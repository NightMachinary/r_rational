*** Alternate Character Interpretations are one thing, but I often find myself /slightly/ worried that our pop-literary canon spends so much time and effort finding ways to cast the [[http://www.youngwizards.com/ErrantryWiki/index.php/Lone_Power][Lone Power]] as heroic and [[http://www.youngwizards.com/ErrantryWiki/index.php/One%2C_the][the One]] as the /real/ bad-guy.

Like, one of these created the universe, and the other decided to muck it up by introducing evil. It should be remembered that Evil is not [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy][a cool leather jacket or a short skirt]], or even [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill][free will]]: Evil is cancer killing your mother tortuously over years. Evil is people having to live flea-bitten and psychotic in train tunnels because there are no care programs.

On the other hand, said pop-literary canon seems to do so because priests need to justify their positions of authority, so Ultimate Good gets cast as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns][/having the right king in charge/]].

(Sorry for ranting: these kinds of thoughts tend to come of reading Iain Banks books and David Brin's blog and sometimes just [[http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/saul.html][the internet at large]] and realizing that, welp, that whole Enlightenment thing we go on about was /really recent/ and /hasn't actually fully won yet/, and still needs defense more than "interesting" subversion.)

**** In Christian mythology, Lucifer is almost never the Lone Power. He was an angel who fell from Heaven after a failed rebellion; his primary sin was that he wanted to become higher than God. Further, Satan is usually subordinate to God and part of God's own +Path to Victory+ divine plan (though that part varies heavily by denomination).

So you can see where the alternate character interpretation comes from. Very few Christians believe that Satan was responsible for bringing death or sin into the world; he's mostly just a guy who really, really hates God and humanity. Those are both pretty sympathetic.

Edit: I am sort of curious how the view of Lucifer in Christianity compares to the view of Lucifer in Judaism, if you have any insight.

This is the big one to me. In almost all cases, Lucifer is inherently understood as *less powerful than God*, and as God is omnipotent, any evil which Lucifer performs is inherently accepted by God simply because despite having the ability to, he has not prevented or reversed it.

Then there's the fact the as God is omniscient, he knew exactly what Lucifer would do when (before?) he created him, and still chose to allow it to happen. So even if Lucifer created evil, God allowed and allows it to happen and so is equally or more complicit.

Hell, under most modern legal systems between parental liability for damages caused by children and vicarious liability of employers from acts of employees, God would be responsible for all of it.

Most sympathetic Devils are either Byronic Anti-Heroes fighting against a much more dangerous evil than themselves, people who have Become the Mask, or guys with the worst PR department in the world. Most of the time they are still assholes, but they are passionate and most importantly /human-seeming/ assholes, usually fighting an alien or apathetic system or being. In almost all of those cases as well, they are not responsible for the creation of evil or death, though they may use it was a weapon or take advantage of it under Pay Evil unto Evil terms.

***** Judaism has no character representing Lucifer or the Lone Power. The "morning star" in Isaiah is a reference to a Babylonian god who was being insulted. "Satan" is taken to be, roughly, its literal translation: "accuser", God's prosecuting attorney. Judaism believes a Source of Evil would contradict monotheism.

**** A thought: Alternate Character Interpretations for $DIETY are often pretty similar to what you'd see from a close-but-not-quite UFAI. Hell: someone decided that their SAI should punish wrongdoing. "Chosen People": someone decided to avoid walking all over everybody by setting to defend their family, followers, or countrymen. Various bigotry: someone decided to hard-code their beliefs.

That said, I agree. Many of the alternate character interpretations for the Lone Power bugged me and I think you hit the nail on the head: there's a trap where they end up being death worship wrapped up in nice words and arguments.

Sorry for nitpicking, but in standard Christian theology that's not what happend. God created Satan. If you think Satan introduced evil, and not the people that do the evil, then Satan isn't responsible either - God is, because God created Satan (and did so while being almighty and omniscient - he knew the consequences and had the possibility to do it better).

There's whole theology branch trying to justify existence of evil, and AFAIK the best argument is "there's no evil as such, evil is just lack of goodness, like shadow is a lack of light, so God didn't created evil - it was always a possibility".

I find this argument wonky (it sugests evil-good scale is like Kelvin scale of temperature - there is ultimately evil act, and everything else is better, and also you can take evil deed, scale it enough times and it becomes good). Also it makes it hard to distinguish evil and neutral actions. Anything suboptimal and better than ultimate evil is similar in kind.

But if you don't accept this argument - the alternative is to accept that God introduced evil, through Satan, which in turn did it through people.

Also regarding the speific example of cancer - Bible says openly God did this when he expulsed people from Eden "you will no longer live forever - you will bear kids in pain and die of sickness".

This (together with the "I'm jealous God", "don't conspire with foreign gods", "the tree of knowledge is dangerous because people could become gods", "tower of babel - I'll destroy that") makes it very easy to read it as totalitarian system propaganda made into mythology.

There's fundmaental tension between God being so obviously more powerful than anything else in his universe that there can be no doubts who wins, and him being so scared of people and other spirits. It just begs for this interpretation.

Well, certainly treating it as /one-dimensional/ is bad, but it's obviously a measure over a many-dimensional space. There are small subspaces that we label "good", and yes, basically everything else is /less good/. And then our brains have separate ways of labelling things that are Bad rather than Lacking Good, and the sections of action/state/history-spaces that are intense in those qualities are labelled Evil.

****** I'm not religious either (but I was, and I strugled quite a lot with these issues when I was 18 or so :) ). Now that I rethink this I kinda start to see the point of that argument. It's the trolley problem. I shouldn't have started this discussion with cashed thoughts from 12 years ago...

Everything below about the evil-good scale is based on my cashed thoughts from the time I was Christian, leaving it here but it kinda makes no sense when you dispose with the sins and punishment:

#+begin_example
   The 1-dimension was irrelevant, what's important is that it has no distinct good and bad states, it's arbitrary.

  I found it very hard to think in that way, and I suspected all people do. It just feels wrong to have no qualitative distinction between "not giving to charity", and "beating up someone".

  The whole concept of sin requires some cut-off point, after which you are OK. With evil-as-shadow there is no such point, you could always do better, so why you can be punished for some things and not for other? If it's a problem with our brains and not the reality - then it's still harsh on humans to create them with faulty morality-meters and then judging by how well they were able to reprogram it.
#+end_example

End of cashed thoughts based rambling.

Still the point that Roman Catholic theology (and many others I suspect) invites "Satan = good guy rebel" interpretation stands.

***** What exactly do you find 'wonky' in the evil as lack of good argument? Basically it seems like because you find the scale hard to read it doesn't make sense. My dog can't read a thermometer but that hardly means that temperature doesn't exist on a continuous scale (sorry not comparing you to a dog, but if some omni-potent/scient being is the one making/reading the scale we would be less than a dog in comparison presumably). Anyway, I might not be able to judge an ultimately evil act against one slightly better, but I know when something shitty is going on just like my dog knows when its hot outside.

I agree that a strict reading of the bible would lead you to a God who purposefully created evil, of course. So if that's your reasoning it makes sense. But people making theodicy arguments almost all believe that the bible stories (especially the early ones) are metaphor, not history.

I'm also not religious but I would believe that it is inevitable that if you create a creature with truly free-will that it will eventually chose to exercise that freedom even if it meant not living in eternal bliss anymore. I think many would rather explore the unknown or not just do what Daddy tells them for all eternity. I am sure after a billion years of orgasming, a bit of pain might be a welcome new experience. Which makes the story of someone saying "Fuck you dad I don't want to live under your roof anymore and damn the consequences" make perfect sense to me.

Uh, no. Duane (author of the series) has explicitly stated she came up with the core worldbuilding concepts after having come across a line in Talmud that she liked, and the books themselves make explicit reference to a character trying to talk to the One by /praying in a church/.

It's a much, much more Manichean theology than IRL religion allows, but if you read the books, you would see that it does more-or-less align itself with the way religion reads things, just... with a lot more good sense than usual.

(For example, many races, when they reach their Choice (eg: they achieve full sapience and become moral/spiritual agents, and thus have to choose whether to act for the Bright Powers or the Lone One), actually attempt to abolish death via some massively overpowered reality-warping spell. /This actually plays right into the Lone One's hands./ One of Its /favorites/ was a species who decided to try to abolish entropy by /stopping time/, and had to be frantically talked out of it by an intervening wizard.

It never says, straightforwardly, "Take my option so you can suffer and die more." It says, "Choose My service and I will give you the power to dominate the world, and whatever you want, you can reach out and take."

This is why it's /very rare/ for a species to Choose rightly by just refusing the Lone One's offers outright, /seeing correctly/ that what's really being offered is /death as a lifestyle/, even though the few instances shown in the books are shown to have achieved nigh-utopian lives that way.)

*** Sort of cheating, but Cradle of Filth's album /Damnation and a Day/ is a reimagining of /Paradise Lost/. The protagonist is Feriluce, and he's joined throughout the story by several allegorical female characters.

One of the curious elements in PL's treatment of Satan is that, at one point, he nearly relents and returns to God, but God reaches down and hardens his heart, causing him to remain an adversary. Similarly, Feriluce realizes his mistake fairly early in the story ("An Enemy Led the Tempest") and eventually wants nothing more than to be left alone to love Faith ("Thank God for the Suffering"), but any joy he finds is constantly taken from him by a vengeful God and a jealous Michael.
