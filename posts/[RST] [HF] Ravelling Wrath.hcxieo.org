** Ravelling Wrath is about a couple of teenagers who participate in a divine ritual transpiring in another world. The rules of the magic are interesting and consistent, but of particular note is that they know that their minds are going to be compromised -- each becoming wound up with a fraction of a deity -- and the best they have available to maintain their agency is mundane mental skills.
