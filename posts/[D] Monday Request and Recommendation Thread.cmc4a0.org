Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** A lot of rational stories tend to be very serious and a bit depressing. What I'm looking for are stories that have semi rational goal oriented protagonists while also being a bit more fun and light hearted.

The best examples of stories that fit this that I've found are:

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/reader][Nemesis]]* - Worm AU where Taylor becomes a comedy cape, not for the LOLs but because its a smart choice in her situation.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/reader][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]* - Harry Potter SI where the protagonist uses her book knowledge to try to help but doesn't immediately overturn the whole world.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/reader][Dragonspawn]]* - My Hero Academia SI where the protagonist doesn't know anything about the world and has the power to turn into a dragon.

*** Just an aside, but I don't really like it when fanfic authors change canon characters' sexuality, as happens in Nemesis. For Worm in particular, Wildbow decided to make Taylor straight specifically because the bullied lesbian high schooler trope is so overused. He didn't need or want that to be part of Taylor's struggles. I feel like trying to drum up sympathy for a character by changing something so fundamental about them, something which actually changing in the real world would be more like a form of soft death for most people, is both somewhat lazy writing and a little disrespectful, both to the author for throwing out a huge part of their character on a whim, and maybe even a little to members of those communities, though I would never try to speak for them.

I can get it in worlds with no apparent gay characters, or with side characters whose sexualities didn't come up in canon. The Wormverse, however, does minority representation well enough that neither of those are reasonable excuses.

Anyway, this is just a personal preference, and I don't think less of anyone for disagreeing. I just find it strange that people do that with characters.

**** I think I fundamentally disagree. I think whats awesome about fanfics is that you /can/ throw out huge parts of characters on a whim. Because while Wildbow might have had a reason for writing the story that way, this isn't Wildbow's story. This is someone else's story, using Wildbow's story as a jumping off point. If you want to write a story where Taylor becomes a kpop star, you can. If you want to write a story where Taylor is a psychopath serial killer, you can. If you want to write Taylor as an asexual trans man, you can.

Now we can talk about specifics and determine if we feel it is lazy pandering or not. I don't know if the author of Nemesis made Taylor a lesbian for some story reason or because they wanted to see more lesbian representation or they just think lesbians are hot. But I don't believe the original work is some sacred text worthy of such respect that we are afraid to change things about the characters because it might be disrespectful.

I guess for me I don't see changing a character's sexuality as any different as changing anything else about them. And for me the fun of fanfics is changing things. If I wanted everything to be the same, I would just read the original work.

- figuring out how to work around superpower limitations
- realizing that making short-term improvements can have deleterious long-term effects
- the value of getting a second opinion

It's also complete. At one point the author toyed with a couple of ideas for a sequel, but ultimately decided that they wouldn't work out.

The author drops you into an angst-fest that while probably justified by the timeline in the story as a whole, needed a build-up for the reader to be on board with it. In Media Res was a poor decision here, and I suspect it will have driven off quite a few prospective readers.

** I really admire and enjoy authors who can write intelligent people talking past each other. Basically where you can tell what each character is thinking, and what they think the other character is thinking, but both (or more) are wrong. Importantly they should be smart and have understandable reasons for this belief. Obviously its much better if this is conveyed through the dialogue and context instead of just telling you what the characters are thinking. It can be used for humor or dramatic effect or just characterization. Does anyone have recommendations which have this type of dialogue / situations?

An example that comes to mind is JacobK's A Young Woman's Political Record which is all about the main character being quite smart and simultaneously really bad at reading people and conveying her intentions. This definitely goes beyond the realm of plausible, but is mainly humorous and character building.

As an aside I find writing this way difficult, my dialogue tends to be too samesy or to the point, perhaps partly because I can't stand poorly done meandering dialogue.

** I've been getting into Apocalyptic Litrpgs lately and I am saddened by the fact that there is rarely any munchkinry. In Apocalyptic Litrpgs the physics of earth gets replaced by an RPG leveling system where people have to get stronger by leveling up in order to survive the spawning monster onslaught. This is a prime environment for munchkinry where people can min/max and abuse the system in place. However, the main reason the MC gets ahead of the curve powerwise is either by extreme luck or a benevolent omnipotent being graces a cheat skill to them at the start.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1729/change-new-world][Change:New World's]] MC dabbles with munchkinry by abusing a goblin spawn point. It is probably the only Apocalyptic Litrpg that munchkins at the start.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35596177-life-in-the-north][Life in the north]] MC makes a good point to his min/maxing mage friend that he can kill him in one punch because he did not put any points in constitution and he should not treat the system as a videogame. (This book is sadly an example where the MC gets extremely lucky kill and is riding off that high throughout the book.)

Its been a long time since i've read it but IIRC in Change the MC was just lucky to be at the goblin spawning point when the change happened so had the chance to do that; the mc acknowledges that tons of people were almost instantly killed cuz high level monsters spawned where they were. Also spawning in a place that allows for quick early leveling is a common trope in lit rpgs; for instance legend of randidly ghosthound, azarnith healer, the new world, everybody loves large chests all have that as well as Change: New World

*** Huh, I've never heard of that subcategorisation for litrpg, “Apocalyptic LitRPG”. So please excuse me if I'm wrong, but if I recall correctly, then /Threadbare/ by Andrew Seiple would fit that description. I think it was discussed during that trilogy how the levelling system was just something that suddenly popped into existence in the not too distant past (within living memory, I think).

I wouldn't describe the story itself as rational, but perhaps rational-adjacent, with the protagonist being the titular teddy bear who was given sentience, and him and important people around him being the respective PoV characters.

The employment of the RPG system to the benefit of the characters is rather shown than explained, though the latter also happens. I particularly remember how a character in a protracted fight for their life kept filling their intentionally left empty job slots with jobs whose requirements they had met in previous years, but declined to learn at that time (like [Herbalist], [Carpenter], and what not in contrast to Classes like [Mage] or [Ranger]), simply to replenish the main attributes connected to that job with that initial level 0 to level 1 level up. That character seriously hobbled their prospective levelling in the future for the short term benefit of fighting that much longer. It was an unusual tactic /and/ an unusual use of what are ostensibly very minor benefits for 'regular players'. It evidenced a lot of thought being put into exploring the ramifications of this new system being put into place.

And for what it's worth, I thought the audiobook narration did improve a bit on the quality of the text, though that may also be attributed to editing between reading the web version and the publication on Amazon.

** So I would like to make three different recommendation requests today.

First are books that play with being in a surreal reality like Alice in Wonderland, Phantom Tollbooth, and Harold and the Purple Crayon. The issue is that the only such books I can find tend to be for children. Are there any such books for adults?

Another request is for any stories about escaping a simulated world like the Matrix. It seems like such stories would be a great fit for this subreddit, but I have barely heard of at.

Last but not least, is a request for anything with a scene where someone realizes that they are not the hero but the villain instead. I'm trying to write about a similar emotional scene, but it's not easy going and I was hoping for inspiration from something similar.

*** For the first one, I would seriously recommend Alicorn's [[http://nyssa.elcenia.com/][Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility]]. It is basically a rational!Phantom Tollbooth, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it's technically for children, I found it very interesting as an adult, and felt the writing style was definitely mature enough that children might have a hard time understanding some concepts. There are certainly enough references to rational concepts that I had a great time with this. This girl can /write/.

  First are books that play with being in a surreal reality like Alice in Wonderland, Phantom Tollbooth, and Harold and the Purple Crayon. The issue is that the only such books I can find tend to be for children. Are there any such books for adults?

You might check out [[https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/magical-realism][popular novels categorized under Magical Realism]]. Word of warning --- to me, they're practically the opposite of rational.

*** Huh, I dropped this because the characters didn't act rational enough for me.

**** Oh yeah, if this was intended for this sub, she totally would have used her skill-trading skills to set up a skill market and simultaneously make all the money and learn all the skills. Or the company that made all those too-human NPCs would have already been taking over the world in other ways.

But I think the characters are well written and realistic - after all, she's playing a videogame to have fun playing the game, not because she wants all the skills.
