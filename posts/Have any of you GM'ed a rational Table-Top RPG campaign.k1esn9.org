The thought came to me and am curious what that would look like. Especially in settings other than DnD's.


** I've DMed a homebrew campaign before. It's a lot of work building the setting, but that part is manageable with extensive prep time. The hard part is improvising the story while keeping things rational. I've found that a lot of the time what is rational isn't always going to be fun for the players, and for personally, I found it more important that my players actually enjoyed themselves.

Another issue with improv is that you don't have the time to consider the greater ramifications of whatever it is that you are creating. For example, you simply don't have the time to consider whether it actually makes sense in the setting for your AI dungeon custodian to accompany the players on their journey in a small and compact chibi form in order to continue to watch over the dungeon relics that the party had looted.

** I haven't GM'd but I have played a few that felt very rational. The feeling came from that the GM had spent a lot of time considering first and second order effects of the setting, and that the actions of my character succeeded or failed based on (the GM's fair interpretation) of their merits rather than on narrative convenience.

*** Yeah, thats how I DM too. tbh not sure if calling it a rational TTRPG is quite apt, as that seems to imply something in particular, but what I do is basically write down some major events to create a narrative around, and give the NPCs involved their own agenda and interests, consider how and why people would be involved (which implies a lot about the economical circumstances of a location) and just set the players loose in that. It works pretty well for my group, but to be fair my players like social challenges like that and don't mind going a session or a few without any combat. It took a bit for them to get used to my style, but they do have taken to it and enjoy the depth of the world around them. *Really* depends on the group though.

** I'm not the GM, but I'm in the process of playing an [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/empiricist/][Empiricist]] [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/natural-philosopher-investigator-archetype/][Natural Philosopher]] in my current Dark Sun campaign (both [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/][Investigator]] archetypes stack). He's an excessively educated man in the middle of a desert apocalypse, which serves as a pretty delightful contrast to the rest of the band of murderhobos I've fallen in with.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/magic-traits/precise-treatment/][Precise Treatment]] + [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/healers-hands-conduit/][Healing Hands (Conduit)]] (and soon [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal/#Heal_Unchained][Signature Skill (Heal)]]) has obsolesced the cleric, show-casing the power of secular healing.

- Empiricist + [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/student-of-philosophy/][Student of Philosophy]] allows most conversations to focus on facts and evidence rather than Charisma.

- Natural Philosopher helps fix the fact that otherwise I'd probably just die in the desert by giving me survival skills and better alchemical crafting abilities. Given it is such a low magic setting and we're mostly going to have to build rather than buy, this has been a godsend.

In terms of the meat and potatoes of combat-focused gameplay, because you still have to survive: He's mostly battlefield control using Combat Reflexes w/ a longspear and cestus, which lets me fumble for extracts and still maintain reach. The cestus will go obsolete as higher rank extracts come online and I spend more time under Alter Self or Monstrous Physique I. Longarm offers good battlefield control, Expeditious Retreat is used mostly to run around and cut off retreat, when combined with reach and combat reflexes.

Plot shenanigans gave me a jumping spider familiar (Novelty!), who chomps an occasional [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/adhesive-spittle][Adhesive Spittle]] infusion to great effect.

There's lots of cheap alchemical toys that help fill in for situational benefits. Powder to find invisible creatures, silver weapon blanch to hit undead, smelling salts to get the brawler up, nepenthe to offer said brawler extra saves when they inevitably get mind controlled, smokesticks when too many things start sneak attacking or shooting arrows at squishier party members.

At 5th level Signature Skill comes online, the brawler gets [[https://aonprd.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Resilient%20Martyr][Resilient Martyr]], and the cleric dips a level into [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/vitalist/#Collective_Healing_Su][Vitalist]] for collective healing, and Healing Hands becomes a couple hundred hp a day, spread over the party wherever we need it to go, and it just keeps scaling. The doctor is in.

There's also something to be said for being the skillmonkey/face, as you get forced to choose the direction of the party for a lot of things.

The campaign itself isn't particularly rational, but the doctor has been very fun to play.

Now I just need to figure out a way to stop all of the sorcerer-kings, fix that whole death thing, and restore Athas.

*** Slight pushback on this: priding oneself on 'secular healing' in a setting with obviously functional magical healing, making a Mother of Learning reference with your familiar and being Int-based instead of Cha- or Wis-based are all not particularly rational - that's just taking surface level features of rationality as it manifests itself in the real world and inserting it into the game world. Which isn't to say that the character isn't rational in other ways (the fact that they're using reach weapons to avoid getting into melee combat, practicing self-sufficiency and environment-appropriate skills, trying to foresee their future needs and acquiring supplies that will satisfy those needs and identifying the magic-induced environmental collapse of their current planet as a serious problem all point to a character for whom reason takes the wheel), or that you're playing the character wrong. It's just that those specific examples aren't really good examples of what a rational character in Dark Sun (or any other D&D setting) would actually do compared to the other things you could have been highlighting.

**** Strongly agreed on all fronts about the mixture of superficial and actually rational elements in play.

Re: my overly glib comment on secular healing: He observed that his ability with the Heal skill was just barely keeping up with the party's needs. It supplemented the cleric, but an hour out of combat to Treat Deadly Wounds? Where do you ever get that much time? At the time it was basically just a good investment of a couple of skill points on a character with all too many for yet another skill check that can't fail due to stacked bonuses. Spending a couple of levels talking to the thri-kreen cleric about the nature of religion, (which in athas focused around elements rather than gods) and after witnessing a rapid series of plot-driven events involving a huge outpouring of energy from the dark sun version of the elemental planes, I was able to justify that he had an idea. Healing Hands is a form of directly channeling positive energy, so it acted as a sort of entry point to trying to figure out how to directly manipulate mana. At the same time it offered a sort of in-game munchkining of diverse systems to keep everyone around me alive at the expense of the usual party structure. Now the others are getting into it: the brawler is getting very good at power-napping, because I heal in combat as if you got a full day's rest. The cleric has been able to focus on being a full-fledged combatant, and is losing a level of spell progression to maximize the ability to spread that healing around, because it'll have way too much overflow healing to make efficient use of the resource. Between it and working on how to manage overlapping field of reach with the rest of the party it pretty much tripled the CR of the encounters we were able to handle. I meant to focus on this aspect, but it was lost a little when I dropped into info-dump 'talk about your character' mode. Splitting off the bit about the actions the others are taking made it feel a bit disconnected.

Mechanically, the familiar exists primarily because she helps with my AC (+2 from Bodyguard before boosts). The choice of spider was basically to maximize dex for the number of uses of Combat Reflexes for taking Bodyguard actions, which is the highest for a stock familiar, and she will act as a hitpoint well at 5th level via Shield Master, covering for my poor starting CON. This is the same level the cleric dips vitalist, so her hitpoints and mine become /mostly/ interchangeable. Both help compensate for potentially fatal weaknesses to the core character build.

As for other things I can be highlighting the game hasn't had long enough for me to accumulate enough exploits. There's also the balancing act unlike when playing a CRPG between munchkining and optimizing for other players' fun at the table, which has left me with building abilities that primarily enhance the rest of the party's effectiveness, while trying to steer our overall course in a way that yields progress towards his goals.

Right now, he is trying to figure out ways arcane magic can be used without defiling, which mostly focuses on trying to figure out what is true past a huge pile of cultural biases. Here is where his efforts have shined through the most: The familiar and a mending cantrip (shockingly useful in a land of bone weapons) are about the extent of his direct dabbling in the arcane, but his initial progress focused on extracts, infusions and alchemy were a more effective experiment. He is exploring what it means to infuse things directly with energy from the planes, which led to his style of healing, and provides a logical progression to the next step on the character's path.

**** The rough part is that Orator is a feat that requires another feat while Student of Philosophy is just a trait. Worse, you also have to take Skill Focus, which eats yet another feat slot just to get 3 non-combat skills, admittedly, through the roof.

By comparison Additional Traits: Student of Philosophy and, say, Bruising Intellect can be taken for the same slot, and the Intimidate will stretch to cover combat uses, leaving you a feat left over, for say Combat Reflexes or Enforcer (so that Bruising Intellect can get used basically every round in a fight if you fight non-lethal), and you can slide those back into base traits to free a feat slot if needed.

I realize you pulled Skill Focus off of Half-Elf, but a Human build would get a bonus feat in its place. Arguably that /could/ juggle things so that your base build was cheaper.

Humans get an alternative racial trait (Focused Study) that lets them take Skill Focus at 1, 8, and 14 in exchange for their starting bonus feat. This basically offers you an eventual rebate of the 'ante' feat you needed to make Orator work half way through the campaign, and in the end game even gives you an extra one. OTOH, the loss of elven immunity hurts with low wisdom. -- I wound up 18/14/10/20/6/6, due to game-specific point buy shenanigans, so I'm even worse off on than you on that front.

(I also didnt have the room to fit anything around Bruising Intellect, so I didn't take it as it doesn't stand on its own well, and I don't have a way to run Improved Unarmed Strikes in the build.)

I'm winding up straight Investigator through 4. Then I'll dip once I have Studied Combat to help rebate the loss of BAB.

At that point I have a few options.

One of the weirdest and most non-standard ones I'm considering would be to dip Wild Effigy Style Shifter for one level adopting a boar minor aspect (for situational Diehard, we get hit HARD by way above CR level fights) and taking Snake Style w/ Form of the Snake. That'll let me basically ignore one attack per round, due to my over the top Sense Motive, and by using alternate shifter claws I can net gore/hoof on top of the claw/claw/bite from Alter Self (Lizardman), brings me to 5 attacks per round before the brawler in the party even gets their second iterative, and if the gore/hoof hit, the opponent is flat-footed for the remainder. Studied Combat applies to all of those attacks, and eventually VMC Magus at 7 will give me Arcane Accuracy /also/ applies to all of those attacks for each use, while letting me boost damage on the spear to +1 +1d6 fire/cold/electric or +2 as needed to get through DR when the fight isn't just a bunch of mooks. Compare with just going straight to 7 Investigator where it isn't until 7th level when Monstrous Physique (Thri-Kreen) will give me 4 claws and a secondary bite, so it mostly just moves up my combat effectiveness by 2 levels.

The natural attacker build is a bit of a trap, though, as Shifter is an /awful/ class, and is hardly worth going 3 levels in to get the ability to claw through DR/magic/silver/cold iron.

This invites possibly retraining at 7 to drop the shifter level at the same time I retrain to bring online VMC Magus. VMC isn't PFS legal, but the GM is willing to let it into the campaign. A +5 to all attacks for a round several times/day and the ability to pop my spear up to a +2 weapon (or +1 +1d6) in such a cash poor campaign is hard to deny, and both class abilities offered by VMC Magus way outclass any 2 feats I could take at 3 and 7. Spellstrike at 11 is harder to justify, but then so is going deeper into Investigator than 3rd level extracts.

If I go deeper on melee combat I'd probably keep the trappy Shifter level. If I have to retrain to go more into magic for campaign reasons I'll probably drop it.

***** 1 extra skill point or hit point per level is equivalent to a weak feat, in the economy of trading one resource for another (toughness and a few other feats related to Favored Class Bonus).

I like your way as well. Reading that character was quite compelling.\\
I chose the Orator route because I'm able to add inspiration to Linguistics without spending an inspiration point.

If you go the Human [Focused Study] route, then you can take SF: Linguistics at level 1 and take SF: Knowledge at 8 to qualify for [[https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Student%20of%20War][Student of War]], which can add INT to armor class, /instead of/ DEX.

Re: your edits. You can get a free style feat without meeting the prerequisites, from either:\\
Monk (Master of Many Styles) nets you two style feats at levels 1 & 2, and lets you use both of them at once.\\
Fighter (Unarmed Fighter) gives you one style feat, but has full Base Attack.\\
Both of these classes also give you Improved Unarmed Strike for free.

****** Taking Natural Philosopher cost me free Lingustics/Spellcraft in favor of free Heal/Survival. Trading magical trap finding for Knowledge (nature) driven crafting/herbalist checks and free inspiration on Survival is probably not something I'd do in a regular campaign, but in Dark Sun it has proven to be pretty key; both are pretty situational to the setting I admit.

I'm legitimately curious, have you been able to use your Orator pumped skills much in practice in your game so far?

MoMS has been a key component in a bunch of my theory-craft builds. The problem for me here is the dip is expensive (it is a bit better if the GM would allow it Unchained, where it doesn't cost BAB). There are annoyingly few ways to add in your natural attacks to a the various cost-effective flurry-/spell combat- like attack options, none of which are sufficiently cheap in my eyes to actually use. And at 4-7 are the highest damage options I know of for a STR investigator run off Alter Self/Monstrous Physique. This is what is leading me towards the weird Shifter dip.

Style Shifter also skips style feat prerequisites just like MoMS and Unarmed Fighter, and gives full BAB like Unarmed Fighter or Unchained Monk while offering better saves than the fighter (an extra +2 to Ref, matching Unchained). In addition it ensures the style feat applies to the two natural attacks granted by the Shifter Claws class feature. This has the nice side-effect that if I take shifter claws from a minor aspect that allows appropriate "alternate shifter claws" they just stack with the other Alter Self (or skinwalker) natural attacks, without demoting everything to secondary attacks like taking a single (improved) unarmed strike or normal attack does, or not getting them at all like in a flurry of blows. (Gore/hoof from Bear or Bull are then the only real options that give two non-claw/bite alternates, with Bull's +2 enhancement bonus wasted in the presence of oft. better enhancements being available later though). The major cost is that shifter claw damage doesn't scale up like a monk's. (You could take Shifter's Edge to make it scale, but the rest of the class is a steaming pile of garbage..)

Wild Effigy stacks with Style Shifter and trades in a bunch of other useless class features (wild empathy and later stuff) for DR 1/adamantine (better than nothing) and a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor, helping a tiny bit with awful light armor AC, and more fully front-loading the class into level 1, priming it for a dip.

One difficult part for me has been seeing how to fit style feats into my action economy. Move actions to study combat are at odds with getting a full-round attack action or taking full-round healing hands actions, so I really need to go with Quick Study to get them to be swift, but now that displaces the swift action to dip into a style, unless I limit my ability to enter a style to the same round in which I take standard actions to quaff an extract. But I also need to worry about losing that swift action to taking an immediate reaction to activate Snake Style. I could go Crane or Kirin Style, which might give a more reliable defense (and let me skip casting Shield in more fights), and avoid the worry of burning an immediate action to get defense. When stacked with Form of the Crane, Crane actually finally becomes good, but I didn't have room to take the traits that would actually fully remove the downside, and Kirin becomes more situational on needing saves and having one big bad in a fight and doesn't stack with a corresponding 'Form of the'. Taking something like a level of MoMS after Style Shifter might work to let me stack, say, Kirin w/ a style that /does/ benefit from the Style Shifter forms, though. Hrmm.

******* Not enough swift actions, ah ha ha, I ran into the same issue. There's a feat that lets you enter a style feat as a free action.\\
Kirin style is terrible.\\
You could spend the first round drinking an extract and studying a target. Let them come to you, trip them with your spear, then drop the spear and savage them.

Style Shifter is cool! The wildcard slots mean MoMS is a good dip.\\
Keep in mind, you have to choose a style that matches your a shifter aspect. With MoMS, you can have a (bad) animal style and a (good) other style.

******** Shapeshifter Style has the problem that it only really applies to one attack in the round. 10' climb is kind of situationally useful, but the natural armor enhancement bonus collides with the wild effigy one.

Charging Stag runs into the problem that I don't have /that/ amazing of a CMB so the add-ons don't help much, and if I'm charging I'm not full action attacking.

Street Style has a huge problem:

#+begin_quote
  You can enter the style stance for street style only while in urban terrain, and the stance ends immediately if you cease to be in urban terrain.

I'm going to be spending a lot of time out in the desert.

Outslug does look quite passable, if I could get Style Shifter and keep going Brawler: +1 AC, +1 to damage with the two shifter claw attacks that'd count as unarmed for the purpose of the feat via style shifter, but I think I'd need to go pretty deep. Taking 2 5' steps off Outslug Sprint would be huge on a very tactical table like the one I play at. When considering I'm most often set up the poor sap stuck running into enemy territory so the Snakebite Striker brawler in the group can flank, I could see a lot of use. Also, if I had enough Charisma to make better use of Dodging Panache via stacking [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/kata-master/][Kata Master]] on Master of Many Styles I could be quite difficult to approach.

Devil's advocate is that one could do much the same repositioning (if only using it for flanking purposes) off Kirin Path as a reaction to them stopping anywhere within reach of the longspear/longarm. With all the natural attacks, I do more damage to whomever is trapped within my reach unable to flee due to the spear.

Heck, Kirin Path + Kata Master's deed's giving Dodging Panache would mean after an opponent inevitably 5' steps in to try to get a full round attack by wading slowly past my spear, dodging panache would let me walk away after they try their first hit as an immediate action. Now, their round ends, but they are still within reach of the longspear, so I can move up to 25' to get behind them to flank or to force others to approach me through the longspear, while it is still their action. Sadly this uses up an immediate for dodging panache and an AoO for the Kirin path, eating into my damaging opportunities and you'd have to focus on that one enemy, so its not good in a mob situation, but it /is/ some fancy footwork. Also, with my Charisma I'd only have 1 point of panache, but with snake style on my gore/hoof/unarmed attacks can count as one handed piercing weapons for recovering panache, so maybe it wouldn't be bad. I hit hard enough to get a lot of killing blows.

Another odd option which I'd never really seriously considered is style-skipping to get to [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/indomitable-mountain-avalanche-combat][Indomitable Mountain Avalanche]]. In a setting with jumpy gith and thri-kreen trying all sorts of acrobatics, it might help me to keep reach w/ longarm and the longspear, but time spent pushing is not time spent killing from an action economy perspective.

I've been trying to think of ways I could justify a more martial build than I'd originally planned.

One thought is to go Wild Effigy Style Shifter at 5, then zag immediately over to (Kata) Master of Many Styles for 6 and 7. That'd give me two more out-of-sequence / out-of-level-range style feats, and a style shifter form. Combined with the bonus feat at 7 it'd open up a bunch of options and make a huge dent in my saving throw deficiencies.

The Kirin Path idea is pretty nice. I'm surprised that it can be used every round. It seems very powerful. I suppose the 12th level requirement means you'll be flying half the time, which makes this much less useful if you don't have a great Fly skill check.

There's a swashbuckler archetype that gives you panache based on your intelligence.

The Lunge reach with Outslug Sprint is nice, because you can start making full attacks from 20 ft away (10-ft step and 10-ft reach). You'll have to drop the polearm at some point in every fight, if you want to make attacks with both claws.

You can make a campaign setting with verisimilitude, and you can reward clever thinking, but if the players /want/ to do the rational thing or don't know how to figure out what the rational thing to do would be, you're not going to be running a rational campaign.

*** he's probably talking about the world that the GM creates behaving in a rational way. in that respect, the rationality of a campaign is solely up to the GM. for example, if a player finds an exploit that gives infinite salt, he can't use it to make infinite gold because either that would crash the price of salt, someone more powerful would come and try to take it away, or this discovery is already in use and the price of salt actually reflects the price of refinement/transportation/taxes or whatever other factor beyond just obtaining the salt itself.

a rational campaign is, to the best of the GM's ability, a living world instead of just a bunch of rooms with mindless monsters that throw themselves at the players with no thought given to why they are there in the first place. the players don't really have to ask why the goblins are in that particular mine, but what makes it rational is that the GM knows why, and if he is a good GM there will probably be some natural reward for the players for finding the answer.

** This is sort of the default way that my group runs things. We will sometimes dip into more campy Exalted type stuff, but for the most part we try to carefully ensure that things that happen in game follow whatever appropriate in-universe rules (with most second order effects thought through, exploits either house-ruled away or NPCs also exploit them, etc). Honestly, even the Exalted stuff generally faithfully follows its own vaguely narrative-driven variant of physics/metaphysics. I think that rational pen and paper games are the natural result of just sitting and thinking through the world that you are creating or running.

On the other hand, pushing things into Rationalist territory, we have found, tends to have mixed results. Rationalist villains can be fun, but need to be kneecapped somewhat or they will murder the party most of the time. If I use an actually capable Rationalist as a villain, they are almost always lower level than the party, physically/magically crippled in some lasting way, or sport other disadvantages that the players don't have. Also, since playing this sort of villain means you are actually trying to be convincing, I have to ensure that his purposes are sufficiently opposed to the players', otherwise they will just switch sides and join up (which is fun once in a while, but not for every game). You can also have two or more Rationalist villains in direct conflict to make sure the player ends up against at least one, but I personally find this tricky to do. I am not good enough to consistently and convincingly run two different Rationalist characters at the same time, especially in encounters where I have to run both in real time.

On the player side of things, Rationalist PCs tend to be either terrible, or at their very best fun for only a little while. The best result my group has was a Rationalist wizard focused on divinations and item crafting. Having a dedicated support caster plus massive information superiority let the other players punch waaaaay above their expected weight class. The DM had to escalate wildly, but ultimately he wasn't able to find something appropriate to stand up to us before we crushed what was supposed to be the primary source of conflict in the campaign. It was neat, but ultimately probably less fun and satisfying than if the campaign had run longer. At the beginning it was fun to be one step ahead, and have the power to make the GM give us extra information, but by the end it just felt like powergaming, but as a support character so it didn't annoy any other players. I guess playing a Rationalist is just powergaming but with the appropriate in-universe explanation for doing so, so I would personally recommend against it.

** I'm running a pretty successful rationalist character in one of my games.

Our party is a group of college students who have been dropped into a high-magic homebrew fantasy world. We are running the game in GURPS, and our GM is running it mostly open sandbox with factions and actors with their own motivations doing their own things. When we did our session 0 and character creation, all the players agreed that we wanted to focus on solving mysteries and exploring themes of culture, technology, and power dynamics more than combat. I got sign off to make a character that would want to poke the world at its seams. (I think my exact request to the GM was something like "Can I make a character who will try to hack the world from the inside?") GM-player collaboration is especially important when playing a game that involves scientifically studying magic. We've had a lot of out-of-character conversations about how magic works beyond the game mechanics and how to close loopholes or explain why our characters would be the first to notice certain exploits.

My character, Gwen Arroway, is an extraverted nerdy former girl scout who was pursuing a CS degree and following all the rationalist blogs and had the career goal of being a science communicator. After adjusting to being isekai'd into a fantasy world, she has made a printing press, has started teaching math classes, made amateur radios, has started work on getting support to upgrade the city's water system, and has nearly gotten the whole party killed by correctly inferring a secret the gods of the world want to keep hidden. Just last session she was leading the party and NPC allies through a goal and planning workshopping session. (We frequently joke that we aren't playing GURPS, we are playing "minutia simulator." But hey, now we have a solid goal that the whole party can agree to.) Her end goal is to make a transhumanist utopia, naturally.

Another character in our party, Ivan, is inspired by the mad scientist archetype. He isn't really rational, but he is an excellent materials engineer. He has made chlorine gas bombs, a rifle, nylon armor, and bicycles. His motivation to uplift the world is purely so that he can have good lab equipment again to better investigate magic. Or he would like to fight and take the place of one of the gods so that he can skip needing to interact with other people. Whichever is easier.

Our third PC is Iris, a pre-med student who wants to eliminate illness and cure the veiltouched (people who have been changed by the Dead God's magic).

Last but not least, the PC who keeps us all in check: Libby, the "ethics committee." Libby is an anthropology student who has to periodically remind the other PCs to listen to the NPCs and to think about the implications before, say, soliciting blood for iron distillation in a world that is conspicuously devoid of iron ore and were "iron" is a strong swear. (I'm talking to you, Ivan)
