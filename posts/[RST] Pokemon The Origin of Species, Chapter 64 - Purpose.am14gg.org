** The whole chapter I was waiting for Red to come out of the shadows, carrying Leaf, looking worse for wear and possibly just passing out. Blue is in for one hell of a surprise when he finds out how nightmarish their experience was compared to his.

I'll admit I fist pumped when I saw it was a Blue chapter! Man, it's been nearly a year since one of those. Lots of respect for him for not pulling a Shounen Protagonist(tm) and breaking rank to Make Something Of Himself. Sometimes the best you can do is just hunker down and help out where you can.

*** Blue may be in for a rude shock when all the dust settles. He /did/ break off from his group without permission or even a word. That was a Mistake. Surge runs his gym in a very martial fashion, so... Yeah. That he was acting heroically and did tremendous amounts of good in the process won't erase the Mistake. Hopefully, it will mitigate the consequences.

/Sigh/ And now, having typed that, I'm debating with myself just how true I believe it to be. After all, HJPEV said that a soldier who can do nothing but follow orders is useless. Vermillion Gym isn't a true military, even if Surge has given it some of the trappings. For Blue Oak to come riding in from over the hills, capture a Snorlax from behind, and take his place at Gramps' side without breaking his stride is the very epitome of Big Damn Heroes. It doesn't matter that Gramps has done (and will probably continue to do) most of the heavy lifting in the fight. What people will notice is that they were losing ground before, and then Blue's arrival turned it around. Even if he loses status within the Gym for his behavior, it'll be nothing compared to the prestige he gains everywhere else for being the hero.

***** Oh, I'm sure he will. Surge isn't a complete idiot, from what we've seen of him. He'll understand completely and still have to make some kind of statement about Blue ditching his squad in the middle of a Tier-3 event. Their stated goal was to spread the word on the evacuation and get everyone moving, and Blue didn't receive any instructions otherwise.

(I should flip back a few chapters and review the Priorities list.)

Now, obviously, you can't evacuate a stadium full of corpses, so stopping the Titanic Trio from murdering all the civilians was necessary. I'm just not sure that Blue will be seen to have made the right decision by acting as he did. Just because everything turns out in the end does NOT mean the thought processes you used to arrive at your decisions was correct. Someone who buys lottery tickets and wins is still an idiot for buying lottery tickets.

** This chapter makes me wonder about the mechanics of Pressure. This is not just blanket fear, or nervousness, or cognitive disturbance. It seems to do something like "Look at all the emotions the target has. Find the one most likely to cause them to make mistakes. Power it up and focus the target's thoughts on it."

I am confused. Who, or what does the selection here? Who defines "mistakes". Something is tailoring the effect to each character. The Birds don't seem the type to be interested enough to do that, so it seems the most likely culprit is that target's brain itself. So is the target's definition of mistake used when the emotion to strengthen is found? Is the algorithm: "Make the target feel whatever feeling they fear the most"?

Let's see.

- Red: Fear of death.
- Leaf: Pokemon Guilt.
- Seto: Self-worth/guilt.
- Karen: Fear of losing.
- Blue: Fear of looking insignificant.

I don't feel it took a lot of effort to make the data match my hypothesis.

The case of Karen is especially interesting, since while the Pressure is very much harmful to her, it's not debilitating the way it is for most others. Blue's case is somewhat similar.

It is not clear to me that the Pressure in the cave exhibited such strong differentiation. Blue notes the effect being less weak this far from Zapdos, so doesn't seem like a mere matter of strength. Maybe the distance at which these features appear was too thin to notice in the smaller bubble?

*** Hmm its not totally inconceivable. I know part of what makes teenagers teenagers is that their hormones turn all feelings and emotions up to 11. So generalist emotion amplifiers aren't that unrealistic. Also, I'm pretty sure that if you start feeling something you're brain will try to come up with reasons to justify it. So like a kid in a dark room or like people living in what they think is a haunted house, it might just project a general negative feeling, amplifies that, and then the brain justifies it somehow. Its weird though because it seems to effect Dark people as well, and this sort of thing seems like a Psychic thing.

** Has anyone in-universe explored the possibility of using psychic types to telekinetically maneuver, lock, and throw pokeballs into place from afar? (or else use their own tk-powers?). It seems pokeballs provide a hard counter to the majority of pokemon without instant-kill auras, and even if they can't fit (e.g. great & heavy balls needed for Shiftry and Onix), don't they still briefly absorb their targets and, upon failure, leave the uncaptured pokemon slightly disoriented? An unceasing barrage of capture-failure could provide valuable opportunity for force concentration, repositioning, or escape, or else even just hide the more expensive ultra balls amid cheaper pokeball decoys. I can see why e.g. mechanical launchers don't work (with the close-proximity lock-on requirement), but any old Kadabra should be able to float some balls near a target, press a button, and send locked-on pokemon-seeking missiles forward a few seconds later?

Non-psychic pokemon might work, too -- humans may be [[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12267][fairly exceptional throwers]], but give a fast, nimble, prehensile pokemon a ball and have it run up and do the delicate, dangerous work of pokemon-capture for you. It doesn't seem like there'd be a risk of it getting sucked in itself, since iirc pokeball technology is just as compatible with humans as it is with pokemon (just with the TBI being more obvious and debilitating for human subjects)?

edit: also, what's the word on [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Weaponry_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world][other technological weaponry]] in this fic? Humans and pokemon have supernatural durability, sure, but they're not literally bulletproof, are they? And if, idk, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#From_caves][Zubat poop]] doesn't work for black powder, could you still harness the rapid expansion of an exploding Voltorb to propel a piece of metal down another metal cylinder at high speeds? Also, the legendary birds are always flying and never land, right? b/c otherwise, couldn't you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_artificial_non-nuclear_explosions][strap a bunch of Electrode together]] and have some tamed Dragonite drop them down from a mile up (with maybe some teleporting psychic types to provide barriers from auto-kill auras and steering until contact)? (even if this doesn't work, I wouldn't mind an interlude/omake chapter detailing its failure, similar to e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver Nine]]'s initial attempts to kill Leviathan)

This is, in fact, Giovanni's foremost plan with Mewtwo :) Human psychics' telekinetic range helps capture pokemon slightly farther away, but not meaningfully so, and it requires a lot of concentration. For pokemon, even very intelligent ones, TK is very hard to train with that kind of finesse.

I've toyed with using mankey or machop as "long range pokeball throwers." It feels like it stretches the bounds of what a trained pokemon can be taught to do, since it requires not just getting within a certain range of an enemy without attacking, but then to hold the ball in a particular way until they hear a sound, then throw the ball at the pokemon. I'll probably include it in some way at some point.

Gotcha -- I guess we haven't seen to many overt displays of telekenesis yet, but I always picture the dexterity needed to maneuver a pokeball to be pretty basic (on par with e.g. eating with a spoon, or folding clothes, or sweeping with a broom -- without causing significant harm to self or others). But maybe here that level of control is less common, and tk-powers are better suited for coarse application of blunt force (I guess [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Psycho_Cut_(move)][psycho cut]] is a move, but only a handful of pokemon can learn it through leveling up -- maybe most psychic power can only apply force over large areas? though then it seems you can just construct a lightweight mechanical shell to transmit that force to the underlying pokeball, or else just use the telekenesis the more stealthily position the ball and leave other functions to radio control? you mention in a later comment that drones have been used but are annoying -- is that because the small blade length means that they're really noisy like IRL drones? cos then maybe telekinesis can substitute for the blades, assuming the relevant abilities are strong enough to support a few lbs of weight (which I feel they'd have to be to allow coarse combat application)).

I think I remember reading in an earlier thread that "smarter" Pokemon are only about as intelligent as chimpanzees, but then I figured most of the other ones to be at about the level of a dog? especially with the automated digital training/brainwashing technologies. I feel like most service animals can carry out multi-part commands, and are limited more by their lack of e.g. grasping ability.

That'd be neat! On a more gruesome note, how is rapid expansion handled here (e.g. during release from a pokeball, or when Wailmer evolves to Wailord)? Specifically, say you encase a pokeball in larger ball with thick steel walls and small internal volume, and then release the pokemon held inside (or trigger its evolution via hormone / rare candy injection, or something). Would the interior's pressure swell to astronomical levels, leading to explosive decompression if the shell is breached? IDK the exact physics/math involved but I can imagine creating quite powerful bombs in this way.

And I feel like that's entirely the point: the Pokemon games exist as sims in TOoS' world, but reality is infinitely more complex, and this is a story about some kids facing these complexities for the first time - all the way up to the Stormbringers, these force-of-nature spectres of death that overshadow the entire story. It's a coming of age story, but it feels so unlike every other coming of age story I've come across.

*** Rainfall does [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rain#In_battle][boost the power of water-type attacks]] lol.

My understanding was that most of the rampaging Pokemon weren't electric types themselves, but rather drawn from the surrounding area, and Vermillion is right next to e.g. Diglett cave, which would have extra local ground/rock Pokemon (there are also lots of Ponyta and Rapidash about, it seems)? Alternatively, maybe being on the water means Vermillion trainers have more opportunity to catch powerful water types? I think this was the story where rock types experienced painful contact dermatitis upon exposure to water, so they'd probably be the worst to choose here.

As for electric types -- gameplay dictates rain to improve the accuracy of those moves, but wasn't this also the story where electric attacks work by intentionally ionizing the path between source and target? Maybe the rain interferes with that? Or would get drawn to all the lightning rods? Or would attract the attention of Zapdos? (in the games it did roost in the Kanto Power Plant).

In Blue's case, it might be the obvious choice just b/c it's his best trained, most powerful Pokemon (again IIRC).

** So just a question, but I was curious if your more realistic, scientific outlook affects your enjoyment of the Pokémon franchise. I mean, does it bother you when playing through one of the games to see how it's a pretty unrealistic fantasy world? Do you enjoy it less because it isn't based in the kind of realistic setting that your story is? or do you simply put away that kind of mind set for the sake of enjoying a game? Genuinely curious.

*** Well, I don't watch the anime anymore, but that stopped long time ago and has more to do with repetitive plots and poor/non-existent character growth. I'm feeling less motivated to keep playing the games, but mostly because their stories are also really bad and the challenge is almost non-existant outside of nuzlockes.

So I don't think it's the unrealism that is the primary problem in my enjoyment of the franchise, and while I would love a more rational pokemon show or game, I mostly just want a well written and mature one at this point :)

**** This seems like an opportunity to plug [[http://www.rebornevo.com/index.php?/pr/download/][Reborn]], a fan-made game with many years of development backing it. It solves a lot of the problems of the original games, most notably the lack of difficulty - it can be quite fiendish, at times, like a pokemon/dark souls crossover. The story is also more than set dressing, much better than in the original games for sure, although that is a bit more of a matter of taste (I like some bits of the writing quite well, others felt more mediocre, but still head and shoulders above the originals).

​

I am currently on a play-through nearing the endgame, and seriously, the game is worth the time for me. It is amazing how much depth there is to the mechanics of pokemon, and a pleasure to actually need to creatively explore those to progress through the game instead of "just level your starter".

​

I have personally run Reborn on PC and Linux (using Wine, but still playable on a very weak machine) and can only recommend it for those here who enjoy complex mechanics and/or feel nostalgia for pokemon, but want to be challenged. The game is made for mature humans, there are some fairly dark moments/themes that get explored through the story and some innuendo in dialogues, but the game does (imo) a fairly good job of treating those things with respect. If anyone would like further information, feel free to drop me a PM :)

****** I have 140h of playtime currently, and am in the content that was added in episode (aka release) 17. The game is released up to episode 18, with afaik one or two more releases until completion. My Pokemon's level cap is at 85 currently, but I don't expect the game to be finished just as one reaches 100. I am avoiding spoilers for the content I haven't reached yet, but I think most pokemon bar legendaries are obtainable at this point, and all of the major overhauls of the game are done, so savegame continuity across episodes should be fairly certain as the releases happen. The development is fairly slow, but there is a /lot/ of content already available, and there is QA and backward compatibility to make sure people can just keep playing as the releases happen. In theory, I could have dug out my old savegames from ep.15 a couple years prior, when I picked the game up again last fall, I just wanted to replay it all since I had forgotten quite a few things.

My position so far is baaasically "no, that's a game conceit."

There are some ideas I've played with in terms of what natural processes are similar to the idea of trading pokemon, like traveling great distances to new climates or feelings of loss, but none of them really work and introduce obvious munchkinry that trivializes them.

**** It's worth noting that originally, the plan was for those pokemon to only evolve with a specific other pokemon being traded. So Machoke and Graveler would cross streams, and that's why Machamp has 4 arms, like a Graveller, and why Golem only has 2 and looks a bit like the Machoke line. Ultimately though, the idea was scrapped for being too complicated.

I dunno if that changes your thoughts on the matter, but I have relevant trivia and damn it I'm going to share it!

Gengar gains a lot of mass, thile Alakazam loses it. Gengar gains 40kg, while Zam loses about 16kg. I know, it's not exactly perfect, but it is something, specially when Haunter is supposed to weigh only 100 grams, and Kadabra is losing almost a third of its mass.

** I don't know if you're still reading the replies to this thread, but I read the following extract and immediately thought of Prof Oak and Elm's confrontation with the university heads on reforming scientific research, and Raikoth. Did you read the same essay (by SlateStarCodex)?

#+begin_quote
  The modern research community knows they aren't producing the best science they could be. There's lots of publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like “I can't believe people are too dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias, turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who do replication experiments. It would be really simple and it would vastly increase scientific progress. I must just be smarter than all existing scientists, since I'm able to think of this and they aren't.”

  And yeah. That would work for the Science God. He could just make a Science Decree that everyone has to use the right statistics, and make another Science Decree that everyone must accord replications higher status.

  But things that work from a god's-eye view don't work from within the system. No individual scientist has an incentive to unilaterally switch to the new statistical technique for her own research, since it would make her research less likely to produce earth-shattering results and since it would just confuse all the other scientists. They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results, since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do so.
