Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A very simple one, because I have a strong feeling it can be utterly broken but can't come up with an idea on spot.

You can shapeshift into anything that exists on Earth, as long as your mass stays the same (down to, say, a milligram) compared to the one you currently possess.

You retain your consciousness and ability to shapeshift, but everything else depends on what exactly you turn yourself into (a brick can't move on its own neither does it have any sensory organs, for example).

You are not required to know the working details of the thing you transform into: if you try to shapeshift into a human, you'd become a random human with precisely the same weight you currently possess. When transforming, you can use only one word in order to describe the result; you can become a "human", but not, say, a "human with the knowledge of a certain password." (Your knowledge stays the same anyway, the change doesn't affect memory and cognitive patterns.)

If you attempt to become a liquid or a gas (or plasma; anything non-solid, basically), you won't transform at all. You don't know what becoming liquid or a gas in during the shapeshift would do to you, but you suspect you'd die.

Only stuff firmly attached to you is counted towards your weight. If you transform into a small tree, and then someone breaks your branch, the weight of the branch is no longer yours.

This ability has a four minutes (passing on the surface of Earth) cooldown.

How would you use this power?

***** ~~If done properly you can gain weight as a human very fast using the keyword "hungry" over and over. Just eat a burger, use hungry to empty your stomach and then rinse and repeat until you have gained the desired mass.

On average random transformations should have your stomach partially full as well, so repeatedly transforming into any large size animal and eating as much as you can in between each transformation should still allow you to gain weight pretty fast.~~

Just read you farther down explicley prohibiting this by saying you need to digest the food first. You could still gain weight fairly fast by just skipping pooping or peeing, but that wouldn't really help you grow that fast.

***** Drinking two litres of water and then transforming into someone naturally two kilos heavier on cool down gets you half a kilo on average per minute per body, assuming that you cycle between bodies weighing 40 to 80 kg that gives a doubling time of 80 minutes. This means that 2 days of uninterrupted chugging water would give you 68 billion bodies, obviously logistical complications would arise before you get that high.

If you are trying to transform into something exact, then no, you would simply not transform. However, if you go for a generic "ant"/"whale"/"human", you would get scaled up/down if your weight doesn't match the target's possible range of weights.

You can bypass aging by body surfing, i.e., transforming into a generic "human" until you find a suitable body. Your idea would work if you measure your weight at that point and then replicate it.

Alternatively colonial organisms like the Pando forest, which is an interconnected colony of like one clonal tree. Trees take in co2, roots take in nutrients, gain mass that way.

As I've answered in another comment, right now I'm actually unsure about this. I suppose that if you choose an exact person as a target, you would need their exact weight. But a generic "human" would just make you a generic random body even if this exact weight is not currently present on Earth. If this is too inconsistent or just seems like a cop-out, I'd think up something else.

*** Instant weight loss method. Just get a friend with a hacksaw.

Instant x, y, z, privilege, where the variables are any of the options that you prefer at the time.

Since it's always tied to the relative "speed" of time at a particular location, there's probably a way to exploit the power for ftl communication and perpetual motion machine based power generation.

Does ingested food count as firmly attached? What if I eat a pound of lead, transform myself into a gold statue, have a friend cut off about a pound of material, and turn myself back to the state I was in without the lead.

Actually hold on, if I transform at all I can't transform back, since another copy of me doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it's better not to use it at all.

Then again, if I transform into Hugh Heffner (before his death) I'll have copied his memories and thus experienced his life up to that point, which is pretty sweet.

You could combine all human knowledge in this way, and come out with some incredible technology. Or just confused about all of life depending on how other peoples' memories affect your perception of the world.

Let's say you are limited to living humans (to avoid confusion whether you'd transform into a corpse/skeleton or a person's original body). But anyway, this requires knowing the precise weight, the same goes you pornstars. I don't think it would be easy to transform into a certain person rather than a generic human/male/female/adult/child.

I'd say that the new rule is that if you choose an exact person/whale/etc as a target, you would need their exact weight. But a generic "human"/"whale" would just make you a generic random body even if this exact weight is not currently present on Earth.

I assume you wouldn't be able to easily break your own power by just inventing your own "language," but there's likely many languages which have single words which would require many more words to convey in English. If you can mix and match which human languages you use, it makes your transformation abilities much more flexible.

It saddens me that this is time zone-based rather than sun location-based. I wanted to go to space and orbit around the Earth such that the sun is always exactly in the middle of the sky all the time, and thus have permanent invincibility.

Then again, since this power is strangely reliant on time zones, can you take over a country and take the concept of daylight savings up to 11 by setting the time to always be 12 noon? Would that make you permanently invincible within the borders of your country?

What happens if you are physically on the boundary between two time zones? Would only the half of you in the timezone currently at 12 noon be invincible? (What happens if there's a border dispute so the borders of a country aren't well-defined?)

#+begin_quote
  You may become invincible whenever you want, but you must spend an equal amount of time feeling like you have a bad flu
#+end_quote

Is there a minimum interval of time between invincibility uses?

If not, toggling your invincibility on for 1 nanosecond every 100 nanoseconds should be pretty much indistinguishable from being permanently invincible, since 99 nanoseconds isn't enough time for most attacks to penetrate your skin before your invincibility toggles on and negates the force of the attack. And 1 nanosecond of a bad flu every 100 nanoseconds shouldn't really affect how you feel significantly, so the side effect is manageable.

You just need to watch out for attacks that can hurt you in those 99 nanoseconds. Which attacks can do so depands on how your invincibility actually works. If you're being burned alive, do your cells just not absorb any heat from the flames? Does the invincibility rapidly disperse or delete any amount of heat above the harmful threshold? Do your cells that die just magically respawn in the same location in perfect health?

I'm thinking of hair. Grow your hair to extreme lengths and when you go invincible, you have an invincible mass of hair that you can use to cover arbitrary objects to make them invincible too.

If hair doesn't count for invincibility (or falls off too easily), what about skin grafts? I think you could mass clone your skin cells fairly easily then graft them back onto yourself, such that you have as much loose skin flopping around as you want.

Now you can make money legally by offering to be the heat shield for spacecraft. No more need for big and heavy heat shields that increase the fuel costs exponentially. Simply bring you on board as an astronaut, and whenever the spacecraft needs to re-enter the atmosphere you cover the front of the spacecraft with your body/hair/skin and turn on your invincibility. Depending on the mechanism behind your invincibility, you could re-enter the atmosphere without heating up at all, and also ensure the rocket behind you doesn't heat up either, yet still slow down to a safe velocity for landing.

--------------

Felicity caught the paper plane before it hit her this time. Aside from a few oddly blacked out suggestions, it was much the same as the last time.

She had four options. Speed and reflexes, useful long-term and well-rounded. Mind control projectiles, hopefully capable of bypassing defenses that would survive the falling rocks---assuming they fell again. Retrying the last wish at a larger scale, with gas-filled boxes around the opponent and a trap-laden fortress to protect herself, doubling down on an idea that so far had worked. A magical decoy, to engage in combat on her behalf, with physical skills in excess of her own, and absorbs targeted wishes.

Mind control had, fairly evidently, the highest potential by some measures, but it seemed the most risky, and if it was even partially ineffective it would leave her undefended, a gamble she didn't want to take. A decoy would also nullify some set of attacks, but if the power of a wish is limited, its complexity would mean she would lose most head-to-head battles, since after the decoy falls she would have no follow-up. The final choice was between landing the kill herself with enhanced speed, exposing herself to danger but allowing her flexibility, and an optimized static arrangement of traps and poisons to take out the target without her direct involvement.

--------------

The moment Arlene teleported into the arena, her heroic golden armour shining in the sunlight, her mythic warrior reflexes had her running for the gap between the slanted steel walls rising from the ground to entrap her. The moment she knew she was too late she changed course, charging at the centre of the wall, to climb her way up to the hole in the roof.

She reached the wall in a leap just as it ceased movement, and her hand, infused with unphysical strength, stabbed a grip into the smooth steel. Barely had she grasped its surface when a hundred rocks plummeted through the opening, cratering the unshadowed square in the middle of the room, other rocks pummelling against the sloped walls and wrenching her grip free.

The moment the rocks stopped, the square, steel roof fell into place, plunging Arlene into darkness. She heard canisters exploding, hearing and feeling a strange gas take hold over the room. Arlene screwed shut her eyes and refused to breathe. If she were in any other body, she would have lost all hope, but she was sure her strength was purely magical in nature, and it took no special effort to engage. However many seconds she had, it would be enough.

Tentatively opening her eyes, and relieved to find them unaffected, she regrabbed her handhold, and like an elite climber launched herself in one motion to the top, stabbing her fingers into the small gap between the walls and the roof. She made a handhold in the motion, but the force threw her free, and she had to leap back to and up the wall to secure herself again. Her chest was pounding for oxygen, but her body showed no trace as she pushed with all her force for the wall and roof to part. Neither gave enough---the walls were thick, and the roof heavy and littered from above with rocks.

The warrior spirit is indomitable, but Arlene's was not. She gasped for breath, and the hallucinogens took her.

--------------

Sorry for people expecting this earlier; most of the weekend wasn't a good time to write it and, to give some more out-of-character information, the other legal wishes would probably have left you dead, so I wanted to make sure the choice was what Felicity would really have gone with.

Felicity has been observing the outside of the room that formed around her opponent from within her trapped fortress. She's noticed loud sounds from within the room, which have died down but not fallen silent, and she's starting to regret wishing for the room to be filled with hallucinogens instead of general anesthesia. She thinks she sees an entrance, but doesn't want to fight barehanded. What does she do?

I'll give fairly free reign for what is in the trapped fortress that she can use, as long as people don't try to push too far. She knows the layout in it and can move around safely. The room filled with hallucinogens is a separate thing, and the rocks that fell with the roof were in addition to the previously fallen rocks, which are to one side.

Note that only time travel that makes my job much harder is banned out-of-character; time travel that's less difficult to write may still be considered. Same for the library wish that got squashed.

I can't formulate a well-supported argument on why we should be winning without knowing what exact powers they have, but I suspect we could be winning with most other options.

I suggest we wait outside the room and let the oxygen in the room out. If that's implausible then at least she would be wasting stamina doing whatever. Then we stab her with a spear when she breaks out.

*** Is there some sort of sound system inside the trapped fortress, so Felicity can speak into a microphone and have her voice appear to come from elsewhere?

**** The original proposal was

#+begin_quote
  a fortress full of traps that can kill or disable the opponent and either poisonous gas or something that can disable the opponent, with herself and the cover at the center
#+end_quote

so speakers seems like a bit of a stretch.

***** That's fair.

...some sort of weapon should be possible, though. Pulling a spear out of a spear trap of similar.

Wait... is the hallucinogenic gas /flammable/ by any chance? There should be a fire trap in here somewhere...

Actually, this point needs clarification. I'll let the gas be flammable, but since it's not designed to be an explosive, this will be in a similar sense to deodorant being flammable. A can of the stuff, yes. The diffuse particulates in the air? Probably not.

Note that the hallucinogenic gas in the room around Arlene is a different thing to the poisonous gas in the traps in Felicity's fortress.

******* If it's flammable, then those diffuse particulates in the air are very likely forming a fuel-air explosive; considering that the gas is pretty much saturating the room.

Drop a lit match in there, and the entire /room/ will go BOOM. The only downside of this is, it will likely flatten the entire fortress and kill the match-tosser into the bargain...

(This is why open flames are not permitted in grain silos).

******** If we look at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammability_limit][lower and upper flammability limits]] for different substances, we see methane is flammable at 5-15% concentrations and ammonia is flammable at 15-28% concentrations. Ammonia is difficult to burn, and methane is easily flammable but far from exceptionally so, but conservative numbers sound more reasonable for a substance not designed to be an explosive.

Since the presumed intended effect of the hallucinogen trap is to cause hallucinogenic effects, the wish would have used a concentration that is not toxic in the short term. Speaking as a total layman, 5% sounds excessive for potent hallucinogens, so I would expect the concentration to be under the lower flammability limit.

********* ...okay, good, then going in there with a flamethrower (or, failing that, a spear which might throw sparks) isn't an immediate death sentence.

...well, not unless the person inside there is really a lot more on-the-ball than I expect.

Alternatively - and this might be the better idea - first get a weapon (just in case), then open the door and yell until I have her attention, then lead her into one of a variety of traps.

** I wonder what kind of crazy stuff could happen if BoTW's Stasis power was Muchkined(is that a word?). I'll say you have to touch a thing to stop time from passing for it(because just seeing something seems a bit too overpowered), but anything done to the object will immediately take effect as soon as the effect wears off in 10 seconds. Also, to prevent weird stuff in space, let's say that it is frozen relative to whatever object has the highest gravitational pull, and all force done to it is relative to the gravitational pull of that object(so it wouldn't just destroy whatever it was on due to gravity).

*** You can essentially focus 10 seconds of work into an instant. If you use a machine to put a lot of energy into it, the acceleration will probably result in something like [[https://whatif.xkcd.com/1/][relativistic baseball]]. Even without a machine to generate force, the effect of everything you can do to it over 10 seconds happening instantly is going to be insane.
