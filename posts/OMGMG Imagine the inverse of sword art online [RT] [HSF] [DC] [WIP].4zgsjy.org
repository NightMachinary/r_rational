** I thought Log Horizon was the inverse of Sword Art Online. Instead of being trapped in a videogame where death is real, they're trapped in a real world where they respawn. Instead of the main character going it alone, the main character is a support class and works with others. Instead of making up how videogames work, you can practically learn how to play an MMORPG from watching it.

**** Did you watch both seasons? The exact nature of the world isn't revealed, but at the very least referring to the Landers as "smart AI" is an insult to certain major characters. The Landers are as much people as the Adventurers.

Or by "smart AI" do you mean sentient?

** Say where was the previous version of OMGMG hosted? I thought it was on MSPA, but the forums are shut down now. Does that mean it's no longer on the Internet?

Also what will be different between the first version and this version?

Looking forward to the story!

*** A lot of things are being handled a bit more carefully.

Characters are introduced more gradually and will each get their own storyline or something else to let them each shine on their own.

Over all plot and protagonistic tendencies are gonna be bit more carefully setup.

Also I had the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oh-my-generic-monster-girls-space-battle-forums-edition.366441/][original mirrored here]].

** This is a pretty early stage for the story, but it is coming. Trust me, I'll be posting this linked again in a few months or so when the full 'chapter/issue' of the comic is finished. But I know I have a few fans here from the last version that might like to follow it as it comes out.

New pages twice a week.

The first idea that comes to mind is video game characters trapped in the real world. Which could be an interesting concept.

That's the second thought I had for inverse of SOA. The first was still "Humans trapped in a video game, but with a good story, sensible characters and well paced plot?"

**** A videogame/mmo is injected into the real world.

Instead of it being heroes it's monsters/mobs. Who are forced to obey software handicaps on some pretty obscenely cutting edge tech built into their bodies that emulate game mechanics.

The monsters/mobs are actually people and/or contain memories of people.

society deals with this in all its varied ways.

**** Could you please start using JPG instead of PNG? The latter one is supposed to be used with [[http://images.sixrevisions.com/2010/12/01-04_jpg_vs_png_gif.jpg][solid colors and clear lines]]. It's good for logos and simple comics with lots of text (like [[http://i.imgur.com/ZvS1lUs.jpg][XKCD]]), but text smudging is not a problem with your size of picture, and PNG makes it [[https://alhomaizidesign.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/jpeg-n-png-123-photo.jpg][obscenely heavy]] at 1+ MB per page.

** I really like the concept. And the initial few comics you made.

You've got a really good idea going here. There is a lot of interesting conflicts and stories that can come up between monsters vs humans.

But I went back and read the old story that this is based on, and I was not impressed.

Please, please, stop masturbating about monster girls, and genderbending, and porn. You've got a cool potential story here. No need to mess it up with the same mistake that every other internet fan fiction writer makes. Which is to needlessly fill it with their fantasies, and slash pairings.

Romance and exploring these concepts can have a place in a story, as long as it is there to SUPPORT the story. But making romance, and fantasy fullfillment the FOCUS of the comic, where it is mentioned every other page..... Please don't mess up your cool story like that.

Edit: Or perhaps I misjudged the old comic. I guess what bothered me the most about it was that it was so extremely slow, and spent a bunch of time on things like the dress-up scene, musical numbers, this wierdo Gecko hug attempts, and NOT on the interesting story. And I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting, for SOMETHING to happen, and because it was so slow, all I saw was a 50 year continuing to masturbate about being a demon girl.

*** The pacing problem was the main one I identified and I'm working on it.

On the other points it's a tricky thing to try and write satire bout a thing without ending up BEING the thing you are trying to deconstruct. That ultimately is why I abandoned the last one, things did not happen with a good pace, characters were handled badly and the focus was all over the place.

Some of that was a result of the format but as the author it also was my fault, hence the re-write.

I'm trying to get two pages out today by the way but got hit with a bit of a wammy of a sickness and it's been throwing my brain off.
