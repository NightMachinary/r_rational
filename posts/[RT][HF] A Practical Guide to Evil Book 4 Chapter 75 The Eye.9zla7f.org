** I've been largely dismissive of the complaints from this subreddit about power creep. But here I think we see the consequence of making average Mighty credible threats to the Winter Queen. For the entire time that Rumania was speaking, I could practically taste the conservation of ninjitsu concentrating down around them. The reveal that they are the oldest being except the dead king has a neat contrast with the Elf she fought in Keter. Even the delay for the hyper-competent team of Longstrider killers works out as a ploy to make it a fight of three equal forces (cat/Rumania/Longstride cabal)

But instead I'm left wondering how 3000 years of collecting Night wasn't enough for this guy to overthrow the entire Dwarven kingdom. If he has had so long to build power, how can he possibly have rivals with the other (younger) sigils. And how can Cat possibly keep up in a fight?

Answer: we're immediately going to see the payoff shards of winter in her soldiers as she finally cuts loose with the winter mantle. This will be a premature burn of a potential growth asset which lets Cat overcome a short term existential threat.

Of course she can't collect an army of mighty. If Callow ever stops being the underdog then Cat's role as avatar of the Callowan redemption arc would end. And the gods really want Cat to win.

*** Technically, they're not a match for the Winter Queen. But Cat holds back because of the alienation, so she's never actually gone full Winter Queen so far. She's able to ramp up gradually what she can do without changing her personality by shunting off the influence, first to Aqua and now to the Peerage, which will probably increase as she conquers the Everdark, allowing her to power up to match the scarier Mighty in the inner ring.

It's also been foreshadowed in this chapter that she can probably channel the Winter influence into drow who are merely sworn to her, instead of full Peers, but that will probably have a nasty backlash.

Putting both of those together, my prediction is that when she actually goes toe-to-toe with Sve Noc, she will have to bring all of Winter to bear in the fight, and her Peerage won't be enough - she'll have to use the other drow. The backlash will end up de-powering her and the drow enough that they won't be absolutely gamebreaking when they get back to the surface, as they would be in their current form.

Specifically her world lacks a concept of Gods-Of-Balance. Considering her Mantle is neutral and she thinks both sides are a pack of dicks, I see no reason why Cat couldnt grab a few minor godlings and form her own faction. A faction dedicated to flipping the bird at Above and Below on behalf of mortals.

If she did so, I don't think either side could act against her directly because she wouldn't be standing for either side. It would mean every act against her would give the opposing side a chance to make a power move. Even heroes wouldnt be able to act with a story on their side, since there is nothing heroic in attacking those standing up for free will.

No, they're not. A small but vocal minority of Levantine leaders are arguing for outright genocide. The rest of the Crusaders want to partition the Empire into puppet states. And honestly, given how often Praes goes insane and commits acts of mass slaughter, can you blame them?

The nasty things the Good side in this story have done don't even come close to the horrific deeds committed by the Calamities and the Woe.

What the Pilgrim did was horrible, but let's not pretend he didn't save far more innocent lives than he took by stopping Black. Black is likeable and very cool, but even his closest friends admit he's a complete madman who has orchestrated the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents.

No, Good and Evil are not just different religions. Evil literally glorifies murder and betrayal, and even the most rational and reasonable villains in the history of Evil conquered a neighbouring Kingdom and practiced suppression and institutionalised murder.

Good on the other hand preaches justice, honour and mercy. Yes, they don't always live up to that and some of their leaders and heroes are take ruthless actions. But you can't argue that Cat is justified in taking extreme measures for the sake of her goals and then condemn the Pilgrim for doing the same thing for what is frankly a far more clear cut greater good.

Oh, and according to Erratic Errata Good and Evil really do more or less correspond to good and evil respectively.

There's absolutely no evidence for that. Warlock believes that the Gods are Creation itself and they can't intervene directly in events, which is why they created the Choirs and the Hells, to act as their agents, but only indirectly, encouraging their interests in individual stories.

Either way, the Gods definitely aren't the narrative. Creation is basically an experiment to see how mortals behave. The narrative is the cumulative result of thousands of years of mortals making choices, shaping the stories and adding weight to the arguments of either Above or Below.

************* Creation isn't the narrative. Creation predates the narrative. The narrative changes depending on the culture that the Names involved come from. The Gods don't decide the narrative, it's determined by the stories that create Roles. Again, we learned all of this in Book 1.

'We know this wager as Fate, and thus Creation came to know war. Through the passing of the years grooves appeared in the workings of Fate, patterns repeated until they came into existence easier than not, and those grooves came to be called Roles. The Gods gifted these Roles with Names, and with those came power.'

- Book 1: Prologue.

“The stories have been around since the dawn of Creation, meaning there's an endless variety of ways they can go. A pivot is a point in time or a decision where the Named pushes her story in a particular direction. It influences the kind of powers you develop.”

- Chapter 19: Pivot.

'Roles are usually a reflection of the people they spring from'

- Chapter 15: Company.

Creation is more than just the story. Arcadia is the one bound purely to narrative, in Creation there are other rules, like physics, as well. The stories change depending on where you are in Creation, because they are a reflection of the mortals who tell them. The laws of physics remain constant, because Creational laws were imposed directly by the Gods.

She used their deaths in exactly the same way she condemned Praesi for practising human sacrifice: she used their lives for her own benefit.

Or her strategy at the Battle of Dead Dawn, which she herself admitted removed any delusions about being a good person.

Or her current campaign, where she's using the threat of death to force entire cities into slavery. Again, the drow are already an absolute abomination of a culture, but that doesn't make it any better.

Her other close friends: a madman detached from reality whose only objection to human sacrifice is its inefficiency, a narcissist interested ony in finding good fights and strong alcohol and a thief obsessed with revenge against her people's enemies.

******** I'll give you the "choking a smuggler" one (I don't remember exactly what is was, but I don't think killing her was super necessary), but otherwise, nope, that's a stretched interpretation.

The fact is, Catherine has shown on average to be extremely restrained and mindful of civilian lives. She has a professional army, unless Proceran nobles who throw conscripted, untrained peasants into meat grinders.

Executing hundreds of mages, and making a display of their corpse? That's really not extreme by medieval standards. William did the exact same thing on a lesser scale, for the exact same reasons. Sacrificing part of her army for a tactical advantage? That's war, and not doing it is insane and leads to losing the troops you want to preserve and the country you're trying to defend; Cordelia certainly isn't above doing that; see also her plan for trapping Black's army in a city full of burning civilians.

Seriously, I can believe that there are ideological differences between Good and Evil that go beyond the aesthetic, but saying that Catherine is a bad person is ridiculous. She did everything she could to minimize the loss of life when confronted with external pressures by murderous schemers, and there's little she could have done to preserve more lives except "murder the bad people sooner".

You do remember how she planned to unleash the Dead King on the world, right? And yes, she planned to restrict him to territorial boundaries and warn Cordelia to evacuate. It still would have killed tens of thousands of civilians, and really, she only had guesswork and hopes that the Dead King could be restrained at all. She was willing to unleash an ancient undead monster on the world, with completely unknowable consequences for the entire continent.

William 'brainwashing for the greater good' Greenbury isn't a good moral standard to judge things by. Crucifying hundreds of people is horrific no matter what way you slice it.

You also didn't address the fact that she's currently enslaving an entire nation to use as canon fodder in a war that has nothing to do with them. It's better than extinction admittedly but it's still an evil thing to do.

And again, there's also the people she surrounds herself with and enables. Robber and his goblins, while hilarious, literally think murder and theft are great. Nauk and his orcs, who Catherine has given permission to eat the corpses of her enemies to make a point. Oh, and don't forget the Butcher of Liesse. She's planning on killing Akua the moment she stops being useful, I know. She's still risking the survival of a mass murdering maniac in order to gain an advantage.

Oh, and one I forgot earlier was that general of Akua's whose soul she ordered removed out. Again, to make a point. And that guy wasn't a mage, so he wasn't directly involved in summoning the devils. He just happened to be on the wrong side and got his soul ripped out for it. Truly the act of a hero.

I'm not saying Catherine is all bad. She has plenty of redeeming qualities and many of her decisions are understandable. She's by far the nicest, most reasonable villain we've seen in the story. But there's a reason it's called 'A Practical Guide to Evil'.

This seems to imply that Cat has some sort of restrictions to what she can do with her Drow. I really, really want to know what the hell this refers to.

None of the oaths we've seen suggest anything about Drow rights - one of the oaths is essentially "do anything and everything Cat says to do, exactly the way she wants you to do it, or immediately die". This does not indicate limitations on what Cat can do with her slave army. There's (seemingly) nothing stopping her from just ordering them to accept the alienation.

I mean, hell, this chapter alone has Cat sacrificing her troops for the sake of tactical expediency. This "bargain" really does not leave Cat with any responsibilities or restrictions, outside of whatever this one is.

  I'm still not sure why raiding parties aren't more of a thing. Sacrificing as many Ratlings as a group of Mighty can get their hands on seems like it would certainly help pay back their debt.

The opening quote partially addresses this:

I think it's a little bit of the above and a little bit of the risk associated with losing Night. Less Night would mean fewer drow, which means the altar for the Below is smaller for potentially hundreds of years. I agree with your point though. If they had weaker neighbors raiding would become a cultural standard.

Quality is great and all, but quantity is attractive on its own merit, most especially when it helps to raise your species out of literal damnation.

I would argue that dragging in hundreds of thousands of, say, Ratlings would /expand/ the alter.

Yeah, there's a risk of losing Drow, but they only need to win more often than they lose to come out ahead. And this shouldn't be too hard: Cat talked about what a single, "second-stringer" Mighty would do to Procer/Callow, and subterranean routes to both countries exist.

One of their neighbours is the Chain of Hunger, and frankly the Drow should be fine against them: Procer's has held the off for millennia without relying on Named for the heavy lifting.

Sure, there would might be issues against the Horned Lords and such, and Cat has already said the the Skein would outmatcach Urulan.... but again, Procer's done okay for a few thousand years (with heiress, yes, but Cat's already compared Drow favourably to heroes) and more to the point, you have the Longstride cabal. A group of Drow that not only would totally be able to handle the Skein or an equivalent, but already has the motive to do it.

And again, subterranean routes are a thing.

** So all of the Night is a sacrificial ritual to put off paying back a debt long in default. The Priestesses of Night are holding the entire Drow race together. Once Cat defeats them, that probably ends, and the rest of the debt comes due.

Cat is coming out of this mess with only what she bargained out of the Nerezim. Without Night, every Drow will wither and die. That was the knowledge the dwarves withheld while bargaining.
