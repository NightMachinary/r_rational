You've found a time machine. It can't go forward in time, only backward, but you can return to your departure date once you're done in the past. A constraint of the time machine is that, upon arrival, you have 24 hours to find your past self and convince them of the fact that you are THEM from the future. If you can't, then you fade from existence.

How would you convince yourself of the truth? Do you think you could? Also for the sake of the argument, the "judge" of this isn't a machine that can be gamed, it's an intelligence that can't be lied to. (So no convincing your past self to "play along" if they're disbelieving)

EDIT: Let's say you have to leave right now, as you are. So no researching a meticulous list of future events and rattling them off (unless you're lucky enough to have an eidetic memory, so have said list prepared already in your head)

Now, an all-up telepath who can write to your mind as well as read it...then you're just screwed. You can't trust reality at all, they know your every plan and trick...I don't think that's a winnable fight.

Those might be small things -- "tomorrow, Sally is going to ask you to prom" or "Thursday, 12:08pm, Billy will fall off his bike and skin his left knee" -- but they can still be verified.

Once you've verified them and both of yourselves are working together, there are plenty of ways to take advantage.

******** The best bet would probably be to look up old transcripts of CNN broadcasts and memorize them, then quote them back a few minutes ahead of it showing on television. That would still be /really/ easy to fake compared to creating a physical duplicate of a person or reading their mind, but it seems like it would be your best bet if you want a demonstration of predictive power.

If someone told me "they're going to crash a plane into the Twin Towers" and then I saw it happen the next morning, my first thought wouldn't be that they were a time traveler, it would be that they were somehow involved in the plot.

So you need statistically unlikely predictions about the future that the supposed time traveler couldn't have foreknowledge of, and couldn't fake, which is a pretty tall order.

*** I have had a password system since high school (about 7 years ago). I think it was a TvTropes page that inspired me. I have multiple passwords and I have planned how many of them I will give to other people if I need to let myself know to trust them. Thus I could also use them if other people are traveling back in time, or in the event of a memory gambit. I also remembered the events that made me think of each password, so if I travel to an alternate reality I can guess at how likely it is for me to have the same password.

Let me put it another way: there are people in this world who are not me that I would trust and do things that actually /are/ in my worst interests. My wife is one. I'd trust my future self more than even my wife because my future self is evaluating things exactly as I will given the same experiences. If he says some things are not worth giving up no matter the opportunity cost, I would always have trusted him.

The second conflict you post is more interesting. I think I would have taken those memories and motivations along with a decade plus of experience, but I'm not certain about that. I am certain that with time I could convince him to but I'm not sure that's in your hypothetical. Also the memories are of a past that may not have existed - you could still largely bring it about. Depending on the date in at least my personal timeline it would take very little for me to have the same general outline of a life.

I think you can ask that about yourself now - would you want the memories and experience of your next 20 years dumped into your head right now? I'd take it for certain. There are a lot of things that would be very comforting to know. That neither my wife nor I get a debilitating degenerative disease in the next 20 years? That would be nice to know!

Consider that seriously, because this sort of thing forms the crux of my objection: isn't your /particular/ daugther a big deal to you? I can pretty much guarantee you won't get the same daughter. Of course, there is nothing optimal about your daughter - she was a genetic dice roll and there is no reason you won't get a better or worse one next time. Yet, would you really erase the currant instance and roll again for a new child?

I guess there are certain things that have happened in my past that are not the best way that things could turn out..but even so, it's my life. It's not the best possible life i could have lived, but it is /mine/, you know? The hypothetical me who didn't make those decisions is probably better off than the current me, but that person /isn't actually me/ and to reverse those decisions would be a death of sorts. I wouldn't want to vanish in that way.

But past-me has the potentiality to become either of those people. Past me does not have any particular affection for any /particular/ instance of future me. Imagine there were /two/ future me's who had gone to different colleges or something, and both wanted to steer past me's towards /their/ respective wives and lives. There is a particular affection that I have for my /particular/ life and wife which has nothing to do with whether or not it and she were optimal and past-me does not necessarily share those particular affections. (In simpler terms, when you really love someone, you no longer /care/ if better opportunities without them are out there)

Of course I would be in a better position than past me to /know/ what is best, but if past-me wants the best possible future and I want /my particular life back/, then we have a conflict of interests.

Are you are /really/ confident that your current life, family, everything... is optimal or even above average relative to how it might turn out for a person who knew all that you know now? And yet...even if you were knowing that it's not, I doubt you'd give up what you have. in exchange...not because what you have is better than the other life, but because what you have is inextricably yours now, even if you wouldn't advice a younger version to walk the same path.

#+begin_quote
  I think you can ask that about yourself now - would you want the memories and experience of your next 20 years dumped into your head right now?
#+end_quote

I want to point out that you aren't /just/ getting 20 years of experience. You are /becoming a different person/. I assume you get future you's /motives/ along with your experiences.

The /other/ half of this equation is "would you erase the past 20 years and wake up in your younger body, and you now must do things in a /very/ similar way to last time if you ever want to go to anything resembling the home you left behind". Because /that/ what the /other/ half of the person you have become in the moment of the dump is experiencing right now. (Keep in mind, not all moments can be recreated. If winning a basketball game, or rolling a dice, or a specific innocent facial expression you made altered the course of your life, there is no guarantee it will happen the second time around, especially if you make any intentional changes to the timeline. And yeah, there is /no way/ you are getting the exact same daughter, you cannot control egg and sperm to that extent).

However, if you're just asking if present-me would like foreknowledge of everything, while somehow eliminating the complications described above, then hell yeah, who doesn't want free knowledge? (One way to accomplish this is to be able to talk to future selves, and the future selves just go back to their future lives after talking to me, with no vested interest in the matter aside from generally wishing their alternate selves well.)

********** I've spent a lot of time thinking about personal identity and the philosophy of space and time. I think our views differ in slight ways that are relevant to this particular hypothetical. I'll try to keep it brief for you but:

(1) I believe that what makes me "me" is the full set* of decision making heuristics that I would follow for any actual or potential decision.

and

(2) Any physical being that shares a direct temporal link to me is also me.**

So I disagree with "The hypothetical me who didn't make those decisions is probably better off than the current me, but *that person isn't actually me*" Instead I'd say that if I had different knowledge in my past I would have made different decisions, but those decisions would still have been made by me. It's my heuristics even if it's working on a different set of data. If I had been given foreknowledge of my entire life (as it actually in fact worked out) the resulting person would still, in fact, be me.

This also means that yes, if I traveled back in time and told my younger self something that I in fact never experienced and it was significant enough to shake up my younger self's decision making process, the younger version of me /is no longer me/ by the end of the conversation. So I could agree there might be a death of sorts but it would be because I'm breaking the temporal chain between my past and current self and causing a significant change in mental evaluations. The paradoxes here are more time travel than personal identity I think.

Anytime you live your life though and have any significant events you are becoming a different person. In fact, I'd say that any time you have a significant life event and, through self reflection, change your own heuristics for the future, it is the /most free decision you can ever make/. This isn't a detriment it's a benefit of the human condition - we are capable of self-improvement through self-reflection as bayesian decision makers.

Would I want to update my current heuristics with 20 years of additional data at no cost to myself? Of course. The updating is still mine.

*This set is obviously not knowable in full (and honestly might be a class rather than a set, but that's splitting hairs).

** Without this clause or something doing very similar work you have a lot of problems with ethics and punishment.

*********** I feel contradiction in believing that any being who is temporally linked to you is still "You", and yet any major life events makes "you" a different person. Isn't it better to say that there's a spectrum in which beings are closer and farther to "you", and the farther you go the more potential for conflict of interest?

Decision heuristics are one thing, but fundamental changes in preferences are another.

Coming back down from the philosophy level to the object level, practically speaking, what about the daughter thing? Don't you have preference for being with your /particular/ daughter?

Provisionally assuming the answer is "yes", suppose You, IHaveNoTact*B*, exist in future B. There exists an IHaveNoTact*A* in future A. Both of you prefer the company of your respective daughters, because you love them and don't want to swap places.

Now, suppose your past self saw Future A and Future B. Future A seems way more appealing from your past self's perspective. Your past self doesn't care about the differences between Daughter A vs Daughter B - both are wonderful daughters, but Future A also involves being a millionaire, Daughter A having a nicer life, etc, whereas Future B is a struggle to make ends meet.

Now here you are, IHaveNoTact*B* from the future. You have the knowledge that allows your past self to pick Future A or Future B

...Now, let's separate this into Scenario 1,2.

In Scenario 1, you go back to your own Future B, with Daughter b, and live happily in the knowledge that your past self is happily whatever Future they chose. In this case, you'd tell your past self everything you know, and your past self would rationally choose A, and that's cool with you.

In Scenario 2, you travel back in time. Now, you obviously try your hardest to get back to whnFuture B, with your own wife and daughter, but maybe make a few minor changes. Your optimal future now is decidedly /different/ from what PastIHaveNoTact's optimal future would have been.

This is what I mean by "conflict of interest". (There isn't an /actual/ conflict in either of these scenarios - it's just a demonstration of how you and a past self cn have fundamentally divergent preferences about how the future turns out, and that it would be possible to construct hypothetical scenario 3 where both IHaveNoTact*B* /and/ PastIHaveNoTact have to deal with identical consequences for PastIHaveNoTact's actions, informed by IHaveNoTact*B*'s advice , creating a conflict of interest between them. This is the scenario I thought we were in.

You wouldn't take a 5% chance of death for a 95% chance of becoming the richest person on Earth (which presumably can be used to further your expected lifespan)?

** The easy way to test this is with lottery tickets or wide page stock return data. It's not just a good validation means but also a nice resource acquisition methodology.

Also, it depends on when I go back to...

** It shouldn't be hard. I know so much personal info that no one else knows.

Or I could just go back to a date where somethng notable happened and predict it, or do any date with news headlines. The problem is that 24 hours is not a lot of time for predictions; it has to be something you couldn't know otherwise. Stock prices should do nicely.

Or do all of the above.

*** The challenge then is breaking the barrier of disbelief. For stock prices, your past self might explain that away as a form of insider trading? I suppose it depends on how skeptical your past self is.

**** If someone came to me now and gave me tomorrow's stock closing prices for 1000 stocks to the exact penny, there are two options: the market is rigged, or this person has some supernatural ability. I would say the time travel hypothesis is still slightly less likely, but combined with knowing personal info about me that no one should know, and future news headlines, it should convince me.

** In response to the edit: if I thought this scenario was at all likely, I would start memorizing proofs and stuff, but as I don't, no luck.

So I still think I could convince myself just using my own secrets. You could choose the date, right?

If it was recently, I would use my passwords, plus the motivations behind them. I've got at least some passphrases not stored anywhere and just used for encryption, so someone knowing those is strong evidence.

*** Yes, you can choose the date freely, although your location is static. So you'd have to ship your time machine where you needed it, if you've moved across the world or something similar.

** I actually attach pretty high probability to time travel being possible; it's predicted by GR, after all, and the most common objection seems to be "but that would confuse the way I think about causality!" Well, so does all the other implications of relativity.

But, um, I don't have a password set up. Embarassing. I mean, I'd rather not precommit to helong any sod who reads my mind of tortures a clone of me or whatever, but still, it's unfortunate.

Anyway, I'm actually really easy to convince, and I'd probably look pretty similar. I have a bunch of things I haven't told anyone, but those aren't /conclusive/, especially if timetravel is on the playing bard.

Honestly, I think a good conversation would be enough for me to notice we had the exact same personality (I'm pretty weird): an having done that, I'd be an incredibly easy sell on the timetravel thing. Although I probably wouldn't mention the "fade from existence" bit until later, that's fairly specific and strange enough that it seems like a weird manipulation ploy or something. I trust myself.
