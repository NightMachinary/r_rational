** Last Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: last-week
   :END:
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f39xs/weekly_challenge_the_chessmaster/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "The Chessmaster". [[/u/Kishoto]] is the winner with his story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f39xs/weekly_challenge_the_chessmaster/ctlc8kg]["Requests"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/Kishoto]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's prompt is "Clones, Clones, and Clones!". Whether through literal cloning, time travel shenanigans, or multiplication superpowers, one person (or multiple people) ends up with multiple copies running around - perhaps with divergent goals. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 12th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]], and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week's prompt is slightly different from the usual; instead of a trope or genre, we'll be doing a specific canon of work. The theme is "Disney Movies". Pick you favorite Disney movie and write the rational version of it! (Depending on the response, we might have more of these in the future; if you have a canon you really think would work well for a challenge, add it to the list.)

*Next week's thread will go up on 8/12.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

****** The story only shows James-derived spurs; I imply that James-derived spurs were only used for short-lived spurs (<1 month), whereas longer-lived spurs were spawned from copies of him.

(I cut out a section about the Allfather's cadre of economists, always in fasttime, experiencing decades a week. The live for a few decades, then teach the younger spurs as they are replaced. Those would be All-father spurs, as the longer life gives them too high of a chance of discovering the secret, given the amount of information they deal with.)

***** Hm, I'm not satisfied with this answer. Something as simple as "The Allfather is an impostor" doesn't need anything else to be understood. On top of that, the rogue ended up giving the MC the information in a really roundabout way that is far harder to be interpreted correctly.

You're also talking about "memetic subversion" here as if it's some abstract science fiction stuff when in your story the memetic hazard was something really straightforward and easy to understand. Everyday logic should apply.

Though I'm a bit iffy on the zombies; didn't add too much (the Buffets are nice), and symptoms of aggression seems a bit contrived.

Although why aren't the Buffetts zombies all zombies? (if they're using N2s five times a week, wouldn't they all have progressed Mover's Sickness?)

**** Yes! Thank you! That's what I was going for.

On the surface, you just have Square, Sam and Noah explaining New-C's new lot in life, with a little hint of danger at the end.

But if you look deeper, it's the start of a fairly complex narrative, even if you ignore the changes up above.

Pangea. Why do they call it that? It's an iconic, historic name, what does that imply? You have the threat of the Ragged, wild infected that vary in sanity and biology (although, just to be clear, it wouldn't get as crazy as Resident Evil's advanced zombies, but there'd definitely be some superhuman strength depending on the type)

Then you have the clones. It's made clear that there are bunches of rich people down here and they tend to form communities. Who better to get along with than yourself(ves), for those who are able to do it. But that comes with its own problems, depending on how unhinged/selfish/narcissistic the originals are. And it also depends on what kind of day they were having when they stepped through the N2. Also, what does that imply for the middle class and poorer clones?

And lastly, the Naturals. They're brought up exactly once. But they're the people that come down the normal way. By dying. What does that imply about who's actually down here? Are people immortal here? Could you go find Alexander the Great, Hannibal or Jesus down here, if you really wanted? ;)

I tried to cram a lot of things into the background, to really make it clear how deep the implications of the N2 and the soul's existence is in this world.
