** When /Seeking Power/ stopped updating in 2014, many though it was dead. Turns out, such was not the case. Forthwith has rewritten the fanfic and has updated it with 3 new chapters!

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/909012/seeking-power-revision-notes][Here]] are the revision notes, [[http://forthwithfic.com/ow/sp/sp_index.php][here]] is the original version of /Seeking Power/ for anybody who wants to read it, and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/175016/across-the-boundary][here]] is the side story collection /Across the Boundary/.

For those of you who have read [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][/The Moon's Apprentice/]], this fic is by the same guy, so you have an idea of what to expect, (though this fanfic's Twilight is less of a social manipulator and more of a massive autist). For those who haven't, I think the chapter one scene where Twilight splits her mind into different personalities to solve a problem should set the tone nicely. For context, Twilight has just learned that Luna is coming back from her thousand-year banishment in in two months and that Celestia has no way to stop her.

  “Uh-huh. Anyway, will you give me a few minutes to absorb everything so far?”

  Getting a nod from Celestia, Twilight turned inward and divided her thoughts into the usual three strains to debate the matter before her: Advocate to suggest ideas, Opposition to tear them apart, and Overseer to keep order.

  /So,/ Overseer began, /Celestia has had a thousand years to come up with solutions. Any new ones we generate either have to hinge on relatively recent information she wouldn't have had time to dwell upon or depend on things we know or can do but not her. I leave the floor to you two./

  /First, let's identify the worst case scenario,/ said Opposition.

  /Everypony dies./

  /Yes, that's real creative, Advocate. Now elaborate on that./

  /Okay. Luna breaks free. Banishes or kills Celestia. Kills us. Subjects the world to eternal night. Freezes it./ And then /everypony dies. Obviously we have to intervene before the ‘kills us' portion of that./

  /What options do we have available?/

  /The Elements of Harmony./

  /We're looking for alternative solutions here. If you're not going to offer meaningful solutions we'll replace you with a different personality./

  Overseer stepped in. /No personal attacks, Opposition. We're all the same pony here./

  /My point still stands./

  /Well.../ Advocate paused for a moment, hesitant to even put her idea up for debate. In the end, she decided that all paths to victory were worth at least some consideration. /We could always throw away our life's ambition and use its power source to banish Luna ourselves./

  Opposition immediately rallied the full force of Twilight's unfettered enmity against the mere notion. /I fundamentally object to that unless we are, or are about to be, dead. Please come up with something we won't regret until the end of a short, miserable life./

  /While I agree with the sentiment,/ Advocate began, /couldn't we just redevelop the power source? Solidified magic can be manufactured./

  /Not at the rate we would need. If we lived to three hundred and shifted the/ entire /economy of Equestria over to producing solidified magic, we/ might /have enough to get by with two alicorns helping and whatever boost the elements provide. Needless to say, that's a ridiculously bad plan./

  /All right, point taken. The next option is we take out Luna ourselves./

  /Celestia is our senior in combat by centuries and far more powerful. If she can't do it, what hope do we have?/

  /Ah, but we have one big advantage,/ Advocate said smugly. /We're not her sister. If we earned Luna's trust, we could catch her by surprise./

  Opposition rolled her nonexistent eyes. /Do you realize how hard that would be to catch her at the level of vulnerability we'd need? We'd have to--/

  The details of what exactly that would require filtered through Twilight's mind.

  /Absolutely not!/ Opposition slammed her imaginary hooves onto an equally imaginary desk. /We/ will not /marry, seduce, or otherwise engage in intimate relations with the mad moon goddess./

  /It was only an idea,/ Advocate mumbled.

  /The single worst idea I've ever heard you suggest! Why would you even--/

  Overseer banged a gavel and called the other two to attention. /I'm ending this tangent here. Advocate, there's a reason we outsource lipstick missions. Opposition, be nice./

  With an exaggerated harrumph, Opposition nodded and turned the conversation back over to Advocate with a simple, /What else do you have?/

  /Well, there's always Celestia's plan. Let Luna take over. Support her reign. Minimize the damage. Celestia considers it a viable option, and she doesn't even know we can pose a credible threat to an alicorn. If Luna can be at all reasoned with, we can keep her in check with the threat of banishment./

  /That's not optimal, but it's a decent fallback option. Other ideas?/

  /I'm dry. Excepting getting the Elements working. We could try being...friendly./

  All three imaginary personalities shuddered at once with the reaction creeping its way back into reality.

  /I hate you so much, Advocate. Is that really the only plan you can come up with to work on?/

  /If I randomly think of any at some later point, I'll let you know. But for now, yes./

  Opposition sighed. /All right, let's work out the specifics./

  /I request more information./

  Twilight broke out of her conversation with herself, merging back into one coherent pony without the illusion of multiple trains of thought. She shook off the momentary disorientation she experienced upon exiting the headspace and turned to Celestia to ask for more information about the Elements.

*** Yeah it's been more than a month already, I though there was a new chapter when I saw this but guess not. It's on my top 10 of pony fic, only hindered by not being finished and taking a long time to udapte.

** Excellent, Seeking Power was my favourite ponyfic. This version of Twilight is such a nerd.
