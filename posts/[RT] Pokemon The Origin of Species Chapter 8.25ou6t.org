** Good job on describing Red's reaction to petting the skarmory. It was pretty much the same as me petting a snake (except that I don't need to pet snakes to optimize everything). Overly cautious at first, curious later.

** Hey all, back again! Those of you confused about what CoRRNet is might want to check out the previous chapters again, specifically chapter 3, where I added mention of it for the first time. Simply put, it stands for Coordinated Ranger Response Network, and acts as a region wide task manager to help warn the public of threats, and allow trainers and Rangers to coordinate.

New story cover is by the artist Shion, from the website Pixiv. Enjoy the chapter, and as always, any and all feedback is appreciated!

*** Apart from the CORRNet, is there another significant change to the previous chapters. I didn't reread them, but I'd be willing if it was needed to follow the entire story.

**** Good question!

If I ever add or edit something significant enough that it's needed to follow the story, I will be sure to mention it in the author's note of the following chapter, and try to summarize the changes. Nothing really major has changed, so for now you should be fine without rereading.

That said, many of the previous chapters have gone through significant polishing since they were first published, so if you have not read them since the day or two after they came out, it might be worth doing to pick up the added nuances in character and world building. But it's definitely not necessary at this point :)

** Soooo, if the Kanto Birds are inspired by the Endbringers, does that mean that the originals are hanging around Hoenn? It just seems to fit a little too well...

*** By originals, do you mean Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza?

The Endbringers themselves were inspired by the mythological beasts whose names they share: Behemoth and Leviathon as lords of land and sea respectively, and instead of Ziz as lord of sky, the Simurgh from persian legends. I imagine Game Freak was similarly inspired by the Land/Sea/Sky trinity when they made Hoenn's legendaries.

If you want to compare the region's legendaries though, I don't know about you but I see the ability to reshape and drown continents as much scarier than "just" making really strong, long storms :)

**** Yeah, due to the shared inspiration there's a pretty clear 1:1 correspondence (Kyogre = Leviathan, Groudon = Behemoth, Rayquaza = flying third member).

The birds are obviously way lighter and softer, as eg. Kyushu is still there, but it's a similar theme. I like it a lot :)

** A small mistake I've noticed: Blue is called Green near the beginning of the chapter.

#+begin_quote
  "There you are," Green says with a smile. "Have trouble sleeping last night?"
