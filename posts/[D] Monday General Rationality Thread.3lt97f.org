Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I just recently started reading Terry Pratchett for the first time. I finished /Good Omens/ (which was co-authored with Neil Gaiman), and I'm currently delving into his Discworld Saga starting with /Equal Rites/.

I wouldn't particularly consider his work to be rational fiction (there are more than a few things that happen "just because"), but the more I read from him the more I become convinced that he was a rationalist. It's just the way his characters act, and the way his stories are structured. In his worlds there is just no such thing as a mystery that is better left unsolved.

In any case case, I'm really enjoying his work.

Do you know any other authors like that? Authors that don't particularly write rational fiction, but still have stories that contain a lot of rational problem solving?

Also does anyone have any suggestions about where I should go with Discworld after I finish the Witchworld portion?

Angel (from X-men) flies with his wings, for example, which is plausible if you assume a certain wingspan, hollow bones, lean musculature, etc. Breathing underwater is similarly something that is plausible for someone to be able to do with a divergent biology. "Invisibility" might just be active camo that works similarly to how an octopus uses their chromatophores to blend in with their surroundings. The implausible part there is usually how the person gets that power, which often contradicts vast swaths of what we know about biology, but it's not physics breaking.

I'm not so sure about that. Condors are the largest flying bird (according to google),they weigh up to 33 pounds. and their wingspan is around 10 feet long.

Even if you got a human down to 66 pounds (and good luck with that), that's still twice as heavy as the heaviest flying bird.

I'm no physicist, but I'd imagine flapping those things appropriately fast enough to fly would be well in excess of human capacity (/especially/ if they aren't muscular, and have fragile bones).

Even at your 66lbs you'd probably need a 20ft+ wingspan. Where are you going to put those when you're not flying on an otherwise baseline human?

The suit is probably another story, but Tony Stark himself is perfectly reasonable yet unquestionably superpowered.

Tony Stark would make a lot more sense as a lone genius if he were on the forefront of some technological revolution, where there are fertile fields in every directions and innovations happening with every passing week. In situations like that, a single man working alone really /can/ make enormous, revolutionary strides. Isaac Newton would be another really good example; he was Master of the Mint, invented calculus, wrote the book on optics, etc.

The problem with Iron Man is that the fields he's primarily working in are not fresh and green at all; they're well-developed. I can maybe give him a little leeway with the arc reactor and the repulsors, but everything else should have been accomplished by other people ages ago, if it were possible.

Tony Stark making revolutionary progress in /every/ field he considers is a superpower.

That said, none of that breaks the laws of nature. It is plausible to me that, given the state of modern science+engineering, a near-perfect brain-wattage supercomputer could make revolutionary progress in every field it considers.

Obviously all of these can be taken too far to be plausible (Superman lifting a building raises certain structural questions), so stay within the bounds of biology.

** Have you ever been in a discussion/argument/informal debate and people ask you for your source? A valid question, as how else do you know if I'm not just making this stuff up? But, realistically, it's very rare that you have a source for each and every single thing you've learnt. For example, I know that some villages in Europe burnt kittens for entertainment centuries ago. I don't know where I learnt it, and I also don't know if there were deeper meanings behind it, simply because I learnt this random fact in passing years ago. I know it's a fact. But I can't source it. Does that invalidate my argument? (Let's pretend you're in a situation where you can't just whip our your phone and Google) And if the answer is no, WHEN should it invalidate my argument? I can't be unsourced about everything.

In addition, let's go a little deeper. As a human, how often do you update your beliefs? For example, just the other night, I learnt that the tonsils are little sacs on either side of your uvula. But, when I was a child (~12 years ago), I picked up the mistaken impression that the uvula WAS the tonsils, or contained tonsils. So my friend and I were discussing tonsils a week ago and that's when it hit me. I've seen tonsils (in pictures), I've known there were two, I've known the uvula is a seperate thing. All for years. But when my friend asked me if I knew where tonsils were, I opened my mouth and realized I didn't. Somehow, the belief that the uvula was the tonsils or contained them had persisted, despite how I'd learnt several things over the years that logically disproved such a thing. I found it to be a mildly disconcerting, but amusing realization. That then led me to wonder how many of the facts I know (I've built up what I assume is millions, by now) are dusty and out of date, or founded on beliefs I no longer hold true, or are just plain wrong.

So.....thoughts on either point would be much appreciated.

*** I ask for sources (and expect people to ask for sources) when the argument rests almost entirely on the fact that's being presented. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Eighty-three members of the supposed Apollo team have come forward and said that the moon landing did not happen.
#+end_quote

If I am arguing with someone over whether the moon landing was real or not, and they come forward with this claim, it becomes the center of the argument that we're having. I immediately have to ask for a source, because if it's true it would probably cause me to update my beliefs. In this case, me asking for a source is a more polite way of saying "bullshit", because I don't believe that this claim is true (partially /because/ it would cause me to update my beliefs so largely).

Same for your claim about kittens. If our argument goes:

#+begin_quote
  You: "Medieval Europe was terrible to animals"

  Me: "I doubt that they were more terrible to animals than we are now"

  You: "Yes they were, it was common for village to tortured animals for entertainment"
#+end_quote

Well ... here we have a problem, because I have no idea whether what you said is true, and there's no way for us to take it further without me knowing whether it's true. If it is true, then I have to update my beliefs. If it's not true, then you need a new argument. And maybe some weaker version of your claim is correct, or perhaps your original source isn't trustworthy. But either way, if I say:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you have a source for that?"
#+end_quote

Then you say:

#+begin_quote
  "No, I just know it"
#+end_quote

Then our argument is dead in the water. We can't possibly move forward until we've established this matter of fact. I frankly don't trust your memory to have gotten the details correct. Maybe you misheard, or misremembered, or someone was just making things up, and I have no way of knowing but it's the crux of your argument. (I don't trust /my own/ memory either, which is why I tend to google things while I'm in the midst of an online argument and then cite my sources as I go.)

So ... it depends. If you're just throwing out a fact, I don't really care. But if you're trying to support or defend some position with a fact I find dubious, I will probably ask you for a source if ten seconds of looking on my own doesn't find one. I expect the same of you when I make a claim.

Edit:

Just as a small anecdote to add to this. I was talking to a very religious co-worker about abortion. Our debate was essentially about how seriously people take the issue, with me being on the side of "generally people who are pro-choice take it fairly seriously". Then he says:

#+begin_quote
  Pepsi puts ground up fetuses in their sodas and no one cares.
#+end_quote

And just like that ... this was what our conversation was about. I was polite enough not to directly say "bullshit" even with the immediate questions this raised in regards to supply lines. So I asked for a source, and he told me to Google it, which I think is a shitty thing to do if your entire argument rests on a single point, but ... I Googled it. Because /if it were true/ I would have to change my mind on the issue. This was a point of data that was so central to our conversation that it couldn't possibly be ignored or talked around. ([[http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/pepsi.asp][Here's the Snopes article on the subject.]] But that's sort of not the point of the story; the point is that there was no way we could continue without a citation of some kind.)

***** Think of it more this way - someone asking for sources is aiming for one of three things.

1) That point is such a strong argument in favor of one side, then if true, the other would feel compelled to change their stance (and thus if you're in a debate with someone, they care about what they're discussing and as such don't want to change their opinion purely on something you said without proof that it's true). In this situation, the timing hasn't been thrown off, because if proven, the debate is over and you "win".

2) They think that disproving that fact will convince you to change your mind on the topic, because you think it is such a strong argument. This is actually the case for many times when I do and when people have done the same to me, because some arguments are simply too central and the entire other side collapses without the existence of that fact. Thus, the timing again isn't interrupted because if disproven, they believe the debate will be over.

3) They don't think it will change either of your minds if shown to be false, but they still think the given fact has enough shock value to short circuit the thoughts of others, and thus feel like they may accomplish something even without getting you to change your mind if they can still disprove that one point. I see this most in political discussions, something like abortion or gay marriage, or any other topics that frequently include people talking past each other and one or both sides invoking more emotional arguments rather than logical ones.

The source itself is frequently unconsidered, as well. Debates I've seen on tumblr between transmedicalists and gender postmodernists had quite a few giant lists of sources on either side, sometimes simply pointing to tumblr posts themselves, and the reason they're trotted out so often is because it is so exhausting to take the time to address.

This (or a very similar concept) has a name, the [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop][Gish Gallop]], and it's even worse for sources than for simple arguments because you have to take the time to go through the extensive text of the source, figure out how it supports their argument (or how they believe it does), and address it.
