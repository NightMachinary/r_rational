Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A thing I've been thinking about on and off (but will probably never actually write the story it's attached to):

You're stuck in a groundhog day time loop that forces you to repeatedly relive 2016 over and over again (covering the full span of the year), with no end in sight or insight possible as to the origin of this loop.

You start the loop with no particularly notable resources (say "generically middle class westerner").

What do you do? What major geopolitical events can you effect? What do you start doing once you get /really/ bored of this loop?

*** An important fact is whether or not death ends the loop. All signs point to no, which is probably good because as number of loops approaches infinity, the chance of death would also approach infinity.

First loop, I would try to do it all at once. I'd probably think it's some cheesy 'right what went wrong' thing regarding 2016 and I'd try my best to abuse what little I specifically remembered of main!2016 to improve this world. An obvious candidate would be trying to resolve the whole 'coup in Turkey' thing to my satisfaction. Chances are, though, I wouldn't get too much done, since I haven't paid attention to good opportunities.

Second loop, I'd probably change my running theory to 'indefinite looping unless evidence otherwise'. Since I'd be considering this as a possibility in the first loop, I'd have memorized an event early in the year that I couldn't have possibly predicted to convince my family. At the same time, I'd also memorize key financial events that I can hopefully use to gain the resources I'd need to do more.

By third loop, I'd be fairly confident that I'm in a time loop with no specified end. I'd repeat the event/stock market thing to get my family believing me and get us enough money to do more things. I'd also stop going to university, since not only have I gone through that year three times, but I receive literally no benefits to staying anymore. While I attempt to figure out key events surrounding events I care about changing and how to influence them, I'd try to get practice getting important people to pay attention when I tell them things. While abusing a loop to get personal secrets out of someone can work in a pinch, it'd be just better if I could present myself as genius millionaire (from my nigh-precognitive stock investments and uncanny prediction of events) and get people to listen when I tell them that there's going to be an attempted coup in Turkey, for instance.

From there on, optimize. Find the best ways to gather money and influence at my leisure, because in the loops (or just parts of loops) I'm not figuring out the first steps of "how to take over the world in less than a year" I'll be blowing exorbitant amounts of money on all sorts of stupid things. I don't have to care about long-term health, so I can eat as much of whatever I want, especially near the end of the year, and be back to healthy at the start. I'd develop a habit of buying whatever strikes my fancy, and being able to play video games for as long as I want.

Things really kick into high gear at my first death, though. It'll happen sooner or later, when my more careless attitude gets me run over or my increasingly optimized mercantile-political empire somehow gets a bullet in my head for one reason or another. I wake up on the new year again, safe and sound, and a grin would form on my face, since I'd have been fairly confident of this outcome but obviously not willing to check for myself.

Now I don't have to have /any/ restraint if I don't want to. I can go into warzones and try to identify important members and their locations throughout the year, without fear of getting caught. I can use any means necessary to break into high-security facilities to find any truth I need. I can kidnap and torture people for information if I need to, without fearing getting killed in retribution. Though granted, the last option would be unappealing, but if all other options are exhausted and I just /need/ to have that information, then I might consider it.

After I've optimized enough, the world is my playground. I could figure out how to hack the US elections and get myself made president, I could hack the US elections to get Harambe made president and, if I can manage it, prevent the decision from being overruled (perhaps through sufficient blackmail). You probably know the drill after this. I do wild and crazy things that I couldn't have done without years of practice on my first try, become famous, make my dog famous, engage in all sorts of reckless and/or insane activities just to see if I can, in between loops where I build an empire that swallows the world by mid-April at the latest, and such a scenario would only increase the options for tomfoolery I have. Imagine a world where the supreme emperor, who conqured the world in a span of two months, decrees that all pants must be bright red, on pain of having a bucket of red paint dumped on you, with squads specifically sent out to enforce this. There's an incredibly large number of things that can go wrong in such a scenario, but with infinite time I can notice them all and figure out ways to stop them.

I'd also try my best to remember the pieces of information that most quickly elevate our technology levels, so as to let even more impressive feats be accomplished under my +eternal+ one year reign.

*** We're far enough along the timeline that this ends in AGI that hacks my brain into respawning it one way or another. The goal is, as always, to solve FAI, and secondarily to reliably slow down this year's AGI research. I'm not sure how well mundane brainwashing via e.g. torture by intelligence agencies works, so start with research on that. If that's not a problem, go public, and reap the benefits of all the other ideas in this thread, along with bringing back the public's FAI research.

I might want to kill myself prematurely to keep AGI researchers doing mostly the same things - and that means that I should probably set up a way to only reveal the loop to the right people after a few iterations, because otherwise unauthorized researchers might try to deliberately randomize their approaches to get their AI through. Of course, that only works if the loop resets upon my death, instead of running through the rest of the year, which might spawn an AGI that finds all the glitches in the loop setup - but this is all the part of the plan that the public can contribute to.

***** No, it merely needs that there aren't many remaining breakthroughs needed along the shortest possible route.

By chaos theory (whose effects I would finally be able to measure!), my mere different initial brain states in each loop are enough to diverge what happens each year.

Like, I betcha within the first few minutes some high frequency trading traffic is handled differently by some router that uses a hardware rng to decide which packets to handle first for fairness, which impacts stock prices, which impacts everything on a somewhat slower scale. The relevant diverger (though it need not be exactly one) is the /fastest/ one, of course, so any example I give is just going to be an upper bound.

Research doesn't work with science points on a progress bar. It's closer to a bunch of dice that are thrown each day, where every 1 doesn't get rerolled, and once some number of 1s is reached the tech goes through, and the quantities are mostly unknown beforehand.

I'll do some very cheaty and inaccurate math by assuming that that AI researcher's survey on when AGI is likely describes an accurate distribution, and also that that distribution is normal, and use that to calculate the expected number of times I can go through 2016. [[http://aiimpacts.org/ai-timeline-surveys/][/looks up the data/]]

10% chance in the 2020s, 50% chance between 2035 and 2050. 50% is the median of the distribution, but since it's normal that's also the mean. 10% is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation][1.28]] standard deviations from that. 1.28 standard deviations is (2035-2029=)6 to (2050-20[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20s][20]]=) 30 years. 2016 is ((2035-2017)/6=)3*1.28=3.84 to ((2050-2016)/30)~=1.13*1.28~=1.45 standard deviations from the mean. 2017 is 3.63 to 1.41. The probability that it happens up to 2016/2017 [[http://sampson.byu.edu/courses/z2p2z-calculator.html][is]] 0.0062% to 7.35% for 2016, 0.0142% to 7.93% for 2017. The expected number of playthroughs of 2016 is (1/(0.000142-0.000062)=)12500 - (1/(0.0793-0.0735)=)172.

You have some unknown number between 2 and 150 lifetimes according to this estimate. Try to push in the right direction.

#+end_quote

See the problem is that you assume because advancements are /somewhat/ random, that they don't have any limiting factors. Not to mention even the most optimistic singularity estimates place it decades away, so I don't really think many people in the area would say there aren't many breakthroughs left. You can take as many independent groups of WW2 era scientists as you want working for a year, but you aren't going to get an iphone.\\
Also you are forgetting that no serious people are actually trying to make AGI /right now/ there's just too much ground that needs to be broke first. Even if a bunch of people through sheer chance had all the needed insights in that year, it would take longer than a year to implement that sort of thing.

Sure you could imagine say quantum noise eventually creating a AGI ex nihilo on a supercomputer. However /by far/ the most likely way a AGI gets created is because of your interference. So either you try to work on creating one safely, or eventually by chance you have a mental breakdown or some other thing makes you create an AGI.

** You have met an individual with a particular speech defect. For some reason he appears to only speak words which start with a H, but you want to rigorously test the limits of the defect. It's a defect caused by magic, so he cannot communicate in any way other than verbally. He cannot write or sign. Body language is not allowed either.

What sort of words or questions would you test him on? I'll respond as if I am the character, but understand I might have difficulties responding if the appropriate words are not in the H section of a dictionary.

To stay in character and to simplify things, I'll say "Heaven" for yes and "Hell" for no.

Or perhaps morse code would be more practical because there are a lot more humans out there who already understand it and are practiced with interpreting it.

As a side question, can he say words in languages other than English that also start with H? or whatever equivalent that language has.

Can he say "words" that have no meaning in English or any language but nonetheless start with H when written phonetically?

Congratulations you win!

Basically, the magical curse only allows me to speak English words known to the listener which starts with a H sound. But the curse allows for new "words" to be added over the course of a conversation as long as the speakers include a definition with the new word. This is to prevent nonsense words (especially ones that sound very similar to actual words) from being allowed.

Note that it doesn't allow for non-English words as a limitation imposed by the curse itself.

If I tried speaking to anyone else, then they would have to make the same statement as you did to allow me the same loophole. The curse is running off the listener's knowledge of H-words, so there isn't a solution to allow for me to be able to speak legibly to everyone.

** You have just been contacted by a newly-created superintelligent AI, which knows that "acting morally" is very important but doesn't know what that means. Having decided that you are the only human with an accurate conception of morality, it has asked you to define good and evil for it.

Important limitations:

- Because acting morally is soooooooo important, there's no time to lose! You only have twelve hours to compose and send your reply.
- You cannot foist the job onto someone else. You are the only being that the AI will trust.
- You must impart specific principles rather than say "Listen to whatever I happen to be saying at the moment." That would be a little too close to divine command theory, which the AI has already decided is kind of nonsense.
- You have only this one opportunity to impart a moral code to the AI. If you attempt to revise your instructions in the future, the AI will decide that you have become corrupted.
- If you choose to say nothing, then the AI will be left to fend for itself and in a few weeks conclude that paperclips are awfully important.

(And then, of course, once you've issued your reply, take a look at the other responses and make them go as disastrously wrong as possible)

Since even the most well thought out moral utility functions like CEV have significant problems, or rely on assumptions about human moral nature, of which I am not willing to count on.

What I think will work best is simply asking the AI to use a hardcoded copy of your current moral system. This isn't subject to the AI worrying about corruption, nor is it divine command theory. Plus it wouldn't make sense /not/ for it to work, after all if it thinks you are this reliable moral arbiter, then using a hardcoded version of your current ethics seems like it ought to be the optimal solution from it's perspective. Since it isn't subject to you accidentally making a moral system that is untenable and contradictory and it will probably correspond best to whatever aspect of "you" that it thinks is morally reliable anyway.

Some kind of well thought out clause to only include some sentient entities (the ones we know about) might be worth it to). Maybe instead of requiring the evaluation to be with the consequences make it require understanding of the motivation.

** Lurked for a long while, but figured getting feedback on this is probably worth delurking. I'm planning on writing either a quest (a la Marked for Death) or a story (exactly which depends mostly on if I'm creative enough to come up with a full story, or just the start of one that I currently have). Anyways, the premise is that there are a bunch of different sentient species each with their own super power, each trying to conquer/rule the world. I've tried to make the powers reasonably balanced, but would appreciate feedback on them, especially things I may have missed that make one power or the other incredibly overpowered. The setting has a tech level ~around the classical era, with occasional exceptions, and tons of monsters running around.

Race 1: Disguise/camouflage experts. They have hair/fur on the outside of their body which lets (sufficiently advanced users) disguise themselves approximately as good as advanced active camouflage systems, or take on the appearance of someone else (though they can't change their actual size, voice, or smell naturally).

Race 2: Combat experts. Each member of the race has the combat techniques of the most skilled currently surviving member of their race (determined by a national council, then put on the thing that grants everyone combat techniques) in any related method of combat. So basically everyone's a combat expert. They also have mideaval area personal weapons (so, steel and crossbows) where everybody else doesn't (at least at the start).

Race 3: Empathic Mind Readers. From birth, members of this race have enhanced empathy - they can determine what other people or animals are feeling. With training, this ability expands, and they're eventually able to understand stream of conscious thoughts from sentient beings.

Race 4: Explorers/spies. This race can project their senses of sight or hearing to the limit of what they can see. This ability doesn't compound, so you couldn't spy more than ~50 miles without using more than one person. Also, in the act of projecting their senses, it produces a bang, and a glowing avatar of themselves at the location they're observing from.

Race 5: Technomancers. This race has virtually no combat ability, and is not great at communicating with other races. It is, however able to manipulate electricity from the stump of their left arm. They also have a set of advanced mechas which they can pilot using impulses from their arm to control, but don't know how to make the mechas, and generally consider them to be demons they grant their life force to.

**** thanks for the reply :)

#2 works by magical items that they keep at their base, where they put the names (or magical imprint) of the foremost expert on a subject in a banner, which gives the rest of the species that ability. Magical items are specific to specific forms of combat (e.g. unarmed, short sword, long sword, crossbow etc.), and they don't have the ability to make more standards. It's unlikely they would progress to the point where they could make new ones or manipulate what they have in the time the story would take place.

I'm unsure how #3 could get a science victory? Like, I think it'd just be a slightly faster method of communication between each other since they could read surface thoughts, but surface thoughts don't move orders of magnitude faster than speech (I think). It would definitely not be a full mind-read ability, or faster thinking speed.

#4 could plop an avatar on the moon, but they don't have enhanced senses, so it wouldn't actually help them that much (though they'd know a fair amount about cosmology). They could definitely do astronomy way better than anyone else though.

They can use their avatars for global communication, by spawning avatars on the moon and lipreading/signspeaking (they might call it moonspeak :D ), or if they can't make their avatars move, blinking in and out in morse.

****** Oh, good idea! They wouldn't be able to make their avatars move (in fact, turning their avatar's head to see something else would require a separate casting), but morse on the moon would totally be doable, and could be more information heavy, since experienced casters could manipulate the shape of their avatar while casting (as in, make it look one way or another, not look physically different). And yeah, I had before imagined that they'd spread a communication network across mountaintops so they could use words, but it probably makes more sense to use the moon and a binary code.

My initial thought is that targeting things it's a skill they need to learn, and would always need to make sure their avatar was in an area with low enough density (so no forming in rock, or mostly inside a wall, but forming in mid-air would be possible if you were skilled enough, but not an easy thing).

Obviously, there are physics problems with relativity which arise with this (the avatar is stationary with respect to what (Earth or Moon makes a huge difference)), but fortunately the background I've written provides enough justification for that problem to not cause the universe to break. Would probably be something experienced casters could exploit with enough practice, but your average #4 couldn't do.

*** Which one is the economic, social powerhouse? Which is the race of builders, traders, and empire? I'd guess Race 3 would fit this bill given their inherent empathy, which means that Race 3 would be the best one capable of forming a Roman Empire sort of civilization. They may not be the best experts in any other way, but by leveraging society they'd be the best-organized.

Vs. Race 1, Race 3 can READ MINDS and mentally "spot" any spies with ease. No contest.

Vs. Race 2, Race 3 are individually weaker, but battles are won with strategy and logistics. Race 3 can make sure that their combat formations, battle orders, and imperial supply trains act and react with incredible precision, and their link with their battle-brothers will build teamwork and loyalty that makes Spartans look disorganized. They can also use mind-reading empathy offensively by figuring out where the enemy wants to attack before they do so, and defend accordingly, while also finding out what mental blind spots they have and exploiting them.

Vs. Race 4, Race 3 might not be able to communicate as easily at long distances, but their empire will still have a post office and they would still be born and grow up in a community that makes it so that they act as a society more than individuals anyway. They're the only one's Race 3 might not have an easy answer to, but Race 4's power is weak anyway.

Vs. Race 5, in combat Race 3 will overcome just as well as against Race 2. Who cares what technomancy you've got when you have imperial universities, roads, aquaducts, and more?

Race 3 will win the war even if they lose occasional battles.

** So, I've been re-reading the second /Machine of Death/ book, so I'm wondering, what could you do to munchkin the machine? (One of the short stories in the first book posits a method, but let's see what else comes)

Here's the blurb from the official website: (source: [[http://machineofdeath.net/about]] )

The machine had been invented a few years ago: a machine that could tell, from just a sample of your blood, how you were going to die. It didn't give you the date and it didn't give you specifics. It just spat out a sliver of paper upon which were printed, in careful block letters, the words DROWNED or CANCER or OLD AGE or CHOKED ON A HANDFUL OF POPCORN. It let people know how they were going to die.

The problem with the machine is that nobody really knew how it worked, which wouldn't actually have been that much of a problem if the machine worked as well as we wished it would. But the machine was frustratingly vague in its predictions: dark, and seemingly delighting in the ambiguities of language. OLD AGE, it had already turned out, could mean either dying of natural causes, or shot by a bedridden man in a botched home invasion. The machine captured that old-world sense of irony in death --- you can know how it's going to happen, but you'll still be surprised when it does.

The realization that we could now know how we were going to die had changed the world: people became at once less fearful and more afraid. There's no reason not to go skydiving if you know your sliver of paper says BURIED ALIVE. The realization that these predictions seemed to revel in turnabout and surprise put a damper on things. It made the predictions more sinister --yes, if you were going to be buried alive you weren't going to be electrocuted in the bathtub, but what if in skydiving you landed in a gravel pit? What if you were buried alive not in dirt but in something else? And would being caught in a collapsing building count as being buried alive? For every possibility the machine closed, it seemed to open several more, with varying degrees of plausibility.

By that time, of course, the machine had been reverse engineered and duplicated, its internal workings being rather simple to construct, given our example. And yes, we found out that its predictions weren't as straightforward as they seemed upon initial discovery at about the same time as everyone else did. We tested it before announcing it to the world, but testing took time --- too much, since we had to wait for people to die. After four years had gone by and three people died as the machine predicted, we shipped it out the door. There were now machines in every doctor's office and in booths at the mall. You could pay someone or you could probably get it done for free, but the result was the same no matter what machine you went to. They were, at least, consistent.

--------------

Clarification: Despite the above text, it's most common for, e.g., a "thyroid cancer" prediction to be given to someone who gets boring old thyroid cancer and dies of it in a normal manner. And no, you can't ever die of something that doesn't match your prediction.

EDIT: By munchkin, I more meant, "if you had sole access to this machine, how could you save / destroy the world or make a bunch of money or what fun things could you do with it", rather than the "try and outsmart the machine" that seems to be peoples' first thought. "The Machine Is Always Right" is an axiom of this universe, so it's kind of a non-starter to debate, though it's always fun to think about the details of that.

*** What rule governs the absence of temporal paradox?

Do all people who would be willing to get themselves killed in order to try and cause a paradox happen to get causes that do not allow rigorous experiments?

I can hardly suppose some cause of death and then tell you a strategy to respond to it, because that strategy might make that cause of death not be spitted out in the first place, or warp probability in stranger ways.

Or would you be willing to play GM here? At any point, you may revise history, to simulate the machine's divinatory capabilities. My character is tired of the world and thinks that at least he might be able to end it all by causing a paradox, bringing about a cause of death different from the one given.

******* The weird thing about this scenario is that as soon as the machine goes public the majority of deaths are likely to become somewhat or /extremely/ unusual. For instance if somebody was going to die of some disease then they will likely take every precaution against it (because at least starting out most people can't just accept their death so easily) so as a result there will no longer be much of a link between environmental factors and death. In addition most causes of death are not rapid and totally unexpected so many people would kill themselves if they got news of contracting the illness that will kill them, just so they can go out on their own terms. As a result initially it seems unavoidable that most deaths will seem to be at least somewhat contrived, and that there would be a massive number of /absurdly/ unlikely deaths.

Ok yeah I should specify that the only person who can circumvent death predictions that way would be someone who is willing to kill themselves just to try to screw up the prediction, but isn't suicidally depressed.

If it says hubris then just kill yourself, it doesn't really seem like hubris would make sense as a cause of death there. If it says paradox testing /then/ you might try to live your life normally. Obviously the thing to consider there is that you might get killed in some unrelated paradox testing incident so it can still kill you after all.\\
However there would probably be a significant number of suicidal or extremely stubborn people starting out. Who would be willing to go to great lengths to avoid feeling like their fates are being controlled.\\
So for those people it might say stubbornness and then have them killed by the stubborn actions of someone else, but how do you arrange that for millions of people?

This, on the other hand, is not as big of an issue as it appears. All you have to do is condition on the fact of the machine's existence, i.e. even if the /overall/ probability of the machine being invented is extremely low, we're only interested in timelines where it /is/ invented.
