Well, title says it all. I think that it's quite rational piece of fiction, somewhat on par with Death Note. I won't give any links (mainly because of possible copyright issues, don't know this sub policies), but you can easily google it.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  From Tsuzuku Jinsei o...: There is a legend that tells of how the world was almost destroyed thousands of years ago by the vampire queen after she unleashed her latent powers. Despite their efforts, the humans were unable to defeat her, and thus resorted to sealing her away until the time came that they would be powerful enough to destroy the seal and kill her. However, the humans are not the only ones after the seal. Having cast aside his kingdom and betraying his own race and the dhampirs (half-vampires), the vampire king is persistantly searching, even to this day, for where his queen has been sealed away so he may break the seal and free her before the humans do. Fearing that once the king and queen are reunited, they shall continue to destroy the world together, the humans and vampires hunt the king, using any method possible.

*** How can someone be powerful enough to seal a greater power away, but not strong enough to destroy it? I guess it depends on the manner of seal, in which case I'd need to actually read it, but eh... Something isn't clicking here and I'm not hooked.
