She is probably the most overpowered member of Juniper's kharass, currently.

She is in a position to greatly upset the world order, /right now/.

******* Fair enough, but why would we measure her power based on how well she can make her meatpuppet punch and cut? If we must judge it based on her value for hypothetical war effort, I imagine there's quite a few overcompetent devil tacticians, strategists, and combat instructors, which would be more valuable than warriors by far.

She does lose to Juniper if given no time to prepare, but also would most likely be able to take out their entire group combined if given a day in a city. (Not that measuring her power based on whether or not she can win a conflict against her other companions is correct.)

******** I basically agree with your first paragraph --- the reason I measured combat ability is that it's more or less been what's tested in the story so far. That said, I think the situation you construct is a bit artificial; it depends, for example, on Val being able to pick out and recognize the (presumably rare) master strategists among the demons.

I'm not sure I agree with your second claim---so far we haven't seen the demons demonstrate general genius at planning, just in-the-moment social genius. I suppose that if you gave Val the element of surprise and let her build a bomb, she could kill Juniper and company, but I think letting her prepare and not Juniper is not a fair test.

********* Hm, fair point regarding Valencia's ability to identify the devils with the skills she wants.

We didn't see master-planner devils, no, but even if there's none (which doesn't seem that likely), social manipulations would be enough. She could recruit people who will recruit people who will recruit warriors and mages for her army; if she doesn't have devilish master planners, she could use a social-genius devil to identify and then recruit a human master planner. She would have half the city where she wants it to be in a day, or in a week if her selection of devils is limited to manipulators.

Whether Juniper's group is preparing as well or not doesn't matter that much, since she has advantages in speed of work and deception. Juniper and company are much more effective in direct fights, but she would never be where they expect her to be, and her web of influence would grow faster than their.

I suppose without devil-planners it wouldn't be a sure victory, but not a sure loss either.

  A green-skinned woman had a shell on her back, embellished with miniscule gardens and inch-tall trees that gave the impression of a living place, a world in miniature (and I could vaguely recall seeing something like it before, but couldn't quite place where).
#+end_quote

I'm a little surprised that Juniper's forgetting this scene from the Cranberry Bay arc (Chapter 38), but not immediately suspicious:

#+begin_quote
  I ... decided to follow along after a green-skinned woman with a shell on her back to see what her deal was. The shell was decorated with a complex, miniature cityscape which had been affixed to it, and she walked in such a way that all the buildings of the city stayed level with the ground. I stopped myself from wandering after her only when she saw that I was paying attention and flashed me a smile.
#+end_quote

That said, I do find it suspect that this NPC has reappeared, although the logistics make sense.

It seems like either a dangling plot hook (possibly for resolving the bottlocus situation, if the miniaturisation is magical rather than actual models) or a potential complication (e.g. if Shelly is actually a spy for one of the more subtle threats). Best case scenario, the whole thing's just a red herring.

**** Ah, disregard then. Looking at it with that in mind, they seem to be describing different dioramas, a forest vs. a city. I'd overlooked that in my initial read.

I still kind of want there to be a payoff for the peacocking turtle women. A lot of the worldbuilding in the story is touched on only briefly, which is necessarily kind of shallow (although it may, in aggregate, imply deeper links). Probably not enough words to cover it all though, since there's so much detail to go over.

I've got an unrelated question, since I only recently got caught up I'm not sure where discussion is at. Back in chapter 73 there's a moment where Valencia teleports with Amaryllis. Valencia appears to not experience the traditional blinding pain as a result, asking if it hurts. Did people have any theories on that?

Since that was the first time any character has been implied to not feel agonising remembered-but-not-experienced pain during this transition, my assumption is that the pain is due to the difficulties of teleporting a soul (which a non-anima presumably does not suffer from).

Specifically, the teleportation key might be ripping the soul from the body, storing it, facilitating the teleport, and then replacing it. The 5 person limit could be based on the storage capacity of the teleportation key (which may mean it could be subverted by powerful soul magic, although my assumption is that it's a balance thing).

As to the pain itself, the likely possibilities to my mind are (a) that removal of the soul is an intensely painful experience, (b) that a disembodied soul is, by necessity, in pain, or (c) that the particulars of the teleportation key storage are the culprit, for example if it involves a sojourn of unspecified length in one of the hells.

The discussion about teleportation in chapter 84 doesn't help hugely to resolve this. It implies that bacteria get wiped out by bulk teleportation (makes sense), but presumably the teleportation key allows a very large number of bacteria to be teleported (and if the quantity of bacteria affected the limit, you'd expect that that would have been noticed).

If the pain-caused-by-soul-storage thing is correct, it's possible that Valencia doesn't count towards the teleportation limit. She could effectively be transported for free. If nothing else, she could probably sit in Sable while it happens (I think the party discussed that as an option, but I don't remember it going anywhere).

What about the bacteria being rendered inert or removed when bulk teleporting. Are they lucky Val didn't come out dead?

**** In the case of Valencia and Fenn it's a very generic 'they have upper-class ancestry', not the /unique/ positions that Amaryliss & Grak have.

The cousin of the princess, by belonging to an actual royal family, is probably already more deserving of the title 'princess' than Valencia or Fenn are.

Unless of course the princess has ten thousand cousins or so, in which case the 'cousin' is still of the same level as Valencia & Fenn in regards to princesshood.

** Happy for the chapters coming out as always, thanks author!

I liked the feel these chapters had, they had an amount of caution, but it wasn't the be all end all. Amaryllis discovering Earth technology is great, and now it seems she has somewhere to direct her energy. Fenn was fun as per normal, and I like how Val was pulled in by the book, making comparisons to herself. I could see her becoming a book lover. Grak chilling with the other dwarf was pretty funny, just at the right timing since I was wondering where he was.

Joon hearing the psychic messages were pretty cool, kind of want an extension of that magic/technique. Interesting how happy he was to go alone with it all. I did jump to the handmaid swap as Joon did too, happy surprise to find out I was wrong.

While his less when fond treatment of druid magic can be attributed to his dislike of something solely based on faith in particular, i find it ironic that most of the structure and ways in which Druid magic works was described in his rant about God in Chapter 81. The whole thing about "if omnipotent and benevolent, why suffering - when means not omnipotent or benevolent" can be applied to druid magic and describe it limits and how\why it doesn't work if you lack faith.

I can understand his dislike towards Druid magic, because it's similar to faith in God, but it being vague or breaking laws of physics (not making sense) and examples he lists as such are contradicting what he actually does himself or other magical schools in the story. Saying Druid magic doesn't have structure is kinda wrong to since you can clearly apply a lot of limits to it and if it was all powerful Locus would not be so vulnerable. You can clearly define there forest ends even tho the border would be somewhat moving and wouldn't resemble a straight line.

My problem is more about what he attributes to Druid magic not making sense or breaking the laws of physics. Cause anyone at that point should ask "How do Anyblade?" Most of the transformations and momentum changes that he attributes to Druid magic not making sense are present with the Anyblade. Form change,structure change,momentum transfer nullification,size,weight, composition. Yet he only questions similar stuff in relation to Druid magic.

Requirements of Druid magic are in fact similar to other schools of magic. Why exactly, blood magic gives you an ability to produce fire from your hand, the answer at this point is the same as for Druid magic "It's magic". The only thing consistent in all magic that gives all of them sort of structure is that you have to pay a price - blood (Blood magic), believing\faith (Druid magic), bones (Bone magic) etc. In fact i think Gold magic is more mysterious than Druid magic.

*2) Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.*

It's also pretty similar to Druid magic in many aspects.

#+begin_quote
  It immediately sprang to life in my hands, changing and warping into different forms, becoming thicker, then thinner, sharp, then dull, long, then short, never staying as one particular sword for very long. Despite that, it was perfectly balanced in my hand the entire time, forming counterweights in the grip to ensure that the shifts it underwent weren't too jarring.

  I directed a thought at it and transformed it from a sword to an axe wrapped in decorative gold hair, then to a small dagger with a skull on the hilt, then to a bronze khopesh.

  It could only do blades, but it was pretty permissive when it came to what a blade was, and I could work whatever I wanted into the ornamental features of the sword, axe, or other bladed weapon I formed it into.
#+end_quote

So there does the mass disappears to (It was a toothpick at one point)? What about it's density? It can change the material it's made of? It can adjuster sharpness? How durable it is? What are limits to what counts as an ornament? Can it have properties (poison, curse, etc)

All of this may result in creating the most durable thinnest (even if atom thin is not possible, toothpicks are pretty thin), sharpest weapon that can cut anything with ease. Decorations being vague he can create a smart blade with a mini super computer attached to it.

Can he create a blade that extracts\traps souls akin to the stuff he was using in the first chapters? Can he create a Gunblade, Star Wars lightsaber, High-frequency blade from MGS Rising any other blade with extreme properties? What happens if the blade is chipped in it's longest form or in it's smallest form, would it be simply counted as it changing form and bear no effect what so ever, does it need to be destroyed to atomic level to seize all functions or it has some magical properties powering it? Can those properties be replenished or the blade powered up if he created an ornamental feature that got power from souls, like cars\bikes do(he already used some infant soul before, so he wouldn't be exactly against the idea)?

*3) Dragons believing that skies of Aerb unequivocally belongs to them.*

So this sudden description of why they can't take a plane to the Boundless Pit raises a couple of questions with me.

1. The first chapter started with our hero Juniper being frown out of a plane. Wasn't it a waste to go through a lot of discussion and arguments just to throw a handful of prisoners into an Exclusion zone? Wouldn't those resources and ability to transfer something via plane be better spent elsewhere? Since they are practically killing the prisoners and not really expect them to make it back, it's a lot of money and energy spend for almost no payoff.

2. So Aumann was so powerful, went through Dragons or just didn't care when he used a Helicopter to fly over a pretty sizable desert? Wasn't it also implied that he did it multiple times before? So Dragons just don't care about that part of Aerb?

3. So we had FIVE helicopters chase or party with no prior preparation and on a very sudden schedule. Dragons didn't care about that, it was arranged in a fast manner disregarding Dragons or again group that gave chase was to powerful to care about that, since they had Larkspur aka royal prince with them?

4. Since all of the above took place and Juniper was super eager and heavily questioned why him flying a helicopter was not part of the Narrative to that point. How nobody ever mentioned Dragons having the domain over Aerb skies to him before, did i just miss it? Why using a helicopter to get to Botomless Pit is not even toyed with by Juniper, he wanted to have\fly one so badly before. He even mentioned his father being a helicopter pilot and having some flight experience before. Why the possibility of finally having to fly one, as the means to escape from the Botomless Pit, never even enters his "narrative sense" as the result of this line of thought?

#+begin_quote
  The train was necessitated by the fact that we didn't have a better way to get to the Boundless Pit.

  This wasn't just a question of bureaucracy; some of the worst disasters in Aerbian aviation history were caused by dragons going after improperly cleared flights, which was obviously the kind of thing that had a chilling effect on passenger air travel.
#+end_quote

And instead it's quickly dismissed by.

#+begin_quote
  Also, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to have to fight a dragon at some point, but that thankfully seemed like it was going to be a long time coming.
#+end_quote

They go on the Narrative hunt with almost 0 evidence and speculated about tiniest of possibilities, but this is not even considered. I dislike the "narrative as the driving force" personally, but they mention in it in relations to "princess on a train" that has less indications that it's a narrative thing. But this huge thing is completely flies over their head and no one said anything before to Juniper that flying a helicopter might be a problem. They didn't steal a helicopter only , because they couldn't transport it, not because it would be dangerous to fly it.

#+begin_quote
  But it was obvious to me that if the Dungeon Master had a single dramatic bone in his body, I would fly a helicopter at some point, especially because this marked the second time that I had come close to a helicopter and then not been allowed to fly it.

  “But some things are definitely clues,” I said. “Some things have cosmic significance, for lack of a better word. And helicopters are one of them. They're part of my backstory, again, for lack of a better word. I'm not saying that everything is going to have meaning in one way or another, I'm just saying that this probably is a clue, and if we don't go back for the magic helicopter, or we can't take it with us, then we should at least be on the lookout for other helicopters. Really, we should just go there and use bulk teleport to put it somewhere that we can get it again, if we need it. For both the helicopters, actually.”
#+end_quote

*4) Are we having pregnant VIRGIN MARY in the story?*

So who counts as the father, Juniper since he was conducting the ritual? He seems pretty okay with this God metaphor and doesn't even mention this whole thing in his "God rant" in the next chapter.

I can even stretch this to the Trinity metaphor in some form since we have Father, Son, Holy Ghost - Locus,Solace being one and the same or mixed together at the end of the ritual. I can even stretch it even further to just having those forms Father\Juniper|Locus, Son\Juniper|Solace, Holy Ghost\Solace|Locus they somewhat fit those description if you separate the three as their roles in the ritual. Father - helped to give birth to Solace or provided power for the ritual. Son - standing in the ritual hierarchy, using the external power provided for the ritual or act of being born. Holy ghost is well, yeah, it's obvious.

So nobody mentioned that fact and Juniper was not even considering or thinking other what he has just done. Similarities to God were not even considered or brought up as arguments during his speech about God in the next chapter.

--------------

Current chapters are were fun. Even tho Chapter 83 felt somewhat jumbled or jumping from one thing to another, or containing a mix of scenes and ideas. Maybe it was just me, but it kinda addressed a lot of things at once and maybe even some comments that i saw before from readers. It's probably my imagination, but still it felt kinda strange to me in some places.

I would love to hear opinions of others towards the stuff i brought up. Maybe some questions can be answered or viewed at other angles. Maybe i even missed something, i tried to be more diligent this time and search\reread the novel to find answers. I still very much like this novel.

*** One of what I would consider the main problems with this story as it stands right now (one of a few) is that Juniper knows more than the audience does.

The problem is that there's a lot to Aerb, both in terms of magic systems, nations, races, and other things, and /logically/, Juniper has been going through a whole lot of sociocultural bootcamp -- and this has been stated to be happening a few times in the text. And the problem with /that/ is that A) I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days" and B) most people wouldn't want to read that, because it would mean stalling out the plot for a hundred thousand words and C) most people would forget about whatever was written in that stretch by the time it became relevant to the plot and D) some of it would never be relevant to the plot, because not literally everything ever shown in the world can/should be, especially with a big world.

I made the decision fairly early on that I would just bring up things when I thought they were relevant, either through flashback to when Juniper first learned about them, or direct exposition/aside, depending on what I felt worked better.

This comes with a few pros and cons. I think the biggest con is that some people really want (or claim to want) massive exposition dumps. I already feel like WtC has too much of that, and there's no way that I'm going to add more on top of what's there, especially when it would give the impression of a dangling plot thread when I've already been accused of having too many of those, or taking too long to get where I'm going.

(There's always been a strong argument for having the reader learn things along with the main character, but that really limits what sorts of books you can write, and has some results that I don't like, especially with regards to the plot.)

But when I'm reading, I take a step back when I realize a particular segment is more of an infodump that's only loosely topical (most recently, that lengthy aside on travel in c82 or the way some characters sometimes talk for the sake of disseminating information). I think it's part of the convenient charm of the D&D layer, where the DM (or narrator) has absolute discretion over what to reveal. The toughest part might be balancing exposition (including side-quests and flavor encounters like the two men arguing over familiar eudaimonia, which I really liked) so that the world feels complex and "alive" while, as you say, avoiding those red herring plots.

**** Sure, but those questions were relevant in the story way before. It's not even a massive exposition dump.

I can see 1 & 2. As being just questions, 2 is more about the limits and similarities of Anyblade to Druid magic, but 3 & were directly relevant in the story. Half if not more of his problems with Druid magic is mass and size change, well his Anyblade does that on a daily basis and he never thought it was similar?

3) No one talked about Dragons when Juniper was ecstatic to fly a helicopter, how exactly that was not relevant to the story? Starting in a plane, that would be logically a huge waste for transporting prisoners, was not relevant? He even wanted to take helicopters with them into the bottle and no one said "Hey Juniper flying is dangerous , cause Dragons". That's one sentence.

4) He goes on a speech about God in the next chapter, Fenn jokes about Virgin Princess, so he didn't notice what he has done or "Pregnant Virgin Mary" at all?

This is not about them sitting in a room, in fact most of the stuff could be resolved with one-two sentences.

I don't want to be the bringer of bad news, but most of this series is sitting\standing\moving and talking\explaining. Large part of it is Junipers inner thoughts and you even have a separate insert real world part of people literally sitting and explaining\talking. People talking is kinda my favorite part next to the adventure part.

As i mentioned Junipers talk about God(Chapter 81) was him literally sitting and explaining while Amaryllis listened, in fact wasn't she the only one that listened till the end?

Druidic magic is clearly limited; specifically, the inability of Druids to experiment with Druidic magic to better understand its capabilities or develop reliable practices is a fairly sharp limitation. It's not that Druidic magic has no structure, but that mapping its structure is impossible. Since experimentation and armchair theorizing are core personality traits of Joon's, he takes the idea of a magic seemingly designed to thwart his curiosity a bit personally. It's not about the impossible feats Druids can accomplish, it's about being told he's not allowed to investigate how they work.

#+begin_quote
  Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.
#+end_quote

I suspect the limitations are fairly sharp (hah!) on the Anyblade, much like the clonal kit. In both cases, they were magic items that Joon was largely responsible for. When he had to stretch the capabilities of the clonal kit a bit, we saw the experimentation demonstrated a bit more in the text. With the Anyblade, I imagine most of the "broken" exploits were already considered and rejected during its time as an rpg item. There might be a nice opportunity in the story for someone to get excited about the possibilities, only for Juniper to chuckle and shoot them down. That'd give a chance to explain WHY he can't do more with the anyblade, but I doubt he's actually missed a trick with it.

***** The deal with the anyblade is that it's limitations were baked into it at creation, it's impossible to modify or reproduce those effects, and it hews to no known laws of magic. An entads deal is that they just happen, and that questioning them is not only impossible, but fruitless anyways, since every part of the process is irreproducible. However, Druid magic is a system, which means you start asking questions like where mass goes to and comes from, and other questions Joon asks. Of course, there's an boundary sopping you from doing that, which is what makes it frustrating.

I can clearly understand why he dislikes it, but at the same time i find it funny, that Juniper is using a magical thing that doesn't make sense in similar way and he just ignores it.

Okay, how exactly you produce fire from your hand with Blood magic, what are the laws of physics for that? How exactly he is having double blood in his system, he would be super dead if his body followed the laws of physics?

For me Druid magic has a constant thing that's price (mana in other stories). You need to use faith and creativity to use Druid magic and Locus has a clear limit, so power source is not infinite, it's pretty defined. But when we have soul magic and it actually requires nothing to change things or what would be the equivalent of mana\price in this case?

** So this time i will focus on stuff i liked about the story first and some questions later. It seems i went other the word limit and will have to separate it, quotes and final words pushed it well past 10 000 character limit.

1. Chapter to chapter character interactions and dialog is great. It feel like living people taking to each other, a group of friends going on a journey\adventure. They all have their quirks and ways of talking, positions they like to take and jokes that they make. Spoken dialog between individuals is pretty awesome.

2. Most of the in chapter stuff is consistent between itself. It's nice to follow and end with an interesting cliffhanger, that doesn't feel forced and is instead implores you to read more of the story.

3. World and people inhabiting it are rather unique, even when they have similar counterparts in other fantasy stories. Same can be said about magic systems.

*Problem\questions i have about the soul magic and ending to the Fallather's ark.*

So i initially thought that "lines branching off from the soul" that Juniper uses to check on his companions actually had a real direction or\and distance to them, so he could have easily identified the fake Amaryllis. Since the line would not point towards her. I didn't find the confirmation that they functioned that way. But since he already tried to check Grak's soul directly and didn't do it only because Grak simply was not fond of the idea. Why didn't he check fake Amaryllis directly when he was touching her during the motorcycle ride? He didn't even need to do it stealthy without her consent, they could have just put Grak into the glove first and have Fenn watch, while Juniper explained to fake Amaryllis what he wanted to check her soul. At that point she either complies and is exposed, or disagrees and he has no reason to trust her, cause real Amaryllis would've agreed.

That whole chapter was them being paranoid about the most minor of thing and taking outrageous preconditions, but it all was resolved with ton of luck, guessing and Juniper taking actions with no justification. He even says it himself. All while he has actual reasons and ability to check things. He notices tiniest of details and comes to conclusion that Amaryllis is fake in the span of minutes if not seconds, but when he has time and ability he forgets about it.

#+begin_quote
  Why the lie? It was easy to construct a reason, working backwards;

  ... but that was post-facto reasoning, not why I'd did it in the moment. Was it something subconscious? Or that my augmented mind rolled a high number somewhere and fed me the idea of lying? I tried not to stare at Amaryllis. I'd been lying to her, was that my original intent or a byproduct of keeping information from Grak?
#+end_quote

He wasn't even sure in the end, but acted upon it.

#+begin_quote
  “Imposter,” I said, feeling a momentary flip of my stomach as I looked down and worried that I'd made a mistake, even with what the game had told me.

  We're sure?” asked Fenn.

  “Game notification,” I said, tapping the side of my head. “Not one hundred percent before that, no, but she wasn't using her magic items, and -- maybe I knew it from instinct, or Luck, or beamed into my head by the game.”
#+end_quote

This is why i disliked that moment and "narrative" in general. He had all the logical,intellectual and discerning power to resolve that situation, he goes into long stretches of constructing thought and finding solutions, but it all came down to "gut feeling", even tho the whole situation could have been avoided beforehand.

Because he had no reason to. At that point, he had no reason to suspect that checking her soul via soul-link and directly would show different results, the entire stratagem with impostor!Amaryllis created by copying Amaryllis' appearance onto an accomplice's soul was outside of his expectations. He was mainly worried about Fallatehr changing his companions in ways too subtle for him to detect, which no reasonable amount of re-checking would counter, and had little reason to suspect that Amaryllis was compromised at all.

With Grak, he had to use direct method because da nad had no connection to his soul (since da nad loyalty was below ten).

***** Regarding the pelehr, fair point.

Still, it comes down to the fact that there was no reason to think that checking Amaryllis' soul directly would show a different result. From his perspective, he looked at her soul just a few minutes ago, and since that time she wasn't in a position to interact with Fallatehr. Why would there be noticeable changes?

And even if he /did/ re-check, he would have likely done so via the soul-link again, just because it's faster. The only situation in which direct contact would have seemed a better option is that /specific/ situation with impostor!Amaryllis, which he simply didn't consider.

My problem is, it's described in great detail how they were taking precautions and being almost paranoid. He even felt that something was wrong.

Hell, he could have driven with Fenn while Amaryliss & Grak were inside the glove, but instead he solved the whole situation with His gut feeling. To me it felt like the whole Fallather situation was resolved by characters getting dumber and making obvious mistakes, instead of upping the intellectual battle. Mistakes that weren't even made under constant stress and one side finally breaking under tension, they both kinda fizzled out of their schemes and Juniper just won because he felt something was wrong.

Actually, the whole thing that clues Juniper in is fake Amaryllis being unable to use the inherited magic tools, cause she is just a copy. Boy, this plan was dumb from both sides, if Juniper just asked impostor Amaryllis to use immobility plate or her weapon, he would instantly understand that she was fake. Or you know something more casual and that he could ask real Amaryllis to do even if he didn't suspect her "Hey Amaryllis sisnce we are driving together use the glove to get Grak and Fenn into it". Holly, it's even mentioned somewhat, after Fenn gloved herself.

Did you see this part. I was kinda remember it and was editing that in, you might have missed it.

  Or you know something more casual and that he could ask real Amaryllis to do even if he didn't suspect her "Hey Amaryllis sisnce we are driving together use the glove to get Grak and Fenn into it". Holly, it's even mentioned somewhat, after Fenn gloved herself.

    I picked it up and handed it to Amaryllis, who hesitated for a second before putting it on.

I even somewhat agree that sooner or later they would need to go from schemes to actions. But it might as well be resolved with "Fallather with his luck worth hundreds of elf years, felt something was wrong. So he decided against approaching Juniper". Since the resolution was a guess\believe work at times. I find this extra funny, since Juniper is not that much of a spiritual man, yet believing and acting with his gut saved him.

********* No, I didn't see that. Also, /ahhh/, all this time you were talking more satisfying ways the author could have resolved that conflict, not about which actions the characters should have naturally taken? Damnation, I entirely failed to pick up on that, I apologize.

If so, sure, there may have been better ways to foreshadow impostor!Amaryllis than having Juniper lie without a clear reason... unless it's a set-up for some as-yet-unknown plot thread, of course.

********** I was kinda talking about both. Speaking of natural actions. It just occurred to me.

Fallather thought that Juniper had lost his soul magic, cause he arranged for that and he sent fake Amaryllis to test it. Well, this was a dumb plan or it was strange for Fallather to believe that Juniper was not a soul mage at the moment. Cause if he is not a soul mage what is the easiest way to test if Amaryllis is not an impostor - ask her to use the bloodline only magic items, that they you at least sure she is physically not a copy. Juniper didn't do that, that should have raised some questions if Fallthather is that smart, but at the same time why send a fake one if she can be so easily discovered.

Fallather's plan put Juniper into two separate states.

1. He is a soul mage still, so he won't test Fake Amaryllis with bloodline only magic items, but instead would check her soul, but would not do so directly. - So sending a copy it rides on Juniper being a soul mage and not checking her soul directly or accidentally asking her to use one of the relics.

2. He is not a soul mage, so he can't check her soul, but he also would not ask her to use any of the relics to at least be sure she is the real one. - Sending a copy at this point is more dangerous than sending the real one, cause it's super easy to check her with relics and he has no real choice but to at least check that the body is the real deal.

*********** Oh, that's a good point. It seems Fallatehr's model of no-soul-magic!Juniper wasn't very smart.

*** I also generally dislike conflict resolutions that pan out by lucky spur-of-the-moment revelations rather than careful considerations. Feels like a cheap way of getting a surprising twist into a climatic action scene.

The fact that WtC was pretty self-conscious about this, as evidenced in the lines you quoted, leads me to cutting it a lot of slack.

I mean, the characters actually talking about this, having a plausible in-story mechanism, and trying to learn from the failure of their plans instead of going "hah, improvisation FTW" puts WtC miles ahead of pieces like worm, in this regard.

** Has the gang received any new quest notifications since meeting the DM? Maybe it's just paranoia, but it feels kind of off that nothing in these chapters triggered any game notifications. The DM seems to be manipulating events at least partially for his own amusement, and removing the convenient "this is important" hints would certainly make things more interesting.

Wait, does this mean the user's handwriting, or always Juniper's?

** I enjoy this story enough that I'm doing a re-read and I'm up to chapter 42 (just after they killed the unicorn in ch40). The discussion of that chapter is now archived so I can't ask this there: did they save any of the blood from the unicorn? It would be a shame if they killed it, drank a couple of mouthfuls, and then left it lying there. Given how much time they spent planning it, I'd like to think that they came up with some magical way to store the blood...assuming that's possible, anyway.

Someone else asked this, but it didn't get answered. Not sure if that was deliberate or not.

Oh, since this is an old thread: paging [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]

EDIT: Question was answered a couple chapters later. Yes, they stored the blood and meat.
