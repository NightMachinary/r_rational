** Use characters that are compatible with Unicode. This will ensure that web browsers will be able to see them and ff.net will be able to display them (note that you probably want to test this to make sure ff.net /actually/ supports them). Using a font file just introduces complications that makes it difficult if not impossible to translate onto the web.

*** You will probably need to provide a web font for them, since this block is not included in common web fonts, or let people know they need to install [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_%28Unicode_block%29#Fonts][one of these fonts]].

**** Segoe UI comes installed on Windows 7 (and later) and supports runic Unicode.

That's the full runic alphabet (minus the eight variants) and didn't require any changes on my end to see. I think it might create problems with Mac though.

Works fine here.

********** What do you mean 'platform'? Unicode is a character encoding, the data looks the same here as it does anywhere else. If it isn't displaying, the problem is the fonts and layout system. No /font/ covers all of Unicode, but that's why you have different fonts for different codepoint regions. So what are you saying is the difficulty? Are the fonts available to open source not covering Unicode well? Are they not distributed widely? Do the text rendering systems not support Unicode broadly? Why are these things not already fixed?

Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, etcetera.

Yes, generally the fonts.

#+end_quote

Which I do, and I keep adding them as I discover gaps in the default distribution on my platform. But I doubt one percent of the user base of any platform does that. They just use what's shipped by default.

#+begin_quote
  Are they not distributed widely?
#+end_quote

They're not distributed /by default/.

That only makes my question of why it's not already fixed even more stupefied. Are you certain that they aren't? Xubuntu apparently does, because I can't remember the last time I saw a broken character and I don't remember installing extra fonts.

By observation, the default distribution of Mac OS X, Android, and iOS do not include the runic code pages in any of their fonts. Between iOS and Android that's basically /all/ mobile platforms (Blackberry and Windows have negligible market share).
