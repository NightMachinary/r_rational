** I decided not to go with the magical translation, and to make Athos earn his linguistic abilities that hard way. Don't worry; he's got a nigh-perfect memory, so he's going to learn fast. There will be less and less babble as time goes on.

*** It's working! While it slows the pace a little for those of us reading it serially, it'll be way more satisfying when it pays off, and binge-readers will fly right past anyway.

Characterization is so important to a good story, and I'm enjoying how Athos, Marcus and Marza are learning to navigate each other's personalities. Plus some unusually opinionated and snooty Interface text.

I'm excited to learn more about this world. What infernal plots await in Hellsport? What's Mr. FloatyBox's problem, anyway? Did Athos crash the funeral of the world's most powerful human? I'll be tuning in next time!

** Ahh yet another chapter in my favorite story of dog and his pet human!

Just want to say, I am all on board the point and learn approach language method. It's not very important and lots of stories skip this part via setting or just handwave (am looking at you Rain) but learning in story even if not detailed is way cooler (mega cool YOLO daaabs*) Anywho if this doggy is to be a rational clever protag, may I suggest for him or some of his new friends to give him a spiky collar. It's not full armor, but it has precedent IRL as used against wolves to prevent neck bites, maybe add a little frilly bow to make him seem not as scary.

Oh yeah, good on Marcus for thinking ahead on villagers being afraid, big dogs are terrorific!

*** In what way do you think Rain learning the language was a handwave? The author made a point that it was based on a nigh-perfect memory and generally enhanced cognitive ability. I'll be honest, that was pretty much how I was going to handle it, except I've got the issue that my protagonist can't talk.

**** oh man 10 day late response. Too lazy to log into reddit.

Anyway. Learning new languages is a bit more involved that simply having a better memory/cognition, I could sort of see it if magic keps the brain in toddler/preschool level, where brain plasticity is making learning new things easier, but it would still take effort to learn, speaking and listening conversations and naturally reading the words so the info solidifies. I think I meant handwave as lets keep the story going and focus on plot, and not say on the fact that if you got enhanced cognition you would also very easily learn other stuff, like laws, math (which he uses so props) basic physics and chemistry, possibly alchemy depending on how it goes.

Rain does speak to learned people so maybe its not avoiding the subjects so much as lack of opportunity.

***** I guess that's why I'm confused...are you asking why didn't Athos show Marcus the English spelling of his name? If so, the answer is that he isn't spending time teaching in return, instead focusing solely on learning the local lingo.

****** My question is about the trouble he had with conveying "what is the word for tree?". He could have drawn a stick figure labeled with marcus' 8-character name, and a tree with no label or a blank or an arrow or something. This is First Contact 101 sort of stuff, in the genre and I expect in the real world as well.

******* Ah, I see.

Well, Athos has been sapient for about half a day, counting time spent asleep. He's never read any SF, first-contact or otherwise, so he's really making it up as he goes along.

** What a good story to read this is!

I'm curious if the town is actually named Hellsport or if that's what it sounds in their language and has an entirely different meaning?

I guess I'll have to read the next chapter to find out!

**** Mostly the dog's psychology so far, it doesn't seem like a dog that suddenly gained intelligence but more a person with a vaguely doggish set of memories. Maybe that's what happened? I guess it's actually too early to tell.
