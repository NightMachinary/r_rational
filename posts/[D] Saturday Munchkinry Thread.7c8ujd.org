Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Reverse munchkin: Whenever this individual touches someone they can choose a series of forces for that person to be effected by up to 3 days later, along with this individual's medical training this can be used to precisely fake a very wide variety of causes of death from heart attack through gunshot(minus bullet but worth mentioning) to some kinds of poisoning, even no apparent cause of death by crushing a few key nerves. This individual is smart, some rich guy wants a celeb dead and has a contact then this person is just one of thousands who happen to meet this celebrity a few days before they drop dead appatently of natural causes.

Let's say you are all in the local police department and only suspect something due to slight statistical anomalies, let's also say there is precident for superpowers so you don't rule out this possibility on principal but have no reason to suspect it yet.

Edit: Four things to note is that the assassin occasionally frames other people especially when there's not a better cause to blame I.E. smoking, is not willing to leave the city for various reasons but mainly because lots of business comes up there (think New York, Hollywood, a capitol or something in that vein), it does not have to be the local police(but preferably something like that, as opposed to sayyyyy, batman or someone with powers.) and finally although the assassin is very good at using the powers other relevant skills like planting other evidence or sneeking into building to poke people and will avoid such things when possible.

*** Don't try to track the deaths. Track the /payments/.

Celebrity X dies, and one of his heirs slips up and says something after a few too many drinks about hiring an assassin to get his inheritance. Ask him a few questions, then arrange a sting by finding out how to hire this particular assassin and catch him when he turns up to collect his advance payment.

*** /Local/ police and a /smart/ enemy? I don't really see it as winnable, then: the assassin would never do another job in this city until a significant amount of time has passed. Pure OCP, gg no re.

But even if the assassin can't or won't leave the city for some reason, we can only have these slight statistical anomalies for evidence, and then we're left with the classical problem of building a serial killer's profile, except with more uncertainty regarding the victims and (I imagine) much lower number of victims. If we're talking a maniac instead of a professional killer, it gets much easier, but as it stands...

What technology do we have? If we have ubiquitous video surveillance and powerful face-recognition programs, we could cross-check all likely victims' interactions with public in days prior to their demises, and possibly find a common face here. I imagine a smart killer would expect this, though, and either wear face-concealing disguise, or work with the assistance of someone capable of rendering camera feeds irrelevant, or just not touch the targets where there are cameras. The problem here is, of course, that we have no reason to suspect that direct presence is necessary for killing, a priori. Why would we assume that, instead of the killer having a Death Note?

Hm. If we're aware of some high-level players that could employ this assassin (which can't be such a high number of people --- this person's services must cost a lot), and know which kinds of people they would likely target, we would be able to either put a surveillance on possible targets, or try to bait the assassination. I can't imagine it would be actually /approved/, though, if all we have to work with are slight statistical anomalies and vague guesses about superpowers. If someone important was killed in such an inexplicable way, perhaps...

**** Very nice, a small problem is his main defence is it not seeming like there's a killer at all so you also need a way for these events to be linked to a hypothetical assassin rather than say... poor eating habits of the rich in the area, as you suggested following profit and motive may get more results.

***** Well, however good this defence is, it is by definition not perfect, since the premise involves the police noticing /something/ amiss in death rates. Once we've narrowed it down to statistics, it becomes a matter of determining which deaths were ~100% actually truly natural, excluding them, and figuring out whether the remaining ones may have been intended; if yes, by whom.

*** #+begin_quote
  there is precident for superpowers
#+end_quote

Are there any general "rules" of superpowers, that we could use to narrow down whether or not these deaths are being caused by superpowered individuals? Like, what sort of basis are we as police working off of?

If we have no inherent knowledge about powers and their limits to work off of (other than that we know superpowers exist), then it seems /extremely/ difficult to track this killer down, unless he makes mistakes, or generates enough clear data for us to find a pattern. For example, in Death Note, Light was killing off tons of criminals every day, using the exact same method (heart attack). L was able to use this data to establish some baseline rules (requires name + face, seems to be able to control victims prior to their deaths, etc). But it sounds like that's not at all the case here.

Sure, we could start examining any surveillance of the victims for the days/weeks prior to their deaths, to establish a pattern. However, as [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]] pointed out, we have /no reason/ to even suspect that physical presence is even required in the first place. And since the assassin is not sticking to any particular pattern, we can't even know /which/ deaths were his.

The only potential approach I could imagine, would be if we could establish a death we were sure was caused by the assassin, to track who would want to pay for their death, and start interrogating those potential buyers until we figure out who they hired, and how. If we were lucky enough to get that info, we could set up a sting operation to attempt to track the assassin down (or at least get clues on how they works), by posing as potential buyers. But it would be an extremely long shot.

*** Local police? Can't really do anything unless you're really high up the ladder. In which case, you can try passing laws for health and safety, requiring people to wear protective clothes and take actions to minimize skin contact. That way the individual's power becomes much less effective, since they can't just touch anyone, only people they are very intimate with. And if they start killing people only after getting intimate, that leaves a very clear trail for the police to follow since all the victims got close to the ability user before dying.

**** Huh, ya if the guy uses simmalar causes of death too much it could be blamed on a hard to track desise and that would make many of his targets avoid the sort of situations that he uses meaning he would either need to take risks or loose out on several months of income. I think there could be better answers to come however.

** Munchkin: This guy can remotely detonate any part of his body, dead cells don't work however, also he heals like normal and parts need to be taken off like normal, as for exsplosive force let's say it's about equivalent to a high grade chemical exsplosive.

*** Well, obviously he can cool his blood for storage... at normal donation rates he could get 3.2 liters/year. I'm not sure whether there is an optimal diet that will reduce that or if the FDA just uses higher error bars than necessary so they don't accidentally kill people...

So if he optimizes and does the research it might be higher.

Blood is <50% cells by volume though, and you seem to be implying that the cells are what matters. Lymph... Low cell content things like urine... other fluids... are much less usable in this case.

Now: see here:

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991899/]]

"For a reference man mass of 70 kg, 25% is extracellular fluid [37], another 7% is extracellular solids [37], thus we need to account for ≈46 kg of cell mass (including fat)."

Now, this source is actually looking at cell counts of bacteria mostly. Which does bring up the question of whether they count.

Fortunately in spite of accounting for about half of your cell count, they don't have too much mass.

Looking at figures 2 and 3 in that paper, we can see that Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are about 3 Kg, Adipocytes (Fat Cells) are about 13 kg, and muscle about 20.

So. 3.2 liters per year? the average human should have somewhere around 5.5 liters of blood and in that 3kg of cells.

So that's ultimately only 1.75 kg of explosive!

And just detonating yourself all at once... 46 kg of explosive.

This doesn't actually help us munchkin much.

But it does add some deeper perspective. Perhaps cultivating muscle mass or fat then having that removed would be more efficient? But at that point... you can just grab an anarchist's cookbook and make your own explosives...

**** Random thought, what defines a cell as being part of his body? Its DNA? It being once attached to his body?

Both allow for mass production in different ways. In the former, you could create clones of him. We have cloning technology, it just doesn't have the accelerated growth + artificial womb parts. So you would need lots of women to be surrogates, and...

Actually I'm being silly again. Forget clones, just produce mindless blobs of his cells. Extract some part of his body, like skin, and then give it cancer (with carcinogens?) while keeping it alive. The cancer will cause it to grow rapidly, which means you now have an abundance of cancer cells with his DNA, which you can keep producing as long as you have the equipment to keep the cancer lumps alive. Only use the clone method if cancer somehow damages the DNA to the point where he can no longer explode it.

If the cells have to be part of his body at some point, that's even easier. Surgically transplant tons of body matter sequentially in and out of him. Give him massive skin grafts to increase his body size, and thus the speed at which you can transform body matter into explosives. Might be even faster to just use blood, hook him up to a dialysis machine, except instead of pumping his blood back into his body, pump in new blood extracted from other people and siphon off the used blood into explosive packages.

*** So, undetectable explosives that can be remote detonated in a way that can't be jammed by mundane means? Obvious things are obvious: Become a terrorist and have people smuggle vials of your blood past any mundane security measures.

Alternatively you could become a hit-man. If you have sufficient control over your powers you could put some of your blood in all the drinks on a party and only detonate the cells that end up in your target; you don't need much explosive power to kill someone from the inside. If you feel like being a comic book villain you could even force someone to drink some of your blood and threaten to detonate them unless they spike the drinks for you (though it is probably more convenient/reliable to just bribe/threaten someone the old fashioned way).

More interestingly: You have a magical method of sending signals. First figure out what the smallest amount of tissue is that you can detonate, then make a device that can keep that amount of cells alive (and preferably refresh them from a culture of your cells). Hook that up to some mechanism to detect sudden spikes in heat and you have a nice one way communicator.

How useful this is depends a lot on the details of how your powers work. Ideally you'd want your ability to work instantly over any distance as that means FTL-signalling, which provided you can set up the required reference frames allows you to send messages back in time. If not, a message that can't be intercepted, jammed or traced probably has some uses to various military groups, even if it is one way and only capable of sending a few bits at a time.
