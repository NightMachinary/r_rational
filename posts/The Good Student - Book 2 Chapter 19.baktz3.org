**** It's basically in line with what you said. It's a constant bait and switch. Even in the current chapter here Nic is probably walking into a trap, and he has been told as much. But did he himself know this? Is this part of his plan? You can already see the same trope is being used again. MC thinks he does something on his own, but it ends up being a trap, it's just what they wanted! Or is it? Seems like he actually maybe fucked up someone's plan? Was it his intention all along? Is he actually capable? But were they separate agents from the true baddies? Who's lying and who is telling the truth?

Combined with the ever present "He is the one"(C) trope it's just a big mess. When everything is up in doubt nothing matters - he can write any number of bizarre scenarios and play it off like it was what was meant to happen all along, because that's now the norm.

Character interactions are still great but Dizzy is still an insufferable bitch and Simole has kind of been waylaid into some sort of comedic role. We don't see much of the other housemates, frankly.

EDIT: that said i'm sure other readers will disagree. One of the chief problems with this novel is that some of the interactions are so convoluted that you can never really tell what's going on, which is part of the meme.

***** Yeah, that's basically exactly what I felt was coming when I dropped it, I felt it settle into that pattern towards the end of volume 1 and as I saw it start up in volume 2 I just didn't care anymore, if the author is just going to keep ass pulling the plot then literally nothing can progress, the characters will progress only for it to be fake and the plot will progress only for there to be a deeper plot, that /can/ be done effectively, but it is a very fine tightrope to walk, and while I have seen that the author can do characters and world building (sort of), he has proven bad at progression of any kind.

** Simole is being oddly helpful to the Librarian here.

I wonder if that's because she's on the side of the High Father, and has something planned.

Or maybe that's just what she wants them to think.

*** Well remember the high father was simole's pet dragon and companion as a child so she probably has a soft spot.
