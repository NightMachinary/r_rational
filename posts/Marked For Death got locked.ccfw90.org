** My very quick TL;DR is that a political deal was brought up involving saving the Uchiha Clan by agreeing to have (or facilitate the having of via other fathers) ninja-children with a fair number of (consenting, 18+ years old) Uchiha women. The player base went very far out of their way to make sure this was all morally tolerable by 2019 standards, but there were still apparently reports on this as 'eugenics'.

Please tell me I'm misunderstanding and the author was advocating real life eugenics in his thread or something. Please tell me they aren't banning books.

Yeah I mean private platform or whatever, but choosing to ban books IRL is “worse” than eugenics in a story, even if there are reasonable arguments that it shouldn't be /illegal/, in my quite reasonable opinion, if I do say so myself.

Would they ban any Fullmetal Alchemist content just because the core setting details are atrocious? Or are they assuming that if it's not explicitly decried very blatantly in-story that's tantamount to authorial (or player) support for an atrocity?

******* SV in my experience are quick to hand out infractions (I've gotten them myself for condemning hateful ideologies, which is rather fucking ironic and is my main issue with the mods), but not super quick to permaban, and while they may lock threads it's usually not permanent and they'll unlock it when the issue is resolved. I've only seen an author permabanned and their story permanently locked once, when the author was a complete transphobic asshole (Both in and out of story, and the in-story is strongly relevant here because it's an SI fic and the author pretty much stated that his real views on the subject are more or less the same as his SI's, for obvious reasons). And even then, the author's ban and lock were only permanent because he threw a tantrum about it when the temp ban expired and doubled down on his transphobia. But granted, I don't read THAT many stories on SV, mostly only the ones with a reputation for being good.

******* A lot of people interpret it that way, and worse, see "eugenics" as in "any action taken to actively improve the human gene pool" as the fundamentally immoral thing - not the whole "killing people" bit. I've seen eugenics brought up re: the situation in Iceland where basically there's no more babies born with Down syndrome due to prenatal screening. Now, if you're anti-abortion, at least that's a coherent position. But if you're pro-choice, then it's utterly ridiculous to decry as "eugenics" the sum total of a lot of free individual choices women take with their own bodies and lives (because guess what - raising a child with Down syndrome is /hard/ and emotionally taxing and most people would rather not go through that because of some abstract notion that some people with Down syndrome /ought/ to be born because... nature wants it? God? Or something). If we could just CRISPR away the genes coding for a thousand horrible genetic diseases that'd be eugenics by this definition. But what would be wrong with that?

Yet that's a position I've seen. "Oh, this is horrible, it's /eugenics/."

Even as far as unethical practices go, eugenics by arranged marriage isn't as unethical as eugenics by genocide. It's just as unethical as arranged marriage itself.

******* All the definitions I've seen for it simply state that it's the promotion of desirable genetic traits over others through selective breeding. In this case, the promotion is simply happening in utero.

Besides which, it often is the government who is promoting prenatal screenings. While eugenics often has the connotation of a compulsory program, I think voluntary ones qualify as well.

If I thought that was a legitimate concern here, I'd be sympathetic as I believe making fascist beliefs socially unacceptable is a worthy goal (though I still wouldn't support it, as I think making it socially unacceptable should be done by social pressure and public shaming rather than locking threads and such, or any other kind of censorship). But the situation here isn't that; this doesn't even seem like actual eugenics, and even if it were, depicting eugenics is not normalizing (or rather obstructing attempts to denormalize it) fascist ideology.

****** I'm totally on board with fascism being bad, and I remember arguing that Less Wrong was making a mistake in allowing itself to become an alt-right haven, but... making certain views taboo has a really, /really/ bad track record. Making broad topics like politics taboo, okay, fine. But social taboos on sex, alcohol, prostitution, drugs etc. have *all* backfired in the past and I feel like we should draw a lesson from that. I think the biggest part of the problem is that once you make something taboo it becomes impossible to talk about it rationally, and that only ever makes things worse. If you even argue against the taboo you will be accused of defending the thing itself, making correction impossible.

In this case: I think that the actual result of making fascist ideas taboo is that well-meaning liberals mistakenly attack generic right-wing ideas as fascism, and then a lot of smart people get frustrated and leave, resulting in a downward spiral resulting in discussions getting dumber and dumber until nothing of worth is left.

Discussing said ideas would be socially permissible, but actually HOLDING them would be widely viewed with the greatest of disgust, such that even those who DO hold them will feel disinclined to share that fact, thus limiting their ability to organize and communicate, as well as demoralizing them.

As for calling generic right-wing ideas fascist, I think this happens a lot less than people think it does. People call the US republican party fascist, because the US republican party is, by many definitions ([[https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html][for example this one]]), fascist.

** I'm currently reading Deep Red on the same website and it has dealt with far more morally repugnant topics than a small scale consensual eugenics program involving adults (which probably won't be written about IRL for years). I'm not even sure eugenics is even inherently immoral, let alone a topic so egregious that it shouldn't be discussed in a fictional story. Honestly, this could have been a non-consensual eugenics program and still been tamer than some of the things in Deep Red.

**** There are three big websites for Questing and Creative Writing that share the same format/style, called SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing.

Questing is like a story/game where people vote for what the main character does, and an author/Game Master/Quest Master writes chapters of the story based on their votes.

SpaceBattles is more dedicated to regular fanfiction as opposed to Quests, and occasionally you'll see the extremely rare and miraculous 'actual original content' there more often than on the other sites. It does have a Questing forum, but that isn't as active as the ones on the other sites. On the other hand, the mods are very strict and will ban you at the slightest hint of content that isn't PG-13.

Sufficient Velocity is more focused on Quests as opposed to fanfics, and formed as an offshoot of SpaceBattles over a controversy when they fired a moderator. It's probably the best Questing forum out there, and they have more leeway in regards to mature content. On the other hand, the mods will ban you the moment you comment anything that isn't 100% politically correct, even if it's very obscure and you had no idea there was a group that would take offense about it.

Questionable Questing is even more focused on Quests than Sufficient Velocity is, to the extent that there is barely any activity in their Creative Writing forums. I suppose you can infer this from the name. This forum's thing is that they let you be intolerant and write porn, but you need an account to access(or even be able to see) their 'Not Safe For Work ('NSFW')' forums. On the other hand, most of it isn't very good, and well, even when it is good it probably has erotica in it.

My experience of SV is limited; MfD takes up so much of my time and energy that I don't tend to browse the rest of the site all that much. That caveat stated, my experience of the mods there has been very positive. Especially when I was participating in the politics threads, I felt that they used as light a touch as possible and usually didn't drop the hammer too fast. Sure, there have been some cases that I thought were a little much, but nothing egregious.

In contrast, my experience with SB was that the mods there +went off faster than sweaty nitro and their standard tactic was to nuke everything in the general vicinity+ used their authority far more often and in heavier-handed ways.

SB nukes threads with mature content, and SV will infract you and maybe temp-ban you if you write something that might insult a minority. They don't do it if it's explicitly a character in one of your stories saying it, but then again it's not exactly the same thing as a ban on mature content.

It's true that the SV mods are a little more lenient than the SB ones, and their first reaction is normally to search the thread and apply minimal punishment to transgressors as opposed to the SB policy of dropping bombs and sorting out the rubble when they find the time.

Really though, it's very unlikely that you'll actually run into an actual problem with the mods on either site unless you act out significantly and end up getting into an argument, deliberately start breaking rules, or continue after they specifically announced 'don't do this!' to a thread.

Not sure I agree; this whole affair was ridiculous. The mods unilaterally locked our thread for multiple days and handed out a bunch of infractions and tempbans because of reports about bad content in the story, which they later decided was not bad. (Granted part of the duration was down to the fact that all of the QMs had IRL commitments that made it hard to get together and explain ourselves to the mods, and then there was about 10 hours of downtime as SV moved to Xenforo 2.)

At the end of the day, the mods acknowledged that the actual content of the story was legit -- one very messed up character set up a deal that was...ethically gray at best. There was a lot of money and political favors involved, but the core of it was that a bunch of Uchiha civilian women would be adopted into the protagonist's ninja clan and required to have a certain amount of children who would then be adopted back to the Uchiha. Mari, the massively messed up character, was the only one to speak positively about the deal and everyone else objected. I, the author of that particular piece, was extremely clear about the fact that everyone involved was 18+ and that the women were all enthusiastic, since having children with ninja would drastically increase their social and financial status.

No, that wasn't the issue. The issue was that a few of the players had said things that, if you read uncharitably, were mean to the fictional characters.

And yes, I understand what the mods were angry about and I'll be good and never ever ever do that again, and I'll keep in mind that apparently as a QM I have a duty to be a moderator for my players and tell them not to say bad things about the characters and to delete the bad things they say or I will have to tell on them so that the actual mods can rap their knuckles.

Yes, I understand and will comply because I don't want the project that I've been spending 15-20 hours per week on for the last >3 years to be arbitrarily shut down.

As for the SFW side, Creative Writing has like 40% more posts than Questing, and the entire front page of CW has posts only from the last week whereas Questing is so dead it has a post from April on its front page.

The NSFW side is considerably more active though, and the Questing/CW sub-forums are pretty much the same in terms of usage. There are of course far more comments in Questing, but that's just the nature of the system.

** Thank you all for the support. [[/u/absolute-black]] has nailed it in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ccfw90/marked_for_death_got_locked/etmo7hr/][zir's summary]] about what was happening in-story that caused the lock.

A few observations beyond that:

- Although I would have preferred a more communicative start to the lock, the mods have moved quickly and mostly been very pleasant to interact with.
- Things are moving in a generally positive direction. The mods read all the posts since the deal was originally proposed (76 pages, ~1900 posts!) in just a few hours and got back to us. They recognize that we took steps to be very clear that everyone involved was 18+ and consenting.
- There are still some questions to answer but I am cautiously optimistic that we will be unlocked by Sunday.

The timing on this is unfortunate, since all three QMs are heavily time-restricted right now due to IRL stuff, and SV is undergoing a major infrastructure change that I'm sure has been taking up a lot of the mods' energy. It's slowing things down as communications are running asynchronously. Still, I'm hopeful.

*** There was a political deal between the Uchiha and the Gōketsu (the protagonist's clan).

Years ago, nearly all of the Uchiha ninja were killed, drastically decreasing the clan's power and wealth. The deal that caused all this trouble involved money and votes moving back and forth in various ways, but the core of it was that (summarized) the Gōketsu would adopt a bunch of Uchiha civilians, including 11 women. Those women would be required to have children with ninja and the children would be adopted back into the Uchiha, the hope being that some of them would be ninja. The women were all enthusiastic (having children with ninja drastically increases a civilian's wealth and status), and were allowed to spend as much time as they wanted with the kids after they went back to the Uchiha.

The character who proposed the deal is currently pretty messed up, and when I wrote it I was very clear about the fact that everyone would be 18+ and enthusiastic. As a result, the story content was deemed acceptable. The problem was that (a) some of the players said things that could uncharitably be considered callous to the women and (b) the QMs did not serve as mini-moderators and call the players out for saying these mean things, nor did we run off and tell the mods that some of our players were saying mean things about fictional characters who were engaged in a deal in a fictional story that the mods judged unobjectionable.

And, just in case the SV mods are reading this: Yes, everything I said in our discussion is true, I do comprehend your point of view and I'll be a good boy and toe the line because I don't want more than 3 years of my work to get arbitrarily shut down. You're still being ridiculous.

First, they wanted to hold off on doing anything until they had read literally every post, all ~1900 of them, since the deal was first proposed back in chapter 271. As fast as the thread moves, the only reasonable way to do that was to lock it.

Second, the fact that it was locked prevents anyone from accidentally making things worse.

Damn, I am so glad they are protecting us from what they might have to do to us if they let us run afoul of their sensibilities in protecting their corporate interests. So noble of them.

********* I've just seen their over-serious mods, holding their formal kangaroo court hearings, and basically they seem to LARP the UN or some nonsense. And yet despite them wasting thousands of hours attempting to seem fair, they have essentially a monoculture where anyone who disagrees with the party line is banned.

** It's notable the lock is almost certainly going to be undone by the end of the weekend, assuming the QMs have time to talk with the admins.

There may be some retconning to alter the deal to be acceptable, but probably not unless the admins are being quite overzealous.

Judge for yourself whether the mods meant it that way or not

****** EJ said that organizing the meeting to discuss the action with SV mods was incredibly stressful and not something he'd ever want to repeat. Even if not directly asked, the implicit threat of having to deal with that again should the story ever feature “objectionable” material or lose the thread entirely is essentially coercion.
