I am posting book one of my rational litRPG series, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena][The Elemental Arena]], to Royal Road.  It's up to 227 pages so far and going strong, updating once a week with a super long chapter (the last chapter was 7.8k words). 

I love litRPG and progression fantasy genres, but have gotten a bit annoyed with unbelievable plot, unrealistic characters, and wish fulfillment tropes that are common. So I've decided to try my own take of the genre, but with a more realistic angle. I was nervous about posting a litRPG announcement to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], since it's not the most popular genre here but hopefully my story fits.

The story features rational elements in the form of teamwork, plot determined by consequences of decision making, people acting like real people and not playthings for the MC, and a range of emotions from humor to tragedy. It will be less philosophical than other Rational fictions I've read though.

The MC and allies will slowly gain power while struggling to survive.  Progression will come in the form of stat gains, skills, and elemental affinities. The MC is on equal footing with his peers in terms of power and skills. Many of their skills will require joint effort to maximize effectiveness (this is no solo game). The plot is still in the beginning stages, but eventually we will see large scale raids on bosses.  There's even a puzzle room.  I hope you check it out. :)

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Also, if you do read it, feedback would be incredibly appreciated. Especially in regards to the Rational elements.

#+begin_quote
  The time for the trials has come, pitting the mortal species of the galaxy against one another.  By completing challenges, clearing dungeons, and defeating rival species, the players may forge themselves stronger and smarter.  But only one species will be declared the winner.

  Earth has finally qualified...

  ...and participation is mandatory.  

  A twenty-nine year old accountant works together with a group of internationally diverse players to survive.  Learning synergistic skills and using teamwork, can humanity achieve an upset?  If they don't, their lives are forfeit.

**** I might post mine here at some point, but it will likely be when there is enough of it to constitute a complete arc, I don't think I can prove rationality to anyone without actually showing it in the text. Rationality also isn't something I'm directly intending to include, just something that is nice when I can. I'm not up to the snuff of the authors this sub sees as it's bread and butter, by far.

***** I think the core of rationality is generally that the characters act like people (who are aware of and react to the situation around them to the best of their ability) rather than semi-automatons following a script and doing things just so that the plot can happen. I think this is enough to make for a solid rational ground.

To properly shore it up as a rational work you essentially have to give the readers all the info that the point-of-view character uses to make a decision, to the point where they could themselves independently come to the same conclusion as the point-of-view character. Kind of like an old timey detective novel where the reader was told everything the detective knew, but applied to different works than merely "whodunnit?".

****** Yeah, I don't think I'm quite up to those standards just yet. Most of the characters in my story are conjured up from the aether to fulfill a need in the plot. Not that I don't try to make them believable after the fact, but I feel like I'm in a constant race to create the world and its inhabitants as the story I want to tell runs out ahead of me.

Maybe it is just the demanding pace of writing a Webnovel as an amateur, though I honestly don't think I could have done it another way.

******* For me, my outline started with creating the characters first, even the ones who appear later, at least as far as book one is concerned. I then created obstacles and I discovery wrote to see what happens. My discovery writing is very basic, and I completely rewrite it after I'm okay with the scene.

I will give an example. Major Chapter 2 spoiler:

I did not plan on events happening exactly the way they did. ex: Kean dying right at the beginning. I originally envisioned him as a quirky sidekick that Nathan could use to bounce game related ideas off, since many of the other characters are not genre savvy with RPGs. But as they were running through the first challenge, his lack of Physical stats were a serious flaw.

Asahi, being a pragmatist, saw Kean as a lost cause and decided it was better to leave him behind. Having three players survive was better than zero, at least to him. Nathan, on the otherhand, is a bit more empathetic. He risked dying to save Kean. If Asahi had been more like Nathan, then all four might have survived, but it would have been risky. Kean ended up dying because it was a hard situation and the characters acted uncoordinated, following their own individual wills instead of the plot's.

******* I think it can work fine with a "Discovery" style of writing (I greatly recommend Brandon Sanderson's lectures on youtube for writing in general).

I suspect a lot of it comes from getting some Beta readers who are good at asking "Why don't they just Y?" or wondering "If that is unprecedented, why is noone more shocked at all the implications that carries?"

I think the answer to such questions might even be fuel for fun depth to the story or world. For example: Why doesn't the Imperium of Man just innovate? Because of the power struggles and complex political interaction with the Priesthood of Mars who have an overwhelming interest in maintaining their monopoly on technology.

Most of the time a minor tweak to the story can fix virtually all the issues that makes someone seem like a plot driven character rather than a person.

If a major tweak is necessary, it can take the story or world in interesting new directions as you find new ground that is as interesting as the main story that you first envisioned.

** The first chapter was a bit rough in terms of grammar and phrasing, the rest is much better. In case that turned anyone off before giving it a chance.

Personalities are diverse and distinctive, nice. Johanna appears really abrasive and I struggle to understand why Nathan isn't more put off by her, but it only breaks immersion a little. The severe time limits (5 days for trial 1) seems like it may be difficult to explore the game system very much, especially the hinted at vendors. It just doesn't seem like enough time to accumulate NP for skills and items. Of course that assumes similar times for the remaining trials, but that's not a given.

Anyhow, good writing and pacing so far, I'll be following along.

I'll take a look at editing chapter one again soon, thanks for drawing my attention to it. I've kind of been thinking I should trim a bit of the fat off that chapter anyway to speed up my hook. I know some writers aren't as interested in editing chapters already posted, but I'm not shy at the prospect.

I will also take a look at some of my dialogue between Nathan and Johanna. I'm glad I achieved my goal of giving her a distinct personality but Nathan's reactions to his allies are important for his character too. I might adjust how he perceives her where needed. I can always give a call to my cable provider if I need inspiration for how it feels to be frustrated talking with someone. :P

***** Delete chapter one seems like good general advice to me.

I have an allergy to inorganic and unnecessary exposition. To remedy this I've taken to just skipping the first few chapters/arcs of most new stories I pick up.

I find it often turns somewhat generic and straightforward stories into intriguing little mysteries where I need to piece together clues to figure out what's going on, because the characters know this stuff already and aren't repeating it for the sake of the audience.

You are correct, there is no way for them to know given their information. Maya was mainly saying it for Nathan's benefit. I originally had Nathan expressing his own skepticism, but it was edited out since that scene was about 3x too long in my first draft and the chapter was already a monster in length. I have added a paragraph back to the scene since it does seem unclear, even though the subject matter they are discussing will remain ambiguous to them for now.

The functional difference would become abundantly clear if you got copied and immediately ceased to exist.

Someone else comes out the other side with identical makeup and memories, sure, but that's more like a legacy than you being teleported. Someone else carrying on your torch, but you are still stone dead.

Delay the murder-part of the murder-copy and you could even meet the new copy and make it abundantly clear that there is no mechanism for transfer of consciousness.

And without a mechanism to transfer consciousness (like gradually offloading neurons to the new location while those neurons can still talk to each other via a wireless link that mimics normal transfer) there's no reason to believe that a consciousness would be transfered.

******* I honestly cannot think of any real reason to hold that position other than instinctual aversion of a situation that we have not evolved to cope with.

There's nothing special about what matter I'm instantiated in at the moment, and consciousness lapses all of the time and is not continuous anyway. It doesn't matter whether you have any continuous transition or not, else we also die every time we fall asleep, or when our mind wanders, etc.

In your delay argument, it certainly would be very unsettling to exist for even five minutes as the first instance of me knowing that those five minutes would be erased, and I don't advocate for implementing anything like that because I oppose torture even if the torture is immediately forgotten.

Still, setting aside the torture aspect, we again lose more than that to the retrograde and anterograde amnesia we get when we fall asleep. There is nothing inherently worse about the loss of a copy of myself that's only a few minutes diverged than there is about losses that I already accept on a daily basis, besides the advantages to being in two places at once (If I ever manage to have two of me I would consider the loss of my clone after such a short time to be a huge loss, but not because anyone died).

My consciousness isn't some mystical thing that needs to be transferred independently of my mind-state. Do you think if it's moved too suddenly the shock destroys your soul or something?

I recognize that none of this is very intuitive, but our intuitions haven't been honed on these situations and relying on them outside of their scope does us a disservice.

******** There is indeed nothing special about the matter that you're instantiated in at the moment. While consciousness lapses often, the lower brain activity that still goes on during ordinary consciousness holds some promise that we are not simply erased - there is a potential though unreliable mechanism to transfer your consciousness from sleep to waking.

It could of course also be the case that we die every time we go to sleep, a frightening thought but until we have serious transhuman technology to make sleep obsolete there's not much we can do about it.

There is of course no soul, but without a mechanism to transfer /our/ consciousness there's no reason to see a teleporter-copy of us as anything but a descendant who will carry on our hopes and dreams after we are dead.

That it isn't possible to externally confirm whether a "consciousness" has been transferred (though it is possible to prove that it has /not/ been transfered, as in the case with the original remaining alive) there is no reason we should assume that it would transfer without an explicit mechanism for the transfer to take place, such as gradual replacement of neurons.

I don't think it's necessarily unintuitive, it simply seems a practical problem to be solved with engineering.

If we ever invent murder-teleporters, the obvious solution is of course to, if possible, never destroy the original after the scan that allows the teleport. Because honestly, why would that be necessary? We don't execute anyone because they get on an airplane or an airship, even they were to somehow generate an adequate replacement for the murdered person.

But again, if we die whenever we sleep, the point is somewhat moot until we can become able to sustainably never sleep.

The consciousness is not mystical, it's just the information network that makes you look out of your eyes rather than looking out of your sibling's eyes. We can confirm that it exists within ourselves as an observable fact, even if we cannot verify that it exists within anyone else, it's not a hocus post thing without any observable qualities.

Maybe you could clarify, what exactly makes a consciousness ours vs not ours? What does it mean to "transfer" it, if instantiating your exact self elsewhere does not count? Why do you feel there is any difference between gradually transferring neurons vs transferring them all at once, if the end result is the same?

********** I would argue that the day we invent teleporters the difference will be very practical, especially if they have the potential to scan someone and create a copy without destroying the original.

The difference between our consciousness and someone else's consciousness is that we are behind one set of eyes, not someone else's.

We only have awareness of ourselves. If a teleporter or some other technology copies us, we will never be aware of the things that they are aware of, no matter how similar our composition.

If someone shoots your copy while you are still alive you will not experience being shot. In fact, you may never ever find out what happened to your copy.

If it happens to /you/ however, you will experience being shot, and you will know everything your senses tell you.

You cannot feel what happens to your copy.

If you want to teleport to a vacation place on a different planet and use a teleporter that does not destroy the original, will you experience going on vacation or will you experience sitting in the scanning booth for awhile, going home and then seeing all the pictures your new copy posts on spacebook?

Why the gradual replacement is important is that it provides a mechanism for the transfer of your experience. We lose individual neurons all the time, so hypothetically replacing them with artificial neurons one by one should not disrupt our awareness any more than day-to-day life does.

To deny that the teleporter kills you just because a copy is made makes me wonder what you would consider to be killing? Is it okay to murder anyone with a blender, or torture them so long as you make a copy of them first? Does the original have no right to lice just because someone copied them?

What if someone told you that they copied you in the last five minutes, and you had some absolute way of knowing this was true, would you be okay with being executed in a painless way?

That does suggest that there is some value to your life, even though there is another you, no? And that if we made murder-teleporters, we should either not use them to transport people, or only use them to copy people without destroying the original.

They would, of course be /a/ you, but not you-you.

We may be misunderstanding each other.

I do not mean that the copy isn't you in nearly every meaningful sense.

I mean that at no point will the original that walks into a teleporter find themselves behind the eyes of the copy that is made.

Being "behind the eyes" is what consciousness is. Experiencing from that particular point of view, as opposed to the point of view of someone else.

That your awareness/experience of existing would not be moved to the copy is what makes the murder-teleporter into a murder machine if the original were to be destroyed.

Extinguishing an awareness in the original is the murder, because that person is a unique individual. The copy is near-identical, but they do not share the same awareness, and the awareness that they have is not transferred between them if you kill one of them.

The ship-of-theseus neuron-replacer maintains a single awareness/consciousnes the entire time it happens, whereas a murder-teleporter creates a new awareness/consciousness, and murders the scanned original through disintegration as thoroughly as being hit by the Mandalorian's disintegration rifle. No bloodsplatter, but also no survivor.

***************** We are real and our experiences are real, but we are a pattern, the substrate doesn't matter, changes in the substrate don't matter, pauses in our experience don't matter. Our awareness is due to us being able to build and reflect upon models of the world that include ourselves and our values. All that matters for our awareness to continue is for that process to continue.

There is nothing mystical about that awareness that requires any continuity, we don't require any monolithic continuity of experience to not be p-zombies. Continuity is pretty much a little lie we tell ourselves anyway, whether to make maths simpler or to reason more simply about time or our experiences.

If the destruction had a delay, we would lose those five minutes, obviously. We would experience arriving at our destination but we would never know about those five minutes unless told later, and most people would absolutely find the loss of those five minutes disturbing. I argued before that this would be torture. Waterboarding isn't the same as drowning someone to death, but it is torture all the same.

** You really hit the nail on the head! So many LitRPGs are blatantly obvious wish-fulfillment pieces or have author inserts to the point that it's become a real problem IMO.

When I read a LitRPG (or really, anything) the thing that'll make me drop the book faster than anything else is a dumb MC who makes no sense. If they're irrational for a reason, fine. But so many are obviously on the "plot rail" that they do things that make no sense because the author made the plot before the character and didn't bother to incorporate the character's own identity or actions into it.

What I've read so far is good and I hope you continue. I noticed you recently got onto the Trending Fiction as well, congrats! I'd love to see more LitRPGs that have a greater focus on believable characters that aren't cardboard cutouts whose only purpose seems to be to hype the MC. Keep up the good work!

** I'm caught up now and it's looking good. The protagonist is realistically horrified by the violence given his back ground and I am enjoying his growth. I liked that you killed the guy in the beginning, it helped underlining that you are willing to kill of characters and I think that adds to the excitement.

I find it interesting that you've given the MC the ability to heal and to find food, and that he choses to invest in finding food. It makes him one of the most important people in the group in a way that is very different than the usual route to make the MC important. I feel that the incentive system that makes him want to focus non-fighting abilities while needing to fight to earn NP to be an interesting mix. I look forward to when someone will start arguing that he shouldn't be in combat because they'll starve if he does and about how the politics will work in terms of who gets the healing/food.

I do wonder why they don't work more closely together on learning learnable skills from each other. It seems that there is a number of low hanging fruits and I haven't seen anyone considering the diminished competetive edge.

The players will certainly gain even more unique skills that will prove invaluable to the group, impacting strategy. We will see more caution for certain players happening as the group's basic tier of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs are met. Currently, they are struggling to survive and figuring out how to work with each other. It's not easy. :)

** It's been tried to the end and I confirm that it is very gewd stuff!

But dammit, now I need more.

It sets my mind running with all the possibilities.

As far as I can tell, some of the low hanging fruits of the system that they haven't reached for yet is that the primary barrier to virtually all the low-affinity-requiring skills is finding out what action is needed to gain the skill.

They don't have writing implements to write them all down, but they could regularly sit in a circle and tell all their skills, starting with those with low requirements, and anytime someone spots something they have the affinity for they speak up and the telling person shares how to unlock that skill.

Kill all but 1-2 gremlins and have whoever doesn't have the polarm skill finish it off and so on.

Depending on if the goblin's drawn knife disappears, another useful thing to do might be to keep a manageable number of gremlins or hornbeavers alive until you can take their equipment or cut off their horns.

It's grisly, but it might be possible to extract some food (dismemberment) from the hornbeavers and use survival to determine if it's safe to eat.

Wood armor might be very useful against the beavers if they can't retrieve the leather armor of the goblins.

Adding a crossbar near the tip of the wooden spears would make them much more practical against both beavers and angry gremlins, along with making their own longer spears from branches or trees.

If they can fashion some kind of wooden shield it would probably improve their odds against Gremlins a lot.

As has already been commented on in the story, keeping a +physical to spare intentionally is probably vital in these circumstances, extra points are good in the long term, but spending 1-2 extra points doesn't seem to give nearly as much value as emergency healing.

I wonder how they will do with sleep. If I understand correctly humans sleep in 1.5 hour cycles, so waking everyone up once an hour to fight would probably be devastating in the long run. Waking up all but 2 and cycling which 2, maybe?

I also wonder how they compare to other species.

If there is something like Orkz, Zerg or Protoss in the arena whose "100" in physical would be 400-4000 for a human their only hope is probably to ally with that species. And let's not even get started on the species that start with 400-4000 in mental.

On the bright side, if I understand the rules correctly our species will get the reward and the individuals will be saved so long as they contribute to the final fight, they don't need to deal the killing blow?

So hypothetically the best solution is to ally with as many species as possible and launch a joint assault on the final boss where you ensure that a member of each species at least throws a rock or something, thus maximizing the number of winners at no cost.

If there can only be one winner, it seems unlikely in the extreme that humanity, a species with only rudimentary genetic engineering and basically no optimization, will have a chance in hell of even getting near the final boss on the same day as whatever superhuman ubermental, uberphysical or uberboth alien species are out there.

Would a hivemind count as a single individual, or would they just select a hivemind with 8000 individual bodies?

Or maybe the hiveminds are part of the ruling class or untouchable political rivals and as such they can refuse to participate.

Or maybe humans are the only ones in this instance, with other species having their own trials? Must be embarrassing to be the AI super-archailect who loses to some humans because they couldn't reach the goal of taking over a planet just by talking before 4000 humans who only just put a guy in orbit managed to bully a giant dragon to death.

So many fun possibilities!

**** Always glad when I can contribute to an awesome work of art like this one.

Sorry for your lost hour.

Wooden armor is not often great, but they're not exactly gonna have time to tan any leather or melt any ore in their current situation, so they seem pretty much stuck with pre-bronze age technology barring any magical skills. Metal being an element suggests that it might actually get you some metal tools at some point. Maybe black powder explosives if the arena has been seeded with the necessary chemicals.

Since they're often fighting animals with horns and gremlins with spears rather than humans with metal weapons even a bundle of branches tied tightly around the torso would probably help a lot.

Other efficient opportunities more directly related to his starting specialization into survival would probably be things like animal snares (hopefully there are non-monster animals that stay around after death protein is an important source of calories for humans), or even deadly traps for larger animals.

Even a giant moose would go down fast if it fell halfway into a covered big hole with wooden stakes, and even a human doesn't do well against caltrops of any kind.

And they clearly need force multipliers, really, really badly.

I'm hoping that Nathan digs a bit deeper into what answers others got from the AI when there's a chance, there seems to be a lot of information that is yet unshared that would function as a force multiplier for the entire group (analyze enemy especially, only one person needs to have it in order to improve efficiency for the entire group vs that enemy, leaving more resources for hard-to-counter enemies).

Whether the end-goal is exclusive or inclusive and wether they might encounter alien players seems like mission critical information, since it would presumably shape their entire strategy for getting home alive.

If there are alien players with stupid levels of baseline stats compared to humans but the boss is cooperative, they can win by cooperating with that alien for mutual gain.

If there are no alien players and thus only humans can kill the boss it's time to see how quickly you can build a somewhat reliable fighting organization.

If there are superhuman aliens and the goal is exclusive a lot of the strategy will probably be "how not to get hunted to death by 1-8000 giant alien jedi with plasma shields capable of tanking an anti-tank shell from an artillery gun, and also get to and kill the boss before they do".

Either way, the story is exciting and I greatly look forward to more chapters!

** /Edit: Please be aware that stats below are no longer entirely accurate due to story revision./

What a great read so far!

As others here have pointed out, skill gain seems to be entirely vital to any eventual chance of success. NP gain is only slightly secondary to this.

The random encounters will be /brutal/ overnight. With luck, Nathan's /Wilderness Survival II/ skill will have some functionality to find a temporarily safe campsite. Alternately, since these are part of the Day One Challenge, the day might simply end and give them all a respite, and perhaps even a small bonus.

Over time, these encounters have been scaling up in difficulty, however this looks to be due mainly to consolidation of groups.

Boosting Emma's /Mental/ statistic from 132 to 140 appears to be the top priority. Elemental and skill increases may also do the trick, but we've yet to see anything like that in the main arena trials.

/Emma's stats/

#+begin_quote
  Physical: 114

  Mental: 132

  Elements: Water 4, Metal 2?, Wood 2?, Fire: 0?, Earth -1?

  Skills: Language I, Advanced Healing I
#+end_quote

Emma's Water rating would likely have started at 3, same as Nathan's Wood stat. We know it's a 4 due to the prerequisite list for Advanced Healing I. This implies she had similar choices to Nathan. Lack of a possession such as leather bracers leads me to think that she chose to enhance her Mental trait, but this is by no means certain.

Emma has not had a weapon; we've not seen her participating in fights prior to the last one. First kills grant skills (hey, this even rhymes). Odds are good that her next encounter will get her an attack skill, hopefully with Mental +1 or +2.

Her use of the sewing needle could also mend clothing such as Asahi's fatigues. This is certainly worth attempting, both for the tactical impact, and for the potential skill gain.

The EP formula indicates that her total should currently be 4*2 + 2 + 2 - 1 + 132/5 = 37, but her actual total is 36. I've pegged one of Emma's elements too highly, but there's no way of telling which at this point.

/Nathan's stats/

  Elements: Wood 4, Fire 2, Water 2, Earth 0, Metal -1

Teaching Emma /First Aid/ and /Wilderness Survival/ look like very good ideas. (Side note: The latter skill has a discrepancy. In ch.10, Maya cannot learn it due to Wood: 3 requirement, however the description in ch.6 lists Wood: 2.)

**** First of all, thank you so much for the detailed feedback and pointing out discrepancies. Great ideas too!

I checked my spreadsheet and you're right. I made a major change in one of my drafts and both of the ladies' EP totals were changed but I missed it in the text. Same thing with Wilderness Survival, I rebalanced some skills since my first draft and only fixed it in one spot. Maya is eligible to learn it now, but will find that she still can't get the skill unlocked to her consternation, at least at this point.

Writing LitRPG is a lot more difficult than I ever thought until I actually tried. Every single edit requires redoing math formulas throughout the rest of the series. I have to keep track of time too for EP regeneration so when I feel I need to move a scene to a new place, it requires rewriting everything after since the characters take different actions based on their available EPs.

I'm doing the editing work anyway, but I certainly am a lot more understanding why other LitRPG authors don't do much editing after posting.

This poor guy has been out of commission since chapter 8. He has not been earning NPs, and his EPs are being consumed as he recovers them to stabilize himself.

******** So, one thing I'm struck by is how easy /Language I/ and /General Fitness I/ skills are to acquire, especially when compared to /First Aid I/ or /Advanced Healing I/. Most skills so far have been awards for task completion or first kills.

The reason for this is, I'm guessing, that the more easily acquired skills will be needed to have any sort of chance to complete the dungeon. Humans speaking different languages cannot coordinate well. Strong, large humans with poor cardiovascular health would likely score well on Physical, yet rapidly wear out and fall prey to the constant attacks we've seen.

This suggests other low-hanging fruit may be out there. Swimming is a critically important skill that many humans have little or no experience with. (Humans from arid or impoverished urban environments exemplify this.)

Simply attempting to float in the creek may trigger a new skill such as /Swimming I/. Climbing would be worth a shot, too. Survival in a forest is enormously enhanced by being able to climb out of the reach of large predators, at least those that can't climb or fly.

Another notion that struck me is how brutal things have been on the Earth and Metal aspects. Two of them horribly impaled by rat-elopes, Johanna (Earth) critically injured, David (Metal) flat-out slain. The "goblins" likewise show signs of shrugging off attacks by their own spears (Pole Weapons I is a Wood skill).

These are both Wood-aspected creatures, I'm guessing. That -30% resistance against your destructive element /hurts/! Since they have five days in the first tier, I expect they will cycle through to another element each day. Days 3 and 4 are going to *suck* for our protagonist.

Building even modest fortification from stone, or perhaps a deadfall or two, will probably help a great deal against the current variety of attackers.

Edit: Reverse-engineered Maya's stat gains. She started with Physical: 112, Mental: 135. Two of her skills, /General Fitness II/ and /Pole Weapons I/, are known quantities. After obtaining these, she'd have Physical: 117, Mental: 135. This leaves /Quick Study I/, /Improved Heart I/, /Debuff Immunity I/, and /Quick Reflexes I/ to account for +4 Physical, +2 Mental. Skill list order appears to conform to the order they were acquired, making /Quick Study I/ Maya's first selection - the same one that offered Nathan /Earth Shield I/ and /Wilderness Survival I/, which both came with two stat bumps. I'm guessing:

- /Quick Study I/ grants +1 Physical and +1 Mental, since bonus NPs apply to both stats.

- /Improved Heart I/ should grant +1 Mental. EPs are not derived from Physical.

- /Debuff Immunity I/ seems in line with /Attack Up I/, granting +1 Physical.

- /Quick Reflexes I/ grants +1 Physical, since this is all that's left.

********* Speaking of Skills, you left out Blunt Weapons I.

"While they ate, the blond Aussie told them he'd learned the /Blunt Weapons I/ skill from the battle for using his club. The skill was passive similar to Maya's new /Pole Weapons/ skill, and he'd gotten it even though he hadn't directly fought the tier 1 monster. But since he participated in the battle, it gave him credit for the kill. /Blunt Weapons/ was Earth aligned whereas /Pole Weapons/ was Wood" (Ch. 9).

There are almost certainly other weapon Skills. Using Mr. Rock unfortunately didn't activate Blunt Weapons, meaning that the term weapon doesn't simply refer to any object used to do harm.

Assuming there is a separate skill for swords/knives (Edged Weapons), the players probably couldn't activate it via using a sharpened piece of stone or wood. I expect this kind of skill to exist to fulfill the general Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing Trifecta of Physical Damage common in RPGs. Furthermore, I would expect this hypothetical Edged Weapons skill to be Metal-aligned as the other two skills have been Wood & Metal aligned (solid substances). This is all conjecture, so take my theory-crafting with a grain of salt.

If the damages resistances & weaknesses to elements functions like I think so, than each players should really watch out for their weaknesses out in the field

- Fire is weak to water. Fire-aligned players might be more prone to drowning, cold temperatures, waterborne diseases and damage from water-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Earth is weak to wood. Earth-aligned players might be more prone to plant-based toxins, (*something else?*) and damage from wood-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Metal is weak to fire. Metal-aligned players might be more prone to overheating, severe burns, electricity and damage from fire-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Wood is weak to metal. Wood-aligned players might be more prone to (*I can't think of anything*) and damage from metal-aligned weapons and creatures
- Water is weak to earth. Earth-aligned players might be more prone to damage from falling, Mr. Rock, sand and damage from earth-aligned weapons and creatures.

This all all my head-cannon for now. I hope to read more of the story!

Good catch! Added it in. Fire is adjacent to Wood and Earth, so Maya and Asahi can benefit from both known weapon skills.

I suspect Mr. Rock didn't grant a skill due to Nathan's Earth 0 rating. Johanna used Mr. Rock to kill a rat, but hasn't been forthcoming at all to others about her skills. If her skill list becomes known, we should find out one way or the other.

The goblin pulling out a knife on Nathan supports your suggestion that something like /Edged Weapon I/ skill exists and is Metal-aspected. This would be the weak point for Wood-aspected abductees.

** So while this novel isnt explicitly irrational i cant really say that it is also explicitly rational.

The gameshow type of premise/setup is overdone. It is boring and uninteresting.

It has some incredibly stilted dialogue which i dont usually mind as its a common thing in webnovels it just adds to my annoyance.

as with almost every litrpg ever the characters need to be wisecracks and constantly reference pop culture stuff which also is always annoying in every litrpg novel that it happens in, and it happens in a lot of them. I havent read a lot of it as i got bored around when they met the 3rd or second group of players/participants and david or whoever died . This novel hasnt shown me anything which i could get exited about yet and i probably wont continue it.

Dont get me wrong, i am glad more people are trying to write rational fiction etc and i encourage you to go on but this is just boring for now. Atleast to the chapter i read it, it hasnt shown me anything to qualify it as especially rational so ....

*** Thank you for taking the time to read as much as you did, which sounds like you made it to the 200 page mark. I doubly appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback as well. I admire that you stuck with it so long even though it wasn't working for you.

While I feel my writing is improving dramatically the more I practice, my particular sense of goofy humor will likely continue going forward. Maya's joking dialogue kind of exemplifies my own humor I think. So what you didn't care for will probably continue, aside from improvements to the dialogue and prose as I make more future edits and improve my writing skill.

One character, Asahi, I intentionally gave stilted language as part of his characterization. It's possible I have overdone it, but he was a person who strictly spoke the formal version of Japanese his entire life which the /Language/ skill takes into account when he speaks in English. Most other character's language should sound more casual, so I will look over my dialogue whenever I do edits to improve.

As for the Rational aspects, I am sorry they weren't enough, though I feel there are many there. I will continue to work hard towards adhering to rationality in my writing and hopefully execute it better as I go forward.

** Just caught up and I like what I am seeing. I wish there was more "gacha" moments though where the MC was given multiple options to pick a skill that had the rarities. Feels like im theorycrafting like I am the MC and gets me more engaged.

Also, my only gripe is that the MC and Maya, the obvious heroine, got way too friendly and flirty for the 3 hours they known each other. Hell, she even acting like a cliche "tsundere". But I am ignoring this fact because she has the highest mental stat we have seen and I think she is manipulating the MC to lead him on for her advantage. I mean do complete strangers really act like love birds in the matter of hours? I actually cringed when the MC gave a flower to her even as a joke.

*** Great feedback. Yeah, I like doing the option list. I actually worried that my narrative would become bloated if he's given a choice every time since it takes several paragraphs of him thinking it through. There will be several more option lists I already have in the works.

Thanks for the feedback on Maya and Nathan. No one else has mentioned it to me yet but I think I might agree with you to some extent at least at face value. I once met a girl at a store and our first conversation seemed to click in a similar way and we went out later, but that is only one example I can remember in my whole life. Funnily enough, that memory is where I specifically drew inspiration for the scene. I just re-read the entire chapter and might make some slight edits, making it a bit less flirty in tone and more joking in general.

I like the fact that all the characters are explicitly in the top 10% of humans, it makes the rational-protagonist trope more believable (and the characters more interesting, especially since that's the top 10% by composite average).

*** Hey, thanks for reading and providing some feedback on what you liked. I just posted a new 9k word chapter this morning so you might want to check it out. Currently, I am updating once a week on Wednesdays. I am mostly confident that I can finish book 1 while staying on schedule since I started posting with a huge head-start.

Although, my lead on the current chapter is shrinking each week. So after I finish the first book, I may need to stop posting for a bit so I can get far enough ahead in book 2 to release each chapter on a steady schedule again. I do a lot of backtracking when I write and edit, continuously changing previous chapters as I write the next. So for a web serial format, I have to keep a big lead on the current posting so I have room to make adjustments.

**** Hey, really enjoying your work. As someone who's started and stopped more stories and different accounts than i'm comfortable admitting, It's great to see the confidence you're approaching this with.

If I may ask, what is your writing style? Are you more of a discovery writer (Gardner) or do you plan things out as much as possible (Architect)? Of course, one is likely more conducive to rational fiction, but I think it would be interesting to hear from someone who is actually putting out content.

Also, after reading the latest chapter, I really appreciate that the LitRPG elements aren't force-fed all at once compared to some others in the genre. The gradual pace of learning skills now seems much more sustainable and a lot more manageable for the audience to take in.

Good luck in the future.

***** I am a discovery writer, which honestly surprised me. I am very organized and detail oriented in my professional life, so when I started writing, I assumed I would write that way too.

For a rational story, I needed characters who were real people. I wanted the plot to be based on these character's actions and reactions. So I started with the characters. Brainstorming characters wasn't too bad for me, I made up a character sheet for each with their background, stats, personality traits, etc. and tried to imagine how they would react to a life and death situation. Most of the rational traits of my story stem from this process I think.

After forming my characters, I tried to make an outline. I wasted a lot of time with not much result. Predicting what characters would do scene to scene was difficult for me since a lot of the subsequent scenes are based on how the characters act. Finally, I figured I should just try writing something instead. I had an idea for a challenge in my head (the moving rock wall challenge), so I put the characters in the challenge and wrote to see what happened based on how the characters might act. I ended up writing 100k words after that.

The story had a lot of issues, but at least I got my ideas on paper. My game system needed a little work as well so I made sure my spreadsheet was fleshed out. Having written a lot already, I had a better idea of what worked and didn't. So I went back and completely re-wrote the story from scratch using the improved game system. I basically *used my first draft as an extremely detailed outline* for the re-written story.

*** Sorry if it bothered you. Based on some other feedback, I have been working on an edit of chapter one and will probably remove one of the vomits which should make it a bit less overwhelming.

Couple slight spoilers (on mobile so can't spoiler tag):

I wanted to show what would happen if a random person was forced into a crazy situation hence the vomit in the beginning.

It gets better, although there are two other places in book one where he vomits, in both cases in regards to a weak stomach while performing a medical procedure.

The main character starts the story with a couple anxieties, one concerning the sight of blood and he is later forced to confront this fear. One way I show the changes to him is how the mental improvements he receives make it more manageable. For instance, the second time he teleports, he is proud that he doesn't get sick.

  Why rational genre...
#+end_quote

I enjoy reading Rational Fiction, and I like that it is a genre defined by the structure of a story as opposed to the setting (i.e. Fantasy). When I decided to write my own book, adhering to rational aspects wasn't so much a decision as it was a given.

#+begin_quote
  Why... only five affinities?
#+end_quote

For the game system, I decided to go for depth instead of width when I chose the number of affinities. As of current chapter 11, the players are only scratching the surface of what is possible. The lack of a proper tutorial means that the vast majority of it is yet to be discovered.

#+begin_quote
  I think its seriously severing possibilities even in fights, i'm not even talking about personalities?
#+end_quote

Fights currently are awkward, quick, and brutal. But they will evolve dramatically as the series progresses. I intend to introduce many skills that require teamwork to be effective, so I think you will find battles to be quite intricate by the time I near the end.

**** i'm always thought, if you have a rational world but you need for the sake of your book use some fantastic element, isn't it weird to have limitations? I mean, you want a book about real peoples with unusual circumstanses. And they have some affinities to fire or to water. Okay, i can get it. But for the sake of realism isn't it weird to have weaknesses imbedded into system? People can be smart or not-so, or people can be weak to some type of gender for example. But weaknesses imbedded into system? Weird choice.\\

***** rational + magic does not have to equal "broken system Our Hero (and perhaps his primary antagonist, but certainly not the common masses of cannon fodder) can munchkin to victory with their Superior Brain." In fact, I'd argue that it /shouldn't/ mean that most of the time. Forgive the presumption but reading between the lines and based on common trends in rational fics, that seems to be the sort of thing you're arguing for.

Side note, didn't downvote because I see literally no reason besides "I disagree with this opinion!" which is /not how downvoting is supposed to work./ You downvote nonsense posts that contribute nothing or that you believe are made in bad faith, you challenge opinions you just disagree with or consider not properly thought-out or justified.

***** No worries, thanks for your interest. :)

Elemental affinities are handled a little differently in my series than common tropes of them. Even though there are only Five Energies, they are quite a bit broader and more fluid than their names imply since literally everything in the universe is encompassed by the five. I'll include a few snippets of text from chapter 3 where some of it is discussed, although it is elaborated in much more depth elsewhere. This is a very mild spoiler:

“What about Air, isn't that an element?” 

“Air is part of all the elements, but not one of the main five energies of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal."

"The elements can act as forces of energy just as easily as they might correlate to material components.  For example, Wood is the energy that feeds Fire, which could simply manifest as a physical object like firewood.  The Wood element could also take the form of oxygen in the air that the fire needs to continue its chemical reaction to grow.  Air is but a generic term for matter in a gaseous state and all matter can become a gas if you make it hot enough. So the air is a part of the elements, but by itself not one of the Five.”

Johanna was scowling at the Guide's explanation.  “So you're saying the Wood element is air? That makes no sense.”

Asahi turned and answered instead.  “If I'm understanding correctly, it can be at times when it takes that form. The elements are energies in a constant state of interaction and flux with one another.”
