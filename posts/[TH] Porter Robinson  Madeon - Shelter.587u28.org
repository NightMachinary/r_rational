** From the video's description: Shelter tells the story of Rin, a 17-year-old girl who lives her life inside of a futuristic simulation completely by herself in infinite, beautiful loneliness. Each day, Rin awakens in virtual reality and uses a tablet which controls the simulation to create a new, different, beautiful world for herself. Until one day, everything changes, and Rin comes to learn the true origins behind her life inside a simulation.

The letter that flashes on screen for a moment:

  To Rin

  From : Dad

  There was just so little time left after you were born.

  I don't know how much love I managed to pour into raising you after your mother died...

  But your smile kept me going. (^{_^{)}}

  I would like to have come with you, but I couldn't.

  I wanted you to forget everything and move on... I knew you'd be alright.

  But you'll get lonely, and remember.

  I know you'll grow strong, and read this letter some day.

  I really wish we could have spent more time together. I'm sorry.

  You were so young back then, too young to understand what they meant. So let me repeat...

  My final words to you.

  凛へ

  From : 父

  キミが生まれてから、あまりにも時間がなさすぎた。

  お母さんがなくなってからキミにどれだけの愛情をそそげただろうか・・・。

  父さんは元気なキミをみて勇気づけられたよ(^{_^{)}}

  本当は一緒に行ければよかったんだけど、それは出来なかった。

  全部忘れて進んで欲しいと思ったんだ・・・ キミなら大丈夫だって。

  さびしさを知ってしまって、思い出すだろう。

  キミが強くなってこの文を読んでくれると信じて。

  もっとたくさんの思い出を作れればよよかったね。 ごめんよ。

  小さい時はよくわからなかったと思うけど、今ならきっと。

  あの日の言葉をもう一度。

*** If you enjoyed this, consider looking at some of Porter Robinsons stuff.

I think a lot of the story elements came from him, he has a thing for fake worlds and simulation.

** Ok, so...question: is this a trailer for a longer film? Or was this a film in and of itself? I imagine it's the latter, but it seemed as if there was potential for further development.

** It's a nice video, but how is it rational?

To summarize the plot: The girl is alone in a world she remakes for herself every day. She gets lonely but eventually remembers how she came to be there (super-science father sent her away in an escape pod during the apocalypse). She comes to the conclusion that she shouldn't forget again because the memories make her stronger.

However: The girl is not shown using rationalist methods to discover her situation or come to these conclusions. One day she starts to remember things, and /stuff just happens to her/. Furthermore, she isn't shown using her newfound knowledge to actually do anything. For example, she doesn't try to verify her situation or even figure out if there are any other survivors.

This is a story in which things happen to the protagonist, but the protagonist isn't seen taking any actions towards driving the plot. I don't think it belongs in this sub.

*** The rationalist part could just be describing her father. It was he who programmed the computer to send her his message once she was old enough to understand its meaning. The girl isn't really able to do anything with her new knowledge such as figure out if there are other survivors because she is in a coma.
