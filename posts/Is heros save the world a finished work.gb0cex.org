It has 5 arcs for what appearances to be a large scope story, so I imagine the writer is on indefinite hiatus. Or is the wordpress site just not up to some other posting place?


** Indefinite hiatus. I was terribly sick, my landlord was quite likely connected to Ukrainian organized crime and was as nice to live with as you might expect from that, and shortly after publishing the last chapter, I was homeless for a semester and trying to not let that or my migraines affect my grades.

And ever since then, I don't know, picking the story up again has felt like a monumental challenge. It's 20% done, it was spinning out of control by the time that I set it down, and I'm not sure whether it was actually /good/ vs. "it had some individual components which were good."

*** Best wishes to you; it sounds like you've been going through it, and I hope that things are going alright now (or if not, that they soon will be).

**** Completely lost track of this thread, but I wanted to make sure I said that things are going much better for me now, since "Person says they've gone through some shit, then disappears" is usually a worrying sign lol.

Thank you for your concern.

For whatever the word of an internet stranger is worth, I thought it was excellent.

I hope things are improving for you.
