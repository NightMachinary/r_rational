Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** Luminosity: If you aren't interested in romance / character relationships as a focus, you probably won't love this. I personally loved it overall. There were some really interesting ideas and it was pretty well done overall. However, the sequels were ... disappointing.

In particular, related work Effulgence was overall not worth the amount of time I spent reading. Effulgence in particular starts off with some strong and interesting ideas and a unique format (glowfic) - they're written through roleplaying between two different authors. The format works really well in allowing 'cute' dialogue and adorable romance back-and-forth between characters. But the fact that neither of the two authors seem to be noticeably in control of the plot lead to a plot that gets pretty out of control and derails and becomes way less interesting than it's potential starts out seeming. The derailing of an interesting setup into shitty mediocrity happens repeatedly. Basically, it's all full of set-up and great ideas and no follow-through or committment to those ideas. In the end, it's millions of words that never really reach a tenth of the potential that you hope for, as intriguing set-up after intriguing set-up are always let down and deflate rather than reaching a climax.

oh wow, TIL that's what glowfic means.

That's actually how a great deal of my on-again off-again vampire romance story is written, but I edit it extremely heavily after the fact and we'll often retcon a few lines of dialogue if we don't like where the story is going. It sounds... irresponsible for an author not to do that ? (That said, it makes the whole process take a FANTASTICALLY LONG TIME, so you know).

It's a difficult call to make. The first part, /Luminosity/, and the second part, /Radiance/, have different narrators, but they tell one long story. Once you finish /Luminosity/, you may find yourself wanting to read /Radiance/ just to find out how the story ends. (Personally, I agree that /Radiance/ is not as strong as /Luminosity/, but I still think that it is worth reading.)

On the other hand, the third part, /Flashes/, is a collection of short stories set in the same universe and is entirely optional.

*** Since Alicorn's stuff is obvious, I'll plug The Steerswoman's Road series. Basically it's nice family-friendly enlightenment evangelism up until the book The Lost Steersman, which is a really really good sci-fi book that's preeetty emotionally draining.

For non-Anglo cultures, it's a pretty high percentage, even for English language works. On the other hand, maybe you don't want to count Jorge Luis Borges or people from Norway? Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is probably "other" enough, though, so let's go with that.

Unfortunately I don't believe I've read that "high percentage" - or if I did, it's not been a high percentage of what I remember. I mostly remember American, British, and Australian writers. Even though Ted Chiang is American, his works are full of really diverse influences, and I really enjoy that, so I was hoping for more diverse influences which will create very different stories than I'm used to (e.g. Three Body Problem).

I will investigate the ones you mentioned, thank you!

***** u/Charlie___:
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It just means that it promotes the values of the enlightenment. The first two books are books for teens that have a story where intellectual curiosity is good, humans are fundamentally similar to each other rather than foreigners being other, science is cool, etc etc etc.

Just like a book where characters resolve their problems by faith might be considered religious evangelism, a book where characters resolve their problems by curiosity and inquiry might be considered enlightenment evangelism, especially when that book is accessible to kids.

And yeah, if you haven't read Borges, read Borges, just for the sake of quality. I think that if you want "diverse influences," where someone is born is an informative but imperfect indicator, and you might want to narrow your search in other ways first (like maybe you want something on the standards of Ted Chiang's work, in which case you narrow your search a lot faster by looking for literary quality first and /then/ reading short summaries or snippets, and maybe never needing to ask where someone's from - this point actually doesn't apply to gender IMO, which is such a cheap thing to find out that it's almost always worth taking into account when estimating idea diversity).

As far as anime goes, I'd say it's still beaten in rationality by Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Fate/Zero, and Attack on Titan, since it still has a bunch of nonsense tropes that those three are better at avoiding. Probably the most rationalist shounen I've watched would be the first arc of Zetsuen no Tempest.

I liked the emotionless calculating SI that we saw the first couple of chapters and the interactions with the mage who approached the SI wanting his star essence.

It's pretty weird. Normal people don't just latch onto the first person they come across when they're feeling adrift and lacking in attachments, unless they're feeling vulnerable and looking for security, which isn't your SI's problem. They're liable to be dragged along for lack of anything better to do, but not immediately get emotionally invested.

I'm not one of the people who dropped the story, but it definitely stood out as really weird to me.

*** Interesting. I'm looking forward to more. Bit confused about how he was injured by Doomsday now, but I suppose 'I cast Punch' has always been weirdly powerful in DC. If Wotan is similar to the one in young justice him getting unlimited power isn't a great thing. I did think he was a fun character so far, and kinda hope he isn't super evil.

I would definitely enjoy him exploring the villainous side of DC verse a bit. I feel like powerful SI's in particular have difficulty with that side of things. Sometimes the justifications are just highly inadequate, or the heroes are evil dumbledored, or the SI is just cruel and impossible to empathize with. JL all seem in character so far though, and your SI is sane and has a very good reason to be wary of them.

*** Yeah, a lot of series struggle with that. Especially when someone makes a trilogy of fantasy books where by the end the main characters are literally at the level of being godkillers, and then they decide to make a second trilogy about the same characters and they're just so absurdly overpowered there's not even any real conflict or danger, you just get silly "the 10 most powerful people in the world, some of whom could wreck continents with a thought, trying to quietly sneak past two guards" situations with no real drama. (David Eddings books can be especially silly that way, and I can't recommend them for that reason.)

There are a number of well written fantasy series and webnovels where the main characters end up absurdly powerful, but they usually do that by having the bad guys be even /more/ powerful to maintain a sense of conflict. (Things like Wheel of Time for example.)

If you want a good story about a character who's actually too overpowered for his own setting, then I really can't think of many, that's really hard to do and maintain a sense of conflict and suspension of disbelief, other than maybe some old Superman stories.

It's a major part of the setting that when our protagonist goes to monster hunter school, she learns that the monster hunters permanently gain abilities from the monsters they defeat.

The immediate consequences are explored: the first thing they have you do at monster hunter school is kill a small monster that consistently grants regeneration, elder monster hunters are terrifying with collections of unique abilities, etc.

If you like it, there's a lot of it and it's ongoing with frequent updates.

***** RA has mixed text and images sections. See [[http://romanticallyapocalyptic.com/0-1]]

​

If that it isn't it then I don't understand what you can be looking for. I'm not familiar with Dinotopia. You can either make the text on on the images or separate from them. If the text is on the images then it needs to scale and shift alongside the image to make sure it stays in its allocated space and doesn't obscure the rest of the image or cause alignment problems. This means that mobile users will need to shift and zoom in to view text.

If the text is separate from the images then it can be resized separately so it is still visible at mobile size when the images are shrunk. It results in a layout that consists of alternating image and text sections like in the linked RA page.

*** Edited to add: The "illustrated script" format of the conclusion of Cucumber Quest chapter 5 [[http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/important-announcement/]] is what I'm currently considering. Maybe a bit more prose than script.
