I saw an interesting example of the "art form [of] manipulating others by letting them be dominant over you" last night, in the film "Crazy Rich Asians". For those who haven't seen it, it's a romantic comedy: girl goes with her boyfriend to his homeland of Singapore for a friend's wedding, and she then learns that his family is upper-class rich. And his mother and grandmother, and a variety of other family members, don't approve of her.

The part that caught my eye was near the end. The girl meets with the mother, after turning down the boyfriend's proposal, and informs her that she did it so he wouldn't be cut off from his family, and that someday, when he finds a girl the mother approves of, the mother will know that she owes it all to the poor American girl raised by a single mother. And, of course, the mother eventually relents and gives her blessing for them to marry, whether just to avoid this happening, or because the tactic gained her respect.

Are there more good examples of this type of manipulation through submission?


** It's important to note that while Crazy Rich Asians is set in Singapore, the culture (and people) it depicts are Chinese. (The protagonist is a first-generation Chinese-American immigrant, and her boyfriend's family moved from Beijing to Singapore one generation ago.)

As a story about Chinese people, Crazy Rich Asians is deeply concerned with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept)#Chinese_%E8%87%89%E9%9D%A2_and_%E9%9D%A2%E5%AD%90][the sociological concept of "face"]] (as in, "saving face"), which is something that is omnipresent in social interaction in China (and many other eastern cultures). Of course, it's something that comes up in western culture as well, an example being the idea of giving someone "an out," and why certain people are often "asked to resign" rather than being fired: it gives the illusion that they were a voluntary participant in the process (and thus had some agency in the process), rather than being kicked out against their will.

As an example of "face" and "offering an out" from western media, this famous scene from Game of Thrones:

*Tywin*: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.

*Joffrey*: I'm not tired.

*Cersei*: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.

*Tywin*: Grandmaester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.

*Joffrey*: I'm NOT TIRED!

When Tywin says, "the king is tired, see him to his chambers," the subtext is, "Although Joffrey is king, I am the one who is truly in control of this situation. I could demand that he be removed from this chamber, but that would ruin the illusion of power we've created for Joffrey. Let us weave a fake story about why Joffrey is being removed from this room so that we may continue to pretend that Joffrey is the one in power, even though I am the one in control."

It would be humiliating for Joffrey to be escorted out forcefully, so saying "the king is tired" is a way for Joffrey to "save face." When Joffrey says, "I'm not tired," he's mistaking his figurehead status for real power. And, in attempting to seize on to real power, Joffrey loses what little dignity he had remaining.

But that's a little bit different from what you are asking for, because here, Tywin is only giving up the /appearance/ of power (an offer which Joffrey refuses); he's not actually prostrating himself before the child king.

The Ender's Shadow series is full of lovely little stories about power dynamics, and much of the story is set in various locales throughout Asia (including China, India, and Thailand). In the second book in the series (Shadow of the Hegemon), our protagonist Bean and his former (and now present) colleague Suriyawong are tasked with training an elite group of soldiers. Certain figures begin conspiring against Bean, and after Bean survives an attempt on his life, the following scene happens:

Bean strode forward and spoke in his not-bad Thai. “Sir,” he said, “I believe Suriyawong and I are safer here with these loyal troops than we would be anywhere else in Bangkok.”

The Prime Minister looked at the soldiers standing, fully armed, at attention. “So someone has a private army right in the middle of this base,” he said.

“I did not make my meaning clear,” said Bean. “These soldiers are absolutely loyal to you. They are yours to command, because you are Thailand at this moment, sir.”

The Prime Minister bowed, very slightly, and turned to the soldiers. “Then I order you to arrest this foreigner.”

Immediately Bean's arms were gripped by the soldiers nearest to him, as another soldier patted him down for weapons.

Suriyawong's eyes widened, but he gave no other sign of surprise.

The Prime Minister smiled. “You may release him now,” he said. “The Chakri warned me, before he took his voluntary leave of absence, that these soldiers had been corrupted and were no longer loyal to Thailand. I see now that he was misinformed.

In this case, Bean "wins" the moment that his soldiers demonstrate their loyalty to the PM, to the point that they're willing to arrest Bean: it proves to the PM that Bean (and his soldiers) are loyal to Thailand, and that Bean's political rival was spreading lies about Bean's divided loyalties. Also, in another round of "saving face," the PM refers to the Chakri taking a "voluntary leave of absence." As you might surmise, this leave of absence was not exactly "voluntary."

*** The broader point notwithstanding, I recently learned that nightshade is the basis of the anticholinergic drug atropine, and would most certainly not make Joffrey sleepy or sedate. In fact, it'd make him anxious and irritable. Along with a whole host of other mostly unpleasant effects. Happily for Sansa, it might also make it difficult to get an erection.

Other than that, the drug would basically make him an even bigger asshole than he already is, doubly so because he'd feel terrible. I think that's kinda funny.

*** This example is complex...but there are simpler ones.

The simpler version is to just appear polite and pleasant when others in authority are around while maneuvering your opponent into over-the-top bullying (in front of an audience). Arrange to be the "good guy" and make it look like your opponent is kicking a puppy.

And I know some people IRL who's passive aggressiveness had those around them living in fear.

**** There was a Spider-man comic, iirc, where the Green Goblin provoked Peter into following him to his office and beating him up there - surrounded by security cameras. Similar idea.

It's more of manipulating everyone else, though, rather than the more complex form of actually manipulating the person you're submitting to.

I suppose gaslighting can be a dark form of it, depending on how subtle vs aggressive the perpetrator is.

*** It makes more sense given the full context of the story. (Spoilers, basically explaining the entire social dynamic that drives the plot of Crazy Rich Asians):

For one thing, if the mother (Eleanor) decided to get rid of the protagonist (Rachel) as you describe, it would not be a "win" for her: she and the entire family would have egg on their face for even /allowing/ Rachel to get close to the family. More importantly, Eleanor's son (Nick) would likely resent her for the rest of his life: Nick already made it clear that he was willing to leave the family dynasty behind to be with Rachel in America, and if Rachel breaks up with Nick and leaves the country, there's a good chance that he will conclude, "Oh, my mother forced the love of my life to leave me." (Even though this conclusion would be wrong, it would be the most likely conclusion for him to draw.)

So, there are significant downsides to getting rid of Rachel: Eleanor's entire motivation is to keep the family together and respectable, and she wants her golden boy Nick back in the fold: a lifetime of stewing resentment from Nick would be a deep and heavy cost to pay in order to preserve the family honor.

Now, consider the value proposition that Rachel lays out: by voluntarily leaving the country, Rachel allows the family to keep their honor. She says, in effect, "I'm willing to allow the love of my life to marry another woman so that he (and his family) can keep their honor." This is a critical piece of the puzzle, because throughout the entire film, Eleanor's main concern is that Rachel is a social climber or a gold digger who is trying to connive her way into the family's riches (or, equally bad, a naive girl who would value Nick's love over the Young family's honor). When Rachel says, "I value the honor of your family above the life that I could have together with Nick," she demonstrates that /she has the exact same value system as Eleanor/: Rachel is willing to make personal sacrifices to preserve the honor of the Young family. (And on top of all that, not only does she value preserving the honor of the Young family, she's demonstrating that she's savvy enough to know how to do it, as she has many times throughout the film.) That is exactly what Eleanor would want from a daughter-in-law!

Also, there is also the fact that it's been made clear many times throughout the movie that if Rachel wanted to, she could say, "I'll disappear if you write me a big check." The fact that she's not asking for money here should assuage any fears Eleanor might have had that Rachel is looking for a payday.

Now, Rachel's position is still fraught: she is from a "lesser" family, and her legacy is not one that will improve the lot of the Young family. All that Rachel has demonstrated is that she has the values (and is willing to make the sacrifices) that are demanded of the Young family. However, all of this is also largely true of Eleanor: Eleanor herself married into the Young family, and throughout the film we see scenes of Eleanor judging and appraising Rachel, perhaps seeing a younger version of herself, and hoping that Rachel is not as naive as she appears to be.

So, when Rachel says to Eleanor, "fine, I'll go back to American and never bother your family ever again," she's really giving Eleanor two options: you can either let me leave and spend the rest of your life with a son who resents you, or you can let me into the family and I'll be the daughter-in-law of your dreams: someone who values upholding the family honor above all else, someone who's willing to do whatever it takes to uphold that honor, and someone who has the guile to do it.

***** Eleanor was already well aware that Nick would resent her when she rejected Rachel from the family the first time; that much has already been priced in. Rachel's persuasive method is more carrot and less stick.

If the "stick" side of the equation has changed at all, it would mostly be based on changing Eleanor's belief from "I'm doing this for Nick's own good, Rachel is a bad woman and one day he'll see that, meet someone who's better for him, and forgive me for rejecting Rachel" to realizing, "Rachel is the real deal; she's willing to place Nick's honor and family above her own interests and she's got the wit and gumption to back it up, Nick is actually unlikely to find another woman like her."

****** Nice comment, but don't forget an additional factor: Nick proposed /after/ the initial rejection, and with the offer of simply walking away from his family, and Rachel turned him down. Rachel had thus unequivocally held the power; she could have said yes and wrecked all his mother's hopes right there. By not doing so, she placed his mother much more firmly in her debt.

***** Well, the point of this kind of manipulation is still to ultimately win, in the sense that you achieve your goals, isn't it?

However, your paraphrase has altered an important point. You phrased it as "give me...or else," a demand for dominance. Rachel, on the other hand, was /already choosing/ the "or else". She just turned up to announce that she was leaving - "You win, because I let you" - and the ball was in the other court. Thus her ultimate victory is the more compelling, because her future mother-in-law had to actively intervene to reverse her decision.

** I'm attempting to write a ratfic around Miraculous Ladybug right now, and it starts with a victory through surrender:

Hawkmoth, canonically the villain, has been trying to steal the mcguffins of the teenage heroes Ladybug and Chat Noir for years. Unbeknownst to everyone, he needs them to save his wife, who is comatose and dying. He has had a growing suspicion that his son is Chat Noir. He surrenders in chapter one. No powers any more, no minions (???), and a serious offer to go to jail for his crimes.

He does, however, paint a heart wrenching picture of how he would do anything for his tragically dying wife, and begs the heroes to spare his son.

There is no way Chat Noir would ever betray Ladybug and ally himself with Hawkmoth, and Hawkmoth has repeatedly failed to take the McGuffins by force. So Hawkmoth doesn't ask for an alliance, or the McGuffins. But to save his dying mom, and if he thinks it's his own idea and he has Ladybug's approval....

*** That seems like it's less victory through surrender and more like victory through allying with people who have common goals. Obviously the heroes would want to save his tragically dying wife, and he was an idiot for not thinking of asking them for help in canon. Though I suppose that's risky, since it's difficult to ask for help without revealing who he is.

** A not-so-serious example in the sitcom Brooklyn 99. In season 3, episode 19, Charles Boyle (who avoids confrontations and lacks self confidence) offers to host a colleague, Pimento, at his home after said colleague have been thrown out of his apartment. Pimento is a horrible house guest and shows no signs of planning to leave soon, and Boyle is too meek to confront him about it.

His (extremely assertive) colleague Gina tries to push him to be more dominant, "alpha", and confront Pimento, while Boyle insist he is a "beta", and that "alpha" Pimento will take mercy on him if he's subservient enough. Boyle tries to confront Pimento and fails several times, until his failures spur Gina to confront Pimento on his behalf. She is successful, and gloats about solving problems by being an alpha. Boyle in return asks whether he didn't win by being a beta, acting so weak that Gina as an alpha took mercy on him and intervened.

** The best IRL example I can think of of this is the Enigma cypher, where the Allies let certain Axis attacks (that they knew about and could have avoided) happen to keep the Axis believing that Enigma was secure.

The best fictional example would be the ST:DS9 episode "Our Man Bashir" which ends with Bashir letting the supervillain enact his plan to destroy the world, as Bashir really didn't care how the story ended as long as everyone lived long enough to sort out the holosuite malfunction.

All in all, though, this seems to fall into the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin][I Let You Win]] / [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureGambit][Failure Gambit]] tropes (and the Crazy Rich Asians example is even mentioned in the former).

That's not really winning through not being dominant, that's winning through letting the clock run down. All Bashir had to do was keep all the relevant characters alive until the rest of the crew of DS9 could interface the station's computer with the /Defiant/'s transporters. He never submitted to the Sisko villain, but rather pretended to have been swayed to the villain's side.

If you pretend you didn't hear it and ask them to repeat it, they'll sound like an asshole instead.. So they'll generally just let it go.
