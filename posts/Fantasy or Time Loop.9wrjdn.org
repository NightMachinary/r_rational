I'm looking for Fantasy and/or Time Loop stories (preferably time loop, but didn't want to make two threads). I don't have requirements per se, but I do have preferences:

1. I dislike overpowered protagonists: OP protagonists are very hard to do in a way that there is /meaningful/ conflict (which is important for my enjoyment of a story). Overpowered is relative, and a protagonist can be able to bust planets as long as the antagonists are up to par.\\
2. Sane cast: The cast of the story should be sensible characters with organic motivations and characterisations. They should be reasonably competent (I dislike plot and character induced stupidity) at what they do.\\
3. I read fanfiction of only some franchises, and since I expect fanfic recommendations franchises I think might be recommended but which I don't read (Harry Potter, My Little Pony, DC/Marvel, Transformers, Animorphs).\\
4. I generally like prefer rational fiction, but it's not a requirement.\\
5. I have other preferences I would decline from mentioning as I expect them to receive negative feedback.\\

Time Loop books I('ve) read:

- Mother of Learning.\\
- Utsuko Hako to Zero no Maria.\\

Time Loop books I'm aware of but haven't read:\\
* Time Braid.

The above is off the top of my head.

All assistance is appreciated.


** Have you watched Primer? In my opinion it's the best time travel movie ever made, possibly the best time travel media of any kind. Go in without reading anything about it, then read as much as you can after.

As far as fantasy, have you read Brandon Sanderson? His characters are extraordinary, and many of them act rationally in the exploration/exploitation of their powers. Definitely not rationalist, but generally well-regarded on this sub. His worldbuilding & magic systems are also consistently brilliant. Start with Mistborn.

**** Primer is a movie only, but it is an indie movie that was made on a super tight budget (the director is also one of the main characters, and they shot on film offcuts from other projects, etc). Added to that, they use the medium of a movie really well and I don't think it would be close to the same with a novelisation.

Invite some friends over and watch it! Puzzling out the plot together is a great activity.

**** I gotta say I think that's a crazy attitude about movies! There are so many amazing films out there that limiting yourself to what's in cinemas or what your friends want to watch is a huge waste.

You're entitled to your opinions and I don't think downvoting you was necessary, but that's an awfully restrictive mindset.

********* Even curated, I often find movies tedious relatives to books and video games. I think you can kind of model these 3 media on a spectrum of activity. Books allow for a lot of introspection and narration of the sort that's difficult to fit in other genres. Video games allow for a degree of agency and audience participation that's totally unmatched. But movies sit in between the two, and so they're not as good at delivering a spectacular in some respect experience. They do have an advantage in revealing visually spectacular predefined stories of the sort that video games can't always deal with, and there are definitely movies I love, but overall I devote a lot more of my time to the other 2.

** Time Travel:

- I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] quite a bit. The characters quickly become unbalanced, but it's slightly mitigated because their opponents tend to attack them in ways that bypass their defenses. The fic does contain some sex scenes, though not in a way that bothered me.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] is a short (16 chapters + epilogue) terminator fic.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10017610/1/The-Dangers-of-Foresight][Dangers of Foresight]] is a Star Wars fic. There's a prequel, but it's not a must-read before starting with Foresight.

Fantasy:

- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] is not a time travel fic, but it contains many of the same elements of incremental growth that you find in time travel fics. I've never read a fic that was this detailed in describing how its technology works.

** I know you've said you don't read My Little Pony fanfiction, but I'd heartily recommend [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever]] anyway. It's my favourite MLP fic, exactly what you're looking for, and doesn't require knowledge of the series. If you do like it I have more MLP time loop stories to recommend, but The Best Night Ever is the best one in my opinion.

Not a book, but if you haven't seen Groundhog Day you should see it too. I know you said you don't watch movies, but Groundhog Day is /the/ definitive time loop story and all around great.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/]] is ASOIAF time loop story, I haven't read it yet myself but I've heard it's good.

**** [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][/Hard Reset 2/]] is even better than the Eakin novels. The original /Hard Reset/ only has one trick; iterate until you solve the problem, then move on to the next problem. /Hard Reset 2/ is more complex because there are additional time travelers, so the fic also deals with cooperation and combat between loopers. Shame it is dead.

This is pretty comprehensive of all the pony time loop stories if you want to dig through it yourself, sorting by rating helps a lot. [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/198605/timeloop-stories]]

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset]] This is the one you were looking for, another person who replied to me actually brought it up. This one is probably the only one besides the first I recommended that extremely well known in the MLP fiction community. It has several sequels and side stories, you can look through the author's stories page for them, they should also be linked in the authors notes somewhere. I also recommend the author a lot if you want to venture into more pony fics besides time loops, he's one of the best.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder]] This is a fanfic of the first Hard Reset fanfic. It's really good but very unlikely to ever be finished.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/160710/moments]] I enjoyed this one a lot. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/269107/the-only-day]] This one is real good too. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/294745/tick]] I liked this one too. It's dark.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops]] This one is massive, 2.2 million words, longer than Worm. Not /that/ good in my opinion but if you really like long stuff worth looking at.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/180134/ponies-on-a-monorail]] This one is decent. I read it ages ago and I just vaguely remember liking it, so it's probably not trash.

** Replay, by Ken Grimwood, has a kind-of-sort-of time loop going on. The main character has a heart attack at 43 and wakes up in his 18 year old body. He uses his knowledge of the future to get rich, live an awesome life, and then has a heart attack at 43 and dies again. He wakes up in his 18 year old body once more, but a few days later this time. I won't go into more detail because I'd have to basically spoil the whole book, but it's pretty cool.

** Generally I would recommend royalroadl.com as a place to look. There are some fics you could enjoy.

Metaworld chronicles is one of my favorites atm. It is basically modern fantasy with our world but with magic. Main character is transported there in her younger body. She becomes steadily stronger but is nowhere near the top. There are uncounted stronger oppositions. It plays mostly in magic Sydney.

If you don't mind litrpg you could read threadbare main character is a sentient golem made out of a teddy bear. It is better than it sounds. And don't let you turn of because of "supposedly" stereotypical evil characters.

A goblins teeth is very popular. Great read and very funny. Told from the view of a goblin that gets captured by bandits.
