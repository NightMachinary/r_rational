** This series is more progression fantasy than rational, but it has its moments. The gist of it is that the main character becomes a vampire, except he's a special one with magic. The overpowered abilities the main character has are generally used to their logical extent, even if it takes five whole books for that to happen. There's a shift that happens, where the story goes from the personal level all the way up to civilization-building.

Includes:\\
---Portals across the multiverse\\
---Apocalypse worlds\\
---Mild civilization uplift\\
---Munchkinning, and simultaneously,\\
---A frustrating lack of munchkinning\\
---AI, eventually\\
---Long books, with nice, high word counts\\
---A good fun read

The sixth book recently came out and isn't on the linked list for some reason, and the author's website is even more out of date. If you want to try the series but aren't sure you want to commit money to it, PM me and I'll set you up.

*** Tried these. The main character is given too much, too fast. He also discards obvious strategic and tactical considerations, like relocating his base of operations and making more flexible use of his finances. Not the worst progression fantasy I've seen, but I've also seen a lot better.

***** Sure. Warning that I like my progression fantasies to require more work, setback, etc. Though again, haven't read this whole series, so maybe later books look more like that.

If you want urban fantasy, Dresden Files is probably the only thing that fits the bill.

For universe-hopping supernatural nobles, I'd recommend Zelazny's Amber series, at least the first five books but possibly also the whole series.

Another really decent universe-hopping (eventually) and well written progression story is the World of Prime series, which just concluded this year.

Probably not my top recommendation here, but you might enjoy the Daniel Black series. Another wizard empire builder situation.

Two progression-oriented web fictions that are recently popular:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]], portal fantasy where the MC doesn't get a special leg up.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] , MC is a giant ant, magic and colony building.

****** There is indeed more of that in the later books, to the extent that his entire home base is eliminated, and a world is destroyed.

Dresden Files is awesome, I second that recommendation.

Haven't heard of the Amber series, I'll check it out. Same for World of Prime and Daniel Black.

Delve is good, but when I checked out this Chrysalis I found the writing way too ... anime? Over exaggerated everything, too many exclamation points, that sort of thing. Does the writing get better?

You're in for a treat.

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether "For a Breath I Tarry" by Zelazny is rational?

******* Yes and no. The story expands and feels a little more grounded after awhile. The prose is also probably a little better later in the story. It still generally has that frenentic feel, though.

#+end_quote

I'm confused by this complaint.

He literally places his base of operations in a post-apocalyptic world where he can salvage the resources of an advanced technological civilization and no one except one person (who he trusts with his life) even knows of the world's existence. How can he do any better at placing his base of operations/lair?

Furthermore, flexible use of finances? He scans worlds for anything he might need and gets materials and highly advanced technological resources from alternative worlds. What is he missing from that?

***** Sorry, didn't read the whole series. I was referring to the first book. Taking the inquisitor people seriously and regrouping until he has his new situation figured out would have been the sensible thing to do, instead he camps out in his manor house where they know he is.

Sounds like he gets handed a lot more stuff, though, ha.

Eh...he gets incredible advantages, but there's a saying that Eliezer Yudkowsky posted somewhere which is very good summation for this series.

#+begin_quote
  If you give Frodo a lightsaber, then Sauron gets a Deathstar.
#+end_quote

Whenever he gets anything that he didn't personally work long and hard for, then he's usually facing some crazily overpowered and deadly enemy as a result. He's generally going through a two steps forward, one step back process. Easy power-ups are always causing problems for him for a long time afterwards.

The bit about the inquisitor is true, but I felt like it was more due to him being overconfident in his new-found abilities as a vampire against mortals and the fact that he literally has no way to find them except for letting them attack him. And the fact that the manor was his best spot to prepare for them. But it /is/ a mistake and narratively he is punished for that by losing Sasha.

******* That's fair. In general I'm OK with power being balanced by threatening threats. In Worth the Candle, for example, the MC is quite powerful but the world has some over-the-top threats. It did feel like too much, too fast in this case, though, at least as far as I read.

** I'm not a fan of series where the main character does a bunch of dumb stuff to "save the girl" so to speak.

Would this series be a good fit or will I be annoyed considering the aforementioned statement?

** I read the first two. I quite enjoyed the first one. The second one was fun at first, but gradually got more and more infuriating. Amazon reviews indicate that the third book takes everything wrong with the second book up to eleven, but indicate the the fourth book is better, so maybe I'll skip ahead, or just drop it.

Some spoilery thoughts/ranting:

TLDR:

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist is a real moron in the second book. He spends a long time doing nothing for no clear reason, then does the stupidest thing despite plenty of warning and options, knowing perfectly well that it was a trap. Why not just portal in a JDAM or something? Or even at the very end: just fireball the guy (and for some reason his flaming sword suddenly can't cut like it used to, and he left his juggernaut horse behind because reasons).<
#+end_quote

Longer

#+begin_quote
  The time skip and power boost for the second book was really large, and detracted from the story I think, since so few characters could be around in a meaningful way, and he was so powerful that personal threats were largely limited to surprises and stupidity. Still, it was a good civ builder story, the worldbuilding was interesting, and the power fantasy was fun. His romantic indecision was just kinda awkward and didn't seem to have a point really, but wasn't too terrible. The big problem is how incautious and unproactive the MC is. He just doesn't really... do anything about his problems. I was sympathizing with 'Parrin.' How many assassination attempts does it take to get him to catch a hint! Seriously the very first dream assassination attempt was interesting, likely ought to have killed him, and should have immediately escalated to an interesting conflict. Instead he completely ignores it. He doesn't even try to scry his attackers, learn anything about Byrne, its prince, the magicians, nothing. The incredibly contrived stupidity at the end of the story would have made sense if he had been furious and understandably worried about these powerful enemies with remote strike capability, and immediately retaliated and gotten tricked into directly facing Parrin. Basically the ending was bullshit, you could see it coming for a long time.<

  Why would he think handing executive power to a 19 year old he met a few hours ago is a good idea? That's not an 'incredibly liberal' policy. Merit based (eg Tort) would make way more sense, and be more 'liberal.'<

  There's a number of small continuity errors where something was introduced and the shortly after introduced again as if it was new. Admittedly some of these could be the MC having dementia (which would explain some things), but no one calls him on it so... In general he has / invents a lot of really useful magic with ease, uses it for something clever, then seems to forget it exists or refuses to use it for no good reason.<

*** I completely agree with the criticisms you list. Many times while reading many of the protagonist's decisions just infuriated me. I still recommend it because, on balance, the good outweighs the bad for me. That said, the writing does get better as time goes on---in the last book, the author seems to catch himself making some of those mistakes as they're happening. If you feel like you should skip ahead, I say go for it.
