** Who has a higher bounty than Kakashi? Sarutobi, Jiraiya, maaaybe Tsunade (if she even counts as a leaf shinobi), but that's only 3? People like Nara Shikaku (Jonin Commander) and Hyuuga Hiashi, but I'd still be missing one somewhere?

*** Could just be an entry for "leaf's jinchuuriki". Most other names I can come up with (Danzo, Asuma, etc) don't really fit very well.

** I liked this chapter.

You are really changing a lot of the mechanics from canon, which I am finding a bit hard to keep track of, but as long as I roll with the changes as they are relevant it isn't too jarring.

** Liked this chapter more than the previous ones. Kakashi is surprisingly reasonable

** I really like how the experience of using the Sharingan is described in this fic. Is that canon/fanon/your own description?

*** The canonical sharingan just seems to do whatever the author wanted at the time. I doubt I'm the first to do it this way, though.

** Can you please cancel your prefixes out? For some reason "A few hundred-thousand millichakra" annoys me immensely. "A few hundred chakra" would be much nicer.

*** Another opinion: I don't mind.

And just "chakra" doesn't even make much sence when talking about /parts/ of chakra.

Also, I think the author is going to mostly stick to abbreviation "mc" now that it's established.

**** this might be a bit silly, but "Chakra + Thaum = Chaum"?

Alternately, just use joules or something.
