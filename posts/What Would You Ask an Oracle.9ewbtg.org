You have access to an Oracle Machine and can present it with any valid decision lproblem (yes or no question with a valid answer) in natural language. The Oracle Machine will invariably give you the correct answer. What question(s) do you ask to maximise your utility? (Once you finish your question(s) the Oracle banishes itself from existence and forbids it (or a similar oracle from ever existing again).

There are a few ways to interpret the premise, so I'll define two axes along which the question can be interpreted:

1. You can only ask the oracle *one* question.\\
2. You can ask the Oracle one question every hour (arbitrarily chosen to prevent access to the Oracle from being too broken, while being significantly more powerful than in the first scenario).\\

a. The Oracle is omniscient and can answer correctly even in questions involving truly random phenomena.\\
b. The Oracle is only nigh omniscient and cannot predict truly random phenomena, but can completely predict all deterministic phenomena.

A question like this has been done before, but I thought it was too I'll defined when I read it and with too much potential for abuse (author added several extra patches to prevent certain kinds of munchkinry). I thought of this as a more sensible version but never got around to posting it, before a certain fic I read made me revisit the question.\\
 \\
Answers format should be prefixed by "*Scenario (x,y):*" (where x is from {1,2} and y is from {a,b}).

Scenario (1,a) is the scenario that I find most interesting.


** Scenario (1, a): Since it's natural language, maybe try for some linguistic tricks. "Is the following true: I will win the lottery tomorrow if and only if you answer my question with 'yes'?"

Scenario (2, b): You can probably get pretty far just asking a series of "Is the first bit of the smallest possible computer program to accomplish X a 1?", "Is the second bit of the smallest possible computer program to accomplish X a 1?", etc. This only transfers data to you at 24 bytes per day, but might work depending on how small truly optimal programs are. (We have some reason to suspect they are tiny but unfindable - finding the smallest version of a program is provably uncomputable in general. But the Oracle could know it!)

*** (1,a): The oracle wouldn't answer if the question doesn't have a truth value. This isn't a hack but is part of the specification of Oracle machines in general. They can solve every decision problem but not all problems qualify as decision problems. That said, I don't really get the question I guess. Supposing you were going to win the lottery anyway it would answer "yes", and if you were going to lose, the oracle would answer "no"? That sounds too simple a resolution, so I suspect I'm not fully understanding the question.\\
 \\
(2,b): I made it a 1h limit to prevent this, but it seems I wasn't sceptical enough. Also, what would the program run on? Software that run on modern computers are pretty bloated aren't they? Can a few KB software usefully run on a modern computer? There's also the fact that payoff would most likely be in years. I think I'll update to a question a day if this is still possible.\\

You could make up a virtual machine with arbitrarily small and terse instructions to get around this, then specify an optimal program on said virtual machine. As a first attempt, you might include an algorithmic random number generator that can provably reach a number of arbitrary-length sequences exponential to the length of the seed, then use the oracle to guess the seed of a much longer program.

**** (1,a): The trick is in the "if and only if". Let X be the statement "I will win the lottery tomorrow", and let Y be the statement "you will answer my question with 'yes'". Then X if and only if Y means that if X is true, then Y is true, and conversely, if Y is true, then X is true. In other words, X if and only if Y means that both have to be true, or that both have to be false.

Now, if the answer to the question is 'yes', then this answer says that X is true if and only if Y is true. On the other hand, Y is true, and therefore X is true, so you will win the lottery.

Conversely, if the answer to the question is 'no', then Y is false. If X were also false, then the answer to the question should be yes (since FALSE <=> FALSE is a TRUE statement), but since it is not, the only remaining case is that X must be true.

In either situation, X is true. You basically force the oracle to answer the question in a way that implies you win the lottery.

...

Or at least, that's what Scenario (1,a) is intended to do. It actually breaks if the oracle does not assume X is completely determined and always answers 'no' to this question. Namely: If you win the lottery, the oracle answers with no, and if you don't win the lottery, the oracle also answers with no. Then certainly Y will be false regardless of whether or not X is true.

I think that issue can be fixed by changing your question: "Is the following true: I will win the lottery tomorrow OR you will answer this question with 'no'" (revised from a comment by Yudkowski in a similar thread). If the answer is 'yes', then the second statement is false, therefore the first has to be true (an OR-statement is true if at least one of the statements is true). The answer 'no' cannot be given, since if 'no' is given, at least one of the statements is true, meaning the answer would have to be 'yes'.

** (1, a)

Hmmm. You want maximum beneficial effect from a single bit of information - in effect, a single yes/no answer.

So, first of all, let's consider how to maximise the effect. The biggest thing that you can do - the thing that will have the most far-reaching effect - is to completely change the direction of your life.

Therefore, ideally, you need two possible lives. For example, you might consider life as an author, writing inspirational stories that encourage others to action; or you might consider life as a scientist, expanding and exploring the realms of knowledge. There are thousands of potential paths a life can take; so you pick the two options most suited towards your personal talents and abilities.

Of these two potential life paths, pick one. Doesn't matter too much which one. (Let us say that, for example, I pick 'novelist').

Then the question is, "Will it be more beneficial for humanity in general, over the long term, if I were to spend the rest of my life as a novelist?"

If the answer is yes, I become a novelist and attempt to write and publish stories.

If the answer is no, I become a scientist and work on expanding the bounds of what knowledge is known.

Since the oracle can predict even random phenomena directly, the oracle can therefore see which of these two options is more beneficial to humanity in the long term and thus allows me to pick the best option; and the potential scope of the consequences is huge...

** "Are you really a perfect Oracle?"

No, seriously. Uhm. Being just a Yes/No question it's kinda hard. You can't crack any serious problems unless you already have a very good hypothesis in version 1), and version 2) still limits you a lot due to the one hour interval. And with a lot of questions ("Is immortality possible?" "Can we travel FTL?") I suspect the answer would be a discouraging and rather bleak "No", which far from being very useful, might in fact be something I'd just rather not know for sure. You can't even use this damned thing to, say, prove Riemann's hypothesis, because it's not like it will give you the demonstration, and no mathematics journal will accept "the Oracle told me" as a viable "Methods" section in a paper.

*********************** I kind of asume that an upload would be conscious , and a P-zombie doesn't sound like somehting that can really exist .I'm not saying I'm not sure how consciousnes works but "imagine if there was a part of the human brain you can zap to turn someone into a perfectly functional P-zombie " this really sounds incoherent in some way .Consciousness is whatever makes me say and think I'm conscious , or it would be really suspicious to have something that says its conscious for no reason that just happens to be the same thing that can host this mysterious consciousness thing.

A teleporter clearly doesn't create P-zombies ,so that case Is pretty much only about continuity , and I think computational continuity is the one that makes more sense( since if you start doing though experiments the concept of "original" becomes weird really fast ,and many worlds already forces you to decide there are more than one entities on the future you can call you).

Btw in the quantum suicide hash thing now that I think of it there is more than a 50% chance you will find yourself to be the version of you that by chance gets a hash that contains "do not mess whith time" or somethng like that and decides to stop if you don't take precautions for that.

It's just weird to accept that "systems" can be conscious even when if you look at their individual information-processing parts they don't look conscious at all. If I had to give my interpretation of it I'd say what makes the whole "I think, therefore I am" thing work for me is a boundary between a very highly integrated information processing system (my brain) and a much lower integrated information processing system (the society at large of which I am part and with which I exchange information). Without this sort of distinction I'd have then to speculate on where does it stop - are countries, or humanity as a whole, "conscious" in the sense that they do experience inner life even though we can't communicate with them? That too sounds like nonsense, but it's hard to put my finger on /why/ is it that I expect it not to be true. Seems too much of a gut feeling.

******** The wavefunction may be continuous, but states are discrete. Possibly infinite, but discrete. And no, I don't mean there are philosophical zombies.

Take it this way: there's your typical Schroedinger cat system, in a superimposed state |alive> + |dead> (I'll omit the normalization factors for convenience). Your brain is still in the |doesn't know> state. You then open the box. Unitary quantum evolution would then have the total wavefunction of the box + your brain to evolve into:

|alive>|knows it to be alive> + |dead>|knows it to be dead>

At this point, the Copenhaghen interpretation mumbles "something something abracadabra measurement and collapse" and says we're only left with either |alive>|knows it to be alive> or |dead>|knows it to be dead>, and the system keeps evolving from there. This, IMHO, is not very satisfactory. However the way I see it is, this is only puzzling if we assume that our brain in the entangled state should see somehow the cat both alive /and/ dead. That is not what the wavefunction describes, though. The wavefunction describes a state where one one side we have a brain /absolutely, positively sure the cat is alive/ and on the other one that is /absolutely, positively sure the cat is dead/. Either brain has /only seen one state/, and would have to wonder where did the other even go! And so, how do we decide which brain should feel like "me", and which one shouldn't? The answer is, we can't. They both are "me". They just are "me who saw the cat alive" and "me who saw the cat dead". They both exist, in configuration space. They both are 100% sure they saw a single, classical outcome from the experiment. They both think the wavefunction mysteriously /collapsed/ - only, in different ways.

There's some additional stuff necessary to justify of course "why those two specific states" and "why is the cat's density matrix diagonal in them" but honestly I feel like that's well justified by decoherence theory. Put together, these two things form a complete explanation of quantum weirdness, if a somehow underwhelming one. It's not something I alone came up with, BTW, it's one possible "soft" interpretation of Many Worlds, in which said worlds are subjective. It's mentioned for example in [[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312059][this paper]] as the "many minds" interpretation.

I could use it to satisfy some scientific question, but then the issue is that no one would ever believe me so all it would do is satisfy my curiosity. I could use it to answer some personal question (eg. will I live to be 100) but that would be meaningless given that with a mere 1 bit of information I would be unable to even attempt to change the results in any way.

So honestly, I would probably just use it for making money. I would take out a bunch of loans and heavily overextend myself to make a bunch of money on sports event.

Senario (2,a, b): This one is much more interesting, and far easier to exploit.

The first thing I would do is ask some questions to ensure I don't die in the time leading up to getting my more important questions done. The chance of death over the time it would take for them to be answered to be answered is fairly small but nontrivial, especially when the rewards would eventually end up with me immortal and by far the most powerful person on earth.

After that I would basically just ask it what the best question for me to ask it would be. Doing so would of course have to be changed a bit for the format of a yes/no oracle, but could fairly easily be done with "What is the [xth] bit of the ideal question set for me to ask you under 100 characters done in this same format for me to ask you translated from english into bits with yes being 1 and no being 0?"

Since its omniscent it would logically know what the best question set for me to ask it better then I ever could. Getting the result back of the question it would give me to ask it would take a while but the return would be far better then anything I could think up on my own.

On top of that I would take out tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt and as many other less reputable loans (payday loans, loansharks) as I could.

Finally I would use leverage (which is basically using other people's money to invest in the stock market/bet at a ratio of your own money) to increase my return even further.

Honestly as long as you aren't currently in debt and people are willing to lend to you it shouldn't be all that hard to get a 10-20x return on your current annual income even if you had no hard money on hand.

As someone highly worried about existential risk, AI is on your mind. You find this oracle and know immediately what your first question will be:

"Oracle, will I live to see AGI exist?"

If the oracle says yes, you will regretfully take your own life. You don't want to live in a future where humanity does AI wrong, and you think it almost certainly will do AI wrong.

If the oracle says no, you relax and live your life normally. Phew, dodged an existential bullet!

In reality AGI is 10 years out. What could the oracle possibly tell you? If it says yes and you take your own life, it's wrong. You wouldn't have lived to see AGI. If it says no so you live naturally, it's wrong. You would run into AGI 10 years down the road.

What does the oracle do in this kind of situation where it's answer influences the future in a contradictory way?

EDIT: Or, what about situations where asking the oracle itself is a trap?
