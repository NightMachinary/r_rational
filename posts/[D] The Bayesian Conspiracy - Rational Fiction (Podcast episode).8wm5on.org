** I would very much enjoy reading an anthology or compilation of some of the best [[/r/rational][r/rational]] weekly challenge entries fwiw. (Not looking to impose on your time, just putting my opinion out there in case a lack of an audience for the project was a consideration)

*** I often wish that I could duplicate myself, since that's the only way that I'll ever get to do all the things that I want to do. Following that conversation I actually tried to make a budget proposal for the project, in terms of time and effort, and though it's something that I would like to do, it's just too many hours/spoons to get it done, especially since I get a bit of social anxiety, and dealing with all the people I would need to deal with sounds like a people-stamina sapping nightmare.

If someone /else/ wanted to do it, all you'd need to do is contact authors through reddit, and so long as you're known to me, I'd be willing to lend /some/ effort and knowledge to the project (as well as some prose, given I have a fair amount of short fiction and a few wins). But one of the reasons that I'm running the weekly challenge is that I thought if I didn't do it, no one else would have, and I expect a compilation or anthology would be the same.

** It's a bit sad that so far no big names in the book industry have picked up any of the works from this community.\\
Sure, the "Rational" label would probably have to be dropped, because as you guys noted in the podcast, it sounds way too pretentious.
