**** My problem is that Guilded Hero *isn't* that. It pretends to be a rational world, but in practice it's just a world of grimderp.

Everyone has stats, they know that stats are required to gain the all-important skills. The main character spends 2 weeks before anyone even /asks/ what his stats are. As far as I can tell from reviews which follow after I dropped the story, it keeps this up the entire story. Eg, why they don't even /try/ to max out summoned heroes.

The story seems to confuse dark writing for deep writing.

***** Ugh and then in this chapter a scribe attempts to teach the main character how to read the local language.... by having him copy pages of text. Over and over again. Onto parchment. Without any sort of translation or explanation. So now the MC is just copying gibberish /without knowing what it says/.

The scribe is described as being unwilling to teach the main character and having to be ordered into it against his will, but this is absolutely ridiculous - literally anyone (including the baron who ordered these lessons) should understand that this is /not an acceptable way to teach reading/.

And the main character is just taking it like an idiot, instead of going to the Baron and saying "hey dude, your scribe is wasting both of our goddamn time and a shitload of parchment".

***** Its explained in the story why they dont spend a bunch of reasources on every hero.

>! The empire can just keep summoning heroes so there just a resource. The heroes get a broken ability to train faster but they arnt equal as a group. Some take a lot less time to gain ability. At first all heroes used to be given years of training before war. But since stuff like massed arrows or catapults or magic pretty consistently kill heroes its not worth it to train all of them for years. Only the really talented get more time to train while the inferior heroes get sent off to just be one more body in the army. And then it explains they cant be mages because if they were they could end up killing the empire thats using them as soldiers. !<

****** Again, I'm saying these are rationalizations and not rational.

It costs them literally nothing to say "Hey, what's your stats? Cool, strength guy use a sword. Dex guy go use a bow." 10 seconds and it would be /faster/ in that initial week.

The short time training is also a poor excuse, since the bulk of the army aren't heroes and literally everybody who's in the army and /not/ a hero got more than one week training. It costs the same amount to train a peasant for 4 weeks and train a hero for 1 week, or to do it vice-versa. Except that the other way around gets you vastly better returns since it's training for a hero.

tbh it seems plausibly rational to me, we don't explicitly know how classes are chosen or what the empire needs, so you're making an assumption when you're saying that what they do isn't the best method for them.

***** Nobody asks what his stats are because it largely doesn't matter. You try everything you're allowed to try (aka. not magic), and you either pick something up or you don't. You don't want to specialize before people get their class specialization.

idk what you mean by “they don't even try to max out summoned heroes”. They do; they just do it by throwing them into war and seeing who sticks. You might be thinking about keeping a more elite group in reserve and levelling them less dangerously, but given the logistical issues of handling kidnapped soldiers, the downsides of not having combat experience, and the fact the empire is in a panicked crunch, it makes sense that they wouldn't.

****** I was under the impression that skills/classes have statistic requisites, so some hero who got summoned in with 100 dex would shoot a bow for 15 minutes and unlock their skill(s) and become a great archer or something, and someone like the main character with 5 dex would spend all day plinking arrows and get nothing.

Or are you suggesting that either of them has an /equally/ likely chance of unlocking a bow skill from the same amount of time shooting? And if they both happened to unlock the same skill, that they would be /equally/ useful with that skill?

Because if both of those aren't equal, then they ought to have customized training regimes based on stats. It takes no more effort at all.

******* I was under the impression that stats were a first-order factor, but that other factors were similarly important.

Most people have roughly average stats, which means that doing a bunch of everything gives them the best chance of unlocking whatever they're best suited to, which might not be what their stat suggested, while serving to round out everyone's baseline stats.

It's true that people with poor stats in some areas might be practically locked out of certain classes early on, but people with valuably-high alternative stats will generally unlock their wanted class early anyway, and for the rest it makes sense to round out their missing attributes.

***** I've enjoyed it quite a bit. The pacing on updates and MC progress has been uneven - update schedule being very excusable due to current events.

The thing about [heroes] are that they're apparently a dime a dozen, and if incapable of getting a martial class, they're thrown away. A pair of them were even sacrificed to fuel the spell that teleported John to his mercenary company. Heroic casters are problematic in the extreme for the king who summons them.

I can understand how not liking the setting can get in the way of enjoying a work of fantasy fiction. A non-rational world, however, doesn't disqualify writing from being rational. It's the main character's motives and actions that matter here.

This being said, John doesn't yet seem to have much agency. I think we'll see this change soon, and it will be that much sweeter when he gets his moment. The attempt to steal the knife from Karen was pretty frustrating because he finally seemed to be acting on his own goals, impulsive though it was.

When reading something that leaves some blanks to fill in, it defeats the very goal of enjoying what is read to imagine the character behaving as you describe.

Readers (I include myself in this group) are frustrated with how little power the MC has, especially in light of his aborted mission to steal the knife. With updates coming a month or so apart, it seems like the guy is never going to progress.

Our situation is pretty extraordinary right now. The author had to postpone his work due to substantial adjustments to his schedule and personal life due to COVID-19. I'm taking a wait and see approach, and yes, assuming that the author knows what he's doing.

Story wise it fits and make sense, but unless what the author is trying to convey here is “the MC is so addled and useless he can't even describe his own life accurately” then that small paragraph is not fit for purpose.

The MC not being able to convey his meaning to the scribe and the scribe losing it on him is totally fine, same with him lacking agency right at this moment.(despite how it irks me) so the story is fine in that sense.

The [scribe] is clearly an /utterly crappy teacher/. The problem is that the [baron] has nobody else remotely capable of the task.

Compounding this is the problem that the [scribe] isn't apparently training John to be literate; he's training him to be a [scribe], a class that grants literacy as a side benefit.

*** Before the invention of the printing press, books were extremely valuable commodities. Literacy was rarer. In-universe, these two factors combined mean it's not worth it to make books that teach reading. It's more commonly done in person, sketching characters in sand with a stick or the like.

The Scribe, as he's protested, ain't got time for that shit, but he's gotta get results anyway. As the main character has literally never seen these characters yet, and doesn't know the words associated with their sounds, he can't tell him "this is A, it makes an 'ah' sound." It'd probably make things worse.

But there's no better way to get better at recognizing characters than staring at and reproducing them a ton. And, as our protagonist has a rote skill learning buff, and the Scribe doesn't want to waste his time... He's set him to work waiting for "Writing Lvl. 1" to ping.

Also he wants to make more copies of whatever this text is and it'll be easier and less painful on his old arthritic hands to edit the protagonist's shitty chicken scratch than to copy it himself.

That's my attempt.
