** To those who are sensitive about such things, the first chapter consists of the protagonist repeatedly and graphically committing suicide.

If you skip forward to chapter two, the actual story starts.

Edit: later chapters also have a few cases of graphic suicide and nudity.

Not Safe for kids.

** I caught up to the current comic and added this to my RSS reader. There are a number of things that I'm quite curious about, but will likely be answered later. It's showing the same consideration as Fleep, which is a very good sign.

It's because of the science, isn't it.

I find it interesting that the author has presented, essentially, the ultimate form of a cluster suicide. Probably won't ever throw any thoughts that direction, but one can hope.

**** Interestingly enough, the author considers this to be science fiction, which I think might say something about the ultimate direction it ends up taking.

** What kind of an evil person links to a story like that while it still isn't finished?

*** While it's nice to be able to tear through an epic, artfully created work, it's better for the author to have an ongoing audience and [[http://www.patreon.com/shiga][financial support]].

** I don't quite get how he arrived at the conclusion that he is a demon. Has supernatural powers, sure, but demon seems extremely specific. Why not spirit? Or fey? Or ghost?
