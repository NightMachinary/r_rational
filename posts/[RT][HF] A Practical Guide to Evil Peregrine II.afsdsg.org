** Oooohh, don't forget this is the nephew [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/10/interlude-queens-gambit-declined/comment-page-1/][he's forced to murder]].

#+begin_quote
  There were no shades to their perspectives, and while they might fondly tolerate them in one sworn to the Choir of Mercy that indulgence should never be confused for approval. The Grey Pilgrim had first understood this when he'd smothered his young nephew in his sleep, knowing the boy was charismatic enough to unite the Dominion and lead to war against Procer. He'd tried, first, to reason with him. To show him the pursuit of old grudges through blood could not redeem a single thing.

  The young never listened, he'd learned. And so old fools like him had to smooth out the sharp edges of Creation.
#+end_quote

I'm also a little confused about the timeline, I think the prince he's rescuing is the Exiled Prince and he's rescuing them from our Tyrant (kairos) but I was under the impression that this vignette is from a a longish time ago and kairos has only been Tyrant for a few years? Pilgrim is in his 60 or 70s present day, right? Or is it the prior Tyrant and if so do we know anything about them?

Nice catch...now that's just sad.

#+end_quote

There's no indication that a Tyrant (or any Name, really, other than GP) is involved at all, so I'd say it's a previous generation.

**** u/swaskowi:
#+begin_quote
  The Grey Pilgrim was in Helike, helping a young prince flee his murderous father.
#+end_quote

I don't know if the king of Helike is ALWAYS a Tyrant but Helike is where our tyrant is from and we know he's not the first of his name so it seems likely that the "king" is Tyrant of somesort.

#+begin_quote
  The Bellerophan's eyes sharpened with interest as he swallowed another mouthful of wine. The Tyrant's seizing of the throne of Helike had been one of the most unexpected diplomatic development of the last decade, in the Free Cities, but precious little was known about. A boy that had been by all reports a nonentity before the coup had in a single day taken control of the city and the army, killed the king in his own bed and purged his nephew's supporters brutally. The nephew in question had fled the city with most of the young nobility and his surviving loyalists, becoming the Exiled Prince in the process.
#+end_quote

+[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/page/33/][This passage]] seems to line up with the story, but like I said, the timeline confuses me. You're right parsimony does suggest its just referring to the previous tyrant but it would mean the same story beat happened twice in Helike a not too many years apart.+

Edit: Nevermind I misread, clearly referring to the previous rulers of Helike and not at all mixed up with our current story. People try and kill princelings alot I guess.

***** The fact that the Name Exiled Prince exists is proof of that. Names are given to Roles and Roles are grooves in Creation that originate from events happening repeatedly in history.

I'd say he's well down the road now.

​

He's maximizing Goodness, and if means murdering children... that's a Good thing to do (note the capital G).

Above does not right. It does, however, mean Good (but not good)

Below/Evil/Freedom is all about free will.

​

So... the Pilgrim, following Above, thinks it is certain, and takes action to further Above's plans.

Someone following Below will not.

Above vs Below is a question of Order vs Free will

***** Right but does this mean he has a change of heart regarding the revenge or does he learn that who does it can't be killed because it means doing more harm than good? Or do the Ophirim talk him down since he's bound to the choir of mercy?

It's just a little odd.
