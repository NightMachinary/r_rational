** Cat's wish is probably what Kairos was laughing at when they first met.

From Book 5, Chapter 7:

#+begin_quote
  The Tyrant took one look at me, good eye widening, and convulsed. For a heartbeat I was worried that the Night had somehow hurt him, but the convulsion erupted into raucous, heartfelt laughter. I blinked, taken aback. I flicked a glance at the nearest gargoyle but it just put out its tongue at me. I discretely kicked it while the Tyrant kept laughing his guts out. Eventually the villain got himself under control, wiping tears out of his eyes with trembling hands.

  “Oh, that is a fine jest indeed,” he said, then peeked at the floor. “You never disappoint.”

  I cleared my throat.

  “I don't suppose you'd care to share,” I said.

  The Tyrant smiled at me in the way of man for whom smiles came easy and meant little.

  “You are so short,” Kairos Theodosian said. “It is quite delightful.”

  He was a good liar, I decided, but I'd known better. Just by looking at me he'd learned something, and I had no idea what. I set that aside for later consideration.

*** That his wish aspect reveals the wish of others explains so many things.

Particularly when he gazed upon Adjutant.

#+begin_quote
  It was not, however, the first time the Tyrant of Helike jibed of Hakram's leanings towards detachment. That he would keep prodding from an angle that would yield nothing was interesting, and suggested two things: first, that Catherine had been right on the subject of Kairos Theodosian having some skill related to perception of others. Second, that what the Tyrant was seeing in Adjutant unsettled him enough to keep picking at it like a scab.

** Neshamah: "Are you truly mad, or just feigning ?"

Kairos: "Yes."

It's interesting that Tyrant had a read on Bard's desires, as easily as just laying eyes on her, when compared to the efforts it took the Death King to achieve the same kind of read.

*** Yeah, it was mentioned earlier too. I assumed that the Bard has some kind of ability related to perception aspects, considering that the Pilgrim has Behold as well, and Epilogue IV implies that the Bard can manipulate what the Augur sees:

#+begin_quote
  The Augur sitting alone in a frosted garden, spoken whispers still echoing in her ears like a coiling snake.
#+end_quote

But considering that the Augur recently won a victory over the Bard, it could be the case that the Bard just has generally good intentions, but some kind of long-term plan that's bad for everyone else, and that's how she got the Pilgrim to trust her.

** I really liked this chapter! Interesting too for what Kairos doesn't tell us: no mention of Roland or Tariq, or their wishes. Or Hierarch's, I suppose, but that's probably "The Will of the People."

#+begin_quote
  Antigone's opinion was that the Hierophant, even stripped of his sorcery as he currently was, might be able to kill either of them in a fight.
#+end_quote

I'll admit, I can't see how... Knowledge is only power if you can use it, and Zeze can't. Any thoughts?

#+begin_quote
  And so they resumed the ride forward to Lyonceau, into the jaws of the beast waiting to gobble them up.

  It was, for a hero, one of the most practical places to be.
#+end_quote

Welcome to Hanno's Practical Guide to Good. Alas, I fear he's horribly misread the plot of the story he's in right now.

#+begin_quote
  “Yes,” the Dead King said. “I can feel the Hierophant. Soon, now.”
#+end_quote

Oh, that's not good. Nessy still has some connection/influence on Masego?

Masego lost his magic, but not his name. I think he can still wield his stolen miracles. And by this point he has rather a few.

**** One of the first things he did after losing his magic was grabbing Sve Noc by the neck, and he would have torn them a new one if Cat hadn't stepped in. So yeah, diminished but far from powerless.

**** Don't forget his shiny new third aspect: *Wrest*. Not too difficult to imagine Zeze stealing your power right out from under you and using it against you.
