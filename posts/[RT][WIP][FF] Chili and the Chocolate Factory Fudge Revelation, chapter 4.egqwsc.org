** So I'm putting more weight on the anti-astronomy policy being an attempt by the Knids to hide doing some sort of astroengineering to either remove the atmosphere or make something that can drop the entire army.

President Definitely-Not-A-Sentient-Table was likely a Knid that managed to enter the atmosphere by accident or by non-scalable technology.

Further theorycrafting: CHOCOR was an attempt by Charlie to engineer enough superscientists to fight the Knids. The election of Kalan Kare-Amil, someone who will be of no help against the Knid menace, spurned him into reopening Pandora's box despite the massive dangers.

Further further theorycrafting: Kalan Kare-Amil was not just the lucky beneficiary of a lone Witch, but a purposeful choice to install a lone idiot into the White House as part of an alliance between the Witches, now on the edge of extinction via mouse-based assassination, and the Knids, who will kill all children in their planned genocide.

*** You think? I was thinking that anti-astronomy was created to avoid giving the knids any potential material to safely breach the atmosphere with, since even one getting in would likely end the world. However the existence of knids was so classified that even the anti-astro department itself doesn't know the reason why they suppress any interest in space and exploration, leading to shenanigans.

** This all got a bit too absurd for me from chapter 2 onwards - the whole world is now very absurd, instead of just the Wonka stuff. I'm sure it all makes sense internally and will be revealed, but I'm mostly just reading because I started it, at this point.

I guess it's just not my thing.

****** I think there is an answer, but I got this idea from another user, not myself: The riddle is “what do I like best?” which implies that there is a single answer, but the variety of winners shown so far implies there must be multiple answers. I think the solution is not necessarily /something/ you like but instead something you like /the most/. So you only win if you like something more than all the other billions of people like anything. Only the top six most extreme people will win the contest. Which is quite fitting for a Rational!Wonka, in my opinion.

** So who wants to bet, based purely on the shared dislike of Chopin, that Chilli was made using the original CHOCOR?

It's more likely that the hatred of Chopin is just a sign of their high intelligence.

Of weird note: Ronald Dahl once wrote a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Conqueror][story]] in which dislike of a piece of Chopin's is a plot point.

****** Ah, yeah, that wouldn't jump to mind outside of a food context, no. Personally, I might block off that association even if I were British, given the way I don't tend to seek meaning in the pronunciation of acronyms.

so the reference would mostly only be obvious to people who have previously had the junk food pop into their head when reading the word CRISPR

** So, just a thought, but there are clearly multiple Dahlesque influences in this story. I've noticed the BFG-style giants popping up, for example (not to mention the Witches).

But this implies a universe in which /all/ the Dahl book happened. In which James rode a giant peach across the Atlantic, and a little girl called Matilda once developed psychokinesis because her giant intellect was insufficiently stimulated. In which Henry Sugar can see through a card and tell you what it is in under three seconds (and is, as a direct result, banned from just about every casino in the world - not that the casinos necessarily know how he's doing it).

I do find myself wondering just what Matilda's up to in this timeline...

*** A couple of users in the AW discord figured out Matilda might be Tide Honey's mother.

#+begin_quote
  Miss Honey was the name of Matilda's adopted mother, and Small Matador would have been a piece of fiction related to Trunchbull, with Matilda the titular small matador. Mother's name is M.H., for Matilda Honey. Though Honey is her last name and Tide is her first name, if I'm reading that right.
