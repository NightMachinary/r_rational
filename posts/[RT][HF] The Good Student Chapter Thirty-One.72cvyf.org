Despite being very awkward language, I don't buy it. There's no way Nic would be encouraged to make requests, even if they have received such instructions. Nic just doesn't need to know (or if he does, someone else would have said so).

On another note, is it just me, or does the relationship between Nic and Dizzy seem a bit... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion_%28novel%29][familiar?]]
