** I'm really curious about how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general and especially in rationalist fiction.

Personally, I love longform content: [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Wildbow's]] [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][gargantuan]] [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][meganovels]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][/Practical Guide to Evil/'s]] epic scope, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][/Worth the Candle/'s]] musings on roleplaying games, etc. But I also think that sometimes there's something missing in these works given how they're all, essentially, first drafts.

Pixar, of course, is an animated film studio. I think film probably rivals short fiction for the sheer /efficiency/ that is needed to tell a full story with such limited time. Where, say, PGtE can spend entire chapters just on really fascinating conversations, dialog in film has to be short and direct, ideally without /feeling/ too short or direct.

This leaves me curious about what sort of form rational fiction would take in other media. Has anyone tried making rationalist films? Rationalist games? There's been a [[https://soundcloud.com/raymond-arnold][bit of music]] written and produced around the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wTeEpNMok2eiAsTd5/state-of-the-solstice-2014#What_makes_a_Secular_Solstice__][Secular Solstice]], which I find pretty interesting. What other avenues are there for storytelling that the community could explore?

EDIT: So I did, thanks for catching that. Also, links to things.

  how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general
#+end_quote

I think that more and more there's a huge gap in how stories are told in traditional media vs online. It's even funny that TV seasons (the traditional form of serial longform media) have been slowly shrinking over the decades and cutting fluff to match up with the tighter plotting you see in movies and novels.

On the other hand online media is mostly literary and the generally accepted length is going /up/, not down. This probably has its actual roots in sporadically updated serial fanfic but has manifested itself even in original stories now (which in some ways have inherited /more/ media DNA from serial fanfics than from print novels.) When I read a story (or see other media) without enough fluff these days it feels like something's missing, it's a distinct lack of breadth. 100k words online is a brisk jog through the park (in many ways the gargantuan megaprojects like Worm set the "serious" standards for the online genre now, and that includes fanfic too) but 100k in print would be a serious novel.

I kind of wonder if this divergence will last, but it's clearly widening now, not narrowing.

Much of the reason is not having a competent editor. There's no one telling the web serial authors "This part is pointless fluff and adds nothing to the story. Cut it out." (or if there is, the authors refuse to listen).

But you're ignoring the larger question. /Does pointless fluff add nothing to the story?/ I think a lot of the time stories without enough fluff feel kind of flatter, emptier. Real books have to be small because of physical concerns, remember, the same assumptions won't all apply.

****** /Pointless/ fluff pretty much by definition doesn't add anything to the story. If it did, it wouldn't be pointless. Or to put it another way, not all fluff is pointless and you want to have enough of that fluff for the story to not feel sterile but you don't want 10 pages of repetitive purple prose just because the author likes writing that. An example from traditional fiction is Wheel of Time where in some cases nothing plot relevant happens in entire books because it's all just fluff.

******* Now we're just arguing semantics though. How much fluff do you need for it to be pointless? In other media, like Television, there is WAY more fluff, and in previous decades with longer, more wandering seasons there was even more. Just watch a season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Xena: Warrior Princess (I pick these shows because they likely have had an outsized early impact on the net lit medium due to fanfic and demographics.) Fluff and subplots will be coming out of your ears.

Who's to say that a serial fiction published online should follow the model of a tight novel instead of a sprawling TV series? From what I've seen the online literature medium has made leaps and bounds in the past decade, and it's hard to believe that it skewing longer and longer over that period is some kind of weird mistake and not natural selection.

*** Time to bust this out again: a long time ago I wrote up a short essay on what rules I think a "rational game" would follow:

I didn't know at the time, but there is a genre that Mark Brown refers to as Immersive Sims, that I think comes closest to meeting these rules out-of-the-box.

*** Pretty much all fanfic and web novels are probably very weak on #2, #3 and #5. #5 is the least offender because if you do a minimum of planning ahead it can still happen. However #3 is pretty much impossible for something of that length (which will be written while it's published, so it's subject to all the dangers of serials, like TV shows and long-running manga, rather than having the narrative unity of a novel or a movie), and #2 is also pretty hard because if you don't also have fun on such a long project you'll end up dropping it, and that's no good.

** For rule #2, what sort of thing(s) would be fun to do as a writer that wouldn't be entertaining to an audience? I'm having trouble thinking of anything.

Ideally a writer trying something interesting/fun would also be trying to make that thing entertaining and make sense to an audience. I can imagine some things could fall flat, I just can't think of what would.

*** Worldbuilding is fun when it's shown, not told. Exposition dumps are for author notes, not dialogue.

Legends shouldn't be the unredacted or objective truth. Every legend needs to be chronicled by a character with biases. The Elder Scrolls series does this admirably!

Prophecies may be a puzzle, but they should have a major takeaway for the character who'll only hear it once, /who then repeats the one or two things they'll remember./ If you refer back to it, have it misremembered unless someone wrote it down.

If you have a map in the frontispiece, don't only include plot-important places, and don't include all of them. But do include political boundaries. And don't make the reader keep flipping back to it.

*** Breaking conventions for the sake of breaking conventions is sometimes fun for the writer but rarely fun for the audience. Really complex plots or conceits are often interesting for the writer but just confusing for most of the audience; there are exceptions like House of Leaves, but most times you try to do something intricate like that it will be interesting to write but fall on its face when it comes to actual readers.

In general, being excessively clever just to see if you can manage it will be much less interesting to your readers than to you.

*** Another common one is writing a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Mary Sue]]. Usually the extent to which audiences like this sort of thing is the extent to which the audience is similar to the author

For example, I and most people on this subreddit love Harry Potter Evans Verres because we see ourselves in that character. But a lot of people outside the rational circle who share little in common with him would perceive him as an annoying Mary Sue. (Yes yes /we/ know that he's actually deeply flawed and that hpmor is at least in part a book about just how flawed he is, but most people will not see that, they will only see that he's supposed to be soooo smart)

Also in general, when you look at things that are more common in fanfic than in professional fic, you see things that are more fun to write than read.

*** I think definitely "talking about worldbuilding", for most audiences vs most writers. Audiences like exploring well built worlds as the characters move through them but they don't necessarily like just hearing about the world as an academic paper might describe it.

Meanwhile writers tend to like constructing worlds even apart from characters.

Tolkien is one archetype of this tendency who still somehow managed to be quite successful - Lord of the Rings reads like a history book at times. I think in some ways this was allowed because in some senses it was "the first" fantasy novel which really hit a wide audience (outside of maybe religious texts, e.g. the Mahabharata, dantes inferno, etc does actually involve a fair bit of world building if you think about it)

Some of these lines become blurred when you are writing for nerds, who are a bit more writer-ish than the average reader.

/Presenting/ this backstory to the reader every time a new character steps onto the page, even if the character is only in the story for a page or two before vanishing, never to return? Less pleasant for the reader.

*** Number two is the one that I think I struggle with the most in my writing, but it's more a matter of what comes easier than pure interest.

I could /very easily/ write chapter after chapter of "the two main characters sit down and talk to each other every single day for an hour, going through many iterations of internal conflict". That's honestly half of what I imagine whenever I think of my story, and I'm afraid it shows. If I were to write the entire story with only these dialogues it might function as a quirky artistic piece that, sure, some people might like, but it could definitely benefit from better storytelling.

My plan is to weave together external and internal conflict for nice thematic tension. Is that not the standard approach?

90% of the "gymbro human interest" fluff in the Deathworlders serial for example. There's a LOT of largely repetitive fluff about muscles and cough hugging and such which is of no interest to most readers of a story about humanity being awesome in space with aliens and fancy tech.

** With regards to #2 and #21, I much prefer Steven Brust's “Cool Stuff Theory of Literature.”

#+begin_quote
  All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool.

  The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.

Okay, I can definitely see where you're coming from here. It's especially important in rationalist fiction that Magic A should /always/ be Magic A - the world needs to be susceptible to analysis. And part of that is that, occasionally, expected things should happen. There are things in the story that should be predictable.

Though I do think it's also important to have the story surprise the reader on occasion as well, because surprises can keep the reader interested.

19: Never, ever dues ex machina. The occasional diabolus ex machina is allowed, because it makes the protagonist need to work harder. I still don't see what's wrong with this, as long as it's not over-used.
