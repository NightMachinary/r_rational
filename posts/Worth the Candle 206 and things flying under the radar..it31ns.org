** I think this is a good opportunity to specifically say "I don't know". It can certainly be parsed as euphemism for sex, or it can just be Mary appreciating platonic relationship time.

Three things point toward the null hypothesis imo --

- (Pri-)Mary likes spending time with Joon, and the other clones have relatively less fun jobs -- and this is why she's so bubbly of late, because she's the locus of "fun" for all 30 of her. Now there are 3x as many Marys in the "fun" role
- Joon makes an incredibly big deal about sex, and he doesn't make another peep about any hypothetical orgies with him involved.
- I almost forgot the obvious one - Mary is still ace, yeah?

I almost wonder if I'm supposed to parse this as "the DM dropping bait for Joon" -- like, hey buddy, nudge nudge, the newspapers are writing the most /salacious/ stories about you and your loving wife who would totally indulge you in anything that would make you happy. Too bad they're just stories, totally unlike this virtual universe that definitely doesn't ever run on anything resembling storybook logic...

how I read this is that she used soul magic to turn of sexaul and romatinc atraction.

and if taking into acount her current actions it is clear that the romantic attraction bit has restored it's self as soul magic is only temporary.

Yes, Mary does have some amount of attraction to June. It's very possible she is well on her way to being (or maybe even already is) in love with him. But it's been made pretty explicitly clear that she doesn't feel /sexual/ attraction to anyone, including June.

**** Arthur, Reimer and Fallatehr all read as "masculine intellectual/nerd" to me.

But a lot of the story is about how Joon feels. So anybody close to Joon also is going to be shown responding in some way to Joon's introspections, or the story wouldn't have a good way to include scenes focused on that character.

They might care with rolling eyes or with self-hating frustration or with sadism, but all Joon's companions treat his thoughts and feelings as worth noticing.

And "interested in your feelings" traditionally codes feminine, or else a man who's romantically interested in you.

Classic masculine tough-guy antics? Those go well with "it's just business, we get the job done, and in between witty quips we bite down on our feelings."

But in their case the introspection is more about sensibly facing the situation you're already dealing with, rather than getting better at your life or career /by/ better mental hygiene.

On the other hand, their characters are a whole lot saner and sweeter than the heroes of Lord of the Mysteries or Time Braid.

** Eh. The first bold bit comes across as teasing, and the second bit could easily be more generally about hangups on monogomy and how that becomes blurred with clones. The last bit does imply intimacy in a group manner, but the specific depth of which isn't a given, due to the variety of paths they could take and Joon's general hang ups with expressing his sexuality.

Something probably happened, "foursome" unlikely the fully accurate term, but given the text before is talking about how the actual action is less important than the specific details I don't think this is going to matter in the grand scheme of things.

Also, I used to spend time in the kink/bdsm/queer club scene (pre-quarantine, pre-best place in my city shutting down) and there are a variety of ways of being a variety of levels of intimate, but given such places haven't been explicitly mentioned in Aerb I'm assuming the comments by the general public are prone to simplifying the situation a lot too from a lack of experience/knowledge.

  There's a planar entity,” said Raven. “Under certain circumstances, it's capable of altering the electron stream within a television in order to produce moving images of its own design. Some of those designs are capable of producing ... effects.”

  “Specifically,” said Amaryllis, gritting her teeth.

  “Mental changes in those who view them,” said Raven. “The effects vary.” She continued on quickly, because it seemed like Amaryllis was going to press the issue again. “The best case scenario is increased mental acuity, decreased reaction times, better impulse control, and lessened emotional response, which comes packaged with a direct line of communication to the entity itself. Non-replicable when the moving pictures are recorded, in case you were wondering. The ‘gifts' are temporary and used as leverage. In the worst case ... there are a lot of worst cases. The entity can make people into flesh puppets. It can leave them comatose. It can hold them hostage in their own bodies, locked in, which it does if it thinks that will give it an advantage.”

  “And why wouldn't you --” Amaryllis paused. “Ah. Cultists.”

  “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there's every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes. There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity's good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it's a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”

** Related question: Have Joon and Mary had full blown intercourse as of yet? I do remember that she's given him handjobs and blowjobs, and they've kissed a fair number of times, but I can't recall if they ever made a home run happen. AW is good at keeping that stuff subtle, so it's likely I read over the detail and missed it.

*** No, they haven't. Some people interpret the quote in the OP as them having had sex, but it doesn't make any sense from a character/story perspective. Joon is repeatedly shown to place importance on full sexual intercourse, and to have the leadup and resolution of that in his relationship with Amaryllis /happen off screen and only be mentioned once/ would be pretty terrible story telling. My interpretation of the above is that Amaryllis is giving Joon blowjobs, and he feels guilty that he isn't really able to reciprocate.

** A wee bit off-topic but is anyone else having difficulty downloading this for offline reading? I used to download the ao3 epub version but now I couldn't.
