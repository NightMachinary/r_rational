** So, finally caught up with this story.

I do like it, but ... 112 chapters, but it's been what, 2 months since he arrived? And only now is starting to work towards the delving part?

Don't get me wrong. I definitely appreciate the lack of EDGE this story has, the time it takes to world build, as well a slow and steady progression in abilities, but man is this slow!

Not to mention he's taking a very lackadaisical approach to not dying... I get he's support based and personal power would be a long time coming, but you'd think he'd prioritize not dying/getting injured by your abilities first. It's only recent chapters it seems like this is becoming a thing he's working on.

Another thing. There's being naive and nice, but there's another when making the stupidest decisions possible, and then going 'Oh well, what can you do?" How about applying that reasoning before the decision?? The fact that he isn't chained up in a basement or dead is kind of a miracle in itself.

Sorry for the rant. Again, I do like the story really, but it was tough at times to get though, not counting the micromanaging of stats... Also it's kind of shitty how he's kind of guilt tripping Ameliah to join, but I understand she's needed.

*** She's probably pretty mediocre as a Bronze actually, at least compared to other rare classes. Her ability to change skills is amazing but doesn't unlock until Silver. We don't actually know what her original build was, but in addition to perfectly even stats she probably had skills in several minimally-related trees, which means missing out on the ability to stack metamagic.

The build might work well with Rain, since she would be a frontline fighter who can actually benefit from him providing mana, but as a solo warrior it's probably weaker than a well-planned traditional warrior build.

***** Maybe, though considering her father told her how to get her rare bronze class and she did tell Rain that Legendary Silver requires 5 points each in 5 specialization trees, I think it's likely she did do that. Since that's not widely known, I doubt she would imply that its THE way to do it if she had done it a different way. I'd guess that when her dad helped her get her bronze class he also told her to keep putting points in the same five trees (though probably not a full build).

The only "suboptimal" skill we know she took as a Bronze is Purify, and you do get one freebie (5 trees with 5 points each, but you get 26 points to do it).

Rain has been capped for a long time. And sure, he's still figuring stuff out and plot is happening, but he's not getting any stronger. And in a world as explicitly who's-got-the-bigger-stick as a litRPG world, well, that matters.

This is not at all true. He's progressed in quite a few ways. He's trained his stats up, as well as figured out how to raise them further, he got a macro hack, he's got better use of his powers for damage, and he even now leads a group, with quite a haul of money, and the authority that comes from a Custodian plate from the Watch. He's been working on his meditation skills, with obvious future payoff, with additional payoff from the tons of accolades he collected, and he hacked his way into getting Dozer. And that's not even counting the tech progress.

I agree with MilesSand that it's weird [[/r/rational]] is so disappointed he's not just getting points-go-up freebies. Rain has been making large leaps in personal and extrapersonal power, but because his level is unchanged people are treating it like it doesn't count.

******* As I see it the appeal in a ratfic sense is about finding ways to be at the top of the heap without having it granted by the metaphysical forces that rule it all. Rain is doing that. He's being slow and has to earn every baby step, but he's doing it.

As for having a bigger stick he'll never beat any of the big players in a 1 on 1 fight (or a 1 vs hivemind fight in the case of the Citizens). He's a support class while they're all soloists or some variation of soloists. Blues won't help with that. At least until he has a party together, which, he's working on that. Some blue ex machina that sneaks up on him just to die in his face, again, would be pretty lame.

To me, it feels like Rain's stalled because he hasn't gotten much stronger, even within the constraints of his level cap. It's a tough balance to strike -- if he finds some super OP combo or exploit, it feels cheap; if he makes small, incremental progress, it feels slow.

Personally, I would prefer he focused more on the system and I've been strategizing my Patreon subscription whenever the story does that. For example, when he got stuck in the town crystal thing. Interface/system customization is the primary reason I'm reading this story and it's hard to find anything similar. It's also why I don't really mind if he can't level up because he is still growing regardless.

** Rain with a skill swapping friend is going to be fun.

The other thing besides non-synergistic skills is the secrecy about classes and skills. The Guard at least seems to have their standard builds that do useful things, but the guild really should too. Even just having level 5 class picks well known does a big bump for most adventurers.

His ideas on builds may also chance when he finally bumps into the damage cap or see more of the higher level people in action, and learning about their skill mixes.

Also, we have only just started seeing crafting. We've seen stat boosting, and we've seen basic enchantment, but what kinds of things do higher tier crafting skills do? Can you boost skills?

For example, she can do physical training while her mana regens, then magic training while she recovers stamina, while having skills that boost both (Intrinsic Clarity and its equivalents). She can also switch to passive skills when she's not training, maybe even abusing whatever that skill was that gives a huge regen boost but prevents casting.

Well, it won't really help because she is MAD between six stats instead of two. If a Normal Mage is 3:1 then he might run 40 Int 20 Clarity per 60 points. She's going to be running 10/10/10/10/10/10 instead. So relative to their size, her pools recover thrice as fast, but at an absolute rate, they recover half speed.

Whatever the optimal build and optimal set if builds for a party are, they may well include a lot of that sort of hyper specialization.

^{And yes, even though there's probably not an outright "bad" build as long as it's coherent, there's almost certainly an optimal build since the system relies on the illusion of depth through limiting information rather than actual depth through incomparable choices.}

And we get some hard confirmation on Rain's plans for his group. He explicitly states the problem with Awakened and why they can't deal with monsters at higher levels, as both get exponential amounts of strength, which is negligible at lower levels and is apparent at high levels, with most of the humans' strength coming from a synergized party. Crafters, tanks, magical dps, physical dps, ranged and physical attackers, healers, and supports in one party can increase a group's total strength far more than a party of jack of all trades dps, an issue that can't be resolved normally in that world due to its medieval level, exemplified when Rain brings up Tallheart and how Awakened don't have easy access to such a valuable and important power boost, akin to fighting without equipment in normal games. We've already known all this earlier, but it's nice for Rain to explicitly say all that and confirm it.

Now I just wish we'd get on with the action, I want to get back to the theorycrafting and min-maxing in combat. How many more months until we get back to the good part? We've already spent an entire month with Rain stuck in a hole and another month with Rain stuck in a coma, please give us some action.

In the dungeon there should be someone else with actual dungeoneering skills. And occasionally get leveled up with the party's assistance when possible. I don't think the world would be balanced so that every 8th awakened would be a crafter.

Personally I think the story is not going to the direction where Rain gets a big blue again. He has newbies, so they would be trying to get them some levels first. Then they could help him get some levels.

His presence adds a lot of utility that's just not available without a crafter, since bags of infinite carry space are unavailable.

To me at least, the interpersonal parts /are/ the strength of the story:

- As you say, there's political intrigue to spare;

- The sociological aspects are extremely well thought out, and contrast with his beliefs in interesting ways;

- Rain's individual relationships show a lot about him, but importantly the other characters have their own relationships and plans rather than /just/ following his ideas (at worst, most could be their own cliche fantasy protagonists);

- Rain has a strong sense of morality and emotionally intelligent ways of expressing it (to me, both great things in a protagonist).

**** Using Rain's example in story:

If the quest is posted with a reward of 100 tel, then the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get the reward of 100 tel, and the Guild gets the tax of 10% at 10 tel. That's what happens as normal.

But with Rankin's interference, the quest is still posted with a reward of 100 tel, the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get 100 tel, and the guild is told that the quest was worth only 90 tel, and therefore get only 9 tel. That leaves 100 reward tel + 9 tax tel + 1 tel for Rankin which is 110 tel for payers to pay.

In both cases, adventurers and payers all see everything as normal. The only one who is affected, is the Guild. Which makes sense, because adventurers probably also post quests from time to time and would have been suspicious if things were off when they were paying versus earning.

Instead he would keep the price the guild sees the same, and raise the price of setting up a quest by that 10%. That way the guild would not notice anything wrong and come check.

Sure, just by looking at the bonuses that Worker gives would allow him to postulate that such a class exists but I don't believe Rain's the kind of guy to take on those chances. And early on in the story, he went for Clarity mostly because of his mana problem, with aura effectiveness being a lower priority. So it doesn't make sense for him to go Worker imo just because it /might/ lead to a better class, while ignoring his current problems (at that time).

******** Maybe not even with surprise ambush. By this point he's running Detection on a script. By 49 he'd have the mana regen to run it constantly, and the stats needed to parse all that input.

********* True. That's not even taking into account his passives will have boosted up its range to obscene levels. At a certain point Detection comes to resemble a strategic map of the region.

******** Disagree. Everyone else is getting new tricks, not just numbers. Attacks that reduce the effectiveness of immediate healing are already a thing we saw in the chem dungeon iirc. Heck, maybe there's even an aura suppression aura or even an aura reversal aura.

  One that had caught his fancy recently was something that he'd dubbed the ‘passivist'. It was a shame that the pun really only worked in English. It was all about picking up as many passive skills as possible, with only a few actives for utility as well as some pre-combat self-buffs. He had no idea how viable it would be in practice, but on paper it was putting out some impressive numbers at level eighteen. It was a lot more rounded than his own build, with good offense and defense, just a bit lacking in utility.

  Mana Striking was an odd passive that used mana to boost damage on any physical attack, armed or not. Combined with the multiplier from Strength of Arm and a few other things, basic attacks ended up doing a few thousand damage, which was insane. He wasn't that sure of the numbers, just going by the damage of punching practice with Carten as the punching bag.

  Additionally, the build had great staying power. That was thanks to Mute, a skill which tripled all regeneration, health, stamina, and mana. It did this at the cost of temporarily sealing other active skills. He'd heard about Mute a while ago, but as nice as getting another regen multiplier would be, it wasn't compatible with auras. Winter was better after all the boosts he had, but it wasn't surprising that most people went with Mute for recovery between fights. It was a great skill, assuming they were willing to spend the points to unlock the prerequisites. The so-called Passivist would be able to keep it going constantly as it didn't affect passive skills. They'd only need to lower it to recast buffs.

  /Rain shivered again as he looked at the build he'd outlined in his mind. This would trash me in a one-on-one, even with my armor. I wouldn't have a chance, but...imagine if I had one on my team. Velocity alone would be massive, but if I also had Prismatic Intent with Precision, Acuity, and the Imperial Auras... Woof. Crazy./

***** Rain theorycrafted it a couple dozen chapters ago. Essentially, stack as many passive boosts as you can, and also take skills that require the "tradeoff" of not using active skills. It had very good DPS, survivability, and sustainability, and could easily be boosted by Rain's auras.
