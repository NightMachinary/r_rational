Hey folks, author here. If anybody was checking out Floating Point six months ago when the first chapter was submitted to [[/r/rational]], I thought you might like to know the first of three planned novels is now finished, finalized, and ready to read on the website.

[[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint]]

The print/ebook version with bonus material is coming in June, and I've started posting WIPs of chapters from the second book, Revelation of Floating Point. So, good time to get on board.

Thanks!

Blurb: /The digital universe of Netwerk. Thousands of servers, millions of living Programs (the evolutionary descendents of Apps) living in relative disharmony as one massive social network. It's home to individuals seeking love, happiness, madness, trolling, order, stability, lawlessness, anonymity, individually, community, and everything in between. Binary people making binary decisions... but life is what happens between Zero and One. Life happens within the floating point decimals.../


** Any chance we could get a blurb in the main body to know if we'd be interested in clicking through? It's obviously easy for one person to click, but you might get more interest with a quick summary or teaser to entice people in. Kudos on completing a novel!

** So I've started reading this and am very ambivalent.

For one, it feels very preachy, and not necessarily in a good way, but it also feels like the intended target of that preaching is someone other than me, as well. It agonist seems like it's trying to be something akin to a 4chan Bible.

Additionally, the pacing feels someone similar to TV procedurals, where there's an overarching storyline that I'm actually interested in, but which is being developed nearly exclusively in the last 2-3 paragraphs of each chapter.

I'm up to chapter 1.6, and still can't decide if I'm waiting for the story to grab me more, or if this just isn't for me.

[Edit]

So I finished chapter 1.6 - I didn't realize that was the last chapter of the book. The last chapter read a lot better to me, and is likely enough to propel me into reading the next book, for anyone who may be feeling similar to me.

** I agree with nicholas. It was interesting to read but very preachy and many of the characters that weren't trace were holding idiot balls, and even trace was stuck with one when he had the revelation. It felt exciting but ultimately hollow, like a sermon.
