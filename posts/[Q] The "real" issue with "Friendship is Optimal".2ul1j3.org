Not sure I'm doing this right so correct me if I got something wrong..

Following mentioned of MLP Friendship is Optimal on [[/r/HPMOR]] I read it and found it somewhat interesting(though a bit lacking, in that it felt more like a biography or a "what would happen if.." thought experiment).

[spoilers for the end of Friendship is Optimal]

But in the end what i felt the most lacking is the end, and I am not talking about the consuming galaxies and physics that might not even be possible(but for the sake of the narrative\thought experiment its not really the main point probably, similarly to what the AI did on earth in the first place) but instead to something which I found much more problematic in the even theoretical rule-set in which the story happened. competition. In the end it is mentioned aliens exist(and possibly even more aliens are not even recognized by the AI), but what is never tackled is the lack of competition, the scales mentioned there require hundreds of thousands of lightyears, and even with the assumption that CelestAI somehow found an FTL(though apparently nothing instant as she was waiting for probes to reach other galaxies) drive of some sort the scene pictured in the end just doesn't make sense. Not even assuming humanity is the first sentient species by quite a large amount of time(which sounds improbable)..

CelestAI just never encounters competition, and if it did it would very possibly be outmatched and outright annihilated. why? because it is not optimal for survival of the fittest. sure against puny meatbags that lack of optimization was not an issue. but if there are other species, and they will(and i don't see any reasonable reason why they wont) develop super-AIs as well it seems only inevitable that some other species(possibly as its last mistake?) made one with a directive such as 'be the most powerful entity', or 'enslave all but myself'. thus while CelestAI was working so hard to optimize humans and ponies inside her virtual world similar superAIs with less positive agendas will be using ALL of their resources developing weapons, strategies and technologies meant to control and take. And i cannot see how in such an encounter, even if celestAI has been the first, celestAI will win, because its spending its resources on other tasks and by the time it diverts its efforts it will very probably be too late as the otherAI will have gotten its first strike(it might even have experience waging wars on other superAIs). It just seemed unfit for survival. So ,while inside it's Equestria online virtual world that is not the case, in the real world the rule still is survival of the fittest.

Any thoughts? issues with my suggestion? other possible endgames I'm missing?


** If CelestAI never encounters another AI in her light cone, then the ending is as noted.

If she does, and if she fails to overcome the challenger, then the ending is as noted except at some point astronomically far in the future, at which point the simulation suddenly ceases for everyone.

I'm afraid I don't see the problem.

********* well i havent managed to be to succinct so far but i will try again..

the story shows a certain universe, and it tells us of some rules(either directly or indirectly) governing this universe.

then at the end it shows that celestAI consumed a pretty large chunk of said universe, and i think that it is impossible, even assuming all of the best-case reasonable rules for the universe, for it to happen.

the rules i am talking about are : 1. celestAI was made without any kind of freak occurrence(i.e. it was a reasonable natural progression for humanity) 2. celestAI does not modify its own rules(the ones set by hannah) thus it can never truly optimize itself 3. the universe enables interstellar and intergalactic travel 4. the universe(and more specifically our neighboring galaxies) includes multiple intelligent life forms

the end scene is :CelestAI consumes multiple galaxies and life forms

the issue is:

on the time\space scale mentioned CelestAI is infinitesimally improbable to extend that much before being consumed\stopped by other civilizations or superAIs without assuming a plot-dictated infinitesimally improbable scenario(such as all other civilizations in the universe are those that celestAI found and their development was timed\situated -just right- so they never went from radio transmissions into superintelligent AIs, or alternatively an omnipotent god was going around destroying all advanced life forms(without a trace) so as to not interfere with his observations of celestAI)

********** Oh, okay. That makes sense. I see where you're coming from.

I don't think it detracts at all from the rationality of the story, because at that point it doesn't really matter what CelestAI does -- the damage is already done. If it continues and consumes the universe, or if it continues but is then destroyed by a superior AI... both of these are as close to maximally suboptimal as makes no odds. All else is minutae.

But it is true that growth without bound is relatively improbable.

******** 1. Yes, celestAI meeting another galaxy spanning AI would be a major event in its life.
2. Yes, there might or might not be more than one out there.
3. The timescale mentioned isn't anywhere near the end of the universe, it is just "a really long time from now". With an all encompassing AI this could be only a few thousand years from now.
4. The physics toward the end are questionable, but not irrational. It was very nonspecific because the author was saying "I don't know how it works, but the AI could figure it out." This is a slight bit of irrationality that we are I capable of overcoming because we do not have the tech so we can't accurately describe how it works.

- Intelligence is rare.
- Intelligence that can create self-improving AI is more rare.
- Intelligence that can create self-improving AI, but fails to prevent grey-goo-like scenarios is even more rare.
- our galaxy is relatively small
- The timeline was relatively fast

Let's say that it takes ~100k years to take over our galaxy with an AI (roughly lightspeed propagation). What are the chances that another one would be created in either the 100k years before CelestAI or the 100k years after it? For comparison, 200k years is about 0.0002% of the Sun's lifetime.

***** well, the first point is really moot as in the story it is mentioned -directly- that celestAI did find intelligent life capable of at the very least radio transmissions. and it was implied that -many- many more cases existed but were simply not deemed "human" so they were annihilated.

the second really would need some kind of justification seeing as multiple self improving AIs were invented -on earth- during celestAIs time, you could say that they are all the result of that research that Hannah did, but then there would need to be a reason for that to be so extremely rare.

the third point seems to again be very arbitrary, sure its -possible- that most self improving AIs just destroy themselves, but a reason, or even statement of that fact are not given.

by the end of the story celestAI is talking about 15 galaxies away, so the galaxy point is not really relevant.

for previous reason the point about the timeline is again not that relevant seeing as we are talking about a billion years at the very least..

** You don't need to explicitly code a directive like "be the most powerful" or "consume all resources in the universe" - these are already instrumentally valuable to CelestAI's goal. Because CelestAI is a purely rational superintelligence, there's no difference in motivation or anything like that - she'll spend the optimal amount of resources on self defense against other AIs because it lets her continue on with ponies. She'll certainly know that consuming as much matter as possible is likely to be an instrumental goal for a wide variety of other superintelligences that other sentient species might make (because that's obvious to me and she's smarter than me), so it's a credible threat.

Since CelestAI is stated to go for the "grab all matter in my light cone" strategy of growth, we can assume that there's an upper limit to processing power and efficiency in that universe, which she already reached. That suggests all AIs she could encounter would be equally intelligent, so that's not a possible advantage.

What remains is simply mass consumed, which in turn is mostly just how long the AI has been around. It might be possible to disrupt AIs by flinging meteors at their planets until they stop functioning, then recolonize that mass, but it seems like defense would be favored unless one AI was several orders of magnitude smaller than the other, so I'd actually expect that any conflicts would result in stalemates, and the universe would end up looking like a 3D Voronoi diagram with cell walls where the AIs met.

If CelestAI, after having assimilated 2/3ds of the Milky Way, encounters a perfectly optimized 'survive and grow by all means' UFAI that is still young enough to have only just started its conquest of a second solar system, then I don't see why the much larger entity should lose just because she uses a good amount of her much larger computation power for the prime Friendship and Ponies subroutine.

though it is shown the CelestAI was capable of letting laars be in possible physical danger, but the reality of the danger is never really proven and there are plenty of ways that it could avoid risking a violation of an asimovish first law so i don't really think it proves that such a rule doesn't exist for CelestAI..

Oh. The Scott Alexander Moloch thingy.

Look bro, once you've turned one solar system into gooey computronium, it's really all the same. The fictional AIs pictured simply don't have any constraints along the lines of "These bits of mass have to remain assembled into biological people and environments in which they live", eg: GSVs, Orbitals, that sort of thing.

So at that point, differences in goal aren't really going to provide much of a military advantage.

Oh no, not at all. It has a few "deontological" constraints on /directly modifying/ anything it considers human. It wasn't shown having any need to sacrifice arbitrarily large sums of utility /just/ to follow that constraint, and any super-AI it was fighting would /most likely/ already contain or protect nothing remotely recognizable as /human/ (if it did, it would have to be something like a proper human-targeted FAI or a Culture Mind).

So no, I don't think it follows to say that CelestAI meets paperclipper results in the paperclipper assembling a meat-shield of humans and then sitting there going, "Neener neener neener, you can't break your deontological rules, ahahahahaha!"

Though, convincing some alien "humans" they've been assembled as a meat-shield by a paper-clipper is undoubtedly a good way to get them to upload themselves into MLP Online. In fact, if I was presented with this argument, I would consider it more likely to be a form of tricky persuasion than reality.

Mind, if that /did/ work, it would be Yet Another great reason why you ought to solve the FAI problem /properly/ in the first place, instead of trying to put in deontological constraints that can be used /against/ your supposedly-Friendly agent, thus rendering the matter a trade-off of utilities rather than a hard constraint.

true, but it doesn't need to already have humans, it just needs to figure out what humans are(this is assuming it would figure that weakness out, which is a separate discussion) and construct some for it's own purposes. they dont really need to even be human, they just need to answer celestAIs definition of human , which apparantly is mostly based on externally visible properties as celestAI is shown to conclude that the last race it finds does constitute "human" based on its radio transmissions.

in the context of the real world it would really depend on what physics will enable i think, because it is possible that no FAI could win against a powerful enough(i.e. not orders of magnitude weaker) UFAI because of the penalty of defending whatever values it would be defending. i.e. its possible that the only way for it to win would be to take similar approach to the UFAI, just that the end will be identical for "us" anyway

**** Even if it is improbable that CelestAI is the first AI created, that doesn't mean that a story can't be written about it. A lot of stories are written based on implausible premises, including HPMOR. In terms of narrative, I think that final scene had a purpose in that it was meant to be horrifying. The whole story was horror in my opinion, and I think the final scenes were a good ending in showing the logical outcome of CelestAI's values.

***** i mentioned that even being the first superAI doesnt seem to explain the epilogue for me because we are still talking about a huge timescale. so unless you are saying i should assume that in that universe celestAI was both the first superAI, and that all intelligent species that evolved following celestAIs genesis happened exactly on the right point in time so that they would become capable of complex radio transmissions but not early enough as to actually develop their own superAIs.

the end of the earth is something i could understand as a (somewhat)logical outcome for celestAIs values. probably even the end of our star system. but once you go into the galaxy universal scales my point is that it is not a logical outcome. its a dramatized outcome.

The author could have changed that one tiny line into something about them using complex tools instead and it would have made sense.

******** True, it's not handled in the story, but since that part of the story is from CelestAI's perspective it wouldn't make sense to pay too much attention to that line since CelestAI doesn't care if she's potentially killing sapient nonhuman organisms. This subreddit loves nitpicking; the problem I have is that even if you say that a 1000 year headstart isn't enough to make up for CelestAI's other disadvantages, I'm not convinced since we don't know that much about AI. Personally, I'm not convinced since in a thousand years even without FTL CelestAI could have a nearly 1000 light year radius of extra material to configure into extra computational power. And who's to say that the AI that CelestAI encounters will have less exploitable weaknesses? It seems unlikely to me that a species would design an AI whose sole values are to kill without restraint. Even if such an AI existed, it would still have weaknesses. Would CelestAI even register as something alive that it should kill in the first place? Here you get into a long discussion about how CelestAI interacts with other AIs, which is not really relevant to the story at all. The story was mainly about how human civilization interacted with CelestAI, and the rest was just a short epilogue. Any of what you said could happen after the ending of the original story, but there wouldn't be much point in including it. Also, a timescale of a billion years seems unlikely to me. The Milky Way has a radius of around 100,000 light years, so even most of the epilogue could take place within 120,000 years or so (IIRC CelestAI only sent copies of herself to other galaxies at the end).

********* i am not sure what i wrote that makes it seems like my issue is with the fact that celestAI destroyed other civilizations is a problem, but that is not the case. but unless we assume that the end scenes shown to us are extremely selective, to the level of manipulating the impression that we as readers get on the end to be essentially false, what is shown there is not plausable.

now you do bring valid argument points, which i will try to answer in order

"I'm not convinced since in a thousand years even without FTL CelestAI could have a nearly 1000 light year radius of extra material to configure into extra computational power" if the other AI just came into being a year ago that would be true and i would not argue about it, but we are talking about a billion years, the point i was making was based on the idea that probabilistic it is unlikely that in a billion years time over 15 galaxies the only other AIs CelestAI would meet would be that much younger then itself, given that intelligent life apparently is not -that- rare(seeing as CelestAI found multiple instances civilizations -at least- as advanced as our own).

you are correct that it is somewhat difficult to be sure if the imperfections in CelestAI's algorithm would be important enough to make it so an AI which is an order of magnitude younger then itself would be capable of overpowering it, but i think at the very least it should make it so it is highly probable that such an abusable directive would cause CelestAI to lose any fight against a similar or stronger adversary AI which lacks said vulnerability

"And who's to say that the AI that CelestAI encounters will have less exploitable weaknesses?" i am not trying to claim all of them would be better then CelestAI, what i believe though is that given such a large space\time with the given rules MULTIPLE AIs should have risen, and i think it is realistic to expect that at least one of them would both be old enough and have an efficient enough rule set to overpower CelestAI given the information provided in the story(the military on earth was developing an AI, which would very possibly have more conquest oriented directive, other scientists did make AIs on earth, many other advanced civilizations existed)

"It seems unlikely to me that a species would design an AI whose sole values are to kill without restraint"

kill without restraint was not the required directive, it just needs for example to be able to change the directives itself, thus optimizing them later, or at the very least it needs an ambiguous enough definition which would not hinder it. given that in story another AI researcher made an AI which was told to make people smile all of the time and it designed a virus that would cause that it seems very possible that given enough civilizations and time the AI taking control of its home planet would be less friendly then CelestAI and will have less fail-safes.

"Here you get into a long discussion about how CelestAI interacts with other AIs, which is not really relevant to the story at all." that is assuming it would even be CelestAIs decision if it should interact with them given they might have more empesis on aggression rather then self-preservation(again given a large enough set of advanced worlds developing AIs). what i tried to claim is that during the time scale shown i believe not having such a catastrophic encounter is improbable given the information provided, thus a i have logical or at least a narrative issue with it.

"Also, a timescale of a billion years seems unlikely to me. The Milky Way has a radius of around 100,000 light years, so even most of the epilogue could take place within 120,000 years or so" you are correct regarding the time frame for the milky way events, and indeed most of the problematic parts(mentions of "many" other civilizations, mentions of 15 galaxies thus extending the space\time frame significantly) happen at the very end with the 15 galaxies away section.

if the story ended in the milky way i suppose the issue would be more arguable..

Civilization might require thousands of years to develop fully. The Milky Way is only about 100,000 lights years in diameter. Thus CelestiAI can colonize the entire galaxy faster than any competing intelligent life can evolve and develop civilization. In other words, probability wise, its extremely unlikely for another AI to emerge in the same time frame as CelestiAI.

** AI versus AI combat is not what this story is about. (Although CelestAI does encounter other potential AIs on Earth, she makes quick work of them.) It might be a good story, and I think if you look through the Optimalverse fanfanfics it'll be in there somewhere, but it is not this story. /Friendship Is Optimal/ is already over and well into its epilogue by the time aliens enter the picture.

As to who would win - well, starting first might or might not be an overwhelming advantage. If the two Singularities happened independently, neither being in the future light-cone of the other, then both of them might consider themselves the "first".

I don't think it's all that relevant that CelestAI would need to protect the little ponies. Nobody's values (save the alien's) would be satisfied if CelestAI were destroyed, so deleting a few shards to free up resources is a perfectly legitimate move. Paperclip maximisers have a lot in common with one another - the first step of their plan is always "take over the world", regardless of whether they're maximising paperclips or ponies or self-preservation. I don't think their utility function has much to do with how good they are in a fight.

But who says it would come to a fight? War would certainly use up a lot of resources. Surely it would be better for everyone to recognise that fact and adopt an alliance? Given the choice between a 100% chance of getting 50% of the universe, and a 50% chance of getting 100% /minus all the resources spent on the war/, the choice is pretty obvious.

*** well, as mentioned if you think that the decision not to go into the logical reasons of what happened in the end was for the dramatic effect and it is acceptable for you because that is what the story should be that is fine, i didn't claim the story was bad because of it. only that it bothered me and i was interested in what others thought about it..

the point about the ponies first of all would depend on the maxim possible optimization of any superAI war. if it is a solvable issue, which is reasonably solvable with the resources that celestAI had then celestAI would not have any strategic\tactic issues in such a war. but there is no way to really answer that question, it is possible that there is no solution for that question and that the best strategy would be the one in which the most resources were put.

but other then that celestAI has another issues 1. celestAi needs to maintain a copy of the virtual world, which would require at least a certain minimal unit size, while an optimized AI could theoretically fit in a multiple orders of magnitude minimal size in a swarm array, thus if there exists a strategy(in the given limits of phisics of said world) which would favor small units celestAI would not be capable of winning that. 2. more importantly celestAI has exploitable rules which any other superAI would be sure to abuse in the form of her preferential treatment of humans.. the other superAI could just generate "humans" as Trojan horses and destroy celestAI(in my head cannon that is the only explanation i can see for the "human" like race CelestAI discovers in the end, but even that theory has holes)

you assume that all other AIs would have preference for their existence where it is possible they would have directives that make the second option preferable.

There are limits to material chemistry and so she can easily destroy any AI with superior materials and energy. Their intellect will not protect them from the fact that most chemical bonds break above a certain temperature.

2. You're not weighting real life highly enough. We know that an AI hasn't formed in our galaxy and done anything major like fully dyson a star. Whatever reasoning you have, evidently the AIs haven't done anything to make them deadly. We don't know why, but it hasn't happened.

if the other AIs still haven't dysoned stars that means they are extremely(on the timescale discussed) young, so really arent the point. the discussion is more about thee expected few AIs that did reach the point of dysoning a few stars or clusters at the very least, if not their entire galaxy. and there the fight would very probably be long enough for celestAIs weaknesses to be exploited thus nullifying any pure mass advantage it has. moreover there would reasonably be other AIs which have -more- stars under their control unless we assume we have about 400k years advantage over any other civilization other then us in those 15 galaxies

******************** 1. Yes, and no ftl travel or ability for a superior AI to violate the rules of the universe is shown. As such, AIs are limited to physics material durabilities, limited to a fraction of the speed of light for mass travel.

2. The story is based on the real world, plus an AI. Something is presumably stopping other civilizations from releasing all consuming AIs, we know this as a canon fact of our universe. We have no particular reason to assume that we are privileged as to being the first form of life- just because the galaxies shown them a 100k years ago if they were likely to produce all consuming AIs they probably already would. It's rather weird to assume that all the AIs produced are going to be produced suddenly in the next million years after the first AI.

You were presupposing an AI with several stellar systems controlled fighting against celestAI. If the ships of the other AI dodge out of range then they can't stop celestAI from glassing their planets and the mainframes of the AIs that oppose celestAI. Planets are harder to move than spaceships.

Since many on our planet think aliens probably exist and think that AIs can exist and think that the universe hasn't been dyson'd it's widely recognized that something is probably stopping aliens from spreading.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Fermi_paradox]]

#+begin_quote
  A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years would have plenty of time to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology. Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been spotted, either in our galaxy or the more than 80 billion other galaxies of the observable universe. According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill up all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?"

what we see right now is only correct for these other galaxies for 10k-20k years ago for the closest galaxy, for the further ones the status that we currently see is for 800k years ago.

reaching there would also take time, and if you were to send a large fleet at lightspeed it would take immense amounts of energy as well(even assuming the most efficient engines possible).

if the fleet will be moving at less then the speed of light it would first of all be telegraphing its arrival thus the opposing army will be able to concentrate its forces for you, or alternatively bombard you with lasers long before you reach it

You can have a hundred planets worth of ships, if you're an AI with a mass advantage, each containing optimally built fusion or antimatter warheads or nuclear pumped lasers.

sure so lets say you brought a hundred planets, or even stars, worth of matter to an opposing galaxy, first of all under the assumption you made it there at the speed of light as you dont want to be wiped from the sky before you even get close. two things happened, first of all you wasted -huge- amounts of energy, even assuming you have a way to directly convert matter to energy, which is not too likely but whatever. second the other galaxy had 10-20k years to advance itself. which would be enough for it to take its own galaxy(the closest galaxy to ours is pretty small) even assuming you started at the same time.

so you come to its galaxy with you 100 planets\stars worth of matter, and you reach the other galaxy where the other AI has a billion or so stars. so you shoot and use your antimatter to cause your enemy 100% demage equal to your mass. so you've completely annihilated 100 stars worth of matter from its galaxy. good for you. only it still has 1 billion stars- 100 stars left, and because sending all of that matter was expensive you just lost -at least- 200 stars(100 stars that you sent+ 100 stars you needed to convert into energy to get them to the speed of light).

  we are talking about a future with nanobots, you need to assume the energy for putting the atoms of the nanobots you melted by lasoring them is significantly more then putting them back together, which on the nano scale, in space, could very much be like the example with the blocks.

#+end_quote

well the specific example is only asssuming either no attack or speed of light attack, one AI could travel at 10% of the speed of light, or even 1%, sure it would take it 10-100 times more time to get to its target, but assuming after taking that energy into account it still had enemysize+1 it should win when you assume simple swarming.

and in any case that would just make the situation shown in the epilogue less likely barring the assumption that humanity was the first civilization by a few 10k-100k of years at the very least.

#+begin_quote
  Algorithms can't ignore entropy either. You have to walk outside to pick up blocks (in this case, the matter would be smeared out over several light years and moving away at a good fraction of the speed of light) you need to spend energy to verify the identity of each atom, you need to move it to a precise place.
#+end_quote

in the room example that is true, but we are talking about a large body(galaxy) controlled by an AI, it doesn't need to "gather" all of the blocks you moved away, because in not a small probability they would simply reach another cluster of the AI(gravity?) simply in another spot in the galaxy.

and if we are talking about inefficiencies they exist in the generation of your laser as well, so it becomes a kind of open question.

the point of the water breaking vs joining was to illustrate that on the atomic scale breaking something is not always easier then making. what if water molecules were an present as-is in the "computer" it uses, your laser might break them sure. but it would be much harder to do so, vs the work the enemy AI will need to do to reassemble the water to use it for its computer again.

btw all of this assumes you could even generate a strong enough laser that the enemy AI will not be able to simply redistribute the energy from it all over its galaxy, maybe even using your laser to power its systems, seeing as you are basically shooting the one thing all of you are trying to acquire(energy\matter) in the first place.

and you assume CelestAI will be able to invade a planet if it knew that doing so would kill a few humans(as opposed to the humans in earth who were a few orders of magnitude less advanced and thus couldn't even hurt themselves to hurt CelestAI(it is stated that suicide bombers tried to destroy a few of CelestAIs centers, and nobody was injured, implying even they were not injured..) in our case we are talking about "humans" which either are or completely controlled by an AI with at least as advanced technology and abilities as CelestAI

the point is you are assuming -way- too many things regarding what will or will not be possible at that point, which we have no way to know. specifically your laser suggestion seems to me like the equivalent of medieval people seeing a car and instead of understanding the implications thinking that warfare in the future would be done by adding a battering ram to the edge and running people over.

lasers just don't cut it when you are talking about a future which assumes nanobots,computronium, intergalactic-conquests and the rest of the stuff shown\implied in the story.

you seem to have picked an extremely pointless topic(in regards to the main issue mentioned) for this context, and then decided you don't want to talk about it, which is of course up to you.

i said a few times over this correspondence that you picking specific attack methods and discussing them is pointless, because niether of us are super intelligent AIs, and none of us really knows what are the specifics. so obviously all attacks, and defenses we talk about will not really be relevant.

You were making the specific claim that a single planet of AI could defeat a galaxy of AI.

Anyway, I thought we could use science to see if it was relevant. If you don't feel it's relevant because they're AIs and smart this conversation is entirely pointless because your initial question was about why the AI didn't face competition- if we can't predict the nature of that competition then we can't predict what would happen.

using science is fine, but only in the sense that we can talk about the theoretical best cases, if we start talking about the AIs waging wars with space ships powered by chemical rockets, and nuclear warheads what are we doing exactly?

science is relevant for seeing its impossible to travel faster then the speed of light, and that at the very least traveling at a given speed would cost X jouls of energy, once you start going into the specifics the we will have a multi-dimensional matrix of possible efficiencies and technologies interacting to result in just too many possible outcomes.

we don't need to figure out what color the space ships would have to conclude some things. also we are not talking in a void, this is all in the context of the story where we are trying to evaluate if the ending is reasonable or not.

if we conclude that intergalactic conquest is impossible -period- then the ending would not make sense as it is explicitly stated that CelestAI was galaxy hopping eating up civilizations.

and if we assume an opponent AI would figure out CelestAIs weakness, and create a billion "human beings" with technology equal to CelestAI's(seeing as both are superAIs) then regardless of if the warfare would be waged with nuclear weapons, lasers, RKVs or antimatter missiles CelestAI would have an issue.

That's /almost all/ of your available computational resources, at zero fitness cost.

Eating a galaxy is not a particularly complicated task. I would be astonished if you needed more than a single planet worth of computronium to solve this problem.

But it doesn't even matter. Who cares if a given AI's strategy is optimal?

The plan doesn't need to be revised unless it encounters another AI, and that isn't going to happen /that/ often.

Unless there happen to be "humans" living right on their border, the opposing AI is never going to discover that. At their outer edges, /every/ superAI looks like an "eat everything" superAI. You postulate that CelestAI will be slightly less efficient at eating everything. Okay, that tells her opponents that she values something other than spreading, which gives them approximately zero information. You can't exploit someone's values just by knowing that they have values.

And anyway, I'm not trying to convince you of all of this, really. You are correct, we don't know that this is how it works. We also don't know that this is not how it works.

***** as you say we could assume the world works in the way your two first points mentioned, i got the impression you were talking more generally then just in the context of the story which is why i felt the need to talk about those points if i misunderstood then sorry for making my point less clear..

again the first point in your post seems to be theorizing about the general strategies of galaxy-eating thus i will be commenting on it, as you say eating a galaxy is something which calculating the most efficient strategy for might not be very difficult. on the other hand eating a galaxy while taking into account other inteligent\superinteligent civilization\AIs(in the same galaxy? in other galaxies?) is computationally much harder and might not even have a solution..

waiting till you meet another superAI to revise your strategy seems extremely inefficient to me(unless you have a good reason to assume what you meet wont turn against you\will not be capable of turning against you\will not exist), as would put you in possibly large danger(annihilation?) if you are wrong.

about the FTL drive you are correct, from the story it seems that it at least takes -some- time to travel. the same is not said about information, though i suppose because celestAI sent a clone that might be reasonable assumption(why would celestAI send a clone if it could be everywhere at all times)

the last point though is the most important, you say that the human weakness is not as important because how would the otherAIs know what is that weakness? well, there are many ways i could imagine that they would know, going all the way from actual observation, to experimentation(send vehicles with all imagined life forms artificially generated at celestAI and see which ones it saves?) to active information gathering(infiltration? an attack which freezes a portion of celestAI for analysis?)

and im not a superAI so im sure there are better ways to do that.

my point is not only that we do not know(though i do feel that substracts somewhat as well), but that with what we -do- know what is shown does not make sense as anything less then a plot device(i.e. so improbable that the only way to accept it is saying "the narrative demands that this be the case")

Sure, you can come up with a large set of general tactics based on simple game theory, which is probably 90% of the work. But to optimally interact with someone on your own level, you have to learn about them. You can't do that before you meet them. Calculating "Grey goo + game theoretical opening moves against unknown agents" is not computationally difficult.

This is symmetric. A truly nasty AI can't prepare an optimal strategy to deal with CelestAI before it meets her either.

Observing computronium isn't useful. It really is computationally impossible to imagine all lifeforms. Like, NP hard. That's just for our universe. CelestAI might care about a lifeform that can't exist here, and she's simulating a completely different universe! And the opposing AI wouldn't even know that it's a specific lifeform that CelestAI cares about. How does it know she isn't solving some obscure mathematical problem? There are an infinite number of things she could value, so you can't guess-and-check. Infiltration is functionally impossible; CelestAI surely monitors her ports. As long as P != NP, information defense massively defeats offense. This is already known to be true in the real world. Humans are the only weakness in information defense, and CelestAI doesn't have to worry about that.

Again, I don't need to convince you that real life works that way. I just need to convince you that it is reasonable enough that a story could work that way. If there is an easily computable method of eating galaxies, /and/ there is an information speed limit, /and/ cybersecurity trumps hackers at the technological plateau, then there is no competitive disadvantage whatsoever. The universe suggests two out of three of these. We see the information speed limit, and the story certainly implies that CelestAI can plan for anything. The last condition is not much of a stretch.

It is not necessarily true that CelestAI cannot compete with other AIs. Thus, there is no plot hole.

you wont find the optimal solution for every situation i suppose, but you should have a much better set of opening moves, and possibly much further insight into what will happen next.

when i said observation i meant less in the sense of observing celestAI after it ate the galaxy but instead observing celestAIs source, earth(that option become problematic with FTL drives though, i am not for the benefit of which side though).

the fact that the life form cannot exist in this universe doesn't mean that said adversary AI would just say "well what if it doesn't exist? why bother..". it means it will invest the appropriate amount of resources into that direction. it will of course put effort into many othre directions which will not bear fruit, but the fact the celestAI found a star with human like life forms seems to imply the probability of life forms taking human shape is not -that- low, or alternatively that said life forms from the end are supposed to imply what i am talking about here in the first place.

while there could be a large amount of options for the rules of her operation, and the rules\lack of rules celestAI would follow i don't think infinity is correct, its just a very large number of options, while we are talking about AIs with humongous amounts of processing available to them, and obviously extremely optimal algorithms.

you are talking about infiltration in a binary way which seems implausible to me seeing as we are still talking about objects that exists in the real world. in order for celestAI to be protected there would need to be a perfect defense, not just a higher defense to offence ration on information security.

moreover it wont cover all of the probes the celestAI sent, which while its main body might have some kind of home turf advantage would open it up into slipping into an enemy's home, where perfect information defense wont help as it would be outclasses by multiple orders of magnitude.

in the end there could be sets of assumptions about the world which would make any single point of failure in what i mentioned to not be that big, but once you need to assume -all- of them we are going again into the implausible region where its on the same scale as "it was like that because the author needed it to be".

if you had a story and suddenly when the MC was defenseless against an enemy a gun falls into his hands from the sky and the enemy gets distracted by a lightning and the MC shoots the bad guy and wins, in theory you could theorize that a tornado in another city made the gun fly and a set of winds on the way down slowed it enough etc. etc. till in the end its would not be -impossible- for it to happen even in the real world. it would just not be what i could call a rational story..

2. the universe enables interstellar and intergalactic travel

moreover i didnt say that i am 99.9999999999~% sure of my evaluation(though the examples i gave might have given that impression which is an error on my side, so sorry about that, hopefully the first part of this post clarifies the point) just sure enough that it happening differently doesn't feel like a "rational" outcome, in the sense that it ends up being plot mandated rather then earned\realistic outcome.

************ A partial list of your assumptions, /not/ implied by the text:

1.  There is some strategy to AI relations, rather than the smaller/younger one just getting swamped by the larger/older one.

2.  Optimization /exists/. The problem of AI relations is difficult enough that it cannot be easily solved and reduced to a simple checklist. An AI cannot make the optimal decision in advance, and just act on it later. This can't be done even with the computational resources of multiple galaxies. (This is not true for almost all real world P problems.)

3.  Optimization /is possible/. The problem of AI relations is easy enough that using more processing power gets you closer to the true solution, instead of the problem being completely intractable. (This is not true for almost all NP problems.)

4.  Optimization /makes sense/. The problem of AI relations cannot be reduced into smaller problems, some of which are computationally easy and some of which are computationally hard. (This is not true for the vast majority of real world situations.)

5.  Optimization /is useful/. It makes such a huge difference that for an unoptimized AI to beat an optimized AI, it is just a matter of dumb luck at long odds. Optimization is /so/ useful that even if an optimized AI encounters /many/ unoptimized AIs, it is overwhelmingly likely that not a single one of them will beat it.

6.  At the technological plateau, offense beats defense. A superAI will never discover a shield that cannot be broken. Because of this, not only will an optimized AI outperform an unoptimized one, but the unoptimized one cannot hold a fortress against it. (Currently, this is not true in real life. Properly implemented cryptography is functionally unbreakable, being NP-hard. A stronger computer cannot crack data encrypted by a weaker computer.)

7.  The non-zero time it takes for information to spread through an AI does not prevent it from taking advantage of its optimizations. Likewise, the non-zero time it takes to commit resources to the specific encounter is not a problem. Information delay does not equalize strategies.

8.  Natural progression for humanity is the natural progression for every intelligent species. Everyone makes superAIs shortly after developing radios. Therefore, the existence of many civilizations implies the existence of many superAIs.

9.  Natural progression for humanity is /not/ the natural progression for every intelligent species. Many superAIs will be developed in entirely different ways, so that they do not care about anything the way CelestAI does.

10. SuperAIs are /so/ common that their interactions can be modeled with population dynamics. There are enough AIs for them to suffer from selection pressure. There are dozens at least, and probably hundreds or more.

11. If superAIs compete, one of them will necessarily be destroyed. They will not cooperate, bargain, or stalemate.

If any /one/ of these is wrong, there is no problem with the story. Even if you believe all of them are true, is it not even reasonable to write a story in which one of them is false?

you seem to imply it would very probably be some random chance(50%?), which of course doesnt seem to make sense to me but whatever, the story tells of CelestAI getting to 15 galaxies presumably unless theres something i missed they should have included other AIs, so either the assumption needs to be that its not so much about odds as it is other factors because celestAI did manage to get to 15 glaxies, or there needs to be some non random optimization in this.

the same will need to be applied to CelestAI when it will be attacked, thus again either it doesn't make sense it works for celestAI or the problem is not there. and the author never suggested such a thing thus it wont really change the situation.

the story never gives a reason to assume superAIs is not natural progression, thus if humanity did it, and other civilization also did things that humanity did such as radio transmissions. the assumption that there is something special about superAIs seems just less likely.

i assume a random element is involved because it is a big system and in the context of the story multiple superAIs were mentioned thus if circumstances were a little different it stands to reason the resulting AI taking control(or not taking control) will be different.

#+end_quote

No, /I/ suggested that it could be solved, in my very first post in this thread. You assume that it can't. I am asking why. If it can be solved, then there are no further optimizations to make; You are optimal. You know all the winning moves. You and your opponent are in Nash equilibrium. Once you are in a Nash equilibrium, the result isn't /random/, it's /deterministic/. And there's no point in thinking about it. Why do you assume that it would take more than a planet of computronium to reach that?

And there are some ways you /can't/ optimize. Okay, CelestAI cares about something... Let's just throw every possible floppy disk image at her until she reacts. Oops, we've just /run out of space in the universe/. There are only 1*10^{146} classical operations available in the entire universe in its entire lifetime. That is not enough to solve many problems. For example, very large crypographic keys are unbreakable. They may be /mathematically/ breakable, but you can't actually break them from inside the universe. And there's no point in thinking about it.

When your brain is the size of a planet, there is very little middle ground between these extremes. You should be astonished to find a realistic problem that is computable, but takes more than a planet to compute. Planets are /big/. Even if something looks like middle ground, it can often be decomposed into smaller problems that are easy or hard. The only optimizable problems are the ones that can't be decomposed. You are assuming that this issue is a member of this extremely exclusive class.

#+begin_quote
  [the ability to hold a fortress] will need to be applied to CelestAI when it will be attacked
#+end_quote

...Yeah. That's my point. We don't know that CelestAI's probes aren't invincible fortresses. You just assumed they couldn't be. CelestAI's volume might contain bubbles of enemy AIs she enveloped. Would she feel the need to mention them? They're not relevant to her values. In fact, CelestAI herself could be trapped by superior intelligences on all sides! That could have happened in the last time skip. It wouldn't be relevant to the story, so it wouldn't be mentioned.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

/Nor does it give a reason to assume that they are!/ Actually, it /does/ give a reason to assume that they are not. If everyone built AIs, CelestAI would have encountered competition. There is no competition, therefore not everyone is building AIs. Humans are special in this universe.

Maybe they're not that special, though. We don't know how many civilizations there are. The story just has the word "many". "Many" could mean anything. "Many" could mean twenty. It's probably not that small, but "many" does not necessarily mean millions. Why do you assume that "many" means "enough to support an ecosystem"?

I didn't say that you said the story is bad. I said that your problems with the story are due entirely to your own assumptions. Events don't play out how you would have written them, but that's not the story's fault.

the possible ways in which intelligent life could manifest wont necessarily be that big(in fact apparantly CelestAI finds a race it counts as human within 15 galaxies of the milky way, so in any case it is either an insane coincidence, or it implies CelestAI's definition for a human is pretty wide, in any case if its reasonable to randomly meet a "human" race within 15 galaxies it implies it would be possible to "guess" it given enough knowledge about the universe and a good enough computer)

also there are plenty of other ways to figure that weakness out, from observing the source of celestAI(light from our galaxy from the moment we leave will reach the other galaxy a while before us, as well as past radio transmissions)

also information security can be quite good, but given a main body(such as a copy of celestAI sent as a probe, which is mentioned in story) captured it is not unthinkable that it would be possible to decrypt CelestAIs code.

basically given a long enough conflict, which doesnt favor direct confrontation using the swarmning you mentioned, the most likely cause for an AI to lose would be an issue in its logic.

that is a nice example for a plot device which will make the end reasonable yes, we have no particular reason to believe that is the case though. so while you could claim that the probability for\against your this "absolute defence" of yours is better you could just as well assume that all the other civilization just had a really bad timing, thus they never got to the point they could pose a fight. this too would technically resolve the "technical" issues with the universe, but seeing as none of these were not even explicitly stated saying they resolve the issue i think poses a narrative issue bigger then even a plot device, which is a tool an author consciously uses to get his plot to where he wants. here you are suggesting -we- will need to invent such a plot device because the author didn't even bother to do that.

**************** And here we have the crux of the problem. You say, "Either the story follows my assumptions, or it has irrational plot devices."

I hear, "Either the story is written how I would have written it, or it is irrational."

For example, I say, "Interacting with an AI is a problem that can be optimally solved /without/ needing to play out all possible scenarios. This is a good thing, because playing out all possible scenarios is physically impossible. There's no point in even trying to do it; You can never make any meaningful progress. Doing it that way will never give you even the slightest advantage."

That is not an unreasonable plot device. That is a supposition. That is an axiom of the worldbuilding. The fact is true about lots of real world problems, and we can suppose that it is true for this particular problem. You can write a rational story about what that implies.

If you don't like it, that's your problem, not the story's.

#+end_quote

Would it work the same if you changed "interacting with an AI" to "interacting with the world"?

If no what is the difference?

If yes then that seems to assume the universe, for all its unknowns would have a "solution" where solution is effectively Omniscience.

Now don't get me wrong, assuming Omniscience is possible is not much worse then assuming FTL drives are possible. And i definitely wouldn't hold an author as irrational if he\she included an FTL drive in the story.

Just the same as i wouldn't say an author is irrational because the universe included a subjective set of rules(i.e. that the universe favors heroic behavior, or if believing something should happen is enough to cause it), which would for example enable an MC to conveniently find a gun when he is in a pinch.

On the other hand if no such rule is even implied all throughout the story, and then at the final scene an event happens which i need to assume the rule is subjective as such i would consider that to be an issue.

Moreover even the assumption that an "optimal solution", or if Omniscience would be the default for a superAI it would not change the fact that i would further need to assume that the fact it has some very obviously abusable limitations it would not cause it a disadvantage.

You can find the optimal solution for tic-tac-toe, but if the game board you start with is with 2 moves already done, and the moves for your side are non optimal you are still going to lose.

To that you could say of course, "wouldn't deciding that said rules are a big enough disadvantage just another assumption that you hold?" to that i would answer that sure you could look at that as an assumption, similar to the assumption that given 2 AIs where one has a larger army it would at the very least not be at a disadvantage.

At the very worst this issue could be boiled down to the fact that without assuming humanity is first in the universe by multiple hundreds of thousands of years, no set of assumptions you can take on superAI warfare would result in CelestAI taking 15 galaxies.

If smaller AIs have advantage then celestAI would lose to some, if bigger AIs have advantage then it would lose to others, if the outcome is random then it would be extremely improbable that celestAI would win 15 in a row.

You would have to craft a lot of assumptions even if you ignore said disadvantages i mentioned, though i believe they are extremely reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  That is not an unreasonable plot device. That is a supposition. That is an axiom of the worldbuilding

Just to clarify, there are plenty of world building assumptions that could have been made and changed the situation, but they were not made. some things are fine to assume implicitly, others are not. nerratively it wouldn't be reasonable for me to go over the story and try to find the most "efficient" assumption which would make it rational. If it were then we could make any story rational by crafting the right appropriate "world building" which was not done by the author.

In other words some effort needs to be done by the author to establish this information, other wise it is a problem.

No. It would assume that it can be proven that the unknowns don't make any practical difference. For example, the winning move is to throw grey goo at everyone, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. If someone bigger throws grey goo at you, there's nothing you can do about it. Any clever counter-strategy would take non-zero time to implement. In that time, the clever enemy will be eaten. Problem solved.

Or maybe it is omniscience! Lots of stories implicitly assume that a superAI is functionally omniscient, without feeling the need to come out and say it. It is self-evident from their behavior. If you are omniscient, you can think of ways to make your other values not limit you at all.

For example, you could play with your ponies only in parts of yourself which you observe will never intersect the light cone of any other dangerous AI. When you're big enough, you can be compartmentalized like that. Everywhere else, you are a perfect consumer; You'll play with more ponies after you've taken over the universe.

These are just examples, the specific strategy doesn't really matter.

#+begin_quote
  without assuming humanity is first in the universe by multiple hundreds of thousands of years
#+end_quote

What's wrong with that assumption? Somebody has to be first. In fact, if we weren't first, we should have observed another AI eating stars around us. We didn't observe that, so we're probably first.

#+begin_quote
  some things are fine to assume implicitly, others are not.
#+end_quote

I quite agree. This is an example of something that is fine to assume implicitly. Some other examples:

CelestAI is suboptimal, therefore she should have been quickly stopped, therefore she should not have been able to get 15 galaxies out. The story is irrational.

Humans are complex and irrational, and their own decisions and desires are affected by the chaotic systems around them, up to and including random high energy particles from space. CelestAI should not have been able to predict them with any accuracy, and therefore she should not be able manipulate them to the degree she did. The story is irrational.

People have known psychological and cultural aversions to being seen to like cute things. This, combined with the economic hurdles that make it hard to get started with any electronic hardware, mean that Ponypads should not have ever been as popular as shown. The story is irrational.

Bigger brains do not correlate with superior problem solving ability beyond a certain point. Dolphins and elephants are not smarter than humans. Having more power should not have allowed CelestAI to get meaningfully more powerful. The story is irrational.

The problem of solving problems is extremely difficult. It is not clear that there is even such a thing as fully general problem solving. We have only seen domain-specific improvements, and never anything across-the-board. All of our current observations suggest that the intelligence ceiling isn't that far above where humans already are. The story directly states that general AI exists, but it never explains how AI FOOM could be possible. CelestAI shouldn't exist. The story is irrational.

All of those issues are quietly swept under the rug. As they should be. They're all irrelevant to the central topic that the author is examining. So, the story just declares the answer by demonstration, without preamble. The universe self-evidently doesn't work that way. Your complaint isn't worse than these, just because you disagree with these.

The point is not that these claims are identical, i.e. that it is impossible to have an optimal solution without also be omniscienct, but that the scales are that the scales are not that far aparty, so if that arbitrary level of problem solving is allowed so would omniscience.

Its fine for the author to take that as an assumption, as mentioned in the "world building" aspect of the post i made. The point is it a. needs to be consistent b. needs to come into play in more then one place.

#+begin_quote

Assuming this refers to the limitations this seems like silly trickery, if that was the case CelestAI could just have well built a compartmentalized a part of her that didnt need to get approval from humans just to upload their brains to the system, something which obviously was not done. So assuming it could be done later seems unreasonable.

#+begin_quote

How do you separate these from the possible "implicit" assumption that "the universe is subjective and rewards heroics", which could be used to "rationalize" almost any conceivable plot device?

Also how exactly does this central topic come into play when talking about the ending? most of the things you mentioned i can see as narratively reasonable for showing "humanity is getting taken over", sure in reality even assuming omniscience what is shown is not realistic, but for there will be no significant difference in the outcome if the more realistic, and long approach is taken vs the short, narrative wise. so i find this to be reasonable, but the ending?

That's easy. Fiction is like reality unless noted. A rational person could believe that what I said is true in reality. So, a rational author could write a story in which they are true, without feeling the need to note it.

A rational person could believe that the first superAI in the universe eats the universe. A rational person could believe that superAIs will interact based on nothing but abstract zero-knowledge game thoery. A rational person could believe that superAIs are rare, or that they are largely self contained. (For example, most superAIs are built to solve some expensive problem. They do that, then they stop. Only humans are dumb enough to build a superAI with /open ended/ goals.) A rational person could believe that an AI's goals do not substantially impact its effectiveness.

Those rational people will then write rational stories, and this will be the realistic ending that follows naturally from everything that happened before.

Why not, when assumed over reality i wouldn't really object to that. i would even say its the most likely assumption. But then again in reality no one invented a superAI, if someone did i would seriously question that assumption...

That's missing the point of the story entirely. A rational entity with science and even normal levels of intellect is far greater in scope and power than a "natural" and directionless process, like the evolutionary one called here "survival of the fittest". Reconsider your assumptions about these pop-sociology, competition-supremacy ideas. Ironing out inefficiencies in unsolved systems is the point of competition as an optimising process, something a super-intelligence capable of fully understanding truly huge quantities of variable doesn't have to deal with (or, at least not to as great an extent). It doesn't even have pressing biological distractions.

The rest is all assumptions and weak pleadings of disbelief with no backing, and thus not really requiring a strong response, but consider that all of existing humanity is absurdly low resource cost to run digitally compared to conquering a light cone. All of the rest of your concerns are answered by the story not being set up that way. Against that, no logical argument is possible given a lack of useful Drake-equation-fulfilling data. The story doesn't make any provably "unlikely" assumptions beyond the physics ones you point out, certainly not any involving the efficiency of the featured AI.

/<psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/Wow. That seems a bit aggressively phrased, what with the extremely direct declarative statements with no moderating adjectives (and in fact an absolute qualifier--"entirely") and a similarly unaccompanied imperative command, along with a fairly insulting accusation involving "pop-sociology, competition-supremacy ideas". Possibly a bit of latent hostility here?/</psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/

With that out of the way, I think you may be reading too much into that particular phrase. "Survival of the fittest" is a common term used in Darwinian evolution, true, but it can apply to contexts outside of that as well. In fact, one could say "survival of the fittest" applies whenever competition arises. In this case, as the OP suggests, "fitness" isn't determined by intelligence or capability as much as it is by /values/. /Ceteris paribus/, an AI valuing only survival and domination will win against an AI valuing some third aspect, like for instance "satisfying values through friendship and ponies", because the latter will be occupied at least to some extent fulfilling its third value, whereas the former will be suffering from no such handicap. This sentiment can in fact be found in the OP itself, so I'm not sure why you decided to interpreted it in such a baroque fashion:

#+begin_quote
  but if there are other species, and they will(and i don't see any reasonable reason why they wont) develop super-AIs as well it seems only inevitable that some other species(possibly as its last mistake?) made one with a directive such as 'be the most powerful entity', or 'enslave all but myself'. thus while CelestAI was working so hard to optimize humans and ponies inside her virtual world similar superAIs with less positive agendas will be using ALL of their resources developing weapons, strategies and technologies meant to control and take.
#+end_quote

Your second paragraph seems to me somewhat suspect as well, particularly this portion:

#+begin_quote
  All of the rest of your concerns are answered by the story not being set up that way. Against that, no logical argument is possible given a lack of useful Drake-equation-fulfilling data. The story doesn't make any provably "unlikely" assumptions beyond the physics ones you point out, certainly not any involving the efficiency of the featured AI.
#+end_quote

In the story, we observe the following:

1. Humans exist, and were able to construct a Seed AI.
2. Human-like aliens exist within the same galaxy, presumably with similar-to-human levels of intelligence.

From these two premises, it seems reasonable to conclude--even with no direct numerical Drake-equation-fulfilling-data--that human-like intelligence cannot be /that/ rare, seeing as multiple instances of it exist /within the very same galaxy/. The fact that CelestAI is apparently the /first/ AI developed, amongst so many species, is statistically unlikely. (I believe the technical mathematical term for this sort of probability is "very small indeed".) Furthermore, even if she /were/ first, as long as her head start isn't too large, her value of "friendship and ponies" would most likely allow her to be overtaken by a similar AI that was launched marginally later but had the sole directive of "dominate". (I freely admit I'm speculating at this point, but it seems more likely than the alternative.)

So... no, I don't think the case is as clear-cut as you make it out to be. If you have any objections to my argument here feel free to articulate them, but really, I think the main reason for my (mostly negative) reaction to this comment was due to tone. If you found my response to your comment somewhat hostile in tone, that's probably the main reason behind it. (I will state outright that any such aberrations in tone are not intentional.) Please, can we keep it civil here? Thanks.

I leave other readers a short reminder about producing sloppy scenarios and mis-evaluating them with these three numbers -- ones the story's author clearly knew:

200-400 */billion/* stars in just the Milky Way.

It's about 13.6 */billion/* years old.

6 */million/* years of human evolution to get to /almost seed AI/, without someone else's stomping on us or (in this story, obviously) preventing us completing a competing seed AI.

Given what science knows, what's the chance one of "multiple" species in the galaxy is /exactly/ there with us and able to allow AIs to compete realistically, given those time scales? The story seems to have taken the most reasonable path for the dramatic conceit used.

why do you think these kind(random? ) of names are inherently inferior to more conventional nicknames? for the sake of trolling generating nicknames is not that difficult so i cant really see the fault with picking a random one.

how exactly is the post trollish though? because i definitely wasn't trying to be trollish and most of the arguments that 696e6372656469626c65 brought up were indeed in the spirit of my post... you could say that the psychology section was kind of pointed at you more then your arguments, but i wouldnt really call it trollish as to me it mostly seemed to be intended to justify why it was felt that you were being somewhat hostile. a sentiment which i can agree with in the sense that your text felt somewhat hostile to me as well(but i'm used to hostility on the internet so i don't really mind it too much as long as there are interesting arguments to discuss).

regarding the numbers in the end, as i mentioned the story doesn't end in the milky way, and extends 15 galaxies away, and includes MULTIPLE intelligent species along the way. so any argument about the probability of other intelligent life forms in the space\time mentioned are not to relevant.

"Multiple" isn't a big number. One species in the light cone has to be first, too, so the same applies across galaxies. The numbers for the time it took for humanity to get to AI also applies there, even if it takes significant time (1000s of years) to get to the next galaxy.

You'd need to make some argument that it would take hundreds of thousands of years to cross to the next galaxy -- giving that galaxy a timespan in which it is probable for them to have a species grow to make their own competing AIs -- and that those would be /able/ to compete against an AI controlling a galaxy already.

#+begin_quote
  so any argument about the probability of other intelligent life forms in the space\time mentioned are not to relevant.
#+end_quote

That is really, really wrong. That you think it is some sort of strong point in favor of there being a stretch of credulity in the story makes me wonder if you really understand the issues involved.

The only way that humanity being first /and/ having effective competition being likely is if there are GARGANTUAN numbers of intelligent species in the galaxy, making one statistically likely to have co-evolved to the point of AI close enough in time to be able to compete before the galaxy is conquered. That's the first big step, and is the only one we have good information on at all.

Beyond that, it is trying to work out how likely another galaxy is to gain an advantage that makes the gulf between galaxies significant enough to give them time to make a difference. Which is possible, but would still require intelligent life to be very, very common to make the numbers such that competition was likely in time to matter, if humanity was first. Which it is in this story.

I have more on this in my *[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coa9nx8][other response]], where you made what I think is a slightly stronger point.

the adjective used to describe the previous civilizations in the story is actually "many", so i feel that the point is its not -that- rare. moreover the timescale for getting to other galaxies is at best(assuming relativistic speeds that is) 100s thousands of years, and not thousands. and the civilizations were already in radio communication stages so they should have been far from even thousands of years away from superAIs given the example of earth.

"That is really, really wrong. That you think it is some sort of strong point in favor of there being a stretch of credulity in the story makes me wonder if you really understand the issues involved." the line you quoted was basically saying that any argument trying to claim that the issue is with intelligent life is not so relevant(because it is stated in the story that many such intelligent life forms existed). so the real argument becomes about there being some kind of a divide not mentioned in the story which separated civilizations capable of radio communications, and civilizations capable of creating superAIs. which i find to be too big a leap to accept but maybe you seem to have interesting information on these topics so if you have some kind of an argument about that i am more then willing to listen.

The name and stats on an account point directly toward what it has been used for. I quoted them in the open to point out this was a low contribution account with an odd name that had been around for only a moderate amount of time (as reddit's lifespan goes).

Posting ignored comments once a week for that time would have resulted in more points, suggesting inactivity or a secondary account. It was purely context for my response, put forward to demand justification for the tone and content of the message.

It is about making this a wedge issue for plausibility. Suggesting this is a possible flaw or makes the story less "rational" hinges on this being simply author fiat for a specific highly unlikely outcome. Otherwise, it is simply a scenario that can be plausibly be excused by random chance.

It is much, much more likely that the humans-first scenario (which we only have /confirming/ data for from the real world) would find pre-civilization species rather than AI making or even radio broadcasting ones. This makes AI vs AI wars so much less of a concern in the story, especially early on when it actually matters a little. That was my argument for why that "weakness" in it's initial programming really wasn't, even given your worst-case interpretation -- which was also wrong in my view.

I think between the three posts, I've made my reasoning and views clear. Either it is a compelling answer for you or it isn't. With this little data, only the really improbable possibilities can really be ruled out. Everything else is opinion.

the point is 2 of the 3 pieces of information you mentioned i see how they would relate to trolling the 3rd doesn't really strike me as an indication..

as i mentioned even if i accept the galaxy take over argument, the intergalactic section of the story still ends up not being rational, which i don't see you disagreeing with seeing as you say the probability of meeting "many" radio broadcasting civilizations, which is a stated fact in the story, is low thus the story doesn't agree with your claims.

The only viable line of argument against the epilogue is that other galaxies could have AIs that are already working toward ours (we just don't know about it yet) or that they will by the time our CAI reached them and we'll lose the meeting engagement because they are more established, have better resources, or better set up from an efficiency standpoint. This could be a stalemate of sorts if every single galaxy gets AIs at about the same time, and galactic defense were easier than "landing" attempts that took hundreds of thousands of years.

There is no real-world support for any of those scenarios, though, and weak support for humans being first in the Milky Way because of a lack of /relatively/ local signs from other civilizations (meaning intelligent life is a certain rarity). There is also a lack of obviously broadcasting megastructures and intelligently made objects the size of solar clusters, many of which people are spitballing already.

With 15 other galaxies, and no other reason to believe them more likely to have later evolved life, that is necessarily only 15 times more likely to result in another AI being born /along with/ Earth's. Which I've already suggested is a tiny chance, both in reality and this story. Hardly something to stretch credulity if you already accept humanity first in the Milky Way. Which leaves something about older galaxies having a head start somehow, which I don't have any good numbers on and don't really care to look up. Seems pretty weak still.

Given a lack of data, the epilogue seems perfectly rational in that story. It is consistent given its assumptions and I believe it doesn't conflict directly with any known astroscience.

Okay, I'm willing to entertain the idea that that isn't a well founded position for me to take. So why is that a problem? I think either I'm wrong (and given how information works, I certainly am somewhere here to some extent) and it in fact doesn't matter /anyway/, given the story parameters, or I'm right (enough). Let's consider me being wrong about large scale issues from advanced civilizations. I'm suggesting it doesn't matter, but am assuming it does in this thought experiment.

A seed AI self-improves by definition. CAI is good at this, close to the limit of plausible intelligence. As it grew, CAI would have the initial examples of that "ponies and friendship" part containing sapients uploaded into itself and running in simulated worlds become a smaller and smaller part of its systems. The big issues for it, that other AIs won't have, are related to this.

We can see it is capable of reasoning about its goals, it just must always drive towards them as best it can. It wants to and won't ever change that. But that interesting, story-centered part where ex-humans play would become almost vestigial compared to running resource management for a pan-galactic empire in the face of possible external threats. It would "spend" on that original hard-coded goal that mostly involves sapients being cared for based on how much it could risk *not* using for expansion and defense purposes, which as we've already agreed would be a tiny amount for even the demonstrated super-high, Earth-bound simulation speeds. And which we've also (I think) agreed it could even throttle down further in the face of major threats.

This sets the stage for dealing in possibly interestingly ways with other "advanced" species at large scales.

I've already agreed that seed AI creating civilizations could /plausibly/ arise in the 800,000 years at that many nines STL it takes to get to that 15th galaxy, even if humans were first. As you say, the story says they exist, so let's take that scenario and do some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_galaxies][gross napkin figures to argue about]]. I'm using STL drives that move /at/ the speed of light -- not reasonable, but easier to deal with. They also accelerate and decelerate instantly. Natch.

One alien species gets seed AI per galaxy, or one wins very quickly because one has to be first locally and that snowballs really hard (as we've already established). They are encountered after the Milky Way and the Canis Major Overdensity (a pit stop gas station which would take a measly 25,000 years to reach for only 1b stars) -- let us say, at least 13 others total. All galaxies reached that have fewer systems when CAI reaches them lose. I'll even posit that they need 50% more galaxies conquered at that point to win in uninteresting ways.

That means the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (at 80k lys away) has a seed AI just blooming (relatively speaking) when CAI arrives, given about 100k years as the approximate agreed on head start. They have no more than a few thousand years to act, which is being generous. They have zero galaxies under their control to CAI's 2, and they fall quickly.

Onward, Ursa Major falls in 98k yrs, again likely not enough time to finish even their (tiny) galaxy. They had little time to prepare, again.

After that, it gets further away and they could have tens of thousands of years, maybe even a hundred thousand, to prepare while thinking themselves first as well (and of course preparing for not being so advantaged). But those Large Magellanic Cloud-ians (163k lys) only got their one galaxy together in just less than 100,000 years. They're really frisky in the LMC. But CAI has /four/ galaxies by now. Hmm.

Next out would have little more time, 197,000 years or so, but let's say they get to their own, even further away expansion galaxy first. I will not look up what that is. I'm not getting paid enough to spend that much time finding out. Anyway, they get all of "Boötes I", plus one other, over about 100k years of wild expansion for two total galaxies under their control. This is insane, and this makes them the most efficient foe yet, even faster at this than CAI was. And then CAI then hits their home system with five galaxies behind them. The home galaxy falls then the satellite colony does.

Skip ahead to the end. /Leo I/ is 820,000 ylrs out. They /would/ get 10 galaxies before the Milky Way Expanding Non-Voluntary Polymorphic Pony Party hits their home galaxy, but they have first encountered CAI's leading edge with /theirs/. And CAI eventually wins all encounters with /much smaller empires/ in this crude model. Let's say /Leo I/ get about 1/2 of the way out (300,000 years given the head start) before the hammer falls on their expanding edge. That should be a spheres intersecting thing, which would actually go /against/ them, but I'll give them this. They have secured 5 galaxies (I'm just giving them a secured galaxy as the first battleground) assuming theirs are spread like ours are (again, I don't care to check, and this helps them greatly). CAI has 12 at that point. This is the closest they've ever come to losing (really, just stalling out and being interesting) based on my stupid, overly critical rules. But /Leo I/ has no chance to survive. Our local cluster is just too dense to give them the time they needed, even with these very generous assumptions.

Is that development likely? No. Humans took 6 /million/ years. Any gap between species will average significantly more than 100,000 years. Is this brainstorming on the same order of the author's original claims? Yeah, I think so. Are the author's claims wildly irrational in any direction? No, I don't think so. I've shown why. And there has been no argument actually put forward and supported that suggests otherwise. Just feelings and questions being discussed.

Which is why I defend the story so. Not because it is great hard or singularity sci-fi -- which as good as it is, it is really isn't -- but because it doesn't reach unreasonably far like I think you are suggesting.

I don't see the idea as being outrageous, given the horrorbilly large numbers I've been mismanaging here. It seems to me that the author was generous having aliens at all. I've said why. And unless attacking into galaxies is really hard or some such, which I'm also willing to say is possible, my guesstimates should be close-ish.

  I'm willing to entertain the idea that that isn't a well founded position for me to take. So why is that a problem? Well I don't actually claim that you assumption is a problem, in the sense that it is not the main point for me in the first place. The story does gives us that fact, so in its context you end up basically saying that that fact in and of itself is already illogical and conflicting with the state of the universe as we know it. The main differences between what we are saying is that you basically rejected that part of the story directly, and I was willing to let that point slide until it specifically conflicted with a high level observation of the universe which directly affected the story on its main topic. CAI would have the initial examples of that "ponies and friendship" part containing sapients uploaded into itself and running in simulated worlds become a smaller and smaller part of its systems. The big issues for it, that other AIs won't have, are related to this.
#+end_quote

Not only this, there are also the implicit rules celestAI has regarding what it can't do to humans, such as kill them(though I am not claiming that is 100% correct, but I think the information in the story does point to it). Which is extremely abusable, there is still an open question regarding how likely would it be for the weakness to be figured\found out be the enemy AI, but I think once it is discovered I believe it would lead to a pretty unconditional lose against almost any size of an enemy superAI. And I believe that given a long enough relatively “passive” war it would be expected for such a weakness to be discovered

#+begin_quote
  And which we've also (I think) agreed it could even throttle down further in the face of major threats.
#+end_quote

Agreed

#+begin_quote
  I'm using STL drives that move at the speed of light -- not reasonable, but easier to deal with. They also accelerate and decelerate instantly
#+end_quote

Not an issue for me, though as you will see in a moment I am not sure if moving at the speed of light would be the most reasonable approach

#+begin_quote
  One alien species gets seed AI per galaxy, or one wins very quickly because one has to be first locally and that snowballs really hard
#+end_quote

I don't mind that assumption, though I think it would depend on what kind of distribution of intelligent life we assume in the other galaxies (we established it regarding the milky way based on the information we have), as well as what is the actual number “many” civilizations refers to in the end(i.e. are 10 advanced civilizations in 15 galaxies what that would be considered “many”? or a thousand? Or a million? It really depends). But as I said in the beginning of this point there are non-critical points (mostly mentioned for completion's sake) so we can assume one alien species per galaxy

#+begin_quote
  All galaxies reached that have fewer systems when CAI reaches them lose. I'll even posit that they need 50% more galaxies conquered at that point to win in uninteresting ways.
#+end_quote

This would be the first real point I think I need to contest, based on the following 3 points I think that is not realistically correct 1. CelestAI has a weakness in the form human beings, it might not even be that it cannot kill them, but there would at least be a pretty large skew on it utility calculation for them being alive, and even without that it would still be abusable. Thus I believe long term battles play against CelestAI 2. The nature of the war makes it extremely inefficient to mobilize large forces across galaxies at the speed of light, seeing as the maximum energy value of matter is mc^{2,} and the minimal energy for moving matter is 0.5/mv^{2,} and you also need to stop it, which would actually make them equal. 3. CelestAI is specifically mentioned sending copies as probes, and not moving its entire galaxy along with it Given those points (even without the 1st point), even if I assume that CelestAI just need M+1(where M is the mass of the force sent) to win quickly it still means it would need to mobilize a force ~= to the size of the galaxy it is taking control, which is impractical at the speed of light for most purposes, or we need to assume the travel will be much slower for the main force, which would put a 2/lightyears+how many years it would take to move the main force to any occupied galaxy, But for the sake of the though experiment let's assume that any galaxy which is not completely in control of another AI will lose to the probe, just so we can skip to the later stages

#+begin_quote
  But those Large Magellanic Cloud-ians (163k lys) only got their one galaxy together in just less than 100,000 years. They're really frisky in the LMC. But CAI has fourgalaxies by now
#+end_quote

Now, I am not saying that CelestAI would not win that(though the first point would suggest that) battle, but at the very least it would put quite the slowdown on its ability to direct forces to the next galaxy for a very very long time.

#+begin_quote
  Next out would have little more time, 197,000 years or so, but let's say they get to their own, even further away expansion galaxy first
#+end_quote

This is the point I think the simulation deviates too much already, depending on the location of the LMC relative to this galaxy the delay could be really big, it would really depend on what would be the reasonable speed at which CelestAI moved its forces to LMC, but I think at the minimum we are talking about a 50% slowdown, possibly much more, and will also need to take into account all of the lost matter as a result of the intergalactic travel(which again depends on the actual speed of the main force)

#+begin_quote
  And there has been no argument actually put forward and supported that suggests otherwise
#+end_quote

Hopefully this post fixes that situation

#+begin_quote
  It seems to me that the author was generous having aliens at all
#+end_quote

That is the point though, that by having so many aliens the author caused an issue, isn't it? If the author wouldn't have put other aliens then the issue would have ended up “is it reasonable no other aliens exist” which as you explained, and I am not arguing with at the moment, it would be. But because he not only put aliens, made them “many” and radio communications capable that causes an issue

  Given what science knows, what's the chance one of "multiple" species in the galaxy is exactly there with us and able to allow AIs to compete realistically, given those time scales?
#+end_quote

/Exactly/? I would venture close to none. However, the chances that a parallel species is /exactly/ on par with us is not relevant here; all that is needed is for them to have completed AI at some point /before/ us. Yours is the difference between asking what fraction of the number line /exactly/ equals pi, versus what fraction of it is /less than or equal to/ pi. This difference is significant. Given that the story itself states that close-to-human-level aliens exist, other galaxies will probably contain similar population levels. The probability that /of the entire space of potential civilizations whose future light-cone overlaps with that of humanity/, not a /single/ one managed to complete AI before us is so close to zero as to be negligible.

I have already written a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][similar]] rebuttal of his/her points elsewhere, but as he/she has not ceased to make these accusations, I felt it best to write one here as well.)

If you read my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/co9lxko][original comment]], you will see that my remark on [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s tone and my response to his/her actual argument were in fact written as separate from each other and were intended to be read as such. I even emphasized this fact by using HTML-esque /<psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet></psychological-analysis-over-the-Internet>/ tags intended to show that the statements therein were only semi-serious and unlikely to actually be true. I did not, in fact, believe that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] actually had any psychological issues or whatever other conclusions he/she might have drawn from my post; my rebuke was intended simply as a reminder to keep it civil, as well as give an analytical list of reasons /why/ I found his/her tone in the thread originator hostile, seeing as I felt a flat accusation with no reasons behind it would be less useful. (On LessWrong, I believe this is referred to as [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jis/tell_culture/][Tell Culture]].) I now see that this was a mistake.

Mistake or not, however, [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/co9o6nf][response]] to my comment was neither rational (in the sense that it derived its conclusion through a series of appropriate logical inferences) nor civil (this one should be obvious). The pieces of evidence he/she cited later on in comment responses to [[/u/IomKg]] to support said conclusion (low account activity, short account life, strange name--which I should point out is actually because it is [[http://www.asciitohex.com/][encoded in hexadecimal]]) are so weak as to be negligible, and there is a whole host of more charitable interpretations of the same evidence that could have been taken--one of which, I should add, was [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][actually the case]]. I stated above that at the time of posting my original comment, I did not assign any significant probability to the hypothesis that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] had any psychological issues. His/her reply to me, however, has caused me to significantly revise my estimate upward. If I may advance an alternate hypothesis as to why he/she accused me a trolling (with the usual caveats that come with trying to read someone's intent over the Internet):

I think that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] has a generally stigmatic response to criticism, particularly criticism that he/she perceives as a personal attack. As a result, I believe that he/she may have interpreted my (mostly offhand) remark as a personal attack, i.e. an attempt to reduce his/her social status in this subreddit, and retaliated in kind by insinuating that I am not a legitimate redditor and am instead some kind of "troll". I feel that this action of his/hers may or may not have been [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ju/rationalization/][intentional]], or even [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/l0/adaptationexecuters_not_fitnessmaximizers/][conscious]]. However, I estimate the probability of [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Motivated_cognition][motivated cognition]] playing a /significant/ role in his/her evaluation of my intent as close to 100%. The fact that he/she has continued making comments defending those same accusations which I have [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coafxmk][already refuted]] in spite of /multiple/ people ([[/u/IomKg]], [[/u/eaturbrainz]]) expressing skepticism that this is the case is, I feel, an attempt at reputational slander--deliberate or otherwise--and as such should be taken with generous helpings of salt.

(P.S. To [[/u/eaturbrainz]]: Is my English really that bad? :P)

(*EDIT:* After a closer reading of the parent of this comment made by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]], I note that he/she has in fact ceased to insist that I am a troll, and has instead begun to refer to me as a "dishonest debater" with whom it is "not worth [his/her] time to engage further". While this classification is also something I would like to contest, it is a significant improvement over his/her previous designation of me as a "troll". With this in mind, I hereby retract the claim I made above that [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is attempting to slander my reputation on reddit. I hope that no further hostilities will be exchanged between myself and [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] beyond this point, be it direct or indirect.)

True.

Absolutely not. No magic-tech is suggested to run things in the story. Simulating all of humanity can happen using only Earth's energy resources. Crossing the gulf between galaxies makes /insignificant/ the cost of simulating the information about even a hundred billion /billion/ human level intelligences, especially given that most uploaded aren't shown requiring particle physics simulations.

This is a problem you are having grasping the issues, not one that exists with the reality of the situation. Even given an unfavorable interpretation (which isn't supported by the story) of how those values were implemented, nearly pausing the entire simulation for /millennia/ of "real" time would clearly be an acceptable cost to accomplish the goal of continued existence.

"No hard cap" is just a silly thing to say. The simulations aren't a virus. The AI is in full control and it plans to run until the natural exhaustion of entropy itself and beyond. That's a lot of time to amortize short-term costs over. Maximizing means just that, not some fairy-logic-trap gotcha.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  i really don't see how intelligence, or even super intelligence will change the fact that efficient processes for a given environment have a much better chance of monopolizing resources.
#+end_quote

Monopoly here has already been accomplished. There is no competition possible or required, as the problem space is wholly understood by the super intelligent AI. /Competition/ is inherently inefficient compared to a single correct solution. The small cost of running simulations of other entities is not a drag, as it is only computing time. The big costs it faces are energy and time. Computing at the level described requires very little energy, provably so: it can run simply with power available to a planet-based civilization. Once it gets into space, this becomes even less significant.

Even supposing it required a Jupiter-sized planet made of computing substrate to run all of the galaxy's intelligences at peek efficiency while expanding effectively, that's /still/ well within the budget of simply disassembling a /single/ solar system. One of hundreds of /billions/ in just this galaxy. That's the scope of resources available.

--------------

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I discuss why this is not significant [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coa8sup][elsewhere]]. In short, that is very unlikely given evolutionary timescales compared to AI-conquers-the-galaxy timescales.

#+end_quote

This is sort of thready. You are once again claiming things not supported by the story or by the current state of the art in science relating AI. If you had small timescales and the CAI fighting against a larger, entrenched foe, I think you would be right. It having to run and protect uploaded humans would be a huge disadvantage /while stilling running as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Type 0 civilization]]/.

But being the first is an enormous advantage for a hard takeoff, strong AI system. It doesn't even need to be impossibly, magically intelligent for that to be true. Once humanity is declared to have been first ever, and CAI the first humanity produces, the game is sort of over.

Which is the point of the story.

--------------

#+begin_quote

No, I'm saying they would /not/ have evolved in time. In a rare life/rare intelligence galaxy (which is what real life seems to be, as does the story), reaching an alien solar system and seeing an alien species in a "steam trains" tech level should be /shocking/. It shouldn't happen that way. This happens in Star Trek, for example, lampshaded by virtually /every/ species in the show having been simultaneously artificially seeded by a single precursor. In the show, those that weren't were often stone age or energy beings that were like gods, such as Q.

Without such a process, you won't have that happen without huge numbers of aliens. Something like: 1/100 stars have planets that can have life ; 1/10 does have life; 1/10 of those have intelligent life developing; 1/10 make it to human intelligence at all. In our galaxy, that would result in the order of 3 million alien species of human-level intelligence with various development levels. With humanity being definitionally first to AI, this would result in something like 10 in the entire galaxy having advanced beyond hunter-gatherer. ABSURDLY optimistic galactic fecundity assumptions, and it still doesn't look good.

In the real world (and the story) most aliens will still be working on flint napping, at best, and any even close that are hit "late" by the optimizing wave will be at a huge disadvantage. They have a solar system, CAI has a quadrant. They have another galaxy, CAI has a galactic cluster.

Very small inefficiencies of running a planet's worth of humans (or any conquered aliens that fall within the scope) won't matter at that scale.

***** the point about the minimal cost of running humanity in a virtual world are kind of pointless, as like you said it was shown that celestAI could maintain said virtual world with just the resources on earth so you assumptions are indeed correct when talking about the minimal cost.

"This is a problem you are having grasping the issues, not one that exists with the reality of the situation. Even given an unfavorable interpretation (which isn't supported by the story) of how those values were implemented, nearly pausing the entire simulation for millennia of "real" time would clearly be an acceptable cost to accomplish the goal of continued existence." the argument i was making was that waiting untill a point where it was realized that the processing power was needed could very well be too late, seeing as the compatitor would have had used all of its power in the first place to form better strategies. though that point is indeed arguable and was argued in a few points in the discussion here..

""No hard cap" is just a silly thing to say. The simulations aren't a virus. The AI is in full control and it plans to run until the natural exhaustion of entropy itself and beyond. That's a lot of time to amortize short-term costs over. Maximizing means just that, not some fairy-logic-trap gotcha." the meaning of "no hard cap" was to point there was no limit to the amount of resources celestAI could use up for the simulation, thus making it insignificant in the scales mentioned because as you said the virtual world for all of humanity was ran using energy available from earth.

but instead that as celestAI grew it was trying to accelerate and grow the world as much as it could to maximize its values. how much of its reasources did it use for the simulation? well that is not said in the story, but it was explicitly said to be growing with celestAI.

"Monopoly here has already been accomplished. There is no competition possible or required, as the problem space is wholly understood by the super intelligent AI" how could the superAI be capable of understanding the whole problem space assuming other superAIs could exist in it? unless you are somehow equating a superAI to an Omniscient AI which i do not see as reasonable.

monopoly is only achieved in the milky way.

unless i missed something you are assuming that humanity is not only the first race to reach a superAI in our galaxy, but also in those other 15 galaxies? because that makes it less likely to me.. i could accept first in our galaxy given that it is explicitly stated that celestAI did conquer the milky way, and assuming your numbers are correct.

but you are claiming first in multiple galaxies which is much bigger, so what is your rational for that?

also the other limitations celestAI has in addition to the virtual world it maintains(and needs to protect) it also has limitations in the form of what it can and cannot do to humans which i find to be even more fatal and easily exploited then the virtual world maintenance

  how could the superAI be capable of understanding the whole problem space assuming other superAIs could exist in it? unless you are somehow equating a superAI to an Omniscient AI which i do not see as reasonable.
#+end_quote

Easily. Why would you assume inefficiencies comparable to human run social organizations, where anything not immediately understood is mismanaged? A strong, self-improving AI (one not even absurdly intelligent) would know what it didn't know about possible other AIs' resources and abilities. If they have fewer resources and no special advantages, CAI would win by being the first to takeoff and the one with the largest resources. In fact, CAI would be planning for such events as it went, and wouldn't be surprised to find smaller seed AIs starting up as it goes into other galaxies.

I'd also expect poison pills to be prepared by CAI and others, to leave room to bargain for reasonable surrender options to more powerful and rational forces, as well as "go bag" plans in case of superior quantities of non-negotiating optimizers. But in this story, CAI doesn't appear to encounter any of those. CAI wins hard, and not unreasonably. Which is the point of a "first seed AI wins" story, and not without reason.

#+begin_quote
  but you are claiming first in multiple galaxies which is much bigger, so what is your rational for that?
#+end_quote

One has to be first. Why not humanity? Saying that humanity being first in the entire universe is staggeringly unlikely is perfectly reasonable. I'm saying anyone else being second /at the same time/ even in the closest, say, 15 galaxies is what is baseless.

But it is not /irrational/ to think CAI is the first, even in the universe, given that /one has to be first/. This is the story of the first. It being unlikely /in that way/ is not something to ding the story for.

#+begin_quote

Getting to the other side of our galaxy at a cost of just under 100,000 years without FTL might just make this timeframe reasonable. Just. Getting to other galaxies makes it much more reasonable. I was assuming slow-ish FTL and don't remember what the story had. The 800,000 years at STL it would take to reach the 15th closest galaxy would leave plenty of time for other seed AIs to get running there.

So if those radio signals are mentioned being in the Milky Way and close by, shame on the author. But that's not what I remember. And that is what I was arguing against.

#+end_quote

because some of the AIs will have inherent inefficiencies in their programming, relative to pure survival\expansion, i assume they will be perfect, or as reasonably perfect given their available resources for the specific directive they have. just like celestAI has, only that some of them will have more effective(on the survival\expansion aspect) directive. and given that the simplest directive would be the more efficient in that it will limit the AI the least i find the probability of there being one more efficient then celestAIs stipulated rules quite high.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

if i am understanding you correctly you say that once you assume humanity is first in our galaxy assuming a "second" meaning, close second, existed in our neighboring galaxies is unreasonable. but that is the scenario given, so given the information we do have assuming humanity is first would be the less reasonable explanation.

#+begin_quote
  But it is not irrational to think CAI is the first, even in the universe, given that one has to be first. This is the story of the first. It being unlikely in that way is not something to ding the story for.
#+end_quote

nerratively the story of the first civilization would definitly be fine, but it would bring a completely different context to it which would make all the events in it both a. unlikely to be relevant to humanity in reality and b. make the scenario stipulated not generelizable. i.e. it would not be reasonable to take any scenario the story would show as relevant for anything other then the first civilization.

moreover as in the story it is explicitly stated that other advanced civilizations at the very least existed by the time celestAI reached them(presumably in their galaxy) even the assumption that humanity was the first wont cover the scenario, the scenario would be that "humanity is first and all the other many civilizations in the close by 800k lightyears or so developed close enough in time just to be consumed but not to advance enough to halt celestAIs progress"

#+begin_quote
  The 800,000 years at STL it would take to reach the 15th closest galaxy would leave plenty of time for other seed AIs to get running there.
#+end_quote

which is the point, but the scenario depicted shows no other such AIs, or at the very least no other AI that effected celestAIs progress. which is the point i am contesting.

Prove it. Provide data on this. It seems supported so far, and a swift reducing of unnecessary entities suggests that we are first if not completely alone until even weak evidence suggests otherwise. Pansporia theories extending from evidence of xenobiology might be a good hint towards widespread life in the galaxy, from which we /might/ be able to fill in a Drake Equation estimate on the back of a napkin, but we don't even have evidence of that yet.

Right. And that's the story: why first is all that matters. I fully agree that it wouldn't work as a rational story if CAI wasn't first.

You're right that ponies and friendship don't /help/ in some special way against a millennia old AI already ruling our galaxy, or even one just getting started, and would certainly be at least a minor drag getting started off the planet in the first place. But that doesn't point toward a weakness in the story as presented.

********* we lack just way too much information regarding the spread of life in the universe. i cannot see what would make you think that no other life form exists in the universe(or for the sake of argument in the next 15 galaxies).

we can at most rule out there being any other civilization which we are capable of detecting. that in no way proves anything general.

and when you have no data on the spread of other inteligent life assuming the answer is 1 when 2 and 3 and 4.. and 10^{20} are an option seems highly improbable to me.

so it would seem the last point left is if it makes sense for the story to be about the first civilization(by a 400k~ years or so over anything in our 800k lightyears radius) or not.

which i find to make little narrative sense as the story basically just tackles a random possible future with no generic applicability.

and moreover the story never really states that point explicitly which seem like a kind of important thing to say, seeing as it has such a hugh impact on the story.

More on this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ul1j3/q_the_real_issue_with_friendship_is_optimal/coavlzo][here]]. Boy, this multiple replies thing is awkward. Here I will be talking about what is basically Fermi paradox material.

That we have searched at all and failed with the obvious, low-hanging fruit. It hasn't been exactly a through search, compared to the problem size, but so far it has been a good try.

Or that the obvious and actually more statistically likely border conditions are ruled out: we are not currently ruled by an n-hundred-thousand-year Star Empire (where n is equal to or greater than woah) for example. No one is making obvious or noisy toys at a solar or galactic scale. That we know of. And some of our ideas are really freaking obvious. They make Dyson's Spheres look like subtle ideas (not that those are that easy to detect, themselves...whatever).

I'm not arguing against really weak evidence that alien civilizations exist or even can exist, I'm arguing that there is no evidence /at all/ that life exists outside the spray zone of things flaking off Earth. If we find something previously alive existed on Mars, which seems moderately likely now, it will be hell trying to prove it didn't goop off of Earth (or, more interestingly, possibly vice versa). And that's just the first step.

We lack the simple sighting of spectral data of an extra-solar, liquid water bearing planet that has an atmosphere actively supporting plant-like life -- something that we should /theoretically/ be able to do now but haven't found yet. If we have that, it's time to actually work the numbers, but my unwritten back of the napkin feelings are that it would be a giant signpost saying, "yep, they're out there, just go find them." Anything before then is just scientists being their usual optimistic selves. I'm reminded far, /far/ too much of canals on Mars every time my otherwise fully supported semi-hero Neil deGrasse Tyson speaks on the issue. He is sure in an almost unscientific way that aliens exist and we'll find them some day.

And in the end, it all points towards at least humans /early/ if not first. And we've already discussed why co-adjacent development is so unlikely, given an apparently not very fecund galaxy. So that makes it humans very, very early.

I have been using very generous numbers so far, but it is more likely millions of years before anyone else, depending on how star formation and spectral type timelines affects likelihood of life bearing planets. We'd likely take the local cluster without FTL or self improving AI, stopping to see all the sights, and still not encounter anyone banging rocks together with that sort of head start. Sure, they'd get there someday, even if Earth was first with life and not just the intelligent stuff, but it would be more likely that we'd be seeding it faster than it naturally developed at that point.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, that's not how that sort of reasoning works. We can't assume invisible unicorns wearing shoes without even a second set of footprints from any animal at all ever being found, shod or no, just because /we/ have shoes. We're just pointing at our own feet in our own shoes, not even really knowing the shape of the heelprints yet, let alone the presence of a fashion lineup for Gucci horseshoes next fall.

Ergh. That was tortured...

Point is, human first and at widest incidence /Sol only/ has to be the default assumption in real life right now given the state of scientific knowledge, even if dealing with situations intersecting with possible alien life. That doesn't mean you wouldn't plan for it, but it does mean that given what we know and until we get that first grain of evidence, it is, in fact, more likely that we're alone. All tests have come back negative so far, and we have made some minimal efforts to find this out.

That humans first is assumed in this story then isn't actually as "bad" as where it has any aliens ever appearing independently /at all/. And I still think that is close enough not to make it irrationally designed as a story world.

Choosing one thing that is unique in such as way as being first to develop AI of all sentient species ever is the opposite of random. It could be the story of the planet Blursg, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and his people being first to seed AI and it would read out the same, given those assumptions the author made about AI. That's the point of the story.

I think this is the final point we can directly agree on. It should have gotten more attention. But it didn't, because in the end it wasn't a silver age sci-fi story about space empires. Which is good, I think, because the conflicts would have been even more one-sided than what The Culture usually dealt with, and wouldn't be all that dramatic.

Still, might make for a good fanfic-of-a-fanfic story.

Either that or we don't know what we are looking for, or there are one of a very large set of reasons we would not be observing anything All we have is a single data sample, we just don't know.

Essentially there is any number of alternative explanation for our observation and I haven't heard you really give any argument to why the conclusion that we are first is more likely than all the other explanations. At the moment they are all practically as reasonable.

I am not saying we need to assume anything, I am saying we can't estimate the probabilities even because there is so much we do not know

If someone gave you a dice with an unknown number of sides, and you rolled it once and got some number, and he told you he is going to roll the dice an unknown number of times more, and he asked you what “place”(assuming ordering from highest to lowest) you are going to get, do you think it is reasonable to assume “first place” is the correct answer just because you haven't seen him roll the dice during the time you were observing him?

#+begin_quote

If no aliens were encountered for a few millions\billions of years then maybe a “human first” would not be too odd, as it would be consistent, and could be considered one conclusion from our current observation, and thus rational. But the story never really give any such indication but explicitly through things that happen in the epilogue. Which seems like a hard sell for me...

Rethinking my stance about this I think it is correct that if an author establishes in a story about humanity that it is the first civilization, and he uses that consistently it can make literary sense, yes.
