I have a bit more than a full chapter of backlog at present, but this is a web serial and I'm happy to take suggestions from readers as to where they want things to go. Would you like more "hangout" chapters, where Ram gets a chance to breathe? More info on a given character (I'm already moving forward some of the big reveal on Ram's situation per a reader request in last week's update)? Anything else?

The Blurb for those just joining us: " The world has not been kind to Ram's family. Father just lost an arm. Mother can't work. And if Ram can't find a way to make money fast, a life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way forward is through the darkest side of their dark world--fighting on the front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay? "

Thanks, one and all!


** Wow, these guys are really motivated to take Ram down, even after half their friends die in front of them. Of course /now/ is the time he finally meets selfless people dedicated to defending their community at their own peril.

*** Or paranoid troglodytes with a bunker mentality. It's sort of like "terrorist" versus "freedom fighter."

**** Yeah, but, if I saw a terrorist kill 3 of my friends after saying he'd be out of our hair if we live him alone, and all I have is a pickaxe... at that point I might just cut my losses and assume it's someone else's problem :P

***** Now imagine that you're a minimally educated manual laborer who spends his life mostly underground at a work site located a few miles from North Korea. You get all your news from rumors, or from overhearing casual chatter by your bosses, which usually ends with them noticing you hanging about and ordering you on your way. Your life is dominated by scary stories and superstitions. You believe you've discovered a Korean infiltrator who plans to blow up your mine--you don't know when exactly--and all of your friends agree. You have the infiltrator outnumbered and surrounded, but he steadfastly insists you've made a mistake.

(leaving aside the part where Dul Misishi in many ways resembles a North Korean labor camp itself)
