The final chapter of volume 2 for my serial novel *My Life is not a Manga, or maybe...* is officially public as of today! You can read the whole thing on my site or Royal Road:

- [[https://notamanga.com]]
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe]]

For those new to the story, the protagonist discovers he is the main character in a rom-com harem manga, and then spends a lot of time trying to get his normal life back. He's genre-savvy and tries to think before he acts (not always successfully), and fair warning there's a big ol' genre swap from Volume 1 to Volume 2. But if it sounds interesting, give it a shot! Whether I succeeded at the things I was trying to do is up for debate, but it's undeniably different than most stories about people getting stuck in manga plotlines.

I would love to talk shop about what worked and what didn't in Not A Manga if anyone is interested! If you finish it, please let me know what you loved (or hated)!

--------------

If you like my writing, I am now moving on to a new story called *Mr. Familiar*, which is currently available only through Royal Road: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36645/mr-familiar]]

I'm not sure yet how rational it will be (so I may or may not post about it again here). The protagonist is another genre-savvy character out of his depth, but if you approached it wholly rationally the main character's situation is pretty horrific, and I'm trying to figure out how to gain broader appeal (at least with the Royal Road crowd, for now) while still breaking genre constraints so the story is likely to lean more on humor (at least initially).


** Read a few chapters, it seems pretty fun. So far the protag seems clever/genre-savvy enough to make him a good rational actor, but occasionally thoughtless enough that tropey developments can slip by him regardless.

I had some slight dissonance reading from every Japanese term being explained to me even though I already know them (I'm a bit of a weeb myself) while instead having to google american things I'd never heard of before (like what a "mudroom" is - I first thought it was a eupherism for toilet). EDIT: Store names as well, especially since they've been changed. I know some, like "Barnes and Noble" -> "Barnes and Novel" and "Victorias Secret" -> "Elizabeths Secret", but I'm not familiar enough with US shops to decipher "Big 6". Not that it matters to the plot at all, but the whole thing is similar to being new to manga and not getting the japanese cultural references.

EDIT2: Finished the first volume and a bit into volume 2. The story seemed to be going somewhere interesting, but then then everything was quickly dropped in an anticlimax and the story just sort of ended with no feeling of having resolved the conflict. Volume 2 then completely drops just about everything from the previous volume, it might as well be a completely new story with a similar protagonist. Like a lot of webfiction unfortunately, interesting idea for a premise that sustains the beginning but seemingly no real plan for an actual story arc which makes for an unsatisfying end. I suppose everything could theoretically be tied together and neatly wrapped up by the end of volume 2, but it doesn't seem to be heading in that direction.

*** Heh, you're not alone! A lot of people were unhappy with the transition to Volume 2 (including myself, to some extent). A jarring switch was actually my plan before I wrote a single word of volume 1 (because I wanted the reader to feel the disconnect that the protagonist feels when they're suddenly cut off from everything familiar, which is normally glossed over in isekai), but turns out there's a good reason for other books to avoid that! It's not a comfortable or fun thing to experience, even vicariously.

The anticlimax of volume 1 is something that I struggled with. On the one hand, it's entirely appropriate because the protagonist is actively trying to escape his own story the whole time, so of course as soon as he finds a way it's going to collapse around my ears. On the other, I didn't quite accomplish what I was aiming for with all the heroines. Samantha and to a lesser extent Paula ended up about where I wanted them, but I totally botched Jill (her entire arc will be getting rewritten when I have a chance to revise), lost track of Ms. Carino, and I need to drop a few more hints for Rachel's behavior to make even marginal sense.

In any case, thank you for your criticism!

*** No plans for a volume 3 at the moment! I do have some ideas for where the story could go (and there's a missing Volume 1.5 novella that I planned, but ultimately skipped over), so I might return to this world eventually but short-term it just wasn't garnering very much interest (and I alienated a lot of people with the shift to Volume 2; whoops), so I'm going to let it lie fallow for a bit.

** I just read the first 30 chapters and I can see why people like it but the protagonist manages to be just as frustrating as the normal protagonist in these type of stories. I kept expecting him to take some advantage of his genre saviness rather than go against everyrhing for reasons as contrived as in the source genre. Nonetheless, that kind of thing clearly works for many.

I'd have much rather read about his dad, who acts and thinks closer to how I thought the protagonist would.

*** Thanks for the feedback! No worries on not enjoying the story; it's pretty weird, narratively speaking, because the protagonist is indeed fighting to exit his own story for quite a lot of it (volume 2 he's mostly just trying to keep his head above water).

** Wait, what? You ended it there?! With no denouement, not even a confirmation that Xavier and Rachel actually made it home?

I've been mostly enjoying this story until now, and would probably even have recommended it to people interested in manga tropes, but, if this is how it ends, I'm going to seriously reconsider that recommendation.

If this were a cliffhanger going into Volume 3, then sure, this would be fine, showing the frying pan they're leaving before resuming the next volume to show them the for they've ended up in (I still think, under those circumstances, that it would be improved by an epilogue wrapping up the viewpoints of some secondary characters, but I'd be willing to excuse its absence). But knowing that there's "No plans for a volume 3 at the moment" at all, I have to say that this ending has significantly soured my impression of the work as a whole. It would be like ending /Avengers: Endgame/ immediately after Tony snaps his fingers. Sure, that action /should/ resolve the main plot, but not actually seeing things resolve, and the aftermath, just leaves me feeling unsatisfied.

*** Thank you again for criticizing the cliff-hanger! I was pondering how to fix the issue, and I realized I was missing the obvious: the last chapter of a manga always takes place 5 years later!

- [[https://notamanga.com/volume-2/5-years-later/]]
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe/chapter/569816/5-years-later]]

I kept things intentionally brief, and couldn't resist that last little bit (which maybe undermines the whole "not a cliff-hanger" thing...), but hopefully that will offer a bit of closure for the characters of Volume 1, at the very least.

I'm going to leave the resolution open for the Volume 2 characters; I might well write a spin-off featuring some of them at some point, because I really like that world and didn't explore it nearly enough.

*** That's a very fair criticism. Reading back over the final chapter, that's ending is a total cliff-hanger, which I personally hate. I'll see if I can come up with a good way to indicate what happened immediately next, even if I don't tie up all the potential hanging threads!

** There's something odd at the end of chapter 39 of part 2; several paragraphs just repeat for some reason.

Aside from that, I think my main disappointment with Part 2 is that things wrap up just a little smidge /too/ neatly. The entire point here is about trying to force real life back in on a narrative - the narrative doesn't want Xavier to go home, and real life should /not/ end that neatly, so it's kind of... it just doesn't seem to work, from a metanarrative viewpoint.

Some examples:

- The World Snake is powerful, that's fair enough. But at the same time, the World Snake never seems to have to face the narrative going /against/ it; there are never conflicting aims for it to have to worry about.
- Princess. As Xavier predicted, she's an example of the narrative trying to tie him down, to force him into the new world. But given that, why is it even possible for the World Snake to modify her so that she can survive without Xavier? I was honestly expecting some sort of terrible choice at the last minute, with a strong possibility that Princess would go back to the real world with Xavier (and in a world full of nulls, she should have no worries about losing control). As a bonus, it means that Xavier and Princess would be in a perfect place to act as minor side characters in someone else's manga later...

Thanks for letting me know! I've fixed it up.

Yeah, I agree and this is something that I'd like to address if I end up revising Volume 2. Fun fact! When I was planning out the main arcs, the plot from Volume 2 was supposed to cover two volumes (the first predominantly from Xavier's viewpoint, and the second almost entirely from Rachel's). However, near the midpoint of Volume 1, my motivation was flagging, the readership had basically plateaued, and I ended up deciding to compress Volume 2 and 3 into a single, longer-than-I'd-planned volume.

One of the big casualties of this is that Rachel didn't get to spend much time on screen figuring out how the heck nima works, so the ending (and Princess's final arc) turned into a little more /deus ex machina/ than I originally hoped (and you're right, the world snake didn't get /nearly/ enough time embodied, as a result).

This kind of happened to me at the end of volume 1, too, actually. Unfortunately, the core premise that my characters are actively working against me meant that as soon as they spotted a way to exit the narrative, they'd go after it as fast as possible, which /really/ screws with the narrative timing (and I as the author colluded with them in both volumes, because I needed them to end). For future revisions, one of my big goals is to try and take a step back and consider "the author" as a character in the story with their own ongoing motivations and narrative behind the scenes. I think things would work out a lot more interestingly if once the tropes start to fail, the author starts to become desperate and throws more and more ridiculous road blocks up until they finally have to give up and just end the darn thing.

**** Nobody wanted to stop it. That army wanted to /kill/ it, and without the majority of the power it used to have it's never been weaker or more vulnerable. (Sure, it's still a massively powerful mage, but...)

But they didn't complete the plot, because Xavier never decided to stay.
