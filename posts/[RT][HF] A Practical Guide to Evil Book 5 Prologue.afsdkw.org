Best quote:

"Given Catherine's continued absence, I imagine an amount of brutal murder was involved"

*** Lines like this puzzle me. Characters keep depicting Catherine as brutal... and yet she lives on the same continent as Warlock, who blew up an entire city and everyone in it, goblins, who skin their enemies alive to send a message, dread emperors, who have a room full of screaming tortured heads, Masego, who kills anyone who tries to talk to him, Hasenbach, whose brilliant plans include "trap Black in a non-evacuated city so the terrified civilians keep his troops in place while they burn alive".

Catherine is incredibly tame in comparison.

**** i don't disagree.

However it's probably about expectation, if you expect someone to murder you sadistically and eat your children, then you dont call them brutal, you'll call them goblins, basically their name means they are expected to be.

The black knight i don't think is known for being brutal but for being efficent, at least the current iteration, and the squire not probably either since they can go either way, both white and black.

so if you don't expect someone to do something brutal it sticks to memory more then goblins being goblins.

**** That's certainly my reaction to it.

Seems the whole story did a 180-degree reversal toward the end of the Drow arc. Writer seemed to balk at the slavery thing (even though it wasn't even close) and wanted her to get her 'humanity' back for some reason. The main character is /all about/ self-mutilation to achieve her goals, it's just weird seeing her go on about being 'gloriously mortal' and giving up all that after the journey we went through.

***** I think, the quote of Masego is relevant here - "To think like a god is therefore to be a god". Cat has been slipping away from herself, without realasing it, and I think even us as readers didn't really notice it because the change is so gradual.

Then however, once she loses winter, the contrast is sharp and she realises how far gone she truly was. I think Warlock was right in a sense when he said Catherine died at second liese.

***** A young, cynical orphan girl is approached by the most dangerous and Evil man in the entire Dread Empire. She becomes his apprentice to help the Kingdom he helped to subjugate.

Also everything is governed, in-universe, by narrative logic, and the orphan girl's main advantage is that she's exceptionally genre savvy.

But whatever impression you got from my shitty summary, it's better than that.

Also if you're a fan of heroic banter, you've never heard villainous banter.
