This will allow her to experience everything from the opposite side, and make triple recursive DnD possible. Which would be great.

*** I was pretty sure it would happen. She was too powerful and offered mechanical solutions to too many problems. She could put someone together when they had literally been cut in half, offered an unassailable portable refuge, and could let the entire party turn into animals for fast aerial travel, sneaking into places, etc. She could scout at range with no risk and she was by far the heaviest hitter on the team, killing dozens of enemies without bothering to move from her seat. She threw the story out of whack and couldn't be allowed to persist.

** Was the prison host subverted by Fallatehr when the voice changed? Before its pause, it seemed quite lucent, even sapient (sapient = soul to manipulate?), i.e. making predictions on why Amy is visiting. Maybe a partial subversion that triggered the indiscriminate blanket response to the bomb threat? If the prison itself planned an ambush, it'd likely be a TPK already - supposing the majority of its magic isn't confined to the prison proper.

*** I'm thinking Fallatehr have found some kind of loophole or blindspot in the Amoureux Penitentiary's rules or mind, and used it to "pass on a letter" --- which the Amoureux Penitentiary honestly believed was a letter/was harmless/wasn't an object whose consequences could be an explosion. As such, when the "letter" detonated, the penitentiary naturally assumed it was a hostile action on Juniper's party's part. Buggy AI, not a malevolent one.

***** Orthogonal intelligence. The penitentiary's mind may be quite inhuman, and have "instinctive" understanding of certain actions and concepts, such as who prisoners/visitors are, what they're allowed to do, et cetera. "Sending a letter" may be something it understands as an action of a certain type, with certain possible consequences that do not include "an explosion". Hence, when an explosion happens, it puts low odds on it being caused by "a letter", and decides that "visitors" caused it.

An analogue: imagine that someone gave you a letter and said to pass it on to another person. That another person, upon your approach, attacks you. The letter had a magical mind-control enchantment meant to influence this person, but would that be your most likely explanation, a priori?

****** Sorry, I failed to emphasize that the intelligence seemed capable of higher reasoning, not just basic indexing and retrieval. Also, recognizing the source of any violence is part of the knowledge representation, a priori, expected of an autonomous prison built to deal with a number of equally autonomous inmates. The analogue depends heavily on the magical mind-control's limitations - does the mind-control cause the intelligence to ignore all evidence, given that the "attack" backfired and harmed the allegedly guilty party for a minimal payoff?

***** The italics aren't quite right throughout the fic, mostly because of how AO3 does their automated tagging, which will put a space inbetween italicized and unitalicized characters. It's a pain in the butt, and I mostly just let it be that way so I don't have to spend time reformatting it. Hopefully this isn't too annoying (and hopefully you won't see it everywhere once you notice it).

Fixed the other one though.

** I think Mary's insight at the end of chapter 56 is /really important./ For one thing, it explains druids pretty well. Druids are really good at staying "in character" and impressing the DM with their ideas, so they can convince the DM to let them cast powerful spells as long as they don't try to "peek behind the screen" to see if the rules are actually being followed.

Fenn's strategy of not thinking about the narrative might be the best plan in that case. Hopefully she's as popular with the DM as she is with everyone else, and if they don't inspect the narrative structure too closely, maybe the DM will help her out.

Is this the mistake Arthur made? The DM probably didn't appreciate his efforts to look deep into the rules of the world and /publicize/ it, if that's what he was doing. Maybe that's what Solace was alluding to when she implied he wasn't spreading only beneficial memes.

*** I couldn't figure out what enlightenment she reached. If cards=rules+RNG and illusion=realistic narrative suspending disbelief, the obvious conclusions are Luck (RNG) matters to the PC and more levels means greater agency in exploiting/bending the rules by extending the bounds of the illusion.

Druids! I was thinking about faith-based druidthink as a method to circumvent a DM-imposed traditional narrative of conflicts and resolutions. Adopt a Jedi Code mindset: accept the nature of the game reality, forgo attachments, and sidestep strict narratives by living in the present. A corollary would be self-imposed narratives -- Joon, unlike whatever we know of Uther, has a personal objective that likely aligns with the DM's endgame for him. The narrative cycles of repetition might not apply to him yet. If he believes in his own plot and precommits, the “place your figs” bit made me consider whether it's possible to always "roll for initiative" during quests (which appear to be guaranteed narrative arcs). Because at this point, none of them seem like freebies.

**** The cards are observable indicators of the rules, not necessarily the rules themselves. Joon explained why he let Mary's character die:

#+begin_quote
  “The game has rules, everyone had read them, so violating them would be violating this sacrosanct contract between gamemaster and players. It would be saying that grand gestures matter more than reality. I would have fudged it, if I could, but ...”
#+end_quote

Druids use grand gestures to affect reality, sort of. They just have to commit to /not knowing the rules/ so that the DM is allowed to "fudge it" behind a screen without being found out. If they learn enough physics, for example, to realize that a spell isn't possible, the DM has no choice but to let the spell fail. The screen is gone, everyone can tell what's happening.

I'm not sure what this means for the looping narrative structure. If it's a Rule, then learning more about it just means they're stuck with it, and the DM won't help. If it's just DM preference, then learning about it (and trying to manipulate it) just means the DM will abandon it to stop them from metagaming. Maybe they need to follow it to keep the DM happy, but don't pay too much attention so the DM can bend its rules a little? I don't see any easy answers here.
