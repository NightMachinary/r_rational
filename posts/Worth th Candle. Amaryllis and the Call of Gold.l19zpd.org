In the latest chapters, the Call of Gold seems concerned that Amaryllis will take gold from Juniper. Since Amaryllis gets half his skill everything, she is a gold mage and a rival then.

How does she control the call? Does having multiple competing Gold Mages lends credence to the hypothesis that each Call of Gold is a different instance of the same creature?


** Amaryllis might have skill in Gold Magic, but she hasn't cast the spell that bonds her to a repository of gold and makes her a Gold Mage. She doesn't have the Call until she does that.

** What I want to know is why gold magic isn't leveling up. It feels like in the beginning leveling up skills and getting perks was super important and recently the only time it was mentioned was when he did the soul magic cannibalization thing for the fight against Onion.

Why aren't we getting gold magic perks?

** Gold magic makes a mess of Synergy no matter how you interpret it. A reasonable reading, IMO, would be to give Amaryllis some fraction of his skill without the drawback of having to separately propitiate the bugbear, and I've said as much before. She didn't have to meditate or get hit with the stick at Sound and Stillness, she didn't undergo the training or initiation process for any other kind of magic except blood, so she should be a damn gold mage already.

*** The ritual to become a Gold Mage involves marking some gold as your own, you can't do the ritual to become a Gold Mage without doing so, so it isn't quite the same as meeting some other unlock condition. Since your strength as a Gold Mage is proportional to how much gold you have, you can effectively treat Mary as having half of Joon's (fairly low) level divided in half, then multiplied by the amount of gold she's marked as her own, i.e. none.

  We performed the ritual with five pounds of gold, with a street value of about ten thousand obols. It was only a small fraction of what we had available, but part of the point was to test it and see what kinds of demands would be levied against me in the first few minutes. - [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/537828/gilding-the-lily][Gilding the Lily]]

**** What makes having a wad of gold different from being tapped with a stick or going through years of study and practice? Bear in mind that Joon has six-eyed so DM legalism should be at least somewhat generous, and defining "having equivalent power to a given mass of gold" as a kind of "skill" isn't that much of a stretch--gold quantity functions as a partial analog to skill in other magics as it is. Saying she personally needs to have gold goes against the whole spirit of synergy, since that's obviously impossible.

If Joon broke the speed record to become a velocity mage, would Mary need to break the speed limit again to use his skill? Since water magic is tied to bloodline, is that barred to Mary? And what about her skill in gold magic is more absurd than Joon having half Fenn's skill in archery in spite of barely-if-ever touching a bow in his life? Or any of the rest of this? A reasonable DM compromise would be to give her half Joon's skill and half his hoard, which I'm guessing would make her substantially stronger than Aumann but with less control.

***** For other magicks there are internal pools like breath or concordance to determine their strength. Gold magic is based on external value of marked gold. Since Amaryllis has marked none her gold strength is zero.

****** False equivalency. Breath and concordance are mana bars, meant to limit the amount of power you can use within a given time period. They do not determine strength; Joon seems to control sound equally well whether he has full breath, half, or almost empty. By contrast, telekinesis doesn't use up gold; the limit in that respect is Joon getting physically exhausted throwing himself around.

******* I think a better analogy would be bone magic. You can be a pretty skilled bone mage, but if you don't have any bones to use, your skill isn't worth much. Gold magic is similar in that it relies on an external resource to use the magic, even if that resource isn't consumed through use of the magic. Similarly, gem mages don't do much without any gems, and warders can at most see magic if they don't have any warder's tools. Gem mages might be a closer analogue to gold magic, since the gems themselves do play a significant factor in how powerful the gem mage effectively is.

******** Nothing is really a close analog, gold magic being weird, but bones are a mana-type fuel and gems and wands are implements, closer to a bladebound's sword. The gold doesn't have to be anywhere near the user (or even on the same plane, as we've seen), it's purely a cap on maximum power exerted. If anything, it's closer to a stat like POI or STR, a secondary limit on skill growth, and Synergy ignores those.

***** Have we seen her use water magic?

I think having half his skill without the actual ability (so she would have half his skill once she completes the ritual) is completely reasonable, given that the call of the gold is inherent, ongoing cost of the magic, and she wouldn't want to have it unexpectedly. It also doesn't seem like it'd be compatible with a shared hoard.

****** But that's obviously unworkable, since if they were both gold mages with separate hoards each would demand it of the other and either one would be a double-strength superman and the other unpowered, or both would refuse to act and lose it. You're effectively excluding this one spell type from synergy. The whole point of that perk is to let each of them hitchhike on the other's strength without putting in the effort or paying the price to get the skill. Possession of a hoard is a prerequisite for power, not a mana-type cost (nor an implement like a gem mage's gems), so in the absence of an overwhelming reason to deny it I'd say it's only fair to let her hitchhike on this the way she hitchhikes on all the magic and Joon hitchhikes on her social skills.

***** The difference is that having gold is a constant requirement that the skill is directly based on, and all the other conditions are initial requirements that unlock the skill without modifying it in any way. Plus, the former is reversible by normal game mechanics (i.e. losing the gold) while the latter isn't.

It also makes way more sense from a thematic and story perspective to not have Mary gain access to it, an argument that holds a lot of weight for a system that is being maintained by the DM, who has a story he wants to tell and can make arbitrary decisions that go against what seems "reasonable" for him to allow. The whole point of Gold Magic is that, ultimately, the Call of the Gold only wants one person to have access to it. If it turned out Mary could use it as well it would likely tell Joon to either lower her Loyalty or kill her to stop that. The idea of both gaining access to it by having separate gold hoards is /supposed/ to be unworkable, because the entire skill is supposed to be unworkable.

****** No power set is supposed to be shared between people in the first place. Joon isn't "supposed" to learn at 500x normal speed or spontaneously regrow limbs after accumulating sufficient life experiences. Joon's life is a giant bundle of unfair exceptions, but it's also a game and that punk-ass DM is reneging for no particularly good reason when Mary could have done a lot of damage control before Joon got back from Celestar. Also, it's not clear to me that the Call of the Gold is an independent entity instead of the DM talking into a mic. Joon treats it like one, but in the same way I cuss at my computer at work. It doesn't have much of a personality.
