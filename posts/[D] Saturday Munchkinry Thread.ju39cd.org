Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** How could you take advantage of extremely strong powers with a really limited range of effect. Any one power from the following list:

- You can travel back in time exactly 5 seconds. This activation has a cooldown, also of exactly 5 seconds. The activation happens instantly, and you're at exactly the position and pose you were 5 seconds ago (think Tracer's ability from Overwatch).

- You have the ability to impart 10 million Newtons of force from your palms or your soles. This force is imparted for exactly 1 cm of travel. During this time your hands or legs are indestructible (and as such protected from the impulse), and your body is protected from any immediate environmental effects of your power. You can use this power once every minute. Outside of your power, your body is like that of a normal human being.

- You can split into 10,000 clones almost instantaneously for 1 minute. The clones only appear in places that will admit their dimensions around you, in a density of about 1 clone per square meter. After one minute, the combined knowledge and thoughts of each clone gets merged inside your brain with no difficulty, just like your own thoughts and knowledge. However, you are still able to forget things your clones thought up/ learned. The clones act as if they have the same mass and inertia as you, and they can interact with most objects. But if they are imparted upon by a force of more than 5N or a work of more than 5J they dissipate into nothingness (air pressure notwithstanding). After one minute, they also dissipate into nothingness. This ability can be used once every hour.

- Once every day you can speed up time around your brain to experience one second as 10,000 seconds. During this time your body moves as if it's in real time, but your eyes can move around synced up with your mind (at 10,000x faster speed). Blinks still take the same 400 ms, which you will experience as 4000 seconds. However, after this second ends in real time you feel as if you had 3 hours of effective rest.

*** With the first power you can quickly become very rich gambling/trading on the stock market.

Start with whatever money you have/can borrow, go gambling in blackjack or a similar game with a quick circle of decision/reward. Make a lot of money, leave a generous tip, buy drinks at the bar for everyone so you have better chances of getting out of there with your winning and not being "persuaded" to keep playing.

Now it's time for the stock market. With only five seconds you need a derivative that moves really fast like options near their end, or a lot of leverage.

To become rich with the second power, that pressure is maybe enough to make diamonds out of carbon? Alternatively go robbing banks by punching through walls and safes.

With the third power you can flood entire buildings with copies of yourself, so industrial espionage if you happen to know exactly when something interesting is going to be shown in plain view or reachable within a minute. Time the important slide in a presentation, or use one clone to restrain a upper level manager while another reads their email when the account has been unlocked. Send money to a cryptocoin account when someone has their home banking app open.

There are two drawbacks: the first is the extreme unreliability. You know that with ten thousands copies you're bound to find some opportunity at any given timw, but you can't predict which. The second is that everyone will know that you were there. Wear a mask at the very minimum.

Also but less usefup: become a one man army. One minute is enough to point 9,999 guns at many different targets from a lot of different vantage points. (you don't want to risk the life of the original you just to fire one more bullet, do you?)

The fourth power is strong in the long run: having three hours more each day is going to have a cumulative positive effect on you career/studies. Impress you boss/professors with the ability to find solutions in a very short time.

Also maybe gain an edge in chess tournaments?

Now that I think about it, are your equipment also cloned? Surely the clones don't spawn naked right? Though duplicating guns may be pushing it, so you would need to buy 9999 guns, and carry them around somehow. And people would be mighty curious when they see you have 9999 guns on you.

****** After some major news yes, but it's kind of uncommon best you can do are market openings and hope for an opening gap up or down. Buy something, rewind time if there's a gap down or no gap and try again tomorrow.

That's why I suggested options: the closer they are to their expiration, the quicker they move.

For a bizzarre example, on 20 April 2020, between 2:28 pm and 2:30 pm, oil prices went from 17$ per barrel to negative 40$ per barrel. ([[https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lhy2h328jhpt/Inside-the-Biggest-Oil-Meltdown-in-History]])

That's weird because the movement ended in negative price territory, but with options and precognition you have theoretically no upper bound on how much you can profit. As long as you find someone willing to take your bet, because at that point it's practically gambling.

This doesn't sound all that different from standard super strength, just you are only able to use it once per minute. Still, that means you can do all kinds of super strength things such as breaking stuff for demolition/recycling or spinning a turbine for electricity (may need a more complicated setup to channel that sudden power burst every minute and to stay within the 1cm distance limitation).

This power is pretty much the above two mixed together. You get 10000 clones worth of thinking time for 1 minute every hour (so not unlimited, sadly). You also get the strength of 10000 clones for that minute.

One thing I must ask though... are the clones weightless? Because if they disappear when faced with a force of >5N, what about their weight? If they weigh the same as you do, the floor they stand on almost certainly imparts >5N on them to support their weight. (Quote wikipedia: The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about 608 N.) So would they just go poof instantly?

If weight does not cause them to poof, then the combined weight of 10000 clones suddenly appearing can be used to do useful work. The simplest application is having them appear on one end of a lever, so their weight pushes up the other end to lift objects. But naturally more complicated mechanical devices can be created, up to and including spinning a turbine for electricity. After all, if you weigh 100 kg, those 10000 clones appearing would instantly apply a downward force of roughly 10,000,000 newtons. So that actually matches the previous 10 million newton power, albeit limited to a downward direction and spread out over a much greater volume.

Probably the weakest of the listed powers. You get much less free thinking time than the first and third powers, though still pretty useful. You don't get any of the force boosts of the second and third powers, unless you somehow use the movement of your eyeballs to apply it. (That would probably hurt quite a lot so let's not even go there!)

Still, 10000 additional seconds of free thinking time, combined with 3 hours of effective rest per day (which I assume means you need 3 hours less sleep), would give you almost 6 hours more time per day. Assuming a healthy sleep cycle of 8 hours a day, a normal person only has 16 hours per day, while you have 22 hours, which means you have 37.5% more time than everyone else. Not particularly overpowering, but still pretty neat.

**** I should have clarified better for the clones. they behave as if they have the same mass and inertia as your body, but they're mostly weightless. Any big enough outside force on them disperses them like smoke. However I think the limit is high enough to get them to work with small objects.

One thing I think might make thinking hard, you'd have to divide up a task into 10,000 chunks to take maximum advantage of your one minute, which might take a while to set up. Unless you use one instance of your power to divide up the task, but even then you'd have to check for overlaps between your clones.

** All humans have the ability to teleport instantaneously to any chosen location in the universe. They can do this once per second.

To do so, they have to identify a specific place they want to go. "The surface of planet Venus" works if you have an idea of what Venus is, but fails if you don't know enough identifying factors about it. For example, knowing "it is a place called Venus and it is hot" is not sufficient, but having an impression of its size and location is enough.

"The nearest convenience store" fails as a target, as the person is asking their power to identify a place rather than choosing one themselves. "The current location of former president Barack Obama" similarly fails as a target.

- It turns out this doesn't equate to time travel, for whatever reason.

- Humanity as a race has always had this power, rather than suddenly receiving it.

- The teleportation is seamless: it doesn't cause sudden air displacement or vacuums. It also adjusts people to the velocity of the place they teleport to.

- Teleportation will shift people to the nearest unoccupied space rather than intersect with other solid objects.

- People bring their clothing and up to an armful of whatever they are carrying.

Travel is limited by two things. First is how far we can see. (We do, therefore, develop telescopes - and cameras are travel aids). Second is the ability to survive once we get there (teleporting to the Moon is /not/ the best idea, but a far better idea than teleporting to Venus). Some people maintain caches of stuff in hard-to-reach places - several of these caches are on the moon (to retrieve it, prepare to hold your breath a couple of seconds...) - much to the dismay of the average doctor.

The discovery of exoplanets is followed, within a week, by people visiting those planets. Humanity rapidly expands to live anywhere vaguely habitable in the universe, and starts to work on making the other places more habitable.

maybe we could try brute-forcing all possible places, for example first dream them up or make them up from photos/computer graphics, and then teleport them?

maybe we can create a fake document about second Earth-like planet in the universe, then convince somebody that this planet really exists, and then ask him to tteleport there?

this really should work as long as somewhere in the universe is a place matching description, because there is no way to tell a difference between knowing a place well because you saw real photos etc and knowing a place well because you saw fake photos

**** I'm not convinced that approach would work, but it would also probably be unnecessary regardless. Each person can teleport once per second, so visiting a star and examining its planets from orbit would be trivial with just a compressed air source and an insulating pressure suit.

Given current technology, you could conceivably place a high-res panoramic camera on the astronaut's helmet, take an image of everything nearby, have the astronaut teleport 1,000 miles forward, take another image, and then work out the position of all nearby planets, moons, and large asteroids. A HUD could be integrated into the helmet to show where each of those bodies are, and how far away they are. The astronaut could then travel to each and survey it from orbit. Sufficiently earth-like planets could be examined from their upper atmosphere, and later on their surface if they appear to be within safe bounds for gravity and temperature.

A single astronaut could likely survey a whole system within about five minutes, or just about 100 systems in an 8-hour shift. A space exploration force with 100,000 astronauts could survey 2.46 billion systems per year, which would be fast enough to systematically survey the entire Milky Way within 40 to 160 years.

***** I mean, if you put aside all the terrible terrible things that evil people would do to destroy civilization and cause the survivors to live hidden in terror, this power is great. You don't even need to find habitable planets, you can just build space stations to live on, and these space stations can be placed pretty much anywhere in the universe. After all, to get materials and power, they can simply have the people teleport to other places to get them.

Build solar panels with large batteries, teleport them next to some star or other, teleport it back and voila, power.

And even non-habitable planets contain plenty of resources. Mars is full of iron and water, that is absolutely not worth transporting off the planet normally, but with teleportation that transport becomes super cheap and quick.

Asteroids are also a great source of ice, which you can use electricity to melt then electrolyze to generate oxygen.

****** True, although it would be easier to grow crops on habitable planets since water will at least flow downward, pressure leaks won't wipe out the habitat, and hazards from long-term exposure to radiation while working there wouldn't be a concern. Radiation might actually be the biggest challenge, since going by ICRP's radiation exposure limits, workers shouldn't exceed 50 mSv per year, and no more than 100 mSv in any 5-year span. Spending 180 days in solar orbit between Earth and Mars would result in exposure to about 250 mSv, so you'd be limited to 36 days per year, or 72 days over 5 years.

Of course, if you only need to spend eight hours per day, then that does improve the situation significantly. 72 (continuous) days would turn into 216 work days over a five year span. This would mean that about 17.5% of your shifts could be spent in space mining, surveying, assembling space stations, transporting materials, etc.

Aside from the benefit of finding low-radiation places to work, surveying would also be useful in terms of being able to identify planets with geological processes which naturally concentrate ores, like how Earth's water cycle can dissolve precious metals, carry it underground, and deposit it in veins which can be mined. The same can be said of ancient biological processes which have left behind valuable sedimentary mineral formations like coal, oil, lignite, limestone, marble, dolomite, goethite, etc.

Turns out that is not true, because galaxies are flooding the universe with deadly radiation.

On the other hand, isn't radiation actually pretty easy to block? If I recall correctly, you would just need to encase the station in thick walls of lead.

Now, we could never ever do that in real life because lifting that much heavy heavy lead from the Earth into space would take an absurd amount of rocket fuel, but teleportation solves that problem.

More computing power beyond its basic requirements doesn't make it smarter, and you will need to improve the software if increased intelligence is the goal.

The source code of all the programming is readable - output of the programs varies, such that e.g. you can loop what it sees with its eyes to a computer monitor but reading its thoughts of the “I think I'd like a hamburger for dinner” type will require careful study and interpretation of the logs.

**** Sockets: the sockets are in a spot on the lower back where the robot can reach and plug stuff in if it desires but apparently the designer wasn't too concerned about making them super convenient for whatever reason. Maybe a design flaw but one which can be worked around.

Self improvement: the robot doesn't know enough about programming at this point in time to do so, and is also concerned about breaking itself by accident but in principle it could do so if you give it the password for root access.

Where it came from: you got it while licitly obtaining title to an abandoned storage unit/inherited it from your eccentric distant relative who got it from an abandoned storage unit, and discreet inquiries suggest that whoever abandoned the storage unit abandoned it due to being nonfunctional.

#+end_quote

I'm still very concerned about this robot having not-"nonfunctional" copies elsewhere, developed by its progenitor.

This is world-changing technology.

What I'd probably do is:

- continue discreet enquiries
- ask the robot what it wants, because everything after this is conditional on its consent
- partner with some discreet research lab to try to identify the robot's origins and maximum capabilities, as well as determining ways of differentiating robots like this one from humans
- press campaign: Robots walk among us, Bot-san here is one. Here's what they're capable of. /Here's a simple, foolproof, safe way to detect them/ so that there's no bot-hunters going around killing humans by mistake, and /here's why trying to kill them doesn't work/, and also they're probably all government agents whose deaths will fuck over the killer. We haven't discovered their origin. Bot-san's parkour videos are funded via this Patreon account. At the $10,000/month level you can ask Bot-san to run specific courses, terms and conditions may apply.

*** Step the first: Impromptu Turing Test (i.e. spend some time chatting with it and see just how human the responses are). I assume it comes out of the test with a result of "indistinguishable from human", which leads me on to Step the second.

Step the second: Find out what the robot wants. It's clearly a sapient life form, so I should not ignore its wishes. Attempt to encourage the robot towards self-improvement and learning enough programming to be able to write small helper programs for itself (but encourage it to be super careful modifying its base code).

*** Well, there's the boring but responsible answer:

Step 1) Contact Eliezer with proof, then turn it of and keep it off and hidden for however many years until either he says the alignment problem is solved in a satisfactory way, and follow any other orders he gives me.

Step 2) Hand it over to whatever more competent authority he tells me to, probably MIRI, that can make it foom quickly but safely.

But assuming something happens that makes that and other similar approaches imposible. Maybe everyone related to AI safety in any way got assassinated, and there's more likely than not a nuclear war going of in a few days or weeks. So here is the crazy power fantasy we're-definitely-going-to-die-or-far-worse version:

a) Unplug the mind form the body, and start studying the code, writing visualizers and inspection tools for anything that isn't human readable. Before I change anything, or let it do anything, I need to know what it's goal system is, and exactly how it's implemented.

b) tie it up+unplug limb motors, so it can only move its head, and have a long conversation about ethics and AI alignment. Does what it self reports match what I observed in the guts of the system?

Now what I do next depends entirely on what those two reveal, but if it acts exactly like a human, and was put into a shell like that to imitate a human, then presumably it's fairly human-like in the underlying mechanisms as well, so much the same kind of things should apply as to an upload.

c) Port it to run on amazon cloud without a body, just a virtual desktop. Since it runs debian this should be quite easy. With that and some minor scripts, I should be able to instantly scale up the number of copies to as many as I can afford without having to bother with hardware.

d) do some quick hacks to slightly increase the chances of alignment, like observing the internal reactions to various phrasings of an order to act friendly, pegging various correlates of altruism and empathy at maximum and selfishness at minimum, rewarding and punishing certain thought patterns, etc. Test these as thoroughly as I can

e) run a bunch of copies, at increased speed. If I can't seem to increase the speed that is almost certainly an artificial limitation I can just find and remove in the source code (after carefully reading comments regarding WHY the limitation was put there. If not, just spoofing the system clock and/or using a virtual machine should get around it.

f) assign some of the copies to mechanical turk and other online work, to start exponentially increasing the amount of money and computing power available.

g) have the other copies read everything there is regarding AI safety and alignment, and anything else relevant, as well as everything related to rationality, practice programing skill, and gmisc education that might be vaguely relevant. Thoroughly test them so that all this has been merged together in a single copy and retained.

h) Test it relentlessly at everything safety related, have more long conversations as before to try to make sure it's motivated to become and stay more aligned, mess with and freeze parts of it's brain to make it harder for it to deviated from that. Also peg correlates with rationality high.

i) Have a large amount of them do friendliness work like a human would, in the fastest speedup I can get them to. This is both because the work needs going, and as a test to see if they've understood those topics.

j) Repeat 'h' and 'i' a few times.

k) gut a bunch of copies into hemispheres and modalities, try to bruteforce qualitative intelligence by just slaving bits of additional copies to a central one, or linking hemispheres in a 1>2>3>4>1 instead of a 1>2>1, etc. Cheap brutish hacks basically, throwing more compute and more neurons at the problem.

l) Repeat 'j' a few times to see if it still seems sane and produces higher quality results. Probably repeat 'k' and 'i' a bunch of times as it doesn't.

m) Repeat 'i' a lot, with a lot more parallel setups of the whole setup, until both me and the AI are confident I can't contribute anything meaningful.

n) Collapse all the copies into one with memories etc. to bottleneck everything through that easier to understand system.

o) Have a long conversation with it about what'll happen next.

p) Set up a script that will transfer ownership of the money, admin of the servers, root access to it's own code, stuff it can use to use my legal identity, create as many copies of the AI in the cloud as possible, and disable any part I put in to prevent it from self modifying or following my orders over it's own conscience.

q) Hook the script to a very big, very red, very shiny button.

r) Press the button dramatically, and run the other way

s) Disappear into the frozen wilderness so if it /didn't/ work, I won't survive to see it and can't be held responsible. Make sure I have a bomb to destroy my brain completely rapidly if that seems like it'll be needed.

Not that at no point was the humanoid shell, or even being able to move, at all relevant.

** Upgrading a character from my tabletop campaign, and I am having trouble identifying useful areas of growth.

My character is a movie character who walked out of the screen and took a bit of it with him. He has strange movie based powers like Jump Cut(short-range teleport), Episodic Healing(regeneration), Cinematic Score(very limited clairvoyance by interpreting the current background music) and a gun that only hits what it's aiming at( it can miss, but never damages anything but the target) and never needs reloading( but optionally can be reloaded for dramatic effect and for a one use bonus to hit.)

This character is based on Cort, from the Quick and the dead, played by Russle Crowe. He recently power up such that he can switch between several of Russle crowes other characters, and have powers approat to them, as well as a base form representing Russle Crowe as seen in interviews. So here is where I'm at.

What Russel Crowe roles should I select(up to nine total) and what powers should I focus on from each?

Current already selected roles:

Base form Ira (Russel Crowes middle name)

Most of his points are spent on defensive passive abilities and he is paying the cost of the transform power to allow the others to exist. Slight mental control ability from his occasional role as a narrator(forcibly narrating opponents makes them follow that narrative)

James J Braddock (Cinderella man)

1930 heavyweight boxing champ, martial skills with an added ability to increase density for damage reduction and increased weight and strength (as this movie is based on a true story, he just has more weight to him than any other role, yep, most powers have a pun basis)

Cort from the quick and the dead

Slightly nerfed, lost some powers when ira became base form as all other forms are built to a lower point cap. Lost some range on teleport and power to summon a horse from off screen. Otherwise powers as listed above

Maximus from The Gladiator

Can call in a catapult strike from off screen and is very good at disarm, for up to three attacks after disarming someone he is proficient with their weapon, weather it's a sword, bow, Lazer pistol, or enchanted club. Also general martial competence

Those are already in use and cannot be removed but can to some extent be modified. Now I'm trying to pick the other 5 roles. Because of the limited power of nonbase forms, generally I can put one or two useful powers on a role after buying minimus necessary expenses, so each one will be specialized. The goal is to have a rounded overall character at the end. There will be some gaps, for example Russell Crowe never played a magic user ( a doctor who studied Egyptian magic, and a detective following a runaway wife starting a kind of shamanestic internship, but no direct magic users) but there are others on my team to fill them.

Tldr, Choosing from Russell Crowes IMDB history, using 8 characters plus a base form, and up to two powers from each, make an effective character. You may switch between roles instantly and often as you want but don't piss of the dm, damage and exhaustion will endure through role changes, power ups will not. All powers pull from the same source.

Any power selected must have been displayed or strongly implied by the role receiving it, or be derived from Cinematic physics.

I have a few starting points, but this is already too long. I will post them in reply to this comment. The system used is Heros 6th edition, but due to its flexibility and complexity I don't encourage consulting it for ideas. Any power can probably be made in the system, but the point cost do not follow rules I could feasibly explain in this medium.

*** ...I don't know the first thing about Russel Crowe. But some thoughts on generic cinema powers...

- A thief character might be able to pick locks off-screen
- A "Master Of Disguise" type character can outright replace a minion of the bad guy while off-screen (but never a named Bad Guy, only a minion)
- A detective can make surprisingly accurate "hunches" on the basis of insufficient evidence
- A character may have the power "Dramatic Death Scene" which means that if he's killed, then instead he's disabled (can't move, can talk at length, can do simple actions like firing a pistol) for several hours, as long as he keeps talking (and he can keep going "And one more thing!" as long as he wants). He still dies if he stops talking, but it allows an ally time to obtain a healing potion or similar.
- "Never Found The Body" - if he dies in such a way as to leave no body, he gets to come back a few scenes later (he might dive into a river when hear death to take advantage of this). This might even follow the Dramatic Death Scene above.
