** I really do like Avatar, and Legend of Korra. Generally speaking, they do a really, really good job with the world they've built ... for a kid's show. You see all sorts of examples of mundane utility with the powers, and in general people aren't stupid for stupid reasons. Aside from a few missteps, they're stupid for smart reasons. But yes, I would like to see an "adult" fic with all the schools of bending taken to their logical conclusions. Maybe not even set within the canon plotlines (even though that cuts down on the need to build up new characters), but just ... taken farther than the show does.

For the record, I don't think that bonebending would really work, given how difficult bloodbending is supposed to be, and how little mineral there is in bones compared to how much water there is in the body. That's not to say that it's an unbelievable extrapolation, but it seems kind of iffy to me - if it were easy, you would expect bloodbending to be a /lot/ easier, so I have to think that a person's chi interferes with bending, making bending their internals very difficult. Same reason that you don't see dessicationbending, where a waterbending simply pulls all the water out of their opponent.

I would totally write a rational fic for Avatar if I had the time - it's one of my favorite series. I think it somewhat unfortunately covers a lot of its bases in a way that certain other series don't, which makes it a little less of a likely target.

****** It almost certainly does apply, which is why bloodbending is so hard. The canonical explanation of bending is that it's the extension of your /chi/ outside of your body, so it makes a whole lot of sense that you can't extend your /chi/ directly into someone else's. I would be very, very surprised if the Manton effect were not in play.

Edit: Because if it's not, firebending should be able to flash boil a person's brain from the inside and waterbending should be able to freeze a person's brain - neither of which is used or even hinted at, even when the opponents have lethal intent and little in the way of moral constraints.

******* Bloodbending is a learnable and teachable skill canonically, and most waterbending such as chi healing could most certainly be used in such a fashion as you propose. It would require a person who is motivated and empowered to do so and overcome whatever metaphysical resistance of their target. There are also people who can bloodbend outside of the full moon's strengthening influence in Korra's time.

Firebending is shown to be an outward skill, with only a few focused on the internal effects you can do with it. Iroh, Dragon of the West, Learned internal firebending skills from both his dragon master and his observation of the watertribe to understand how one might manipulate internal chi to redirect lightning. The Breath of Fire, an internal technique, seems like it is not a common skill and something that Iroh might have learned from his Dragon teacher to which he passed onto Zuko.

The Manton effect applies in Worm as a set law of the universe with Faultline being unable effect living wood with her power and we can clearly find evidence that bending can be used on living subjects of both plant and animal in the Avatar Universe. The Foggy Bottom swamp bender that used the trees, Katara drawing water from the plant life around her as examples where a Manton effect would forbid such things from happening. Explosion Man too is an example of an unusual firebender who could cause explosions at a distance unlike how it is normally done. If he could score a direct hit, I would think that the flesh itself would be superheated and then explode.

The Manton Effect was Wildbow's attempt at solving one of the big problems with superpowers, which is that there are an enormous amount of lethal possibilities for someone that can, for example, create a forcefield through your chest or telekinetically crush your heart. I'm not proposing that the exact same thing applies here, just that the general principle is probably the same - the reason that we don't see people freezing brains isn't that it has never occurred to them, but because it's not possible (or very difficult).

*** I don't think people are giving firebending enough credit. I mean, at it's core, firebending is pure energy manipulation. Thinking along those lines, you could do amazing things. Surround yourself in an unfocused aura of blazing radiation. Good luck stopping a stream of high powered gamma rays! Release enormous flashes of intense light to permanently blind your opponents. Charge the air so that a single lightning bolt forks outwards to dozens of targets. And of course firebenders can manipulate electricity, and that's what neurons run on. They could send someone into seizures just by firing a little static into your brain. Or manipulate your emotions by stimulating certain areas of the brain. Or increase their own brain power with Electrical Brain Stimulation to increase their learning, memory, and reflexes. And other benders can bend their environment, so why not firebenders? Concentrate the full power of the sun on a person, or a whole city! They'll be reduced to ashes in seconds. Want to be subtle? Just bend the sun's ultraviolet radiation onto a target, no one will see or feel a thing- at least until a few minutes later when they break out in a terrible sunburn and die of radiation poisoning.

And that's just the start of it. If, hypothetically, an firebender (i.e. energybender) can add energy to a system, then maybe they can take it out. Halt the kinetic energy of projectiles (or increase it), freeze water in an instant, bring the flow of air to a complete standstill, or instantly drop a persons temperature to below zero. But admittedly that's just speculation. Perhaps something for our protagonist to research...

Firebending is without a doubt the most overpowered bending by a factor of five-hundred thousand, no, make that five-hundred trillion. The firebenders just need to realize it.

Then again, fire is just a chemical reaction--oxidation. If you can bend fire, you could perhaps bend any form of oxidation.

But isn't all energy one in the same? The charged particles that start the chemical reaction of fire are presumably the same that manifest as lightning. There appears to be no fuel furebenders are summoning to burn, just the fire, which is what led me to believe it is simply raw energy. I guess it ultimately depends on the mechanism of fire bending. But I still stand by my assumptions. Taken to its logical conclusion, the chemical reaction of fire is simply a byproduct of a firebenders input of energy.

Hah, on the E=mc^{2} note, yeah I was actually going to argue that an advanced firebender with a little concentration could transmute any element from thin air. But manipulating elementary particles into existence might require some finer instruments that human hands.

Regardless its fun to think about.

** I haven't read all of stuff here and if this has been said I apologise, but I've seen people both in the tumblr thread and here talk about "bending energy" or "bending oxidation" and...

This is probably not what's going on? At all? Avatar has spirits, spirits of the /ocean/ and the /moon/ and spirits of /good/ and /evil/. It's a world where mental things are fundamental. When people bend fire, they're not doing anything as prosaic as bending oxidation of anything (after all, they're bending fire out of /thin air/), they're doing spiritualsy stuff that corresponds roughly to some conceptual idea of fire.

The most obvious point of evidence here is earth bending. What the /hell/ is /earth/?! Earth benders can and do frequently bend a /lot/ of different types of earth all over the world, so it's not any specific precise chemical composition. Besides, all earth has trace metal, so what's so special about metal? This does not /look/ like a reductionistic universe, it looks like one that's fundamentally mental with the "concept" of earth directing the bending and not any specific chemical or physical consideration. That, or earth and water and air and fire are /fundamental/ elements just like carbon and iron are in our world.

Which constrains very little our anticipations! It looks like you could argue anything into being called "earth" or even "air." So we take our cues from canon, and in canon, the /least/ versatile element /is/ fire, which is basically only seen as the destructive force, with fire, explosions, and lightning being the only examples we're shown. Contrast with water, that can freeze or melt or boil, that can apparently /heal/ (how on /earth/ does that happen?!) and control internal bodily fluids (to the point where [[#s][Spoilers first season of Korra]]!!!)

So yeah, I maintain my original position on tumblr that fire is the least useful bending :P

Everyone has a /chi/, and bending can simply be described as extending the influence of your /chi/ beyond your body in order to manipulate your surroundings. This is why bending is so tied to martial arts - the physical exertion serves as a focal point to /chi/ extension, but isn't strictly necessary.

So it's not really something that can be measured in terms of meters, because it requires metaphysical concepts.

***** From [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Lavabending][the wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  The first known use of lavabending was by the Fire Nation Avatar who preceded Yangchen, who used the technique while in the Avatar State to cause the simultaneous eruption of four small volcanoes. Centuries later, the technique was utilized by Avatar Kyoshi when Chin approached her peninsula in an attempt to claim it as part of his empire. In order to protect her people, Kyoshi utilized her bending to split the peninsula from the Earth Kingdom mainland. In order to accomplish this, Kyoshi created fissures and bent lava up from underneath the landmass in order to sever it completely from the continent.

  While attempting to master the Avatar State by harnessing the energy of the sun during the winter solstice in 55 BG, Avatar Roku remained stuck in the Avatar State as a result of the overwhelming power that rushed through his body. During this time, he inadvertently caused the eruption of a small volcano near the Fire Temple on Crescent Island. Roku eventually mastered the Avatar State and used lavabending once more in 12 BG, diverting a massive lava flow in an attempt to save his home island from a volcanic eruption.

  Following his death, Avatar Roku manifested through Aang in 99 AG and used lavabending to destroy the Fire Temple during the winter solstice, in order to punish the Fire Sages who had since abandoned their duties to the Avatar in service of the Fire Lord.

#+begin_quote
  Trying to make bending fit our physics can only go wrong, but let's try. Something tells me Ghazan heating up earth to create lava makes him the most powerful bender in the entire LoK universe, and I get pretty pissed at how the show has been all over the place regarding people's powers.

  In the latest episode he turns a decent chunk of earth into lava, creating a pit looking thingie to fend off the attacks of the metal clan guards. Let's guestimate its size at 5m radius, 1m deep. That makes it 25π cubic meters of earth that was heated into lava. According to Wikipedia, "lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 °C". So let's say 1,000 °C, and let's also assume that's exactly the melting point of the rock, to make the math more simple. Looking at [[http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met455/notes/section6/2.html][this page on the thermal properties of soil]], it says the temperature of soil 30cm down doesn't vary a lot, staying at about 35 °C at any given time of the day. The same page will give you the specific heat of solid rock, at 750 J/(kg*K), and its density, 2700 kg/m^{3}.

  So we want to get ~212,000 kg of rock, from 308.15 K to 1273.15K, and then we want to melt that rock. The initial heating takes 212,000 kg * 965 K * 750 J/(kg*K) = 153,435,000,000 J of energy. Melting takes 212,000 kg * (225,000 J/kg) = 47,700,000,000 J of energy, totaling about 200 GJ (gigajoules), [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29][equivalent to about 180 lightning bolts, or 4 MOAB bombs, the second most powerful non-nuclear weapon ever designed]]. That means Ghazan can produce as much energy as 180 of the world's best firebenders, in a few seconds.

Contrast with waterbending, which can be used to make engines, ice houses, /and/ for healing, /and/ for food preservation, which cuts out a large amount of labor.

Contrast with firebending, which has by far the most industrial uses. Sure, they can't build their own houses like the waterbenders or earthbenders, but once they have a village established, they can build similar engines and basically cut out all need for ovens and/or heating, which is enormously useful. That's without even getting to the metallurgy that they're capable of given the amount of heat they can produce.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]] by Vathara managed to construct an AU where all of the nations really made sense. The story mostly follows Zuko and Iroh. By more strongly integrating the concept of the spirit world and the Avatar's role as the spirit bridge, a very interesting story creeps up.

One of my favorite parts of this story is the absolute terror that having the Avatar, whose job it is to mediate with spirits partly on mortals' behalf, actually merge with the water spirit at the North Pole causes across the entire world.

The story is complete, everything is resolved, although the final chapter feels like it was a cap put in place to allow the author to finally just finish the story. The 700k words before it are golden.

** I feel like this basically misses the point and appeal of various elements of the show. The appeal of bending in the first place is simply that it's cool. If it was something you had to think about, it wouldn't be as much fun. /Harry Potter/ also puts no thought into its magic, and both of these series are wildly popular. This should tell you something. It doesn't matter how the Fire Nation wiped out the Air Nomads. It's the start of the conflict. Who cares how it happened? The bending fights are not about /bending/, they're about clashes of personality and power. The differences in the fighting styles between Azula and Zuko in their final battle symbolize their character arcs. Zuko has found his center. He is calm and capable, and this is seen in the way he holds his ground the entire fight. Azula is cracking under the pressure of power and paranoia, and this is shown by her erratic and wild motions that carry her around the battlefield. The fight would be worsened if they had to instead fight with intelligence and munchkinery instead of symbolism.

Not that the appeal and point of a story can't be changed to be other things. But it's worth appreciating how a lack of attention to certain details can allow other things to come to the fore, and how necessary those details are in the first place to crafting an enjoyable and popular story. Certainly one can't lose track of storytelling elements simply to be rational. Have Zuko and Azula fight rationally, but it still needs to be symbolic of their opposed character arcs.

But the HP series deliberately makes a choice to focus on the milieu at the expense of the bland, predictable characters. A:TLA deliberately makes a choice to have a simple plot and a simple world to bring the characters into strong focus. Considering how bland and empty the world of A:TLA is and how simple and derivative the magical mechanics are, what exactly is the point of writing fanfiction about /that/ as opposed to about the characters, who would do well in any world? You are very nearly writing original fiction; might as well make it something you can sell.

Besides, I really don't understand the appeal of the game of pointing out the ways in which people who can casually violate the laws of our universe could indeed dominate it. Just seems rather vapid. Well, who am I to judge other people's fun?

*** To add to that, a lot of the fights are about personality, not bending. Aang can beat Zuko initially becuase Zuko is so uptight and obsessed with his vision of himself capturing the Avatar and regaining his honor that he can't focus on the task in front of him. Aang is clever and quick, and so he easily exploits that. But in the underground crystal cavern place Zuko can take Aang on because Zuko has just gone all-in by betraying his uncle and siding with his sister. He's utterly desperate and truly focused on success /at this moment/. He is not even thinking about his father. Azula is stronger than everyone because she is pretty darned rational and gets under everybody's skin. That's why she easily beats a pissed-off Zuko, but as Zuko becomes calmer and more collected and at peace with himself it becomes harder and harder for her to fight him. That's why Katara can beat Azula as well: Katara goes into mother bear mode, which Azula's mind games simply don't work on. But Aang never beats Azula because Aang never quite overcomes his personality flaw of being unwilling to use direct and overwhelming force.

The connection between bending and personality is a big part of what makes bending so interesting. We see this most clearly when Aang is learning earthbending. He has to overcome his natural inclinations and learn to stand strong and face things head-on. The other elements also have their associations with personality traits which come out in various places. If bending were instead merely about how some people can control some elements and that allows them to do all kinds of terrifying things, a lot of the emotional appeal of the show would be lost in place of smart but meaningless action scenes.

I think you're right, but I don't agree with the dilemma you're proposing. It's possible to create "bending flows from your personality" and "bending must be used intelligently and effectively" in the same story.

Wouldn't this fit /perfectly/ with worm-style munchkin-vs-munchkin fights?

** I think you can enhance the fire benders industrialization as shown in the show, and make that one source of their strength. This would allow a connection to lightning/electricity, as well. I'm unsure how you would prevent other nations from simply copying Fire, though. Maybe it could have pollution issues? Maybe there's a spiritual or quality of life element as well? Maybe the energy conversion is only sufficiently efficient if a firebender is present, due to different physics? Or, suppose that Fire benders live in an enormously dirty and crowded overpopulated area, because they're in a Malthusian trap, or something like that. Other nations would be reluctant to enter the Malthusian trap willingly, so they fight back without resorting to industrialization. Maybe industry is taboo. Maybe it's unknown, and a few leaders are the ones who made the decision.

Motive is another problem. Perhaps Fire nation destroyed their homeland in their early attempts at industry (maybe something like the scenario in The Last Ringbearer, where Mordor accidentally ruined its own agriculture?), which is why they're desperate to take over the land of others?

I think addressing the "Chosen One" vibe that Aang gets would be necessary for this fic. Relying on one person to stop a war? That's just stupid.

Lots of potential here. Good job OP.

** I'm two chapters into doodling a Rational!Avatar fan-fiction (or maybe more accurately, a Science!Avatar fanfiction) but the two chapters are not meant to be the /first/ two chapters, so I'm still trying to decide if I should wait till I have a coherent story woven together, or just put the individual chapters up as short stories. It may be a while because it's not the only thing I'm writing, and I've spent most of my time thinking of how to set up the world mechanics in a more rigorous way so that people can Do Science to it.

Anyway, suffice it to say that there are some fairly cool things you can do with firebending without introducing any new mechanics if you put your mind to it - and not just for military applications.

(I've actually been somewhat struggling to find equally awesome stuff for the other elements - though I'm ultimately not opposed to ending up with a power disparity, i would like to at least try to max-out the potentialities.)

**** Three Families was good. Wouldn't call it a rational fic, but the world building and plot was pretty excellent, and overall I'd say it's more rational than the show.
