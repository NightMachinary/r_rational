You know what would be awesome? If someone could write a brief list of the most interesting and creative ideas from Worm.

I have tried reading the story several times, but just couldn't get through it, it's way too negative for my taste. I want to read about clever exploitation of superpowers without sitting through pages of misery porn.

Just wanted to ask that in case something like this already exists, or if anybody could mention their favorite examples.


** From memory, so I can't promise these are all accurate:

Jack Slash has the power to extend cutting edges. He teams up with Hookwolf, who can transform into a swarm of metal blades.

Phir Se, who creates portals through time, temporally duplicates photons to make ridiculously massive explosions.

In order to contain one of those explosions, a cape called Dispatch draws Eidolon (whose powers, given time, become whatever powers he needs) into a bubble where time passes really fast. Eidolon uses that time to get an indestructible forcefield power.

Golem, who can make copies of his body parts out of nearby matter, creates a giant hand to serve as a lightning rod.

Oni Lee, who can teleport and make temporary copies of himself as he does so, carries grenades so that he can make suicide bomber clones.

In order to cut at the legs of a gigantic monster called Behemoth, they have a matter-warper named Annex create a gigantic chain which is then "charged" by Foil. Anything Foil charges can cut through anything. The chain is carried through Behemoth by a couple of giant mutant dogs created by a third cape.

Glaistig Uaine absorbs the powers of dead parahumans and creates shades of their original users. She uses a duplicator shade to create a huge number of her strongest attacking shade, Grey Boy.

Chevalier has the power to take similar objects and merge their traits. He uses it to combine a very very large gun-sword with a small and actually-usable gun-sword to get a truly fearsome weapon.

***** Fair enough, but it was the first I could think of off the top of my head. Anyway, I get the feeling that it's still munchkinry of a sort, as the "coolest", most obvious way to use that is to go around, slamming your palm into the ground and controlling the territory.

  I question the ability of flying bugs to mass their lift together like that.
#+end_quote

I am talking about their ability to support each other and to retain positive lift when their space is being encroached on by the bugs that are so dubiously adding their own lift. I am aware that simple numeric addition of the amounts of bugs Taylor uses would be enough to lift an additively larger weight, I am saying that physically doing so with a condensed mass of bugs is not feasible.

***** I quit around the fifth endbringer, i think. He's right that most superhero stories have invincible heros, but there needs to be a threat, even if the reader goes 'like you'd really do that'. Civilians are nice, but they don't matter enough to the reader.

now, if the resurection had a side effect- power loss, or degradation, for instance- it actually makes death more plausible, because now they've got a way to lose without the story dying. In that way, resurection can increase tension.
