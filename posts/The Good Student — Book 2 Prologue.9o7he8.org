Been waiting for this for quite awhile. I'm happy to see it updated.

** Can someone describe the Good Student and why I should get into it? What's the main character's thing?

*** The main character studies a lot, absorbs information and uses it to answer questions and solve problems.

In most stories I read I get a little impatient and want to skip ahead. Either because I'm tired of the details or because I just want to know what's going to happen with the main plot. I rarely had that desire with this story. I enjoyed reading it but did not want to skip ahead. The main character's perspective and thoughts were the interesting part.

*** The main character is very, very book smart. He knows how to study, and he knows how to view facts from a bunch of different perspectives to come up with exactly the right answer for his audience. However, he's also really, really, incredibly bad at understanding other people and ascribing human motivations to what they do. Almost comically so, but not in a way that is played out for humor. After reading the first book, I'm still not sure whether this was done on purpose for really subtle humor or if it he is just a shallow character. Usually that's an easy distinction to make, so I'm assuming it is done on purpose until more is written.

*** It's not good.

The first book takes 3 chapters for the story to even get started, and if the quality of those first chapters is anything to go by, the rest is definitely not worth your time.

** Can someone give a summary of what happened in book 1? It's been so long that I forgot what is going on.
