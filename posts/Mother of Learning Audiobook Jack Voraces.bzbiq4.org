Hi folks, Im Jack Voraces, a narrator on Audible. I did the Limitless Lands series which currently has nearly 1000 reviews (4.7 stars over all).

I wanted a project that I could do to give back to the community after their amazing support and love. I wanted to make a free audiobook that could be as long as possible and that people would enjoy. To this end I discussed the possibility of narrating Mother of Learning with the author, Nobody103.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning]]

​

We agreed and are now putting out the book as a free podcast on most major podcast apps and YouTube.

There are currently 3 chapters out but there are many more to come. Please enjoy and feel free to comment any feedback you like.

​

Looking forward to recording more for you all.

Virtually all names seem to be intended to be read as they're spelled with Croatian pronunciation in mind.

***** Take out any errors and unwanted sounds. Check that the recording is the same as the text and master the audio to make it sound awesome and add any effects. If several takes were done, picking the one that sounds the best for that character.

Audible advises that it takes about 6 hours per finished hour of audio to edit so its no simple task. A 10 hour audiobook could take 60 hours to edit + the time to record. (A professional editor can probably do this much much quicker.)

** Dude, this is really great! I was a bit skeptical about this, since I didn't really like the narration of HPMOR by Eneasz and most other free audiobooks that I came across (I still appreciate the effort people put in), but this is actually high quality stuff! I think your voice fits my image of how Zorian could sound pretty well. Thank you so much for doing this. I'm really looking forward to new chapters.

** wow your voice is great! I have over 4 months on audible listened and yours is one of my favorites. I'm Not a discerning listener and have only given up on a book due to the voice actor maybe 5 times.

If you want one persons opinion, you don't need to go so high in tone for females, your voice is great and deep, just go more natural.

Huge fan already, will check out your other work

** There appears to be an editing issue in chapter 1 at around 3 minutes and 38 seconds. The phrase "you don't really intend to go out looking like that" is repeated several times in the audio but is said only once in the text. I'm guessing that the narrator made some extra takes that should be removed. HTH.

Overall, excellent quality, I'm looking forward to more.

** Thanks for doing this Jack. I see a lot of people talk about this story but since I am strictly audio I have never gotten the chance to enjoy it.

Hopefully there are more people out there like me. $42 dollars isn't so much between a small group. Good luck. I hope this trend continues because I've heard there's really good content on RR.
