** Wanted to write something upbeat, so I did 8-). For a little background to some of the events referred to in The Gardener, see "Flicker and the Wolf" and "Briefing" under my Stories links.

I am starting work on revising Fall now, so updates will tend more to short stories and vignettes for a while.

*** Fun story, if shorter than I would like.

I really enjoy the Fall series, and I look forward to seeing you get back to it. In particular, I hope you're going to deal with that dangling Tabula Rasa plot thread soon...?

**** Next regular chapter of Maker's Ark. I need to be sure to get the interaction between Flicker and Jumping Spider right, because there are other long dangling threads and some subtext there.

*** Awesome! Once you are done any chance you'll do a reading for recording?

**** Thanks for your enthusiasm, I can always use motivation for the editing part 8-). Audio book recording is on my list of things I'd like to try someday. I may try an recording of a short story first to see how that turns out. We'll see.
