  It didn't matter so much that he beat Summer so long as an outcome without precedent lay at the end of the road.
#+end_quote

I'd like to point out that the very idea of an unprecedented outcome comes from the scheming of Black, so Arcadia is really just mirroring Creation, as usual.

***** It could be that Winter started the war so Summer had to start one as well. Or that Summer had started the war so Winter had to follow along. It certainly /implied/ Summer was at fault but these Fae are known to twist the truth entirely without a single word of lie.

Basically, it was a non answer hedged as a definitive one. You, and I at the time, can certainly read it one way while it means the other.

****** Interludes are a gamble. I'm not particularly interested in the First Prince or the Tyrant of Helike, so interludes focusing on them suck.

Stuff like the Calamities interludes we got, though, are great. Same with that glimpse into Thief's past.

I agree; if we get an Akua flashback rather than something more current, I shall be very sad.

** So the thing that sticks out to me the most is that Sulia won't tell Cat why the Prince of Nightfall must not get those crowns. Unless it's a magically significant thing that Maesgo will explain, I kinda think it's something Cat also has the power use since she is Winter and Named. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a problem with telling Cat, right?

**** Could be. I was just suspicious because she was really intense about telling Squire not to let it happen, but then wouldn't say why. So either the Princess is irrational and won't tell out of spite, or she's rational and doesn't want Cat to claim the power the Prince is after

***** so the king of winter is trying to shake up the story, but the prince of nightfall isn't as far as we know. Meaning that the 7 crowns and one are part of a story.

Given the high number, the most probable source of the crowns are princes of the principate, (She needs 8, the principate has dozens, and she's going to fight them anyway)

Sula doesn't want the prince to get whatever it is he's getting. The most obvious answer would be that it makes him vastly more powerful, tipping the balance between winter and summer.

#+end_quote

The seven: Helike, Bellerophon, Stygia, Nicae, Atalante, Delos and Penthes.\\
The one: The Hierarchy itself

The solution has ties off things neatly:

- It ties together the so-far entirely separate Free Cities subplot with Cat's own story
- It means only one fight actually needs to take place to secure her side of the bargain, which is narratively convenient.
- It gives an actual plot reason for establishing the Hierarchy. "Seven and One" is different from "Eight".
- It leaves Cat with her own crown and power base in Callow intact.
- It means that a Praesi victory in the Free Cities doesn't actually lead to increased safety or stability for Cat's side.

***** She also runs the risk of Cat liking the answer. For example, if the crowns kill the King, or end his cycle, then it may do the same to the Queen. If Sulia doesn't want her Queen dead, she might be agitated but she also doesn't want Cat redoubled in her purpose
