*** Yeah, my attention slipped around the middle too. I may give it another shot sometime later now that I see how many others enjoyed it, but it definitely strikes me as a story that would be better at half the length.

** The Minotaur idea reminds me a lot of David Foster Wallace's subplot idea in /Infinite Jest/ -- there the MacGuffin is known as The Entertainment, a video made with fancy filtering technique that somehow activates the pleasure terminals in a viewer's brain, making it so entertaining that it leads a person who merely glances once to become compelled to watch the film over and over until they ultimately die of dehydration/starvation, and are willing to literally murder other people or cut off their own limbs to get another viewing in unethical testing scenarios. The drama comes from a French-Canadian insurgent group seeking to find a master copy of The Entertainment in order to threaten a broadcast, to thus force the US government to meet their demands.

Great job +Tenobrus+ /edit:/ duckevenfree1.

*** Sorry to clarify, I didn't write this. This person did: [[https://twitter.com/duckevenfree1]]

Agreed on your comment, although I think the similarities with /Infinite Jest/ go beyond the Entertainment. A lot of the tone feels very close to some sections in /Infinite Jest/, and the "garbled speech" is a common theme in both.

** To be honest, I am not a fan of nosleep stories.

I understand that for some people it is exciting or interesting to read a story that /could/ be true, but for me this format is usually simply confusing.

I am not sure how to say this correctly, as English is not my first language, so I'll just try.

I feel some kind of mild 'resentment' when reading stories like that, because it feels as if I am being... decepted. Not sure if that is the right word.

Or maybe being insulted in some way. It is unclear to me, all I know is I don't like that format.

For example, the username in the reddit screenshot in that story is a real user who posts exclusively in nosleep.

I understand that the story can't actually be confused with reality, but that is not immediatly clear. It starts like any normal blog post.

Now if this was on [[/r/nosleep]] that would be fine, but having it on an independent page just makes it murkier. The realization that you are reading fiction hits only after you've read some paragraphs.

I understand that adding fake screenshots gives it an interesting spice of reality or plausability, but I can't get away from the feeling I tried to describe above.

*** I agree about nosleep and the genre of "it could be true!" creepy pasta. However, this piece specifically seems more like using the medium of a blogpost as the correct medium for this fiction story. Most of what makes the story so good is it's a "very-very-very-near future" sci-fi story, something set in a fictional world that's uncomfortably close to our own (but still clearly not), and the plot involves so many current-internet things and trends. In that sense having the medium of the fiction be a first person blog post is extremely fitting.

It feels very different from the usual usages of this format, i.e. "I found a scary thing in a cave", or "there's a creepy person in my house" which could really just be put into an anthology of creepy stories just as well as a subreddit, in that the fact that it's a first-person /blog post/ is actually a good medium choice.

** A story I read once somewhere, paraphrased by me:

#+begin_quote
  Scientists have just unveiled the first computer in a new, highly advanced generation. It's big and shiny and imposing. It's orders of magnitude beyond anything else in existence. So naturally, they throw it a party.

  After the festivities are all done and everything's winding down, the President (I don't know why he's in this story, this is just how I heard it told) decides he wants to test the computer out. So he goes up, turns it on, and asks it, "Is there a God?"

  The computer whirs for a moment, and a voice from it says, "/Now/ there is!"
#+end_quote

All that aside: /wow/. This reminds me of some grand combination of "The Library Unpublished" and Charles Stross's /Accelerando/.

That said, I don't think I should read any more of it. It's doing weird shit to my brain.
