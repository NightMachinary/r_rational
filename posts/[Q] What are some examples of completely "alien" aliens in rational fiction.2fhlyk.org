** One that I often see posted when people start talking about alien aliens are the Tines from Vernor Vinge's /A Fire Upon the Deep/. They're dog-like pack animals that use sound to form a coherent organism made of individual members - very inventive, and very cool. Also the Skoderiders, which are a plant-computer hybrid if memory serves.

Also, the obligatory plug for [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/][/Three Worlds Collide/]], where I believe half the point is to have aliens with values systems that are far removed from human.

The relevant trope is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][Starfish Aliens]], also see [[http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1kr9p1/genuinely_alien_aliens/][this thread]] from [[/r/print_sf]] (though most of those novels are just science fiction and not actually that rational).

*** IMO, half the point of Three Worlds Collide is how, compared to the vastness of conceptual space, very /small/ differences in values can still be incompatible, and that values are complex. Like, it's pointed out how similar children are psychologically, how we could have gone down the Superhappy path, how we share literature and art with the Babyeaters. It's more salient to think of something /nearly/ like us with infanticide as a terminal value, than it is to think of a paperclipper with no terminal value crossover whatsoever.

Of course they're still very alien, compared to other fictional aliens. It's just not the point to have them far removed from human.

***** Well, there IS some literotica out there with people who have sexual encounters with aliens that most people would find grotesque, and specifically in hentai, tentacle-blobs are a fairly common kink.

But yeah, the original "sexy aliens" trope was generally just about hyper sexual humans with green skin and blue hair.

Side note, is your flair a reference to The Laundry Files?

** Peter Watts' Tumblers in /Blindsight/. Interestingly different in many ways, including [[#s][spoiler]].

There's also an old-school classic story called (if memory serves) /The Dance of the Changer and the Three/, but I don't know that you could call it rational; the aliens' behaviour is deliberately never explained.

** Wang's carpets, from the story of the same name, by Greg Egan, which was then integrated into the novel /Diaspora/. Ted Chiang's "Story of Your Life" is also really fascinating. It is largely about a linguist in a first-contact situation and ends up at least partially a story about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

** I think Banks does a decent job of creating some distinct aliens in /The Algebraist/ (with references to other species that we can't even really communicate with). I actually am curious if the Dwellers' attitude towards their offspring was a partial inspiration for Yudkowsky's /Three Worlds Collide/.
