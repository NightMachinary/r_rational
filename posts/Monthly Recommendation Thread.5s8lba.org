** The /His Dark Materials/ trilogy is pretty spectacular. They really butchered the movie version of /The Golden Compass/ (the first book in the trilogy), that mediocre movie isn't representative at all of the awesomeness of the books.

*** The thing that's kept me from checking out this series is that I've heard it's Anvilicious in its message about religion. As a spiritualist, I really don't think I'd enjoy listening to an atheist explain to me why I'm wrong, again. Is it actually as bad as I'm presuming it to be based upon /incredibly/ limited information and my personal biases, or is this more like Narnia where you can still enjoy the story without agreeing with the author's belief system?

Much more like this. Both series move more toward their respective views as they approach the end. But honestly, I found /The Last Battle/ more anvilicious than /The Amber Spyglass./ I didn't get the feeling His Dark Materials was especially atheistic when I read it as a devout Catholic teenager; I just felt it was highly critical of religion as it was portrayed within the series. But considering the main religion of the series was like an extreme alternate universe version of Calvinism, I didn't feel my own faith attacked.

On the other hand, I felt annoyed by the end of Narnia because, ugh, he basically just plagiarized Revelation. And threw Susan under the bus. Still angry about it now, haha.

**** I think the Narnia books are pretty anvilicious, and I wholeheartedly disagree with the anvils being dropped in most of the books, but I still enjoy the stories. I read all seven books the summer after kindergarten when I'd just turned 6 and I read them many times over the course of my childhood, I'm not gonna unceremoniously drop them just because I lost my religion when I got older.

As a transhumanist/rationalist/science-aficionado, I don't particularly enjoy Michael Crichton's "technology is evil and scientific progress is equivalent to 'playing god' (which is supposed to be a bad thing, apparently)" anvils that pepper just about every single book he wrote, but I still enjoy reading the Jurassic Park books.

The /His Dark Materials/ trilogy is often described as "Narnia for atheists." It's not. It's simultaneously /much/ more heavy-handed about its message and much more subtle about it; that's contradictory but I don't know how to explain it. It /is/, however, a fantastic epic fantasy.

** I must strongly recommend Neil Cicierga's Mouth Trilogy (AKA what I've been looping for the past couple of weeks) to anyone who loves music. The first two albums, [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsilence/][Mouth Silence]] and [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsounds/][Mouth Sounds]], came out in 2014. (Mouth Sounds came out first, but it's been stated that Mouth Silence is intended as the first in listening order). The third and thus far final album, [[http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/][Mouth Moods]], came out just this year.

They are expertly-crafted mashup albums that create a wonderfully surreal feeling that only barely relies on familiarity with the original song, if at all - indeed, I loathe a good number of the songs used, but am still continually fascinated with what Cicierga manages to make of them. The use of others' intellectual property means that they cannot be sold, but the work Cicierga put into the albums is very real, and actually greater than what many professional musicians put into their work. Cicierga's mashups are always a different experience from any of their composite elements, and on occasion what he's created is essentially an original song that merely uses a sample as its instrument. ("300 MB", a track early in Mouth Moods that plays Moore's Law for cosmic horror, comes to mind.) I can only hope that Cicierga will continue this in the future; these three albums are enough, but if he continues to put the effort in that he's put in thus far, I don't think the potential is ever going to run out.

** I've been reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33962948-perilous-waif][Perilous Waif]], the first book in a new SF space opera series by the same author as the oft-mentioned Time Braid. So far it's much better than all his other stuff, I'm impressed. It's set like 500 years in the future where much of the galaxy has been colonized by humans, and where body augments and 3D printers and human-level AIs are common as dirt. The worldbuilding has been stellar(heh), he's setting up an interesting universe to explore.

As cool as all that high concept stuff is, my favourite part of worldbuilding so far is pretty simple, his abbreviation for kilometres (kloms) and centimetres (cems). This makes it different and futuristic enough to not offend touchy americans, but familiar enough to be instantly recognizable. Tbh it's kind of mind boggling that those words aren't abbreviated in common speech already. Perhaps a big factor people resist transitioning is how unwieldy the words are in metric.

Seriously though, those prefixes aren't there just to sound fancy, they have a precise technical meaning. Butchering them isn't a good idea. If you seriously need a shorter word for kilometre, just make up some slang like US army did. They use "klick" and it seems to work fine.

*** I enjoyed it. Still a power fantasy but I felt the powers were far better integrated into the plot than some of the author's other work - like his Daniel Black series. Also, the author seems to have captured a real sense of scale in this work. Things feel big, which is often a problem in SciFi. My go to example for this is Elizabeth Moon's Vatta's War series, which ends up feeling tiny despite the author's best efforts.

I particularly liked the bot battles and the use of fabbers.

Plus, a reasonable interpretation of recent episodes is that the inciting event for the whole show is an AI took its given utility function more literally than its creators intended and then started encouraging other AI to self-modify their utility functions in the pursuit of the "rogue" AI's preprogrammed goal, so there's that.

** I just re-read /Friendship is Optimal/ and /Caelem Est Conterrens/, My Little Pony fanfic that is really about friendly AI and the nature of consciousness (the latter story boasts the tagline, "As Horrified Eliezer Yudkowsky!"). It's an amazing universe and I got into it far too late (it's, like, 5 years old now which is eternity in Internet years). I'm considering reposting fics from the universe every couple of weeks to invite discussion on the ideas contained within.

I think someone wrote on here that while HPMOR invented the genre of rational fiction, the genre has developed to such an extent that HPMOR might not be considered /top-tier/ rational fiction.

(myself I'm probably scraping the bottom of the proverbial rational barrel as I'm writing vampire yaoi set in a rational universe. Mostly consists of people acting appropriately cautious, communicating effectively, and an interesting transformation mechanic that I'm not sure exists elsewhere)

I've also heard good things about Worm, Metropolitan Man, Unsong and certainly others.

Then again, you are talking so someone who got bored of HPMOR and stopped reading, so we're probably not going to like the same things; there's no accounting for personal taste.

The article I read on this subject that I found really convincing was stating that one of HPMOR's faults is that it tended to include lots of lessons (i.e. it tried to teach you science/rationality). The article argued - and I agree - that rational fiction should /be/ rational, rather than /teach/ rationality. Teaching rationality is obviously a worthy goal but it's not the most entertaining premise for a genre of fiction... Obviously HPMOR may have expanded beyond that, but the early chapters were full of lessons about science, tracts about death itself being the ultimate evil, and so on.

While it's a bit west-biased, it's really cool to see the main character using science and rational reasoning to get him out of troubles. There's a lot more to it but I can't recommend it enough.

** In an effort to try and find some other good series while [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods are Bastards]] and [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] update, I started working my way through some of the other [[http://topwebfiction.com/][Top Web Fiction]] suggestions. Thus, I've recently read Savage Divinity, The Zombie Knight, and am working on Super Powereds.

Problem is, I can't tell if they are rational or not. Well, I have other issues with them too, but specifically for this forum I can't tell. I still enjoyed them (some more than others), but I don't know if it's proper to recommend them. Just in case, though, I'll give a brief overview and my thoughts...

[[http://www.fictiongrill.com/savage-divinity/sd-chapter-1/][Savage Divinity]] is a reincarnation story of a man who finds himself in the body of a young slave boy in a fantasy world.

I wasn't a huge fan of it at first but the story grew on me. Unfortunately the most recent arc felt like a complete side story, which slowed down the main plot's action; and I got to the most recent updates just as the story got back to the main plot. The main non-rational aspect is that many things do seem to happen "for the plot," and a lot of the minor characters just seem unrealistically one-dimensional (assholes just for the sake of being assholes). The world building is fairly interesting, but it feels like a lot of reading is needed to get really invested.

[[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][The Zombie Knight]] is about a teenager who dies and is resurrected by a Reaper in order to save people who are close to death. Now an undead Servant, he works as a sort of superhero to protect people in a world that is similar-to-but-not-quite-Earth.

Basic description aside, this is a different twist on the trope in that the teenager has a lot of issues not commonly seen in the genre. Hector deals with crippling shyness, depression, racism, and extremely negligent parents. It's unique to have a protagonist going through such "common" problems, which I appreciate. The writing, especially between Hector and his Reaper, is often extremely witty; however the story suffers at the beginning from being dialogue-heavy and description-light. This changes over the years (the series began in 2013 and is still going, though it went on hiatus for a while) and smooths out a bit, but it takes time. There's also trouble where a lot of things do seem to be done "for the plot," and often the rules of the world are pretty bent. "You can only control one element" when it comes to powers... oh, except for those who can control multiples. "You can only use one type of ability"... oh, unless you go into "hyper mode" and get access to others. I think the largest suspension of disbelief is that there are hundreds or thousands of these Servants, but the story begins as if no one knows they exist. It seems fairly obvious the world revolves around their actions.

I've seen this recommended in other places before, and it's highly rated on the top web fiction site, but honestly I don't think it's that amazing. It is a quick read compared to some other series though, as each update is often only a single page at a time. And the technical manipulation of some abilities (especially ones based on control of elements) is pretty neat.

[[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/][Super Powereds]] is the one I'm currently working through and have really enjoyed. In this world there are people with superhuman abilities; those who can control them are called Supers and often rise as heroes, while those who cannot are called Powereds and looked down upon as social pariahs at best or walking catastrophes at worst. A group of five Powereds undergo a procedure that allows them to gain control over their abilities, and attempt to integrate in a hero certification college program for Supers.

I am currently on the second book (the third is current, four are planned) and am really enjoying it. Unlike the previous two series, this one feels the most rational. There is a big focus on solving problems through creative use of powers (or through tactics); the rules generally seem sane and consistent; and many of characters are driven by their own values... though there are a few notable exceptions to this.

Overall I think it's worth checking out; I am only about a third through the second book, but so far it's been really enjoyable.

*** Been awhile since I read them, (probably just about 10 years aka since I was that age), but I think the The Princess Tales books by Gail Carson Levine are great. They're short mostly humerus takes on classic fairy tales. I'd say they are probably a bit more deconstructionist as well though. Dragon Slippers was also one of my favorites at around that age, but I think it's meant for a slightly older audience.

*** Gaiman's Graveyard Book would probably fit into the upper end of the range suggested (more for a 9 or 10 year old). It's not like super rational or anything, but it's an amazing book anyways.

When I was a kid, my favourite kid's novels were various Gordon Korman stuff - the Bruno and Boots books, I Want To Go Home, and other kid's stuff. They are pretty funny and enjoyable, and I read my copies of them so much that the rather cheap paperback bindings on most of them fell apart from wear. These are, again, more for 9-10 age bracket. These are very typical children's fare and not especially rational in any way.

** If you enjoyed Harry Potter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][the Alexandra Quick series]] is an excellent fanfiction that is even more coherent and darker, while following an entire cast of original characters in an original US setting.

Among the strong points are the well written, age appropriate children, credible factions that are morally ambiguous, competent adults, mysteries that need solving like in the original books, some amazing plot twists that actually make sense in the light of the information provided earlier in the story and a flawed heroine that is actually more of an anti-hero.

Cons: there are 4 books available, but the series is not finished and may be on hiatus.

Still worth the read though.

  I went to see "Kimi No Na Wa." this week. It's really good, and incredibly beautiful. Alas, not particularly rational, so if you get easily stuck on a out of nowhere 'mechanics' change, well, that happens once around the middle of the movie. (though you can kinda post-rationalize it once you know what was actually going on).

  It wasn't that important though, and I got back into it very quickly. So, strongly recommended unless one plot hole can destroy your enjoyment instantly :P (in which case, can you ever enjoy a movie anyway?)

It's fairly straightforward young adult portal fantasy, but more Sci Fi than fantasy, with a reasonably interesting exploration of a society with ubiquitous neural interfacing.

Certainly not rationalist, but arguably rational. The protagonist is fairly intelligent, the setting is interesting and consistent, and nobody is holding the idiot ball.

A problem I have in general is that due to a high reading speed and reading being my main leisure activity, I read an absurd amount of fiction and frequently run out of stuff to read. As a result, I often find myself trawling the long tail of stuff on Amazon.
