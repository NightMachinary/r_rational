Pageviews are up; a quarantine, it seems, is a good time to sit down with a book.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/03/22/chapter-13-3/]]

Pyrebound is a story about dire circumstances bringing out the worst in people. Deep worldbuilding with a Mesopotamian flavor. [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][Click here]] if you want to start from the beginning. Thanks, as always!


** Man, I feel like you've really done a great job at capturing a civilization in your words. Brutal, unforgiving, rational and irrational in twisted ways.

Reminds me that we live at human civilization's most graceful, most enlightened peak, that it was 100x worse for most of history. I had hoped there was a light at the end of the tunnel, but now I sort of expect Ram to die a tragic, meaningless death raging against the world he was born into.

*** I don't think any civilization remained quite as terrible as this one long-term. As for the ending, not much I can say beyond "keep reading," and I imagine you'll like next week's too. Thank you.

** I find it hilarious that Ram has accidentally triggered a growing civilization wide civil war between two different classes of autocrats.
