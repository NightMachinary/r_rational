** He writes as if the cold equations themselves, and the series of events that lead to a situation that cold equations are needed are the same thing. Since the series of events that lead to the situation is bad, he says cold equations are bad too. That's an unfair attack on cold equations.

#+begin_quote
  ‘‘The Cold Equations'' is moral hazard in action. It is a story designed to excuse the ship's operators...
#+end_quote

Nonsense. Cold equations just tell you what to do when the mistakes have been made in order to avoid further mistakes. Ship's operators should still be punished for negligence.

Secondly, it's not only mistakes that lead to situations where cold equations are needed. What can an insurance company do other than using cold equations? Steal money from mafia bosses so they can pay for everyone? No, sometimes we have to use cold equations even when we've done everything right.

*** He's speaking as an author. Everything within a story happens at an author's discretion, and so he's attacking authors who seem to get off on writing situations which force "good" characters to do terrible things. See Ender's Game, which is entirely [[http://www4.ncsu.edu/%7Etenshi/Killer_000.htm][a set-up to make sure Ender can commit genocide and still be innocent of doing so]]. Cory argues this creates in the readership an attitude more likely to excuse such actions in the real world. (The "moral hazard" part of the article) I think the effects of Atlas Shrugged show that he's got a heck of a point. (For a great portrayal of "necessary" mass murder that doesn't leave you rooting for the mass-murderer, [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/the-narrative-is-the-argument/][I recommend Chasm City]] )

**** Hm. I read that Ender's Game essay... and while I agree with it in the context of this discussion (railroading characters with good intentions through contrived set-ups into doing bad things does not a good story make), the conclusion seems as much of a set up as the book itself. Sure, Ender and the officers might not be as rational in their judgments as OSC would like to present, but if they believe they are, and they are honestly pursuing the greater good to the best of their ability, the end result, whatever it is, doesn't make them immoral. Though it doesn't mean they aren't dangerously insane, either.

OSC might have failed to paint a sufficiently believable universe, but the questions it raises are very interesting to ponder, so I don't share the article author's apparent dislike for Ender's Game, even if I don't think it's as much of a masterpiece as [[/r/books]] seem to believe. I don't regret having read the book. Though I do see how some impressionable teenagers might get entirely the wrong things out of it...

**** If Ender was a real character, who unknowingly committed genocide, yes I would think he's innocent (whether he should be punished for that or not is a different question). If reading Ender's Game creates in the readership an attitude more likely to excuse a person who unknowingly committed genocide, I see nothing wrong with that. If readers are stupid and come to think that this means genocide is okay, or people who commit genocide shouldn't be punished, that's their fault, not the writer's fault, or a fault of cold equations. From the linked article:

#+begin_quote
  But Ender's Game clearly conveys a “crush anything that threatens you” mindset.
#+end_quote

I never got that impression. The whole thing was a mistake. There never was a necessity for genocide. The aliens were never going to attack us. They thought there was a cold equation to deal with when there was none. Just think about the money this ridiculous enterprise had cost them. In the movie they say 50 billion dollars. So they spent 50 billion dollars for nothing. It's a total waste. At the top of it they mass murdered a sentient race. How exactly did that story managed to convey the idea that you should crush anything that threatens you?

What's wrong with Atlas Shrugged is that it is just bad philosophy and even worse writing.

***** The point is that the situation as constructed in the book is incredibly contrived and unlikely in precisely such a way as to make Ender's actions both sympathetic and excusable.

To take a more relatable example, portraying scenarios in which applying cold logic dictates that you should torture someone in order to stop a ticking bomb a la 24 is dangerous. The events of this show are salient and come quickly to mind when we think about the use of torture, but they're also describing a situation that's incredibly rare. It repeatedly sets up incredibly unlikely situations to make the inexcusable excusable. I believe that this has materially affected the torture debate in America.

The "crush anything that threatens you" is totally a theme of Ender's Game. He kills every person he fights, and though he is never the aggressor, the explicit reasoning he gives for the ferocity of his violence is that he must be certain that the enemy not be able to retaliate.

***** It wasn't necessary for Ender the murder his bullies either. The bully incidents were just the alien incidents writ small. The point was that the bullies/aliens COULD hurt humans. Murder/Genocide isn't necessary or even very good ways to solve that. However they do guarantee that that particular threat will never be a threat again. And when the opportunity presented itself, those making the decisions decided that permanently neutralizing that threat took priority over any other concern.

How are you dealing with the effects of their blatant negligence vis the trolley that is even now bearing down on several innocent people?"

Second: "What steps are you currently taking to ensure safety and survival for all other humans? They must be pretty stupendous to give you no opportunity to experience a situation with suboptimal safety measures."

Third: "Safety measures sufficient to prevent this situation have been proposed and analyzed. They proved too expensive to justify their cost. We put our limited funds into more efficient life-saving measures. This analysis is unchanged considering the current situation."

The final one would be to construct a thought experiment that can't be countered by better safety features -- maybe a freak landslide in an area that had never experienced them before, where you can block one path to divert the flow from a house occupied by several people to a house occupied by only one.

Yes, being a spiteful asshole to a philosopher who's /trying/ to conduct a thought experiment is jerkish. The problem is, real people's answers in these thought experiments are often inconsistent /not only/ because of personal irrationality but because the bisected options of the dilemmas often represent /mere fractions/ of a real person's moral system. All kinds of matters of context can play into whether a given real person's "should function" says to act utilitarian, or deontological, or virtuous, or Kantian, or even (yes) sociopathically selfish in a particular situation.

Framing effects and priming can bias us one way or the other, of course, but the issue remains that none of these "fractional" ethical codes can form a consistent /and/ complete moral system without at least partially encoding the others. The thought experiment is cleaving at the wrong joint, IMO.

********* Ok, let's unpack.

I believe the Marxian analysis of the behavior of capitalism is basically (if sometimes only /partially/) correct, based on the evidence I can see.

Because of this, when objectivists pass from basic humanism ("people are ends-in-themselves and can exercise rational thought if they work hard at it") to forming a deontological code of socioeconomic ethics ("private property is absolute, altruism is evil"), on one level I reject their ideology on value-diversity grounds ("objectivist deontology fails to capture all my values in its ruleset"), and on another I reject it on consequentialist grounds ("actual, factual capitalism has nasty consequences"). The latter is informed by my socialist beliefs, and the former by my reading of the Objectivist ideology.

********** Well, it sounds like we agree on a lot. Marx' analysis of the behavior of markets is fairly sound, but in my opinion misses the confounder that is the state operating on the behalf of established market entities against upcoming market entities. This state action would tend to concentrate market power in the hands of first movers, because they aren't subjected to the competition of the new entrants to the market. This power disparity causes many of the ills of capitalism as practiced today.

Property is also problematic, as different people grant title in different ways. I tend toward a Lockeian/Rothbardian method whereby those who first claim and use a property are its rightful owners, but that is backed up with the expectation that the property will be used. If a property is left abandoned it will revert to an unowned state, allowing new owners to claim it in the same manner as it should have been originally claimed.

A quick example. Suppose a factory closes down, but the facility is not sold. After some years, squatters move in and begin using the equipment and space for their own purposes. After a few more years, the original factory owner appears and demands the removal of the squatters. I would side with the squatters, as the property had been abandoned, and the squatters have laid claim to it through work and improvement

I disagree with the Objectivist "altruism is evil" stance, but would say that few, if any people act in a purely altruistic manner. If I give to the poor it is because I want the satisfaction of helping others, and doing so gives me that satisfaction. I think the altruism that actually is evil is not the giving of charity to others, but the taking of resources from one and giving to another under the guise of altruism. Government welfare, for example, is the taking of money mostly from middle class people, and giving it to poor people. Rich people are mostly unaffected by government action because they have already purchased the politicians, or can hire the correct lawyers and accountants to get around the rules.

"Without their consent?" I'm pretty sure that by continuing to live in and benefit from infrastructure and citizenship in a country that explicitly states its tax laws, the consent is there. I've never understood the perspective that rejects the social contract: would they prefer a government agent knock on their door at the age of 18 and ask them to sign an agreement to pay taxes or forfeit citizenship? Because claiming that people don't consent to pay taxes is pretty silly when they're more than happy to reap all the benefits those taxes go to pay for, but just object to a few that they can't immediately recognize as benefiting them (less people starving on the streets = less crime and disease = less overworked hospitals and police, etc).

Roads highly traveled are maintained, roads that aren't fall to decay, and now isolated towns and locations become even harder to travel to and get resources to or from.

  I'm sorry, but there's really no evidence for your beliefs here. It's as ideologically blind as communists who think that everything would just be honkey-dory if a centralized organization controlled EVERYTHING.

Evidence, huh?

Infrastructure:

Roads: [[http://northernnewenglandvillages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NH-Road-Marker-First-New-Hampshire-Turnpike.jpg][The First New Hampshire Turnpike]] built by private corporations. Now part of NH route 4

Dams: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Canyon_Dam][Hells Canyon Dam]] the worlds largest privately built dam.

Charity:

There are innumerable private charitable organizations, I'll not list them here.

Police: [[https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=private+security+companies&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][Google search results]] for private security companies. Looks like quite a few to chose from.

So these things can be provided competitively/privately.

  Consigning the poor to living in ghettos of unprotected anarchy? You might joke it's already like that, but I hope you're smart enough to recognize what a massive oversimplification that is.
#+end_quote

Actually, if I want real security for my property, the best thing I can do is remove poverty. Crime is an effect of poverty. So any organization competing for my money to prevent crime is going to have to address poverty as part of its plan. This may mean either making significant monetary contributions to alleviate poverty, or providing low cost patrols in impoverished areas.

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention making security and protection about who has the most resources, rather than even the pretense of justice. Sorry, not values I share.
#+end_quote

Not values I share either. Yet another thing a justice provider is going to have to do to get my business is prove that they aren't favoring the wealthy over the poor. This means third party audits and a focus on a reputation for justice.

  It's rather convenient for you to say this in a world where roads already connect every house and store on a continent to one-another, but let's say you just mean money to maintain the roads you use: over time, what happens when everyone does this? Roads highly traveled are maintained, roads that aren't fall to decay, and now isolated towns and locations become even harder to travel to and get resources to or from. And that's just the beginning: do some research on what a privatized highway system would actually look like to understand just how massively unwieldy the idea is in practice.

  Good for you. Most people won't. Most people don't. You think they suddenly will if the government steps out of it?

#+end_quote

On average [[http://philanthropy.com/article/Interactive-How-America-Gives/133709/][Americans give about 5% /$135.8 billion/]] of their household income to charity, after paying an [[http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456][average of 17% /federal, 2009/]] in taxes.

Other countries do things differently, and I don't know them as well as I know how the United States government does things, but that doesn't change the nature of government.

The question wasn't whether a private interest can supply them: it as whether they can be provided on a competitive basis. If you don't like one private interest's road, the tolls they set or the level of quality they keep, it's not exactly a low barrier of entry to make your own road.

And that privately constructed dam doesn't exist in a purely free-market environment: it follows regulations, it complies with government standards. The environmental impacts of the dam weren't even understood when it was built: put all such constructions in the hands of competing private interests and the resulting cascade of effects is even harder to account for.

Once again, congratulations in realizing this: the vast majority of people take the "screw you, I got mine" approach and simply buy big walls and lots of guards. If that were the predominant form of security enforcement, we'd basically be reverting back to the age of fiefdoms and castles.

Ah shit, I was hoping you were just a form of libertarian. Nothing personal, but I've long since tired of arguing such matters with anarchists: there's a chance you're more logical and evidence-based in your ideology than they all were, but a very small one, and it's just not worth the time investment for me to find out : /

As shown in your posts so far, the results seem predictably the same as past experiences: you're satisfied with your ideology because you presume everyone is a virtuous, educated rational actor. They're not. So as noted, it's kind of like talking to a communist about how their theories don't quite work in the real world.

I'll give you a chance to change my mind though, as is only fair. How does your hypothetical system deal with environmental protection?

From what I've seen, this is an area libertarians consistently fail to address, and is one of the major things that eventually made me stop considering myself one.

The basic idea I have of how libertarians/anarchists deal with pollution is that, with strong private property laws, individuals or companies that damage the environment will respond to litigation, so this litigation should in theory make up for the damages the companies do and deter future incidents.

Unfortunately, ecology is such a fantastically complex system that proving simple cause-and-effect responsibility from a private interest to an environmental issue is often impossible in a realistic time-frame to halt or address the behavior. And that's assuming enough funding could be provided to even investigate the cause-and-effect of a particular natural disaster or damage of pollution, especially if those affected are too poor.

What's worse, no change in limits on retaliatory litigation could make up for permanent damages to health or ecology. In many cases, private interests simply don't have nearly enough money to make up for all the damage their actions might do, even assuming the problem can even be fixed by money, and that they're made to pay for it in the first place.

As an example, if I start a company whose actions begin poisoning a river or lake (on my property) that feeds an aquifer three towns over, but the effects of it aren't realized or traced back for decades after I've already made my money and liquidated the company, even if my middle-men get dragged to court and our army of lawyers fails to prevent a guilty verdict, all the millions we lose will not undo the damage to the children born with leukemia as a result of those chemicals.

#+begin_quote
  I've already address roads above, but I'll ask you this, if nobody is going to these "isolated towns and locations" then why would roads be needed to go there?
#+end_quote

"Few people" =/= "nobody." The value society gets from making sure the barrier of travel is as low as possible far exceeds the incredibly minor portion of its taxes that go to roads.

#+end_quote

In your magical scenario where people are suddenly free from the shackles of taxes, but aren't now having to pick up the slack of what those taxes used to pay for for their personal security, roads, fire stations, mail services, medical services, education, etc, etc, sure :) Too bad that's not how reality works.

Careful, your bias is showing. "Able to enact violence on others" implies no accountability or oversight or consequences. Your perspective of government is pretty skewed indeed if you're basing it entirely on all the worst case scenarios and practices, and ignoring all the cases in which centralized authority deters and prevents harm. There are a number of studies and books on this: may I recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115][The Better Angels of Our Nature?]]

1. The barrier to entry is far higher with an existing state, including not only the costs that would be required in a free market, but regulatory compliance, property taxes, and a business model that can compete with a perceived 'free' good.

2. No, it's not a fully free market, such a thing currently does not exist. That does not indicate such a thing is not possible.

3. Audits are funded by either business associations (BBB), or concerned third parties.

4. Pollution is dealt with though the mentioned liability, decreased firm size due to dis-economies of scale no longer being subsidized by the state, and private conservation groups such as the Sierra Club.

5. Police, fire, etc, are generally local maters, handled by local taxes. I only covered the federal portion, which pays for most entitlement programs and all warfare.

6. I'll examine the book when time presents itself.

7. Moral positions tend to be difficult to argue, and get simplified in discussions such as this. It can make it look black and white.

You're still ignoring that there is literally a limited amount of roads that can be constructed, even ignoring what a huge waste of real estate it would take to construct even TWO separate, parallel roads everywhere. It is the perfect example of a system that benefits from centralization, and that you cannot realize or admit this goes back to what I meant about ideology getting in the way of reason.

#+begin_quote

Whether it's possible or not isn't even the question: it's whether it's a net benefit to society to sacrifice some personal freedoms for optimization of health, safety and public freedoms.

And how our values are ranked are no doubt different, but if you believe that absolutely no diminishing of personal freedoms are acceptable, no matter the harm that results or tradeoff of benefits to other values, then see "absolutist ideology."

#+end_quote

What power do you imagine private conservation groups have over a company polluting on their own private land, exactly?

All of which, as I mentioned, fails to show an understanding of ecology and pollution, let alone address how they would be dealt with.

Seriously, look into criticisms of libertarian/anarchy responses to environmental issues: aside from things like the aforementioned road system, it's one of the biggest glaring weaknesses of the worldview, and if a thorough understanding of the issue doesn't shake you from your ideology, nothing will. I've met a handful of libertarians honest enough to admit this weakness, who lump environmental regulation in with military as one of the few acceptable things for centralized authority, and I have far more respect for them than I do most that have simple faith that "free market solves all."

"Generally" being the massive oversimplification there: without organizations like the FEMA or FBI to help deal with issues that localized groups can't, you'll see the return of things like massively organized crime syndicates. What libertarians so often forget is that these organizations didn't form out of a naked power grab for more central authority: they were formed to adapt to the shortcomings of too much localized authority.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/20/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]["I couldn't /act/ on moral considerations if they lacked the power to move me!"]] Do you mean that you derive some nonmoral satisfaction from helping others which you are affected by more greatly than by the separate "purer" value of helping others?

#+begin_quote
  I think the altruism that actually is evil is not the giving of charity to others, but the taking of resources from one and giving to another under the guise of altruism. Government welfare, for example, is the taking of money mostly from middle class people, and giving it to poor people. Rich people are mostly unaffected by government action because they have already purchased the politicians, or can hire the correct lawyers and accountants to get around the rules.

In which case, since Objectivists are dissolving the distinction between morality and self-interest, they're making a non-statement by saying altruism is "wrong", because altruism is /definitionally impossible/ -- you /can't/ act without being moved by some concern of yours.

Mind, I'm sure the Objectivists would object (once again, no pun intended) that my tax-man's gun pointed at their head is a problematic concern for them to act on, but since they've already dissolved morality into self-interest I see no reason I shouldn't proceed to dissolve fear of superior military force into the same self-interest.

Or in other words, I question the coherency of a philosophy that collapses distinctions except when it doesn't. It appears rationalized to lead to certain policy conclusions.
