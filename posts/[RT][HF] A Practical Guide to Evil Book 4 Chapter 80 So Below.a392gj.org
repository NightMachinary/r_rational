** The moment Akua reappeared I realized something. The Akua/Catherine arrangement is similar to the Andronike/Komena situation. Bitter enemies versus close sisters, sure, but the rest of it parallels pretty closely. You have an older, more experienced mage being bound to a younger warrior and cast more-or-less into the dark in an advisory role. You have ascension with a poorly controlled mantle to a tenuous position of quasi-godhood. You have the constant sacrifice of their people to accomplish a highly unlikely goal. They both tried to usurp Winter.

They were both driven by the meddling of the Intercessor into things their former selves would have loathed.

That last one, I think, will be what brings them together. They both have grievance with the third side of the game of creation, the Meddling God. Where Above and Below are bound by stories, the Bard chooses their course and makes them. Whatever she is, it doesn't appear to be driven by any of the great powers we currently know.

And it's possible the Bard will cheer on this opposition. One of the few things we know about her for certain is that she wants to die. She makes absurdly powerful enemies of both sides, and it may be in the hopes that one of them can destroy her. Maybe Sve Noc and the Queen of Moonless Nights working together are meant to be another force for the Bard to fail against.

** Making people eat their finger isn't normal, but on Below it is. Below, not even once.

I wonder how much of these snippets of regretful memories are underlining how the alienation went (first from her Name then from Winter), and how much are hinting at something else. A new Name, closer to the fence than a Black Knight's Squire? Ascension like the Intercessor, not bound by either side? Back to nameless mortal, but armed with the knowledge that sanity and full ownership of one's own thoughts are weapons too? Red herring and I should go back to sleep?

** I'm not sure I like the "trial" setup the chapter ended on.

What is Sve Noc even trying to prove here? A name from Below comes with evil baggage, that shouldn't be news to anyone. Is she trying to argue Cat is 'special'? Are we going to have a turning point when Akua shows Sve that Cat wasn't all Evil when she set up that pre-war agreement with the Grey Pilgrim? Cat wasn't going to use Devils or Demons in the first place, because she has longer term goals that don't involve nuking Harrow; she basically conned her way into a free 'No Angels' rule for the Battle of the Camps.

What does Cat stand to gain by 'winning' this trial? The Drow don't want to settle the surface, the Drow ostensibly don't want to fight foreign wars, and Cat doesn't want Winter back. Does she help Sve Noc manage winter? Get some partial cooperation agreement? Betray the Dwarves? Migrate the Drow into Arcadia? Let's not forget, *the deal Cat hashed out with the Dwarves required Sve Noc's death*. Callow is still broke. The Drow can't pay. The Drow seem as poor as a sack of shit, assuming they'd even part with whatever possessions they have left after slaughtering each other for so long.

If an agreement, ANY agreement, can be reached, then what could the purpose even be beyond saving the Drow population? The Drow don't even know Callow exists, the Crusade is irrelevant. Will Sve and Cat team up to fight the ULTIMATE EVIL that is the Wandering Bard? Who doesn't even have anything to do with the /current/ situation and whose location / plans are unknown? Are Cat and Sve going to go on a little tromp around Calernia to bitch slap the Bard and set up the Liesse Accords because 'Oh my gawd that's such a good idea! Cat, I get it now! We don't /have/ to be Evil after all! We can totally pull one over on our omniscient, all-powerful, and unknown overlords! Let's ask the crazy Tyrant in Helike for advice!' Or maybe the Bard will show up randomly and make herself relevant, just because.

Side note: If Cat is still sticking with the name 'Liesse Accords' while speaking with Sve Noc, who has overseen an entire civilization made up of events unfathomably worse, then I declare she has gone full idiot protagonist. Completely full of herself. Same as the heroes. The only way I can imagine that going is 'Neat, can we use that against the Dwarves?' when Cat goes to explain the atrocity that inspired the name.

*tl;dr* Fuck me for writing this. I need to have faith Erraticerrata will do this right, but these past few chapters have been a left turn away from a train wreck and do not (as they currently stand) qualify as rational fiction. Cat's acting erratically, Sve is acting irrationally, and Akua is YOLOing it as a Hero when she could have just bolted.

**** Your proposed solution of 'Change Sve Noc's name to trick the Dwarves into paying out' does not address the fundamental conflict of genocidal conquest between the Drow and the Dwarves. Or the fact that promises to Cat as Fae have not been demonstrably useful without the other party being injected with Winter.

And the last two chapters have been Cat half-assedly throwing out arguments to try and ally with Sve Noc, not Cat trying to usurp the Night and become immortal again.

You can like the story and still admit that it's not telegraphing itself in an intelligent direction.

****** I'd assume the violent society of Drow inhabiting the Everdark would object to their eviction. On moral grounds, if nothing else. 'The strong take' tends to imply 'Prove it'. And the Drow don't even have a ruling body in place to facilitate an evacuation. Presumably, the Drow don't even have communication systems in place outside of Sve Noc's omniscience.
