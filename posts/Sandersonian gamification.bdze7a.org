I love the idea of creating emergent (video) gameplay based in strong rationalist foundations, especially something with the richness and variety of Sanderson's works. But seeing as his books are ongoing and his wikis are filled with a lot of amateur guesswork, we can only look at facets of his in-world systems.

Does anyone know of any rational work whose systems are available and documented down to the complete rules/pseudocode level?

  Time travel in Braid

  ...

  I've written numerous times about time, time travel and time travel in specific works of fiction. One thing I keep coming back around to is the fact that there are models for time travel; in fact, very broad classes of models, which individual time travel stories select among, and then refine for their own specific storytelling purposes. Another topic I've revisited several times, inescapable to any time travel nerd, is that many time travel stories have rough edges or deliberate errors in their models. There will be moments in the story where the strict rules, if there were any, are deliberately disobeyed because they are inconvenient, and because the story needs to go in a different direction from what was previously established to be possible.

  This happens because in fiction you can put together whatever sequence of words you like, and nothing can stop you. Your need for one word to follow the other is more important than the need of your universe to be internally consistent. In practical terms, there is nothing which can stop you from making a film whose main conflict is resolved when, say, objects suddenly start to fall up instead of down.

  Contrarily, inside a computer game, there are rules. A computer game, like any computer program, can only behave in the way in which it has been programmed to behave. (Give or take hardware faults and solar flares, obviously.) And if you have written your computer program to instantiate and execute a virtual environment, and to allow a player character to navigate that environment, then what you have built is a universe with a model; a model which is inviolate. This is a great way to immediately avert all possibility of inconsistency.

** I've yet to read anything that's definitive enough that it could be described at a pseudocode level, much less where the hard work of pseudo coding something has actually been done.

That's a really cool idea but I think you are looking for something that would only exist if someone abandoned a project and opensourced it.

**** It's a really cool idea but I've yet to see a magic system that's implementable this way. Your probably better off trying to find a way a game of Life variant or other Turing complete system to implement on top of a game system: which pretty much means making it up yourself.

****** I was talking about conway's game of life which is a 2d ruleset often implemented on computers. Turing completeness when demonstrated on something odd usually comes out of showing that a set of instructions can be implemented and executed and that there is no length limit on the instructions. For conways game of life this can be achieved with this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94][universal machine]] or as always [[https://xkcd.com/505/][there is a XKCD for that]]

You can implement a computer/turing machine inside the game.

For an example in a card game there's [[https://www.toothycat.net/%7Ehologram/Turing/HowItWorks.html][Magic the Gathering]]:

One may set up circumstances such that if the rules are followed, a computation will be carried out, and gameplay (involving player choices) may resume after the computation is complete. (They didn't end up making this work without additional constraints like "if a card says you may do something then do it".)

How is this Turing complete? I imagine this wouldn't have been possible if there wasn't a way to produce arbitrarily large armies. (For the turing machine's infinite tape.)

** Scribblenaughts and similar games exist, as do VR headsets; I feel like it's only a matter of time before someone makes a game based on The Rithmatist.

The ultimate target, of course, would be AR headsets: imagine drawing spells in chalk on the pavement and having those come to life. But we're in very early days as far as AR goes, and the experience would be poor with the hardware we have right now.

*** ah, AR malware. did you see this design on the packaging? that triggered the adware we installed in the root of your system at the factory!

oh, and at some point the lobyists will mandate that legally you MUST use these AR glasses. you know, for 'safety' reasons.

if we can get past the inevitable coperate cyberpunk dystopia that some people will try to force on us, AR could turn out pretty cool.
