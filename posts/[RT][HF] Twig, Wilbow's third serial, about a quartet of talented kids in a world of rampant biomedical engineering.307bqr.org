#+begin_quote
  The year is 1921, and a little over a century has passed since a great mind unraveled the underpinnings of life itself. Every week, it seems, the papers announce great advances, solving the riddle of immortality, successfully reviving the dead, the cloning of living beings, or blending of two animals into one. For those on the ground, every week brings new mutterings of work taken by ‘stitched' men of patchwork flesh that do not need to sleep, or more fearful glances as they have to step off the sidewalks to make room for great laboratory-grown beasts. Often felt but rarely voiced is the notion that events are already spiraling out of the control of the academies that teach these things.

  It is only this generation, they say, that the youth and children are able to take the mad changes in stride, accepting it all as a part of day to day life. Of those children, a small group of strange youths from the Lambsbridge Orphanage stand out, taking a more direct hand in events.
#+end_quote

There's six chapters up in the very first arc, and I'd say Wildbow's at the top of his game again. If you stopped reading his work in /Pact/, now's a great time to start again. Twig has some massive differences from both /Worm/ and /Pact/, since it begins with a complete party of main characters from scene one, and the protagonist absolutely sucks at fighting.

If you read the primer chapters Wildbow wrote after /Worm/, you'll recognize the setting as the one from /Boil/, however the characters and story have nothing in common. It has a little in common with /The Mysterious Benedict Society/ so far, but with more evil. Much more.

Oh my goodness, get fucking hype. As a Wildbow fan who dropped off during /Pact/, thank you so much for reminding me this is a thing that exists. A perfect size for the /MoR/-shaped hole in my heart.

I stand behind that statement fully. I stopped reading somewhere along the way during Pact, but Twig, so far, seems to be just great. It's not /amazing/ yet, but it's off to a really great start.

Do people generally think Pact was less good than Worm? Has Wildbow said anything to that effect?

I'd agree, but I'd be curious to see if people discussed it anywhere.

*** Wildbow's writing it, so the answer is "sort of". The world is rather dark, but the characters don't angst or dwell on it too much, and there's been quite a bit pf character driven humor so far.

** I've really enjoyed how much of an unlikeable cynic the protagonist is. In 1.3 he thinks some things to himself that make the setting seem like Crapsack World, but I felt this sense of optimism, that he was wrong about how shitty everything is.

The plotting and manipulation has been very fun to read, too.

*** Do we know that this /isn't/ the same setting as Boil? I'm rereading the samples now, and it seems like it could be a different focus in the same world. What with the rampant biomedical engineering based on "Shelley's codex," and the artificial life being called "voltaic." I'm pretty sure Twig used the same term, and the voltaic horses were "sewn together like patchwork." There's also a colloquial reference to "stitch" servants.

Boil could be later, or on a different continent, but I'm strongly suspecting it's at least kind of the same setting.

**** That was a positive "god damn".

I feel like the difference between Boil and Twig will be similar to the difference between early incarnations of Worm and what it ended up being. Worldbuilding, ideas and themes, maybe characters, but not an actual shared canon.

** My thoughts as I read 1.1:

#+begin_quote
  How does it go? The first lesson, something even the uninitiated know. For life to flourish on the most basic level, it requires four elements. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.
#+end_quote

And phosphorus. I cannot think of even a single life form that doesn't use phosphorus. ATP. Phospholipid bilayer membranes. Phosphate groups in DNA/RNA backbones. The stuff is in fucking everything.

But okay. Go on.

#+begin_quote
  Kitties,” Lillian whispered, horror overtaking fear in her expression.
#+end_quote

/giggle/ Yeah okay, I know it isn't supposed to be funny, but it just reminded me about Tom Riddle and his jar of kitten hearts.

#+begin_quote
  As if to follow the thought, Lillian's foot skidded on the bottom of the trough, and she tipped forward, straight into Helen's arms. The creature stopped its slow consumption of the cat's litter.
#+end_quote

Lillian is going to be the Panacea of this story, isn't she?

#+begin_quote
  “You go second,” Lillian whispered to me. “I know you well enough to know that If you go before me you'll look up my skirt.”
#+end_quote

What? How does /that/ work? He'd have to go /after/ her to do that.

#+begin_quote
  She accepted Gordon's support in getting down to the downspout, and began her slow descent.
#+end_quote

Oh, they're going /down/, okay that makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  It all had an odor. There were smells that became second nature, and there were smells that were ingrained in the psyche as bad smells. Ones that spoke of death, of long sickness, and of violence. Rendered fat, decay, and blood. Each were heavy on the air.
#+end_quote

Bonesaw's lab?

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't the first time I had told myself any of those things. I'd heard it from Gordon. It didn't make it any less annoying.
#+end_quote

Getting a pre-Bonesaw!Brian vibe from Gordon.

#+begin_quote
  I let go, and enjoyed both the moment of utter terror and Lillian's gasp of horror, before my fingers caught hold of the window frame below.
#+end_quote

And an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0][abridged!Kirito]] vibe from Sy.

#+begin_quote
  I was nodding before the word came out of his mouth. “You.”

  “You're clever,” I praised him.

  “Why?”

  I made the universal gesture for money, rubbing thumb against two fingers.
#+end_quote

Abridged!Kirito is a sociopath, in case you were wondering.

#+begin_quote
  “If you don't follow through, you won't get a deal like this again,” I said. “Think hard before you try cheating me. A big part of what we do is find people.
#+end_quote

Heh. Sy recruits for the mafia.

#+begin_quote
  Helen spoke for the first time in a while. Her voice was cute. “The Academy sends its regards, Mr. Snake Charmer.”
#+end_quote

And it's over. Ending with a bunch of victorian preteens killing a guy in cold blood. BEST FIRST CHAPTER EVER.
