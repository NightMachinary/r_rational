** Ah Cat, continuing down the slippery slope of compromise. Where will it end and what will be left of what you truely care about?

*** Well, Cat's motto is /justifications only matter to the just/. I think she innately gave up on principle when she crystallised those words - she's just seeing the effect of her motto on her actions now.

*** Well, she was never going to truly be a hero. Black is personally raising her to be his successor. At most you'll have a morally ambiguous Ranger-type.

**** No, definitely not a hero. I don't think I like any of the heroes in this story so Cat not being one of them is definitely a good thing. I still feel optimistic that Cat will transcend the models of both heroes and villains along the way to producing a better world.

***** I rather like the hero group under White Knight, bard excepted of course. Thief is pretty cool too.

****** That's funny, bard is one of my favorite characters. She makes things interesting.

******* I like Bard as an intentional foil. I dislike Bard as the schemer who's trying her best to destroy Cat. Like, she's not even really taking swings at the Calamities she's trying to pull down all of Callow because it isn't how stories are done.

She's the literal antagonist of EVERYTHING Catherine is trying to achieve.
