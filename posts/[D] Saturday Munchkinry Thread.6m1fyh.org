Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** So, I think I've found the /one/ Shrink Item abuse that hasn't been explored before. It should be possible to shrink down a 5-foot cube of air into a clothlike form that is effectively under 4096 atmospheres of pressure.

I've been trying to do the math, but not being an engineer, I haven't been able to determine if a D&D style world would be able to produce a system capable of utilizing that much pressure.

So would pneumatic cannons be feasible? Would you have to make them out of adamantine? You could probably bleed off some of that pressure so your materials could handle it, but how much would you have left.

Lastly, if you created magic items that produced tiny balls of shrunken air at various equivalent pressures, what technologies could you create using this as a power source?

*** Of course shrink item cannot actually work like this. If it did, the spell would be called "fireball" instead, because that would be the observable effect.

I mean, if you are trying to create an explosion by magically compressing something, why restrict yourself to gasses? Water is usually modeled as incompressible because the energy required to compress it even a little bit is well beyond the scales that typically show up.

Going to extremes, Osmium has a Young's modulus of about 500GPa, which if I understand correctly, means that if you shrink it to substantially less than it's usual size, it should be at about 500GPa of pressure (of course it becomes non-linear at some point, so this is a crappy approximation). This means that the total energy of decompression is about 500 GPa/2 ft^{3} ~ 2.8/10^{10} J, or about 5 tons of TNT, which I guess is a pretty large bomb.

But the point is that if shrink item actually worked like this, you would get a similar result from shrinking basically /any/ solid item.

**** Thanks for the help. I actually don't know the math that we'll and have been using Google to try to piece together the answer. The story I'm working on isn't the usual "person from our world with a scientific background gets access to magic" but more of a Leonardo da Vinci type who is experimenting without any prior knowlege.

He starts this experimentation when his son shoots a spit ball at him through a reed. As far as compressing non-gasses I'm wondering what the magical interactions might be. For instance Enlarge Person states that if there isn't enough room for the targets new form, than nothing happens. But there's (essentially) ALWAYS room for a gas. I'm basically assuming the spell itself can't perform work outside of what it's already doing.

*** The rules do not specify how rapidly the item is shrunk, or how rapidly it returns to normal size. At most, I could see a DM justifying a 3 second shrink/expansion time. That gives you your standard action to cast the spell, shrink something, and then pick it up with a move action. Obviously, this still means that any shrunken object placed inside of a sealed container will create a bomb, but at least it's not a bomb of unspecified and potentially infinite magnitude.

Assume that the volume and mass increases linearly over 3 seconds, so you're adding about 41 cubic feet of gas at standard temperature and pressure per second. You should now be able to work out your options in terms of exploiting a contained, pressurized gas system.

*** Note that if you can contain air at 4096 atmospheres of pressure, gathering 4096 doses of clothgas and unshrinking them should let you target the lot with a single shrink item spell.

Shrink item is a third level spell slot and thus worth about 150 gp per cast from a hired wizard.

**** My initial back-of-the-envelope math told me that the energy release from 4096 atm suddenly decompressing would be enormous. Enough to launch cannon balls at suborbital velocities.

Also, a magic item that created tiny balls of shrunken air would probably allow for selling them at arbitrarily low prices. Since D&D/Pathfinder magic items have no maintenance and in this case, the units would have no material cost the marginal cost of the compressed airballs would be zero.

***** Hmm... I get something different.

Released energy is the integral of pdV, right? Unfortunately, p scales like 1/V. So we really have the integral from 2ft^{3/4096} to 2ft^{3} of 1atm /V dV. But the dV/V integrates to a log(4096), which isn't all that large. My calculation puts the total energy at

1 atm*2ft^{3} * log(4096), which Google tells me is about 47kJ, or about the energy of 10 grams of TNT, which is a bit more than whatever this page calls a heavy firearm: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy]].

Also, as for cost, you need a 5th level or higher wizard to cast the spell, and they will only get a couple castings a day. Training a wizard is expensive, and since there are relatively few of them (and a lot of other uses for their spell slots), it may well end up being pretty expensive. I mean maybe the marginal cost is 0 in some sense, but the opportunity cost is large, as is the cost of the initial investment.

** OK guys, indulge me here:

In Animorphs, Rachel morphs an alligator and then all of a sudden she starts morphing at random, out-of-control times and in out of control ways (e.g. she'll be a half-elephant half-wolf monstrosity). This culminates in her essentially having a /full size, live alligator/ bud off of her body like she's a yeast or something.

According to the author, Animorphs: The Reckoning won't include this in its plot. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to work out how a rational animorphs team could use Rachel's "condition" in an advantageous way. I'm not sure there's much use for it, but I know you lot are as crafty as they come.

**** Assuming it's the same mechanism as in the books, it's analogous to an allergy. Most people have zero, but some people have one or more (I don't recall the term the books used, so let's call them) "morph allergies". When you acquire a morph you are allergic to, the mechanism you use to morph freaks out as described above eventually spawning a clone of the morph in an attempt to (if I recall the books correctly) expunge the DNA that you're allergic to. I don't recall exactly how specific the allergy is (that specific alligator, any of its family, alligators as a species, etc) but it's specific enough that you can't prompt "allergic reactions" for arbitrary morphs. There is no guarantee that the other animorphs will have an allergy at all, let alone one you could eventually discover, or a useful one. Rachel can probably create an unlimited number of alligators, assuming she's willing to go through the whole unpleasant process each time, including risking her life when an adult alligator appears in close proximity to her.

*** It's been forever since I read animorphs, and I never really got into it so correct me if I'm wrong on the details.

IIRC, the main enemy in animorphs are alien worms, which are utterly blind and helpless and easily killed. Yet when they crawl into people's ears, they can mind control them.

So it occurs to me that the simplest solution is to just destroy everyone's ears. Or put poison in them to kill any worms that enter. You would need to capture a lot of alien worms to experiment with so you figure out what poisons kill them but not humans, but that shouldn't be too hard. Test biological poisons that hurt alien worms but not humans, then morph into the animal species that produce those poisons, produce them en masse. Then put them into people's ears, by force if you have to. Or stealthily, using small insects to carry those poisons into their ears.

Or better yet, the MCs can also morph into the alien worms iirc, so just take over the people in power and then mind control them to pass laws forcing people to stuff their ears with anti-alien poisons. Or just chop them off and cauterize the wounds.

Yes, you may lose your sense of hearing, but now you're immune to mind control, and so the aliens are now screwed.

Then again, if the aliens had even the slightest amount of intelligence, they wouldn't keep being foiled by a few teenagers who barely even leave their country. (Cause you know, you could just mind control the world leaders that aren't being guarded by the teenage MCs. Fire nukes at MCs, no more animorph resistance.)

**** ... This is the worst post in this thread I've ever read oh my god

A) Even if this were a good idea, by what mechanism would the Animorphs /convince the population of Earth to cut off their ears/? Even if they could, future children would still have ears that could be taken advantage of, and the Yeerks could breed clones from DNA samples to make pristine humans. And if humans somehow managed to render themselves completely fucking useless, the Yeerks would just destroy the planet.

B) The Yeerks have a huge headstart in resources, manpower, and time. They can kidnap "people in power" and impersonate them far more effectively than the Animorphs can and would easily win in any such battle of intrigue.

C) If you could discover a poison that kills only Yeerks and is safe to be applied to the inside of human ears, that's great. But even if you can design such a substance, you have to distribute it to an impossible number of humans and even /then/, Yeerks can just sanitize hosts' ears before entering.

D) I reread your post, apparently your suggested mechanisms are /forcibly/ poisoning people's ears or using /stealthy insects/ to deliver the poison. Genius.

***** Again, I'm really missing out on a lot of the details here. If the books have given answers for why these ideas don't work, you can just say so, no need to be rude.

Let me explain my thought process here. First, my assumptions:

1) Humanity is under attack from a species called Yeerks. 2) Yeerks in their basic form are helpless creatures. Utterly defenseless little worms that can be easily killed in all kinds of ways. 3) The Yeerks' main method of attack is to mind control humans, which requires them to crawl into a human's ear. Hence humans with destroyed ears cannot be mind controlled. 4) The Yeerks' technology is not significantly better than human technology (otherwise, humanity should already be destroyed). 5) The Yeerks are not omniscient, they need time to learn about humanity (including our technologies), from their mind controlled hosts.

With these assumptions in mind, I first considered the Yeerk perspective. What is the most effective way to beat humanity? Well, that seems pretty straightforward to me: mind control the people in charge of firing nukes. Fire nukes. BOOM. Humanity crippled by nuclear war, Yeerks now move in and swallow up the remnants of human society, too feeble now to mount any resistance against the Yeerk invasion.

Why hasn't this happened yet? I assume it's because the Yeerks simply haven't figured out nukes yet. But they could do so any moment now, and once they do... BOOM.

Now I consider the human perspective. Since the Yeerks' best move is to trigger a nuclear war, as soon as they learn about nukes, humanity's best move should be stopping that. How? By making absolutely sure that the people in charge of firing nukes don't get mind controlled. This needs to happen ASAP, before the Yeerks learn about nukes. Well, how can we do that?

Simple solution: Destroy everyone's ears. Cut them off and cauterize them. Yes, we will probably become deaf as a result, but that's an acceptable sacrifice compared to the alternative of nuclear war. Being deaf does not make one "completely fucking useless". We DO have a written language to communicate with, not just audio languages. There are plenty of deaf people around that are still productive members of society capable of doing all kinds of jobs.

Plus, once you have ensured that humanity can no longer be mind controlled, you now have a large human force with a very good understanding of their own human technologies, vs a relatively small amount of infected humans with still rudimentary understanding of human technologies, and a bunch of helpless Yeerks with no more human hosts to infect. So humanity becomes pretty much guaranteed to win the war. All for the relatively cheap price of our sense of hearing.

There are a few flaws in your plan with the understanding you already have (it's more effective to safeguard the nuke system than to go on a massive impossible project, how would Yeerks take guarded humans with nuclear codes anyways if they're helpless) but yes, the Yeerks already have alien hosts and planet destroying spaceships.

****** There are several flaws in your base assumptions, which means most of your conclusions you derive from them are wrong, even if they're based on sound logic.

1) The Yeerks primary goal is to enslave humanity, not destroy them. Yeerks are weak and helpless without hosts, so they go around conquering other species in order to have more bodies so that every Yeerk can have their own. They could wipe out 99% of humans and then slowly allow the humans to repopulate, but they're confident enough that they're winning anyway, and probably saving that as a last resort.

2) The government, and pretty much all humans do not know that the Yeerks exist, aside from said 6 teenagers. The teenagers do not have the ability to convince or force all humans to destroy their ears, and they do not know who in the government is already being controlled that they could go to. Doing mind control themselves is also hindered by the fact that they cannot stay morphed as something for more than two hours in a row or they get stuck as that permanently and lose the ability to morph. They do mind control people at some point in the story, but only for short tasks and afterwards they have to leave and the person is aware they've been mind controlled.

3)The Yeerks have advanced technology, laser beams and space ships and stuff. I'm sure they know how nukes work. But don't use them for reasons 1) and 4)

4) The Yeerks do not know that they are being harassed by teenage humans. The beings who invented morphing abilities are Andalites with advanced technology and combat skills and have been at war with the Yeerks for a long time. The Yeerks believe the animorphs are a strike team of Andalites, and presumably have some sort of hidden base and space ships and a large backup force somewhere. The animorphs try very hard to stay stealthy and maintain this misunderstanding for most of the series. The Yeerks can't nuke them because they don't know where they live or if they're even on Earth.

There are plenty of irrational things going on in the series, but for the most part your solutions don't work for either side. The animorphs lack manpower, and can't act openly because they are being stealthy and can't trust anyone who might be mind controlled. The Yeerks lack information about the animorphs, and are also being stealthy and are hiding from humanity.

Hell, given the odds, it might be better for the MCs to be the ones triggering thermonuclear war. Or hijacking a planet destroyer. At least with the human farm destroyed, other alien races in the universe would have a slightly better chance of surviving a Yeerk invasion.

******** It's been a while, so I don't remember why the Yeerks are moving so slowly, but as far as I can recall, they don't have like all of the leaders of the governments controlled yet, just some high ranking members and various people scattered around here and there. The war isn't quite lost yet, but basically humanity is in the process of being infiltrated and has no idea and will lose without a fight if nothing changes.

I think part of it is that the main force is out in other parts of space waging war against the Andalites so this is more of a side objective setting up as an investment to create more war potential. Presumably their planet destroyers are all busy in the war, but if the humans did all rise up against them then perhaps might spare one for little old Earth. The MCs are trying to save Earth and the humans, I don't think they're selfless enough to sacrifice Earth if they think they can save it. Which, come one, they're teenagers AND they have superpowers, of course they think they can save it.

The excuse for them enjoying their teenage romance/drama is that they have to pretend to be unaware so that the Yeerks don't realize the guerilla force harassing them are actually humans and decide to nuke their city. There are infested humans around, including the brother of one MC. The Yeerks are somewhat oblivious, but if all six of them vanished to go make a war base and a police investigation occurred the Yeerks might finally put two and two together.

****** It's been a while since I've read the books as well. But, to answer a few of your points:

- Yes, Yeerk technology /is/ ahead of Human technology. /Way/ ahead. In fact, if they wanted to obliterate every human on the planet and boil the seas for a thousand years, they could. But they don't want to, because there is one thing that they want from this planet; human host bodies. Human host bodies in /staggering/ quantity, in order to win another war with another alien race.

- The Yeerks already have a lot of the people in power. Maybe not Presidents - but they have near-total control over the media (which they use to make sure that news of their invasion doesn't get out) and plenty of other, apparently harmless people, including loads of police officers. Again, if they wanted to turn this planet into a ball of radioactive slag, they /already/ have that capability. (If anyone went around cutting off people's ears, he'd find himself quickly hunted down by the police and hauled off to jail)

- The Yeerks don't require a complete ear. Just access to the ear canal. Cutting off the ear won't help.
