** Hey everyone, welcome back, and sorry for the cliffhanger! Also sorry for the slightly late chapter: those of you caught up on HPMOR can probably guess what distracted me.

So, one of the readers brought up some good questions about pokeball functionality and the hoothoot's death in his review, and I wanted to share some edits and clarification here:

Even if Red had registered his hoothoot with his pokedex, he can't just catch another pokemon and overwrite its data with the hoothoot's: pokemon don't become "energy" per se. They are basically atomized and compressed into a mass of what looks like energy, much like the light of the Star Trek transporters. The actual pokemon that was captured needs to be the one used, or else a pokemon that's almost literally a copy of it down to the atomic level, or else risk major complications. Just think of the gut bacteria and antibodies that need to be recreated. It's theoretically possible, but so difficult that it's rarely attempted and has never been successful.

Pokeballs are so arbitrarily powerful that the temptation to include more features and failsafes and capabilities than those included in the games/anime, like wireless data backup and automatic registry, have to be resisted. Since I need to draw the line of how powerful they are somewhere, I'm trying to stick to the games' capabilities as much as possible, and even come up with various miscellaneous restrictions (battery life, mass limits, "lock on" requirement) to explain why people in the games and anime don't, for example, fly over wild pokemon dropping pokeballs on them until they're caught.

Otherwise, taken at face value with how they /seem/ to work, the munchkinry would be so powerful and so obvious that the only explanation for why people in the games and anime don't use them that way and are still smart enough to tie their shoelaces in the morning is that pokeballs /can't/ be used that way, and it's just up to our imagination, or in this case mine, to come up with reasons why.

Hope that makes sense, and if anyone has new questions or objections to note, I'm really interested in hearing them, as always!

** So Blue got a Shiftry. At the loss of his Caterpie and Beedrill. I don't think it was worth it, especially considering how much that 'mon's gonna be hating him for dismembering it.

The part with Red and Leaf was interesting, as was the differences of pokemon between regions - even the same species can have differences it seems, just like reality! I also liked how Leaf gave the Pichu to Red, and apologized about his dead Hoothoot.

** Huh, I was pretty sure they were overpowered and would have to escape somehow rather than fight, given the previous chapter's very scary description of how dangerous even the single Shiftry was! I guess Shiftry do not account for allies hidden in pokeballs :D

As always, your writing gets better and better with each chapter. Really good tension! I like the relative lack of plot armor preventing things from dying, it will make future fights more intense.

** I liked the fight scene. It did a good job of keeping up the tension. I didn't realize this before, but how does Squirtle expel so much water? Does it store compressed water somewhere? Do its attacks in this story use up less water than in the games/anime? It makes more sense for a Blastoise, which is large enough to hold a lot of compressed water, but not really for a Squirtle. Even absorbing water through the skin shouldn't give it access to that much - google tells me that at 20 degrees Celsius you can't get more than 15 mL per cubic meter.

Since the names Volta, Faraday, etc. exist, does that mean this pokemon world is a post-apocalyptic version of ours? Or is that just a reference. I'm looking forward to finding out.

*** Squirtle stores compressed water, yes: it allows it to hold more than what its size would normally appear to, but not nearly as much as the anime, where it seems to be infinite.

As for the names, their world has many of the same major figures in history, particularly science. It was a decision I made early on to allow Red to make references to scientific discoveries and research that allows the readers to still look it up and research it in more depth :)

***** I was actually thinking that it doesn't hold it inside itself as water, but as compressed oxygen and compressed hydrogen, in two separate bladders in its body. When it prepares to spit some, it releases a bit from both into a third chamber that turns the gasses into water.

The problem with this is it would require a source of high heat inside Squirtle's body, and on top of that the third bladder would need to be incredibly chilled.

(and of course the danger of exploding turtles during battle)

I'm not sure which is more feasible: that it has such a complex and potentially dangerous internal organs, or that the one bladder that holds water is able to exert absolutely insane amounts of pressure.

It's yet another one of those cases where I just look at GameFreak and think "Does *anyone there* own a basic science textbook?!"

****** I think a bladder that exerts a lot of pressure is much more feasible. I'm not a physicist, I only know a bit about biology, but the oxygen/hydrogen reaction is explosive, and while it'd probably be possible to release the energy slowly through a chain of reactions with enzymes that would result in water slowly being produced in the third bladder, which would defeat the purpose of using a reaction to quickly produce the water. Compressing the water by an insane amount probably doesn't work either in terms of the physics, but in terms of evolution it's a lot simpler to just have really strong muscles compressing a tough bladder. The only real-life animal that shoots water that I found on google is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish][archerfish]], which simply applies pressure and doesn't have water storage issues for obvious reasons. Many fish store oxygen in their swim bladders to adjust their buoyancy, but it's kept in non-compressed, gaseous form. Perhaps for Squirtle it would make more sense for it to use very thin, very accurate, high pressure streams or bursts of water to target weak spots like eyes so that it could achieve more with less water. But you have to work with what Gamefreak gives you, I suppose. I'm looking forward to your explanation of how Pokemon use moves like Surf indoors.

That's mostly what I've been doing so far: the deluge of water used this chapter quickly exhausted his reserves, but before that he's been using short high pressure bursts.

***** So your comment just made me think that there's more to the "reference" that [[/u/PrinceofMagnets]] mentioned than I thought. After a google that brought about surprisingly specific results, I regret to inform everyone that I have never read Wheel of Time, nor heard that phrase used in connection to it XD I didn't even know it was a "saying" of any importance: it's just what came to mind for Blue's thinking, the way someone playing pokemon in our world or a sim in his would have to, eventually, take a chance on a capture without knowing if it would stick. Since pokeballs work on a binary catch-nocatch system in my world, this was the closest thing to taking a chance on a capture that they'd get.

I'm not sure if that detracts from the enjoyment or not, but I figured it's best to be honest :)

****** That just makes it even better in my opinion, Mat was my favourite character in TWoT. I'm really loving Blue and Red, they have a really interesting dynamic, especially with Leaf just sort of tossed into the middle of their friendship. There's so much potential in this story for interesting character conflicts, and it really seems to me that you're doing an excellent job of pacing and keeping the focus narrow enough (if we end up with more than 6 characters driving the plot, I'll be shocked). This is my favourite fiction that I'm currently reading.
