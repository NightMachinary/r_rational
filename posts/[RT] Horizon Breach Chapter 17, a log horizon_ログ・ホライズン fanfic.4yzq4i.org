** Improving.

I don't understand why you're describing the dialogues rather than writing them down, though. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Naotsugu swore vehemently that Tetra had an overskill she'd kept quiet about.

  Tetra swore, just as vehemently, that she was secretly a pink party pony.
#+end_quote

*** In this case, neither are actually talking; I'm talking about past actions.

I'll definitely take that advice into consideration, though. The next few chapters are pretty dialogue-heavy, so I'll need to make sure the dialogue is at least interesting.
