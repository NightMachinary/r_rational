*** Girl*

I think it's a possibility, depends how deep she can get, and what powers the primordial Essence has granted her.

Honestly I think a great continuation of the story would be from the perspective of one of her offspring.

She makes it down to the core of the world and absorbs more power, directly from the Dragon below, but somehow one of her eggs gets detached and ends up on the surface, blown out through the hole to hatch somewhere in Cyoria, it learns of Humans and in a primal wish to emulate them it uses it's primordial Essence (which originated from panexeth) to turn into one.

Commence story about awesome spider girl/boy with antimagic powers and the ability to shapeshift and a overarching plot about the birth of a new primordial (her mother) and the fact that she may be the only one who can defeat her, ad in some prophesies from people like Zorian, interaction with the Areana, and it could be an epic almost as cool as MoL

******* The Dragon Below is the mythical entity at the centre of their planet. It is supposedly the still beating and possibly sentient heart of one of the seven Primordial Dragons. The gods killed the other six, but use the last to form the material plane, leaving only its heart intact to provide mana for the world.

The primordial are it's children/fragments? I'm not to clear on that. They are the most powerful remnants of it. The lore is that the Dragon's continued rage and hatred towards humanity is why using ambient mana for casting drives humans insane.

***** After a recent re-read, my first read through from beginning to end, I think /all/ of the primordial essence from Silverlake is in the eggs now, and that it only granted spider mum sapience and the compulsion to go lower, though that may be an innate compulsion to seek the proper mana density for her offspring to mature in. I still like the sequel idea, and if nobody103 never returns to the MoL world, I might give a shot at a Fan-fiction.

Best case scenario, the spider goes down deep and its clutch is too magical to survive in the mana-starved upper levels, so it's just one eldritch monstrosity among many down there.

The crown probably isn't that big of a deal for Oganj since he is already sporting tremendous natural mana reserves, but I'm sure he'll figure out nasty things to do with a massive pocket dimension.

**** Interesting thought, but assuming Zorian made a habit of maintaining his spiderweb presence-detection trick, if QI came in mind-blanked Zorian would immediately know a powerful mage is in his presence, and if QI tried to come in with a fake mind it's not very likely to be convincing enough to fool Zorian. He'd probably need to directly teleport right next to Zorian to ambush him, in which case I estimate there's a moderate chance Zorian is able to defend himself, a very high probability that Zorian ends up needing to out his real skill level to defend himself, but also a mild chance that QI would need to abandon his new body when he tries to escape in the aftermath, and will take a while before returning to Ulquaan Ibasa if he doesn't, at which point you question whether it'd really be worth it to him to ambush Zorian.

Well, assuming Zorian maintains his spiderweb presence-detection trick. There's a mild chance it'd out him as an archmage if another archmage happen to come across him able to actually detect his spiderweb. In which case I wonder what other methods he has to avoid ambush. Constant stealthy divinations?

** Man, I've been reading this since it was around 15~ chapters in. Always been a highlight of my day when it came out, and every chapter has left me wanting more. The epilogue is no different, which makes me a bit sad that such a wonderful story has come to an end. There isn't anything else on the internet I have found that has scratched an itch so satisfyingly as Mother of Learning has.

I particularly loved Zorian's growth, not just power wise (which was so damn good), but as a human being - the interactions he had with all the various characters. The moment Zorian decided to take Kirielle to Cyoria for the first time was amazing. As was his return to Cyoria, teaming up with Zach, and then Xvim, Alanic and Daimen.

Thanks [[/u/nobody103]] for all the entertainment you've given me over the years. Looking forward to whatever you write.

Indeed, and were done by a Silverlake who /didn't/ betray them. Sure, any promises they made to the Silverlake who exited the loop are null and void, but they made promises to a different Silverlake in exchange for making them a potion of soul sight and teaching them dimensionalism, and both the Silverlake they made those promises to, and the one they would be repaying, have done nothing but help them.

I get why you don't think he would want her teaching Kiri. I disagree that it's as big a deal as you think, but I get it, and I'd totally understand if Zorian himself came to the same decision.

I don't get the idea that because one Silverlake betrayed him, that negates the commitment he made to a different Silverlake, to be repayed to a third Silverlake, neither of whom were involved in any such betrayal.

Zorian also knows she's very willing to abuse anything she gets and seek more. you can't just say "why blame her for Looper!Silverlake" when they've only really diverged half a year. anything Looper!Silverlake is willing to and has done, Silverlake is very much capable of doing to Zorian

Since he doesn't care about prestige he could probably register them as zero-circle spells and teach them to Kirielle perfectly legally.

IF he wants to go that far, which he probably doesn't, if nothing else because it'd probably attract attention to him. He'd probably just teach Kirielle mana sensing, then shaping exercises, then just straight-up unstructured spellcasting if he gets that far before Kirielle becomes a certified mage, and I'm pretty sure illegal spell teaching doesn't covered unstructured spellcasting. He could probably craft a "shaping exercise" that mimics magic missile. Though Kirielle's more likely to be interested in the illusion stuff.

  The Greg Hunter is an odd species of giant spider. Mostly docile, the Greg Hunter will happily go about its life without attacking nearby humans, so long as it's left alone. There is one caveat to this docility however: given the opportunity, the Greg Hunter will, as its name might suggest, doggedly hunt down anyone with the name Greg. We still don't know how the creature identifies Gregs, but it's more than just auditory observation (as demonstrated by the slaughter of four of the Silent Monks of the cloistered order of Somnus in 1426). Perhaps it has some degree of soul perception?

** I'm very happy with this epilogue. This story /is/ the one at my top of all time list, ever since I first started reading it, which was when chapter 42 was first posted. So since September 27, 2015, or slightly after that. What a journey.

I never buy physical copies of books, but come on. If this got published, I would need to get a signed copy, somehow. This story just hits all the points that I want in a story.

I think people are mostly missing an extended epilogue, which may happen eventually. Maybe Nobody103 will pull a Wildbow and start a giant work in a few years, as a sequel. This epilogue was pretty satisfying, though.

The only thing I miss is Zach interaction. In particular, I would have loved to see his wakeup scene, though the way this one started mirrors what he probably felt really well. I'm sure we'll start to see some fanfiction now. :)

** All right, now that I had the time to digest things, here are some of the things I'd like to see in the follow-up story:

- Zorian rubbing it into his mother's face that it's all thanks to her witch ancestry that giant telepathic spiders scouted him out (and the reason Daimen was so successful)
- Quatach-Ichl being incredibly petty and revealing Zorian and/or Zach the first chance he gets. I'm thinking soon after the war against Ulquaan Ibasa begins, he'd blow up a portion of the Eldemaran army, face their HQ and amplify his voice, and just bellow "ZORIAN KAZINSKI AND ZACH NOVEDA, I DEMAND A REMATCH!" and see how that blows up from there.
- Akoja's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Akoja. ...Possibly at the same time as Raynie's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Raynie. Like, one party walking in on the other two's conversation or something.
- Zorian hunting down Violet-Eyes for that injection of cash he needs. Her imperial staff might even be helpful when fighting against Oganj later, too.

She was from a major house of Ulqaan Ibasa, one with a unique tradition of undeads seen nowhere else, that could potentially become more widespread than lichdom. Simply meeting with her or any member of her family would have required a lot of effort, time investment and resources, if they were not initially related to the invasion or intended to participate themselves. /Particularly so/ because she was the heiress of this politically powerful house, one which was powerful enough to be able to apply pressure on Quatach Ichl himself. Who was the one who recruited her? Was it Red Robe, or Quatach Ichl? Was that why Quatach went back to Ulqaan Ibasa every month? Or if it was Red Robe, then why did he choose her? What made him go to Ulqaan Ibasa in the first place, or motivated him to seek them out?

The mere fact that she, and her house, exists, creates a lot of implications for what is possible with magic in this world, and for the power structure of the Ibasan government. You're right that overall, she wasn't particularly relevant to the story. But that's only because the author chose not to include her, because he seems to have decided to drop that plot thread.

QI himself also looked down on the new class of undead (nevermind the fact that she died easily, too). thinks they're too arrogant and overestimating themselves.

QI is a military leader but implied not all-powerful ruler of Ulqqan Ibasa. imo you're overvaluing QI's influence and House Zoltan and misunderstanding how their political structure works. remember, QI welcomes an attack against Ulqaan Ibasa because he thinks it'll teach some of the others in power a lesson, implying he doesn't have anywhere near absolute political authority. thus any particular house or necromantic art is very inconsequential to the main story.

RR outright knows QI beats Zach solo handily. archmage or not (and I don't think RR ever thought Zach to be at that level). plus they brought more than simply 3 people to confront everyone in the hall. plus the teachers have to care about defending students and other importants.

Not a single mention of whether they gain their abilities through infections/blood/saliva like traditional vampires, or through rituals like liches?

And also, you're underestimating her strength. She could survive losing an arm, like it was nothing. She fought against Kyron, and did not suffer any major injury that could hurt her in the middle term. She obtained a form of immortality and perpetual youth that allowed to keep her flesh and her tactile senses, which is more than what lichdom offers. If vampirism is an alternative to alchemy, why didn't Silverlake mention it at all?

Also, I'd like to point out that without a shield and taken sufficiently by surprise, Zorian is as brittle as any other human being. A single dagger thrust, incinerating beam or hidden mine, could take him out in an instant. When Zorian killed her, it was when she was dizzy and couldn't properly avoid it, while taken by surprise with one of the few spells that could actually have a real effect on her, while she mistakenly assumed that the students were no threats to her and her immortal body. It was definitely inexperience and overconfidence, but she had no reason to expect that someone like Zorian was there in the room, either.

But all of this aside, it doesn't change the fact that her mere existence, and the existence of her house, creates a plot hole, if they are never referenced again. In a world where vampires exist, and willfully choose to participate in the invasion on the sides of Quatach Ichl, this is not what you would expect to see. It is inconsistent.

when I say she was weak, it was a bit of an exaggeration. she's weak in the sense that she's 100% combatable by seasoned battle mages or retired ones. and if she was truly strong, she wouldn't have been blindsided /that/ easily. she's definitely no QI and she's probably weaker than the Cult leaders, etc.

why would Silverlake care? she doesn't have access to unlimited bodies to really focus study necromancy anyways. plus, alchemy is her thing... why even bother? and lastly, she wanted her youth back. vampirism isn't going to help her at this point.

Having no mention whatsoever of them by anyone at all at any other point in the story, not even any invaders, not even in their thoughts that Zorian read, and not in Red Robe's inner thoughts either, is an inconsistency, if they were actually present in the invasion force. There is no way whatsoever that it could be otherwise. It's clear that it's just a plot point dropped by the author. In a world where there was a vampire clan participating in the invasion, there would have been /at the very least/ one other mention. There were none. This isn't consistent with a world where vampires exist.

********* more lore regarding vampires would've probably made things a little more complete. but as I already said, what does this specific lore add to the plot at all? Zorian can add a throwaway comment about vampires living there (adding little value) or we see her again... turning people? I already mentioned why this isn't a realistic option and there are plenty of stories where vampires are very selective in who to turn (it's intentional and not as simple as just biting). when mind reading, Zorian is probing with intention (that's the only way to do it) and none of the things he'd care for would involve her. she isn't going to be someone he'd be able or want to investigate during the month and is mostly a normal soldier in the invasion (rather than commander integral in its planning). thus mentioning her again within the invasion also doesn't add much value to the plot

forcibly bringing her back into the story without intending to actually make use of it is distracting at best. I just think it's excessive to say it's inconsistent to mention her once and never again. for that matter, why don't we see /any/ other undead nobles participating? there has to be at least one other house that participated and they're probably an undead. but they were never even mentioned ever. she could normally with them and thus never encounter Zorian again on most/all restarts. if you're going to say it's inconsistent she isn't mentioned, then questioning why we don't see any other undead nobles is also an inconsistency. if she must be mentioned, they must be mentioned

why even mention vampires at all? because it was an easy way to introduce some world building without being too distracting. other forms of necromancy are possible, adds even more "evil" to the invaders (using our world lore as a crutch, sure). it was an easy insert and (mostly) fit in smoothly. the best way I'd see her or vampires in general being mentioned again would be if Z&Z decided to raid the fort for w/e reason. maybe that was indeed cut. still, I don't think most would consider thus large enough of an issue to say the story is inconsistent

****** Quatach is highly respected, and his voice has weight. But Ulqaan Ibasa doesn't have a monarch, or a single ruler. It's more of a republic in this way, with a council making the decisions, and with various factions being part of it. Not every faction respects Quatach Ichl's opinion enough to listen to it.

For example, most people on the council seemed to consider that it was best to remain at peace with Eldemar and the rest of the mainland, to not stir the pot and to negotiate trade agreements. Quatach disagreed, claimed that the most profit would be obtained from waging war, and that they should not be so satisfied with a single isolated and unhospitable island. However, his voice not being enough to sway enough people his way to convince the Ibasan government to start a war, he decides that it's in his best interest to attack a major Eldemarian city along with the local cult and thus force the issue.

The current situation, with Eldemar gearing up to wipe the people living on that speck of an island despite the risk of being stabbed in the back by Sulamnon or Falkrinea while their attention is elsewhere, isn't so far off from the situation Quatach Ichl wanted to create. Although, he would have preferred to have not lost the initiative, to have caused much more damage to Eldemar from a rampant Primordial and an unleashed angelic counter-attack, and to not have lost his crown in the process.

** You don't just leave those kind of plot hooks hanging if you're not going to do more than a epilogue spin-off. Of all things to mention in a epilogue, why the golems? And why twice? Well...

MoL 2's story begins a full month after the start of the war between Eldemar and Ulquaan Ibasa. When Cyoria comes under attack for a second time, a young novice mage who went on a expedition to the depths of its dungeon finds himself trapped, his only exit gone in a matter of moments, this is how he discovers a hidden facility deep underground and the giant golem slumbering inside. Now protecting his city and stopping the Ibasan forces is up to him and the +gundam+ golem he found. Will the towering machine, along with the ever increasingly complex golems of the Eldemarian Kingdom, be enough to change the tide of battle in their favor and end the war once and for all? Or will the forces of evil triumph once more? Altazia's fate is once more in the hands of an unlikely hero and his mighty companion.

** I would argue that based on what we've seen in the last chapters, Zorian is /most certainly/ the most powerful human /mage/ in the entire continent, by far.

1. His magical creations are so advanced beyond his time it's like a soldier from the middle ages with a modern machine gun. Sure, Zach or the lich could overwhelm him in a duel, But could they defeat him protected by the cube while supported by a 10-20 Mrva golems? Not to mention all the other tools he can prepare in advance.
2. His hivemind connection with 10-15 clones of himself and the mind enhancements he developed seems to give him something close to superintelligence. Like finishing advanced math calculations in seconds instead of hours, and reverse engineer a trap /after springing it/ while in combat.
3. He can basically one-shot anyone now that he managed to bypass the mind-blank spell.
4. Non-combat related, he has the most potential to exponentially grow.

I think the biggest plot-hole in the entire story is that he still goes to school, which should be a complete waste of his time. (He could probably digest an entire lecture in two seconds, with his hivemind of clones and enhancements)

*** Zorian can't store 1 let alone 10~20 Mrva (yet). and both those and his cube can be sieged and drained. while very, very diverse, the cube could potentially have a weakness (like the demon saliva). now that QI has fought Mvra and knows of the flower, he can also build counter measures. after that, Zorian is pressed for an answer.

Zorian didn't quite have an answer to Silverlake's creatures. the rose demon stopped Mvra handily. it's doubtful Zorian would actually beat Oganj in a direct fight. well, maybe with the flower. not that those are common by any means. and also probably vastly underestimating how much it costs to build even 1

one-shot requires contact. gl against QI or Oganj. QI can potentially fight it off via his superior soul defense (as confident RR was in his own, it probably isn't as superb) plus other defenses as well

you're probably overestimating how much Zorian can still grow. probably still plenty of room, but not exponentially

it's not a plot hole. how is he going to stay under the radar if he suddenly left on his own? you think he'd go back to Cyrin with his parents? there wasn't even anyone to go back to yet since his parents were in transit still. going off on his own will attract attention. "going to school" is pushing it, considering he personally grabbed teachers for "simply" a study group. he is also doing this more so to pay back his fellow classmates first and foremost anyways

Anyway, What am I going to do with my life now then? I've been following and looking forward to the bi-weekly/monthly chapters of this for years, it's honestly helped keep me going... now I just feel empty.

I guess I'll need to track down some more of these "build 'em up" (well, "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One man industrial revolution]]" is the closest genre to MoL, just replace 'industrial' with 'magic') stories, but I don't know if I'll ever find one that "scratches the itch" as much as MoL did.

So, in one way I'm very happy to see this has come to a satisfying (and well deserved on Zorians part!) ending, on the other I'm sad that it's over.

***** I think it's mostly because the author's been updating very slowly, so they haven't had the perspective on how to pace it very well. 3 weeks can be rough to pace, for MoL. But aHW is much more irregular, and goes a lot longer sans update.

It's a good story, except the recent chapters (and really the whole thing) needs some editing and revision. And maybe for new chapters to be written faster so that the author can keep the idea of how it should be paced in their head, instead of slowly dripping out updates.

A similar problem happens with Dungeon Keeper Ami, where ever since the Trapped double chapter, the author's updated it so slowly that the pacing feels a bit odd. Though, I think Pusakuronu is doing a bit better of a job in keeping pacing in mind over the long stretches without any updates.

What's the situation with Zach, Xvim, or Alanic? Zorian goes through his master plan, Zach hits him, and....thats it?? Where's the fallout?

I think the real issue I'm having is that this entire book is about never seeing ripples go out further than a month, and the epilogue here is....one month after the invasion. Give us some long-term ramifications! Set it on the one- or two-year anniversary of the invasion (or something), so ZZ have had time to seed their paybacks and watched as the benefactors get to actually study the books for more than 30 days at a time. How does the world change when they can /actually/ change it? Zach's goal was always to stop the invasion, but Zorian's felt a bit more farsighted, and I feel a bit robbed that I don't get to see the fruits of that foresight.

Like, all of Zorian's relationships, both hostile and friendly, have been colored by his ability to retry over and over until he's spent literal years getting to know people (with the sole exception of Zach). The playing field is now leveled, and with time flowing normally he doesn't have the time to build up those relationships with all those people the same way.

I'd really like to see the pang of regret as people grow apart from the version he knows, or outright reject him out of suspicion when he accidentally blows his first impression out of habit. Showing the downsides of the loop would have gone a long way to feeling more complete.

In contrast, the principal of Cyoria's academy was noted to be a fervent nationalist, though I can't speak for the municipal government). The story'd be a little different if the Ibasans tried to attack the capital, which has a higher concentration of competent mages loyal to the death to the Crown. Zorian even notes on his first visit there that the capital city has soldiers patrolling regularly as a matter of course, unlike Cyoria, so crime is somewhat harder to organize.

Besides which, if Zorian was to seriously attempt subverting the entire royal bureaucracy, he'd have to get them all at once, which is physically impossible unless he uses something similar to his array network (which would just call attention onto him), or use something like a long-term compulsion that spreads like a virus which other than being somewhat too shady for Zorian and even most aranea's tastes, would probably take enough time that someone skilled enough is almost guaranteed to catch on eventually. Either of those would just escalate a takeover into outright conflict between the government and the mind mages, which is really not where Zorian wants to take this, I'd bet.

And even all that is leaving aside whatever divine artifact the Royals might be able to dust off and use. Zorian still hasn't figured out how to invade the sulrothums' sand worm's mind, because of its divine protection, remember.

** A big vote for the slice-of-life mini-sequel as mentioned in the afterword, if you are keeping count. With the cast-of-dozens the epilogue could only cover a few of the relevant characters, and in minor ways, so I would definitely be interested in having more of that detailed. And there is still sortof this final "plot" element of Zorian and Zac building a life where they can be honest about their abilities and find a role for themselves, which I imagine that would cover. So if you need votes for that, this is one!

** This is excellent. I can say it now: MoL is my favourite novel of all times - and I read a /lot/ of novels.

A single epilogue chapter is, of course, not enough to touch all plot threads in detail, nor is it meant to. As the author said, that would be sequel material. This, instead, was used to provide a general outline of the closure, and it's certainly up to the task.

Possibly untrue, given that in Chapter 105 the imperial crown was relevant to making Jornak a temporary time-looper (and I don't quite see Zach being able to "borrow" it from QI without a battle).

Not, "Jornak's next six months were the best time of his life. But when the second limit approached, tempers started to run high among the group." (Paraphrasing.)

*** Zorian himself explains to Zach why he did so. I'm going to quote from chapter 92 for your convenience.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh yeah... what did you do with the--” Zach started to ask, before being cut off by Zorian.

  “I killed him,” Zorian said curtly. “Sent his soul to the afterlife.”

  “I... umm... shit,” Zach fumbled. “That's kind of... brutal?”

  “What was I supposed to do?” Zorian asked, uncomfortable with this line of questioning. “I don't know how to make a new body for him. Maybe I never will. I'd have to either keep him in stasis for years and years before finally releasing him into an alien world where a stranger has usurped his life... or having him accompany me as a powerless ghost looking over my shoulder, constantly getting his face rubbed in at the fact I'm so much better than him at everything. Isn't that a cruel and horrifying fate to inflict on someone?”

  “I... don't know,” Zach admitted after a while.

  “I know I'm not the same person as him by this point,” Zorian said quietly, “but I would hate that with every fiber of my being. I... don't think I'd ever get over it. Maybe I'm just a selfish monster trying to justify my crimes, but I think I'm doing him a favor. Alanic says the afterlife is still a thing, even after the gods stopped talking to people. For all his faults, I don't think the old Zorian had done anything truly heinous in his life... there should be a good outcome waiting for him there. Something he'd never get back here with us.”
