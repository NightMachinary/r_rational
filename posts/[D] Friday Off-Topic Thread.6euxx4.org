Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** Another book I'd like to read from “the same series” would be /Operational Manual For Your Body/.

Possible chapters: knows bugs (and workarounds \ fixes), lesser-known capabilities, proper maintenance and damage prevention (short-term \ long-term), properties specific to your sub-model (this information can be partially harvested through DNA tests, I think, but still).

The point is --- it's not that this information is not exactly available somewhere out there, but that it's usually intended for professionals (GPs, specialised doctors, surgeons, therapists, etc), and not the “users” themselves. So you can't just pick up a 300 --- or, hell, even 600-page long book, and be sure that most of what you'll need to know about your organism will be in there --- relevant to everyday-life and for the entire human lifespan, and not in abstract-biology encyclopedia type of way.

Well, I, at least don't know of any such books.

** I've been watching the show Code Lyoko recently, and I realized that it's already pretty close to rational fiction. They could have shut down the super computer at the beginning, but that's more of a difference in systems of morality rather than something that was explicitly wrong. There are many times when if they had thought a bit more logically it would have worked out better (eg. Jeremie bringing the CDs he's made to the factory when there was any chance of needing them), but on the whole, the story actually does meet all the criteria.

***** Okay so the gang discovers the XANA supercomputer and with Lyoko and Aelita. In the show, they do this whole 'threat of the week' thing where XANA attacks and they defeat it and rewind time to undo the damage that it did. Just like, unpacking that into "kids fighting a UFAI and trying to rescue their friend from inside a virtual world" running through all the implications of XANA and time travel and all of that instead of just glossing over it. It wouldn't be 'threat of the week' anymore, that structure would break down pretty much immediately, and there'd probably be a sort of Lensman Arms Race between XANA and the gang as time goes on. Could even have it culminate in XANA going full skynet and starting a widespread war on humanity.

Just taking all the pieces the show has, and putting them into a rationalist framework, yields some really interesting potential stuff.

****** One thing I noticed at the beginning was that the returns to past can't bring people back to life, so the implication is that every time they return to the past, a bunch of people who would've died in the next 24 hours suddenly drop dead.

One solution is that it only can't bring back people who would remember the return to the past, but then why do they work so hard to save everyone? It could potentially be an ingrained sense of saving people that they haven't reconsidered.

Another solution is that it only can't bring back people that were only killed because of the actions of XANA/the supercomputer, but that's somewhat confusing in the "who decides that" way.

******* Well, in the show XANA very clearly had magic powers. It repeatedly /possessed/ inanimate objects with no mechanical components like antique samurai armor and a teddy bear that grew giant-size. One time it somehow used indoor and outdoor light fixtures to control gravity, and in a later episode even took control of a doctor while the heroes were in a hospital. Even when they finally make Aelita human, XANA somehow made it so she'd die if they unplugged him.

Rationalizing the time travel rules is the least of your problems, this stuff is actually important to the plot beyond justifying episodic stories. The method that comes to my mind is to say XANA created grey goo bots too small for current science to detect that can build things from the environment, but whatever has XANA trapped in that computer is preventing it from accessing more than a small amount of the machines at a time every week or so.

If you went that route, though, it'd be easier to justify XANA's victims not coming back since the machines could be having an insidious effect on the people around the town whenever XANA gains control of some. It's just another kind of magic, but it's something and that level of technology would explain how they're able to eventually construct a human body for Aelita.

For Aelita, she is essentially just finally ten years later devirtualizing the original body she had before she was put into the super computer, so she shouldn't be any more confusing than the rest of the crew being able to be virtualized and devirtualized.

** So awhile back I wrote something of an anti-FAQ for "Nice Guys," here being used to refer to "Guys who bemoan the unfairness of the romantic world toward good, kind hearted guys like them." The point of the anti-FAQ is to try to explain the errors and biases in that perspective, and help them find a more useful/mature understanding of the opposite gender and the dating world.

(Is Anti-FAQ the right label for that? I'm not quite sure what it means specifically, but FAQ seemed wrong since it's the hypothetical Nice Guy asking the questions and me answering them)

I never published it because I got super busy with other projects before I could find others to proof read and give feedback on it, particularly people who consider themselves farther on the "MRA" side of the spectrum rather than the "SJW" one, if we use those acronyms to represent extremes.

Finally figured I might as well offer anyone who's interested the chance to provide some feedback so I can maybe put it up sometime this month. All perspectives welcome, though if you consider yourself or have considered yourself at any point a Nice Guy, your feedback would be particularly helpful.

** Lately I've been on the lookout for good depictions of different types of psychological dysfunction--specifically depictions that are consistent and clear, instead of just "lulz they're crazy". Examples that come to mind so far are:

/Bojack Horseman/ and depression

/Wilfred/ and anxiety

/Jessica Jones/ and post-traumatic issues

I almost want to include Crazy Ex Girlfriend in this list, but the protagonist of that show suffers from several different issues to varying degrees, so it's harder to get a sense of what is happening in her mind.

His symptoms also come off as more manic than anything. Most people going through depression who want to avoid doing something will just stay home all day, whereas he just as often avoids doing something by taking random trips out of the city or wild partying and drug use.

** It's basically my first exposure to the topic of Trump's Twitter posts, but the recent /covfefe/ incident has me wondering if Trump has been intentionally using typos to manipulate the perception and publicity of his tweets. I mean:

1) It is common knowledge that typos change the perception of a message, increasing the reader's sense of the spontaneity (and hence sincerity) of the message. (While, yes, decreasing their sense of the writer's formal education / intelligence.)

2) A narrative of "the media makes fun of me for /stupid/ things that don't matter", the sorts of inconsequential things that working guys like you do (like typos in tweets), is in Trump's favor.

3) Getting cocky? A particularly blatant error (see #5), in a post about how "despite the media coverage...", later replaced with "guess what this typo means" and a "Yep, it's a conspiracy" from Spicer.

4) Apparently he's been routinely misspelling Barack's name.

5) The most recent one, "covfefe", does /not/ strike me as a real typo - it (unlike the other typos of Trump's that I found reports of in a quick search) is not a correctly spelled word (IE, not an autocorrect error) and not a phonetic spelling. Also, I spend way too much time looking in detail at people's typos, when I see them, and "fefe" instead of "erage"... just... um, really? Probably not on QWERTY...

6) Scott Adams puts forth that there's some evidence that Trump has a powerful grasp of a sort of low wit that could perhaps include techniques like this.

On the "evidence against" side, of course, we have the base rate of typos in his posts and the difficulty of prosecuting a good conspiracy.

Conclusion is that we should stop giving media attention to Trump's typos.

****** They aren't winning, but they've convinced themselves that they are. I've already seen people abandon Trump because he failed to deliver or pushed them path their limit, but statistics are showing that the vast majority of people who voted for him are still behind him. I find it hard to believe that most of them aren't already using conspiracy-level thinking to have continued their support in spite of the evidence presented to them.

Only in fiction produced by the international cliques and the globalists that deliberately vilifies my beliefs. Sometimes they even try to pass it off as non-fiction and pray to Moloch the gentiles won't notice, I assume.

Of the more prominent ones, I thought Set in Stone was good. UNSONG could probably work as counter-semitism propaganda with the right framing. HPMOR and most of its meta-fanfiction are Chick-tier author tracts.

** *Printing several pages onto one piece of paper?*

Embarrassingly silly and small question that I can't seem to find an answer through Google on, and there don't seem any good subreddits for:

I've compiled some notes I want to have handy to refer to into a 16-page PDF. I want to shrink and rearrange those pages, to print 8 per side onto a standard sheet of paper, so that I can cut, staple, and fold it into a pocket-sized booklet. My last-ditch solution would be to hope a photocopy/print shop wouldn't charge much to accomplish that... But does anyone here know how to wrestle my doc into usable shape without having to pay cash?

(My available computer is Linux-based. I'm generating the PDF by fiddling with an HTML doc mostly full of tables and 'printing' it to a file. Some further fiddling is probably going to improve its presentation, but if you've got an auto PDF-to-booklet script handy, or otherwise want to play with it, I've tossed my current draft [[https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cniglic%20Test%201.pdf][here]].)

*** I think something from the pdfjam package may work for you:

[[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam]]

In particular there's a tool called pdfjam-pocketmod, which "converts 8 pages from a single PDF file into a pocket-sized booklet". That's for a fancy layout where you can just fold the page directly into a booklet I think -- if you just want to shrink pages so you can cut them out, pdfnup is a tool for grouping every N PDF pages into one (read the name as "pdf-N-up".)

**** That looks like just the tool I need...

... but I seem to have entered the yak-shaving stage.

I have pdfjam installed; I just can't seem to get my copy to /do/ anything other than announce errors. For example, looking over the pdfjam-pocketmod script at [[http://tug.ctan.org/support/pdfjam/bin/pdfjam-pocketmod]] , I can manually enter the final command (replacing the variables with what I want done), but... if I don't enter an output filename, then it obviously doesn't work, but if I do enter an output filename, I get an error that the file with that filename doesn't exist. And, of course, neither the man page nor the website or any discussion I can find offers anything as simple as a working example of the pdfjam-pocketmod command.

It's 3am locally; maybe I'll see whatever it is I'm missing after some sleep.

And that can wait while I try to figure out how to make the various tables more readable.

*** Your printer doesn't have a "number of document pages per sheet of paper" setting?

I can go Print-> Properties -> Multiple Pages -> 9 in 1, but it would require manually reordering the pages (and adding two filler pages).

If all else fails, you can use GIMP or something to horribly hack all the pages together and print that.

... As it turns out, I'm not quite finished moving house, and my printer is buried and/or transmogrified into an unrecognizable box; it looks like once I get a print-ready file or two, I get to stick them in my online temp directory and pop over to my new local public library to print them there.

At this rate, I may have to do just that. Which will mean a dive into yet another program's canvas-size settings and taking the time to figure out how to divvy up the page and how to paste into selected areas, etc. At this point, I'm gaining a tiny amount of hedons just from how many steps it's taking to get to the point where I can look up my notes while I'm out doing some chores. Not nearly enough hedons to counter the annoyance of not having just printed the thing two days ago, but I've got enough depression that I'll grab my hedons wherever I can find 'em.
