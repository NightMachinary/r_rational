***** Yeah. Filled with the new aspect. But even if it isn't a new aspect I doubt it's less powerful than one. Like being made into a duke level fae.

Remember, black is a nightmare because of his shadows and inherent nature. Not because of his silly trump cards.

** Looks like Cat just became the

Black Night. :P

The King had an entirely novel way to conquer a city. Give the current leader a title under you and ask for no allegiance.

And now she's a double Duchess, so I wonder how the Empress will react to that. As well as to the claim that Marchfort is now a city of the fae.

***** There's also the issue with how to get the heart back.

Cause, she needs to kill the Winter King to get it. But, as he said, Winter keeps what you kill. So, if she does, she's now Queen of Winter.

EDIT: Oh wait, my mistake. She just needs to finish the war to get her heart back.

**** Wow, just... Wow.

Loved the imagery. Summer is 100 x worse than any previous challenge Catherine has faced. Archer will be a good asset but I don't know how the hell Catherine is going to overcome. (And how Heiress is going to try to fuck it up for her.)

This is an awesome set up for the rest of this book.

******** I'm still trying to articulate this point fully, but I enjoy what Practical Guide does to our (as the reader's) sense of narrative.

We know, at the end of the day, that Cat will win. The question becomes - how does she win? What does she give up? For example, in today's chapter, she gave up her literal heart.

At the same time, we know Cat's world works within narratives/stories. She "fits" her story within that of the Orphan Squire to beat the Swordsman. She "fits" her story to touch the power of the daughter-killing-her-father and therefore defeat the Duke of Violent Squalls. Today's chapter (King setting her a task) sounds like the start of a Story, but the question to the reader is: which story are we going to see?

So as the reader, we wonder: which story is the author going to "fit" this into? King setting an impossible task to get rid of a "faithless" steward (focusing on the relationship between the King and Cat, like Hercules or other [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask][Impossible Tasks]])? Group of people [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest][questing]] to save their friend (focusing on Cat's heart-loss)? Hero trying to defeat great evil (focusing on the war against Summer)?

But at the end of the day, we believe that Cat will win. Because that is the unspoken compact between author (erraticerrata) and reader. If not, /why are we reading this/?

And her third aspect; she's sacrificed whatever it might have been.

That's a good possibility given the attitude of the Winter King.

These two are virtual certainties.

#+end_quote

Yes, indeed. It seems to me that Cat always loses something when she wins. I fully expect Killian to either betray Cat or die (or both) before the end of this story.

Whatever happens it's going to continue to be more complex and nuanced than can be captured in any one sentence story plot line. I think Heiress (or should I say, the Diabolist) is going to be part of the story to the end; and she always adds an unpredictable element in my view.

#+end_quote

Am I missing something - does it say so explicitly? This is the part:

#+begin_quote
  Power pulsed in my chest, spreading through my veins. I felt the third part of my soul, the missing aspect I had yet to forge, fill with something old and too large to comprehend.

  “I stand by my oath, dead thing,” I rasped. “Before my days are done /I will see you unmade/.”
#+end_quote

It doesn't sound like she's sacrificed the third aspect - just that it's affected by Winter powers. Could she lay claim to the name "Make"? (It's repeated several times - she says she'll see the King unmade; the King charges her with the making of peace.) The third aspect was also triggered by the ice entering her heart. If she gets her heart back, does she get the third aspect back?

Alternatively - Masego did mention in Book II Chapter 27 (Cut) that the name of the Squire was permanently crippled - it would fit if she never gained that third aspect, with the winter powers being the replacement.

Another speculation - the Snow Queen fable can be about a girl with a shard of ice inside her heart. Would also fit into the idea of castle building and the image of Winter that Cat sees.

******* That was mostly sarcasm on my part. Cat's style of "winning" a game is flipping over the chess board then throwing pawns at the opponent's eyes while stomping on their feet.

Things are going to be chaos.
