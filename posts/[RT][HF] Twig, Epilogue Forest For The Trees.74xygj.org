**** Well, yes, but I wasn't going to post individual epilogue chapters, just the epilogue as a whole. Those who read every post are already on [[/r/parahumans]]; these have been for the readers who prefer to read each arc in its entirety.

** How long is Twig? And does anyone have a feel for how good it is when binged as opposed to week by week?

*** Pact is around 950,000 words; Worm is a little less than 1,700,000 words; and Twig is a bit less than 1,600,000 words (now, but I imagine there's enough left that it'll break that number). Unless the epilogue arc is really long, it won't surpass Worm, but it's definitely a lot closer than Pact is.

I binged it up until 19.4, and then read it as it was published for the 34 chapters since that (so, 17 weeks). It was fantastic both ways, but I preferred reading it as it was published, because it meant I could take part in the discussion threads on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]. I'm not sure if the same would be true for something like Worm 2, though, since Twig has a lot more mysteries for the reader to solve than Wildbow's other works did.

Twig is probably my favorite of Wildbow's works. The other two do certain things better, but I didn't get as attached to the characters in Worm or Pact as I did in Twig, and I've seen a lot of people voice a similar sentiment.

*** Twig is fairly long, but I'm not sure how it compares to Worm or Pact. I /think/ it would have an excellent binge factor; knowing how it ends, I'm very excited for a re-read. The story spans nearly a decade, but the spans of time shown are filled with events and character moments.

*** Twig is excellent, but because it is a little more episodic, it's hard to just pick it up and read through all of it. I'm pretty sure its ending length is somewhere above 1 million words long, longer than /Pact/.

** Allright, nice. I've been waiting for Twig to be finished to try reading it.

What were people's general impression on the story?

*** Excellent, but very different from Worm and Pact. Focuses more on character arcs and interactions than complex battles, but is still has endless creative monsters and awful ways to die.

The writing is some of Wildbow's best.

*** I seem to be in the minority of people who didn't like Twig that much. Don't get me wrong, it's clear Wildbow's skill as a writer has improved /a lot/; the dialogue feels much more organic than Worm or Pact, he seems to have gotten over his discomfort of writing romance and the pacing is well-managed. The characters are also very well-written, but imo Wildbow has always done that well. That said, for the strengths in writing at a fine-scale I think the storytelling wasn't as good. It felt disjointed and many of the arcs didn't serve much of a purpose. A lot of them are just 'The characters go go the next city and defeat a new enemy there'. I think Twig is less about what the characters do and more about how they change, and I get that some people like that but I felt like it was less entertaining. I'm still glad it exists because Wildbow has gained some great experience and I really want to see how he applies that to the Worm universe.

*** Thankfully, most of those who are to start reading it now will probably be done with arc 20 when the entirety of the epilogues are out (unless they're utter freaks who can read more than 3 arcs a day, assuming there'll be 4-7 epilogue chapters.

*** No epub, as Wilberblow wishes to publish his books eventually and having copies of his works online downloadable makes publishers less likely to want his books. But, compiling Twig into your own epub is fine (as long as you don't share it with others) so feel free to do that if you wish~ source: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/6cusa0/wildbow_ebook_scraper_question/dhxi3jf/]]
