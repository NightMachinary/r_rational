** My money's on Hierarch being behind what's happening in Rochelant, maybe with his third aspect. We don't know why exactly he decided to leave Nicae to go with the League's armies, but I think this is the beginning of his play.

*** What play? He hates everything happening to him and just wants it all to stop. This isn't a plan on his part, he's just doing it to punish the foreign oppressors.

** Man I fucking love this story. This sheer level of absolute chaos with no one knowing who's on who's side is unprecedented among the literature I've read. Reminds me a lot of the early Balkan wars.
