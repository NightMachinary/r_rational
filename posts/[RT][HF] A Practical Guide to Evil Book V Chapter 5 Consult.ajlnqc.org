** My money's on Hierarch being behind what's happening in Rochelant, maybe with his third aspect. We don't know why exactly he decided to leave Nicae to go with the League's armies, but I think this is the beginning of his play.

** If Cat meets the Tyrant, I don't think Calernia is gonna survive the sheer chaos that is bound to create. The meeting is gonna be a rollercoaster of quips and logical leaps.
