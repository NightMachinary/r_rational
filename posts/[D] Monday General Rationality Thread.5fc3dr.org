Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I've been spending an inordinate amount of time on [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]], and it has become apparent to me that the goal of raising the sanity waterline is going to be ever harder than we thought it would be. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism][Anti-intellectualism]] has become a pervasive attitude throughout the western world, which has rendered traditional methods of rational debate useless at persuasion.

Last week I made a post about how hard I was trying to avoid dehumanizing people with different political opinions from me, but the more I speak to them the more I see my prejudices as rational. Every fact I cite is decried as biased in my favor, even when they admit they are biased against me. It's as if they see rationality itself as something to oppose. I don't know what to do.

*** I spent a little bit of time on [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] but I came away with the feeling that what I felt [[/r/AskTrumpSuporters]] should be wasn't what it was. The modding explicitly disallows hardball questions and even so the Trump supporters on there always are complaining that they get attacked.

Anyway I wish you luck. I think it's fair to say based on polling that the [[/r/the_Donald]] style Trump supporters are in the minority both of the country and even of Trump voters. It is strange though and scary. I don't think it just comes from one side though. Politics sadly isn't an intellectual game and few people know how to even start engaging with it as if it was.

**** what exactly are the causes of anti-intellectualism being so pervasive?

Now that I think about it, if you try to run a campaign against prejudice or discrimination against any other minority group, people might be more likely to change their minds. But if that minority group is just intellectuals--that is to say, smart people who actually use their smarts and enjoy doing so--then most people will probably just feel insulted, because the implication is that /they/ are not smart people who actually use their smarts. But the fact is, most people aren't and not due to any fault of their own. Most people probably don't have the time, energy or attention necessary to think deeply about things, or to learn to think deeply about things.

Also, this is just pure speculation, but I wonder if maybe a lot of intellectuals started out as just average intelligence people who've then had more practice thinking deeply and analytically--more chances to hone their intellects, and either got less negative reinforcement for expressing deep analytical thoughts or who were able to just ignore the negative reinforcement. Like, somebody who is new to thinking deeply and analytically would probably think, say and do a lot of very stupid things, so in order to avoid embarrassment from expressing stupid thoughts, they just avoid deep thinking?

After all, being willing to think deeply about things isn't the same thing as being more intelligent.

People conflate a whole lot between intelligence, education, and [[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/democratic-party-clinton-trump-white-voters-workers/][the professional-managerial class]]. We have a culture that treats being smart and acting like a college-educated professional as identical, even when certain college-educated "professionals" are /just plain wrong/ about thing after thing they say and do (for instance, many people in fine suits claim AI risk doesn't exist because dualism).

Yes, the link is spiders. I think it's still worth linking, because the elephant in the room is that when talking about these issues, conflating between "people in general" and "the people who showed up and got counted on Election Day" is, well, /very/ incorrect.

****** Well yes, being a college educated professional and being smart are not the same thing. However, if somebody spends most of their time on menial or physical labor they're not going to have as much time or energy to focus on intelectual things, are they? And even then, I wasn't just talking about people who aren't college aged professionals. Sometimes people get really really busy and they don't feel like they have time to really sit down and think about things much. And while I suppose they could just make time, if they don't really sit down and think about things more then they'll never realize how important it is to do that. A lot of people might be smarter than they realize but just don't apply their intelligence that much. Take this with a grain of salt though, since I haven't actually read any studies that suggest whether this is an actually significant factor in why most people aren't intellectuals.

Also, saying it sounds like something that someone in the philosophy subreddit would say doesn't actually tell me anything since I am not familiar with that subreddit. But keep in mind that I did say it was just speculation. I don't really know enough about social psychology to really say for sure whether any of my speculation is actually true, and I don't have any idea how to test it. I was merely raising a possibility.

Most people aren't intellectuals because we mostly don't educate them to be intellectuals. This includes most white-collar professionals. LW, [[/r/rational]] and the rest are /unusually/ focused on large-scale intellectualism, /among/ communities, even among the educated, who focus on anything.

Most people don't get philosophy (in the academic philosophy sense) or rationality (in the statistical sense) lessons, ever, in their lives, and in fact, many attempts to use Philosophy or Rationality (in the economic sense) in common conversation are blatant manipulation.

When we keep intellectualism a rare skill that is commonly used to manipulate people, people are, well, kinda rational to somewhat distrust it. But it's also very cultural: people in Israel are /impressed/ that I went to the Technion (their Institute of Technology), with zero total allegations of egg-headedness.

(Of course, the last known allegation of being an "egghead" AFAIK was from Rainbow Dash to Twilight Sparkle. Does anyone actually /say/ "egghead" anymore?)

*** Right-wing politics aren't anti-intellectual, although I can't speak for Trump supporters. They are strongly /anti-establishment/ - this has intersections with anti-intellectualism, but it's important to understand that sometimes rationality and right-wing politics /aren't/ mutually exclusive.

It's understandable that they're paranoid about intellectualism when the academic establishment has such a history of being dubious, and they themselves are conservative socially. It's not as if they're against studies in general (in fact, studies help legitimize their claims) - they're against /your/ studies, or they think your studies don't paint the whole picture. There are plenty of intriguing studies for the other side on issues liberals don't even tend to consider, and those keep a lot of people on the right who would otherwise leave. I can't name anything off the top of my head, but if you ask somebody for sources, you'll find /something/.

[[/r/AskTrumpSupporters]] isn't a good place to reassure yourself that this presidency won't be a disaster, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][because they're not as representative of Trump as Trump himself is]] - remember that many people voted for Trump begrudgingly, just to keep Hillary out of office. It's like going to /pol/ expecting to find people mourning the death of Castro. Trump himself is probably more left than half the people on that sub.

Also, picture this: In the wake of that massive invalidation of psychology studies, and the near stagnation of the field of quantum study, the people arguing against the current academic environment may not be all wrong. In the same way that people advocate returning to the Enlightenment roots of the constitution, there may be people who reject the modern publishing industry and strive for the virtues first established in the Scientific Revolution. There are people who reject the academic establishment who are /not/ anti-intellectual, the same way the people who want to return to the roots of the constitution are not anti-government. It's possible to be an academic conservative, or even a conservative rationalist, because the fundamentals of the movement are embarrassingly broad (and encompass both people who would identify as politically conservative and those who identify as libertarian-left).

Granted, the people who use this as an excuse to not change their minds /ever/ are wrong, but that's not the fault of right-politics any more than Lenin is the fault of the left-ideology. Some people are beyond the reach of rationality, but that is no reason to discount an entire political hemisphere! The biggest problem here is that you poured buckets into the desert to try to raise the sanity waterline, when you should have been digging canals in the lush fields. It might not be remarkable to preach the virtues of rationality in [[/r/Libertarian]], but it's more liable to give you results.

***** Yes, and that's why the two party system is a useless piece of trash. It just depends on what part of the establishment you happen to pay attention to.

EDIT: Example of a typical moderate democrat-moderate republican exchange:

DEMOCRAT: "Restricting the power of the government regulations is well and good, but how will we deal with things like climate change and corporate negligence without a government to enforce the rights of the citizens?"

REPUBLICAN: "I am okay with climate change laws, so long as the rights of the citizens are not violated. However, I feel as if they are an opportunity to sneak in more government corruption and power, which makes any benefit gained from climate laws irrelevant."

If that seems unremarkable, then you're correct. We don't actually think all that dissimilarly - the problem usually ends up being different priorities. This is probably half of why political affiliation is so heritable - it means little which party you're actually in, you are equally paranoid either way.

I have mixed feeling about that.

One one hand, two parties invariably leads to centrist candidates, gridlock in congress, absolutely glacial change, and disenfranchisement amongst a lot of people.

On the other hand, that's exactly what the founders intended, and so far, it's worked.

"Real change," even for broken things, doesn't happen. But at the same time, neither party has the ability to really fuck things up while they're in office, combined with our other checks and balances. It's why I'm not particularly worried about trump-- given free reign, he'd do a lot of stupid shit, but that very partisanship everyone hates so much will be stalling him in the senate, unless he buckles down and actually compromises for once in his life.

Similarly, extremists from both parties kind of deserve to be disenfranchised. They get to have their say in the primaries, but they don't deserve to steer the national conversation.

So the result is that if you're not already fucked to the point where only government intervention will save you, the government is sort of a nonissue with regards to whether you're ultimately succesfull or not. And while I think the US could do with a better safety net, that's still superior to the government being directly impactful on every citizen's day to day life.

You may not consider yourself an extremist, and it's true that you're probably not radical within your own social circle, but if you went up to a random person on the street and struck up a political conversation with them, chances are you would be doing most of the talking.

Well, yeah. But I'm not getting fully automated luxury gay space communism anytime soon anyways. The views that I hold which are extremist aren't catered to, and that's the system working as intended. If a group wants a change from the status quo, then it's their prerogative to convince /people/, not politicians, that they should be listened too. Anything else is just another form of oligarchy.

#+begin_quote

Exactly. Extremists make up only a small proportion of the population. Letting them (us) control political discource just because they're loud is a sure recipe for a schizoprenic government. And regardless of how good each specific change is, they make planning for the future difficult, even if they make life better in the aggregate. And that's assuming the changes are /good./

Fundamentally speaking, I'm ok with being ignored, so long as my opposite number is also ignored. Because I think I'm right, and therefore will be vindicated eventually, therefore convincing the majority to see things the way I do.

And when I'm wrong? Well, thank goodness I didn't have that input, then.

I... Agree with your /statement/ but not with your point. That is, I think what you say is true, but I don't think it's bad. Because what is a law, other than removing liberty in favour of security? Every law is an inconvenience to some extent. The innefective laws are bad, of course, but the very centrism in government I'm arguing for keep them from being /too/ bad for any specific group. And they eventually get repealed or amended, for some reason or another. And the actually /good/ laws stay.

That's not to say that the current system is perfect-- lobbying has congress listening to a group of extremists, except both sides eat out of their hands.

But the fix isn't to give special interest groups, regardless of whether they're called "companies" or "third parties" more power.

For me, that's reddit, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon video, and then a whole bunch of other sites that I use less often. That leaves me to do productive things, like writing.

I've been fairly astounded by how effective it's been for me. You'd think that it would be simple to just say "okay, don't go on those sites if you want to do more productive things" but I've increasingly come to realize that good habits are a matter of conserving willpower and altering patterns more than simply doing or not doing things. I've seen lots of advice for dieting that says it's simple, just make sure that calories in are lower than calories out ... which seems to deny that the basic problem lies within the brain.

I've read:

1) Get into the habit of cooking your meals/only buying food that requires cooking

2) Don't eat outside of meals

3) Go grocery shopping when full.

4) Buy healthy foods.

5) Buy small plates and bowls.

Which sounds like a much more psychology based diet plan.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to test it because I don't do the shopping. And apparently everyone else in the house thinks ensuring that the fridge contains a constant stream of Egg Nog and Chocolate Milk is a good idea...

** I'm a bit worried about the future. Something I thought of after the Brexit vote and now after Trump is how hard it can be especially for someone young to think about radical change in the future. I was born just after the fall of the soviet union. Almost all of the change I think about directly experiencing has been slow, gradual, and really quite predictable.

On the other hand I didn't expect Brexit, even though the polling was tight, even though it was a hard thing to accurately poll on I had strong bias toward the status quo. Similar with Trump while I was more aware I again couldn't picture what I viewed as a radical departure from the status quo despite the fact the polls were close, despite the fact that respected experts were giving 30% odds of Trump winning.

What I'm getting at is that I worry we don't picture the level of radical change we may see in the future. It's not exactly a new worry but so much Sci-Fi deals with nation states or similar groups doing bad things with technology, but the more I think about it the less that's my worry. I'm more concerned with individuals. What happens when and if any human can fabricate a nuke? I think we assume that the power to prevent destruction will scale about evenly with ability to produce destruction, but I don't see any reason for that to be guaranteed.

I feel like we may come to a junction where the only way to enforce rational actions like preventing nuclear bombings of cities is a much more invasive government. As somebody who is sympathetic to the ideas of Libertarianism that's a pretty tough idea, but I don't see a way around it.

It comes to the conclusion that we need blue goo, eg. benefical immune system nanobots, checking every single molecule in the biosphere every minute or so.

Thats probably the most extreme example; bioengineered plagues are currently the most realistic problem we have, and much easier to defend against (though still with really badly catastrophic outcomes).

Has this ever been actually the case in history? To me it seems like destructive power always ran faster, even if for a long time in history the difference was smaller.

Some of this is certainly due to my bipolar biasing me in the pessimistic direction but I still can't shake the feeling that the right conclusion to draw, even after I account for my bias, is "we're screwed and things are going to get awful in the next couple of generations, and then get even worse," and that coming to any other conclusion is just overcompensating for my bipolar's bias.

**** I'd like to say that's the bipolar, but I also have some bipolar and feel really similar right now.

The rational part of me points out that what's happening right now is /overdetermination/: the people in charge attempted to impose an irrational order too hard, so the system is breaking down quite openly and turning chaotic. If you always give people a false choice between a lesser evil and a greater evil, while the evils always make their lives worse, they will eventually choose the greater evil, the one you didn't want them to, /just to stop you doing that shit again/.

Our task here is to rebuild social consensus towards a new order that meets people's needs more effectively and reliably. That's the hard part: the actual material infrastructure for the new order is /already here/.

If we're all making World War II comparisons these days, well, things were awful in 1933, but in a part of the world FDR was about to start the New Deal then. By 1943, everything was thoroughly fucked and humanity was in its very darkest moments. By 1953, the Postwar Consensus had been forged and people were rebuilding in a healthier new order. Trust me, I /hate/ the fact that the long view here involved 20 years and millions of deaths.

Morally, our task is the same as ever: to act on empathy and kindness rather than selfishness, fear, and bias. I've known at least one person /from this subreddit/ whom current fads of speech would group as an unrepentant neo-Nazi. He's definitely a Manosphere person at least, and I'm not sure what other weird alt-right shit he eventually got into. I'm not sure he browses this sub anymore, though I do very rarely see him around here. Without revealing anything he said in private, the difference between him and someone I'd consider "more decent" is mostly just that he's /selfish/: he suffered a major hurt in life, and he wants to be part of something that explains /his/ suffering and offers an opportunity to do something about /his/ feelings of powerlessness, rather than about suffering and powerlessness /in general/.

In very short, he suffered a deep, painful loss, and he thinks the theories he's adopted can explain that loss partially away and block off further such losses in the future. I might think that every inference he has drawn from his experiences is wrong, but I can hardly fault him for feeling pain in the circumstances.

The difference of belief that makes me /not want/ to side with him, when he was trying genuinely to convince me of his views, was that I don't believe the Dragon Tyrant can be appeased, and I kinda think he does. Or at least, he thinks he can schedule his turn with death to be "later" in an organized way that benefits him alone, while he thinks that attempts to benefit people in general are naive and in fact counterproductive. I believe the opposite: that security for people in general is the surest way towards security for myself personally.

Nod! To explain a little more, what's weighing me is mostly the thought that, so far as the destruction of our various ecosystems goes, the tightrope that we had to walk was already pretty thin and required that we not mess up.

Except, now we have, and so it doesn't matter that we'll eventually get back on track. I'd feel more hopeful if it were just a matter of pushing through and fixing what broke, but we don't have the time for that, or so my (possibly addled) brain says.

Or more succinctly, I don't disagree that we've faced similar circumstances before, politically, and I'm honestly very optimistic about our ability to repair the situation given the time, it's just that, in the context of climate change, I don't think we have that time, and at best we'll fix the political situation in time for everything else to fall apart on us.

So I'm kind of torn between "The moral thing to do, according to /any/ of the systems that are even a little bit attractive to me, is to keep on trucking and do whatever I can, even if it ultimately won't amount to anything," and "Fuck it, I'm out, I hope I get hit by a car tomorrow because at least then I won't have to see the world burn."

Unfortunately, I cannot reassure you and say that On War is going to be good reading. It certainly had some interesting notes but a lot of chapters contained too specific or too general information for my tastes.

Some points I have carried out:

1. It is useful to know about Napoleonic Wars, Second Punic War and wars of Frederick the Great. Clausewitz provides great in-depth analysis of some battles in these wars.
2. According to Clausewitz, deception is not very effective in warfare. This is why On War can't be the only book to read about war, in my opinion. (This probably comes from his experience, where such methods repeatedly failed him)
3. Sometimes it is possible to glimpse the views of Clausewitz himself from the text. These are, mostly: 'every plan is going to fail somehow' and 'it is impossible to evade war'.

If you (or other subreddit visitors) would like to read something more lightweight on military strategy, please see [[http://l-clausewitz.livejournal.com/][this amazing blog]] for general notes and [[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html]["Stratagems" by Frontinus]] for the specific examples.

Im also extroverted enough that dealing with patients and coworkers is reasonably fun. In support of the latter: I'm impatient to start real/adult life, I have a growing sense of anxiety/excitement that tech is where I should work given that its kind of eating many other fields, and I want to be independent of family and in a new place for a while.

First off, [[https://80000hours.org/][80,000 Hours]] if you haven't seen it already, has some of the best EA-aligned career advice out there. I'd recommend reading up on their career profiles, especially for being a doctor and the stuff on the tech sector.

I think a lot of this has to do with comparative advantage. If you think that you're reasonably better than most other medical candidates, than that may actually be a better bet. A friend of mine, for example, switched from coding to working at an NGO because she felt that her work as a coder was only mediocre.

If you're just interested in some general information on App Academy and doctors, here are the relevant 80K links:

[[https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/][Doctor stuff]]

Emailing some App Academy grads (like Buck) could also be a good preliminary step to see about what sorts of reasoning they had for switching.

Overall, my advice is to get more information from people who know more about these things. A lot of EAs are happy to discuss their reasoning, as well as impact, and I hope this helps you out.

**** Thanks for the links, I'll check it out.

I've used 80000 hours for career advice but found it wasn't too specific: no skills/IQ test or personality inventory that might be helpful in making a decisions. I guess there isn't a ton of good data on career fit, though.
