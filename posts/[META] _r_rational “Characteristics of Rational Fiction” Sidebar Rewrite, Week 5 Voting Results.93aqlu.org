(note that the 'net score' is APPROXIMATE: vote fuzzing is in full effect and if you reload the thread a few times you'll see the vote counts swing back and forth. This is not an actual representation of people currently voting, this is Reddit's anti-bot behavior and means that no one is ever able to truly tell the exact number of votes.)

We can see here a cluster of four submissions within ten votes of each other; I don't know enough about range voting analysis to interpret the results, but at first glance it seems relatively close. There really was a lot of good work put into each of these submissions, and it shows; I applaud each of you who donated your time and talent to putting our collective thoughts into words.

So where do we go from here? As you might suspect from the previous thread schedules, this is as far as I myself planned for, so we're at a bit of a pivot here. I see a few main options:

- Put up new voting threads and narrow selections down further until a more clear winner is reached
- Begin the solution discussion anew with the top four solutions as a baseline
- Run with the top entry and begin iterating on it (or as suggested by [[/u/AlexanderWales]], put the winner up temporarily in the sidebar and begin experimenting with it)
- Something else

Thoughts? Opinions? Critiques? Let 'er rip in the comments below.


** As you might have noticed, I've updated the sidebar to be the winning entry. */This does not preclude further changes./* I'd be fine with people suggesting tweaks, and I'd be fine implementing those changes with or without a vote, depending on how much it changes the core definition. More discussion is welcome, but the bias is now toward what was voted on.

If you were one of the people to submit an entry in the final week, you should have flair now, which is just a little blue shield. If you change your flair, you'll lose the shield. If you had existing text, I left that in place, but if you didn't, you got some text. If you'd like different text for your flair, PM me.

If you'd like some participation flair of your own, let me know; I don't want to exclude people who contributed to discussion but didn't actually submit their own definition. The flair is mostly just a mark that you did the honorable duty of not being a lurker.

** Now that we've got [[/u/Noumero]]'s as the 'winner', I'd like to propose we put in a cycle here to attempt to slim down the word count.

The sidebar should be a brief, high-level overview, and too many words doesn't fulfill that purpose, IMO.

Perhaps what we do, is make a wiki with the full content of the post + references (like links to fics which attempt to exemplify the highlighted traits).

Then, we attempt to shorten each bullet point without losing their meaning, and put /that/ on the sidebar, with a link to the wiki article.

**** I'm going to work on a rewording of the post right now. I'm all for a link to a subreddit wiki article where we post the full content of your proposal though.

Edit: Assuming you haven't read this post yet, here's my tweak of the first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  In "Rational" fiction, a character's intellectual agency is always put above tropes. Characters pursue their goals consistently, and the consequences of their actions are realistic within the world and the story's plot.
#+end_quote

Original:

#+begin_quote
  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

***** Hmm.

#+begin_quote
  a character's intellectual agency
#+end_quote

Shouldn't refer to only "characters". It's meant to apply to background agents as well, to people who don't appear in the story, but whose existence is implied by the worldbuilding. A perfectly-rational story would model them as rational agents as well, which is meant to enforce consistent worldbuilding.

What do you think about this?:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction aims to explore realistic intellectual agency and its consequences on fictional worlds and story plots, valuing it over all other narrative elements.

  All fictional works are "rational" to an extent. /Highly-rational/ fiction could include one or more of the following features:

That having been said, here's how I would shorten it:

#+begin_quote
  "Rationality" describes the extent that a fictional work aims to explore the thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as the consequences of such behaviour on the plot and the world.

  In any genre or setting, highly rational fiction puts intellectual agency over literary tropes and all other narrative elements. It could include one or more of the following features:

****** I like your update, but would tweak it. "realistic intellectual agency" doesn't add anything that just saying "agency" would, other than make the definition more restrictive, imo.

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction aims to explore agency and its consequences on fictional worlds and story plots, valuing it over all other narrative elements.
#+end_quote

For the second bit, I would nix "All fictional works are 'rational' to an extent." Thus, my update of your update:

#+begin_quote

***** This doesn't merely reword but completely omits significant aspects of the definition, like 'thoughtful behaviour', or that the story /explores/ this behaviour and its consequences.

I also feel it goes against the spirit of the definition since one of the aspects of Noumero's definition is that it treats 'rationality' as a quality that can be higher or lower, rather than a specific category.

I would thus vote against the particular tweak.

** I voted for the winner, so my perspective is a little biased, but I don't think I'd want to repeat previous steps. I'm okay with tweaking the winning solution to better fit the sidebar (maybe create a discussion thread for tweak suggestions, with the understanding that the core ideas and concepts are set in stone) or maybe trying to combine the three winners into one compromise solution. And of course, running with what we've got as the winner sounds fine to me.

One last discussion thread for tweaks does sound like a good idea, I think. People with criticisms can make more precise observations now that they're dealing with one solution in specific, and we can try to see if the phrasing can be improved in any way without losing clarity (brevity is important for a sidebar, after all).

The winner is a bit wordy for my taste. But it hits the key notes. And, if nothing else, we should have a bias towards action.

And in the spirit of 'bias towards action,' I'd vote that we give flairs to everyone who put up a well-formed proposal. Even if they didn't win they put up a non-trivial effort. And that should get encouraged.

A month or two from now, we can have a "Suggested Tweaks to the Sidebar" discussion, where people can discuss suggested tweaks, minor or major. Then we can put said specific tweaks to the vote again, (or perhaps some tweaks will be minor enough and uncontroversial enough that if there's no objection from either the community nor Noumero himself, a vote might not even be needed).

** All these threads were kinda a lot of action, and for a relatively low activity user like me it was pretty opaque where and when to come in with my contributions. It would be a big drain and just a lot of action. As a result, I ended up not taking part in this. Probably there weren't a lot of people like this, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, but I may not have been the only one. Overall, it seems not to have mattered as we got a good outcome regardless, but hopefully this feedback helps.

This is not an attempt to shit on [[/u/dwood15][u/dwood15]] or any of the other people who took part in this process, or anything like that, just a personal experience that may be a useful data point for future things like this.
