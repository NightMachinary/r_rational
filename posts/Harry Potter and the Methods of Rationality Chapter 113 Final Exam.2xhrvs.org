***** Interesting, but untrue; Voldemort has the True Horcrux, and can himself arrange to prevent arbitrary deaths. The True Patronus may be the only thing that can reverse death, but since Harry knows that Voldemort has the True Horcrux, he cannot truthfully claim that he alone can prevent death.

The fact that Voldemort is probably unwilling to implement a universal True Horcrux based resurrection system involving sacrificial babies or something in no way diminishes the fact that he could choose to do so.

He can only die now by external factors, which only happen if he allows them or fails to prevent them, i.e. if he makes a stupid mistake that leads to his death. I wholly expect Voldemort to be able to last through the rest of humanity with his current body, due to this, and he could make billions more horcruxes in that time.

****** Agreed. He can, though it's highly likely that he /will/. Hence why I very deliberately chose the word "may". I suppose technically speaking "Mr. Genius is the only one who might pass this test" is technically untrue, but no one would call you a liar for saying it - I don't think parsletongue is that nitpicky. Harry truely does not believe voldemort will set up a universal True Horcrux system or anything of the sort, so the statement isn't a lie. EY would have to settle any debate on semantics. :)

*** Having thought about this, I feel like this whole problem is misdirection, EY has set us up to fail, we don't really have much we can do to solve the problem. We don't have the advantage of controlling Harry in the previous chapters so we can't set anything up to help us. He has a proper solution, he's been working on it for months, we can't recreate that in the matter of days, even with the number of minds on it. I still feel the evidence points to this being misdirection from him.

Your solution is the only one I've come up with and it requires that A, Harry has stolen Snape's wand and when under the invisibility cloak, he partially transfigured the floor to be antimatter (with a time delayed vacuum), killing him means that the vacuum spell gets destroyed and with it, the planet, which leaves voldemort an eternity on the golden plaques since the resurrection stone is destroyed on earth.

As killing Harry is akin to eternal solitude for LV, he knows Harry must be allowed to live. Harry doesn't want to do it, but precommits to the action in order to ensure LV doesn't kill him. It makes sense for Harry to have done something by this point, and this does not betray LV as it will amount to nothing if they part ways amicably.

** So, Harry has his wand and absolutely nothing else, with 60 seconds before his imminent death (unless he starts sharing with Voldemort). What capabilities does he have?

- Partial transfiguration
- Command over Dementors
- Knowledge of science
- Buying time with explanations
- Patronus 2.0
- Retrospective time travel

For partial transfiguration, this takes a long time to set up, as referenced in the whole Azkaban arc. I have a hard time imagining a circumstance in which he used that 60 seconds to both stall his death AND partially transfigure something, without Voldie catching on and killing him.

There are no Dementors anywhere nearby, and I have no idea whether or not it would be possible to partially transfigure something into a Dementor.

If Harry wants to buy time to explain things, the more complicated and nonmagical the better. Explaining partial transfiguration would probably take the longest. We've already seen that Parseltongue is extremely limited in vocabulary, so to have Harry explain would probably take a very long time. Voldie could, however, just have Harry list whatever texts he used to teach himself, then kill Harry and read them himself.

As for science-y things, we've already discussed about how hard it would be to partially transfigure air into things like antimatter. As much as I'd love to see him turn the earth under his feet into antimatter specifically targeted to the area immediately underneath each Death Eater, I don't know if that's possible given the radical non-homogeneity of earth and the focus/concentration it would take to extend/make antimatter without it immediately annihilating absolutely everything nearby.

We've seen how the Patronus 2.0 can be used to restart a dead person. If Harry casts a Patronus 2.0, and Voldie tries to kill him, can Harry just have his Patronus go inside him like he did with Hermione, and keep himself alive that way? I need to think on this more.

Will continue to update this list of capabilities and ideas as I re-read, but final exams on Friday mean that I won't get to work on this as much as I want :(

*** I see two ways harry might play this out. First one is for Harry to convince Voldemort he needs or wants to learn partial transformation. The second one is to remind Voldemort that Dumbledore seemingly was present at two locations at once. Here it is key to suggest that the mirror might be involved as the facilitator of this and not a time turner.

*The Partial Transformation Way*

We would like Harry to aim for both him to explain and do a practical demonstration. If successful Harry will have bought himself some more time while he explains how partial transformation works and why it is so hard to do. Secondly by allowing Harry to show a practice Harry obtains a chance of doing magic without being killed by all of the Death Eaters surrounding him.

Now I see two things Harry could transform which could be effective. One is a ball of fusion the other a black hole. Given we do not know the exact limits of transformation this might be a stretch, yet there are a whole lot of things which points towards it being possible.

First off a fusion reaction requires a whole lot of pressure besides heat. The pressure itself can by my understanding itself ignite a fusion reaction. Now how we produce that pressure could be interesting. I don't see creating pressure from outside pressing in to the the solution. Rather manipulating gravity would probably be the best solution. Also making the field where gravity is manipulated small should make things easier power requirement wise.

Having the fusion reactions close to Voldemort would incinerate him from the heat alone or at least damage him enough to kill his body. If not the heat the radiation produced by the heat would achieve similar results.

If Harry is shielded by Voldemort he should have a chance of surviving instant death and then surviving the whole ordeal if we bet Granger wakes from being exposed to the same attack. She would not die from the attack and be able to provide Harry with some healing.

The black hole would work much like the ball of fusion as if it is created close enough to Voldemort he would be sucked in and his body would be destroyed. The same would be true for the Death Eaters. The problem with this plan is Harry would need to secure himself first which might be hard to explain.

Being able to make in practice small suns and black holes might also be enough to foreshadow how Harry could possible end the wold. Though defeating death seems like a better guess.

Now Voldemort would probably ask Harry questions to make sure of his intentions which Harry should be able to answer truthfully by being smart about it.

The whole point of the answers would be to subtly misdirect Voldemort's attention. Let us say Voldemort asks "Will you try to kill me?" just to make it as hard as possible to make a response as possible. A passable answer could be "I am not going to try and kill you with this transformation." This of course requires Harry to be able to view destroying Voldemort's body as not killing him. It would require Harry to think of Voldemort not as spirit and body unified, rather as Voldemort only being a spirit.

I will try to get back to this answer later, I have no more time to write atm :(

** How good is he at partial transfiguration that this point? The stone opens up some self-transfiguration options.

You can transfigure a duck without knowing how a duck works...

So transfigure a copy of your brain over top of voldemorts (and then get shot a bunch). Transfigure a copy into the ground? It couldn't have magic and would quickly die when your soul flees. Probably. I doubt that the solution is going to have something with such a high failure rate.

Hmm. Use it to kill everyone somehow? The answer "Transfigure everyone presents spinal fluid into francium" seems a bit silly. If the answer is "Use my magic to kill everyone" I'll be suprised, and anything that is fast enough to work in this situation would be pretty deus-ex-machina-ey.

EY has presumably already written this, and it has a lot of parrelels to the AI box experement. Evidence that the solution is going to be talking and not much else. Knowing that you're saying the truth should be considered and advantage (and truth is one of the assumption made in the AI box game).

"The air is filled with carbon nanotubes. Everyone here will die if you make the transiguration permanent, and they will die of transfiguration sickness if you don't. Only I have the power to save them, and I doubt you could learn the skill in time, presuming you did manage to convince me to teach you.".

Of course producing enough carbon nanotubes that people would die of transfiguration sickness if it wore off....

Still, not something I think would save you. Just buy some time.

It's a gamble, there's no guarantee that Hermione will succeed in accomplishing anything before being restrained and the odds are in fact against her (not as badly as they are against Harry, but still), but I certainly don't have a better plan. It's even possible that Voldemort will hold off on murdering Harry at least while he figures out the implications for the prophecy (such as the possibility that the revived Hermione is the prophesied one instead of Harry, and murdering Harry in front of her will cause the prophecy to come true), which gives time to implement other plans as well.

This isn't just one of his deeper schemes to let Harry escape and fake is defeat etc. I think he's intending on extracting as many secrets as he can from Harry and killing him. He's too afraid that Harry will fulfill the prophecy and destroy the world.

Harry will have to use partial transfiguration in order to escape. Maybe he can transfigure carbon nanotubes threads or something from the air and impale stab everyone in the brain or something.

*** If Harry hasn't shown Quirrelmort the nature of partial transfiguration yet then that is certainly a good opener. At the very least due to its complex nature it'll take time to explain, especially if he originally answers in Parseltongue which seems to have a lot of syntactic constraints.

The question is does he just use that to buy time or does the partial transfiguration itself have the potential to serve as an immediate offensive measure against 36 death eaters and QM? Maybe he could transfigure something into antimatter, but then the question is how does he escape the ensuing blast?

As much as this entire scenario is Mr. Yudkowsky's handiwork in trying to force us into a situation with so many restraints we can only collaborate to think our way out, I think too that that's the motive of Voldemort himself, to force Harry into a spot where he really has to prove himself as V's equal.

*** As demonstrated through Partial Configuration, some magic (notable, the only form on wordless magic Harry has seen the "inside" of) functions with "consensus reality" effects. That is, by changing his mind about what reality is, Harry was able to do something new.

This demonstrates one Harry ability, and one Nature of Reality:

- Harry can change his consensus reality effects
- Consensus reality matters

Given that we also have a stack of evidence that there is a poor correspondence between even /brains/ and self, I'm thinking it's worth exploring Consensus Reality rules that, if discarded, open up possibilities.

** After a moment of panic, it struck me. Carefully phrasing my words in Parseltongue, I asked a question. "What happens, Tom Riddle, when another Tom Riddle dies, enters the Horcrux network, and the dead Tom Riddle happens to be able to both control Dementors and cast an advanced form of Patronus that does not require a wand?"

I paused. "If you kill me, I win. If you don't kill me, you will eventually lose. You have been very careful to provide a bribe to me to let you live, so the threat of killing me is clearly misdirection. You know you cannot kill me without me destroying your Horcrux network, and you have provided me with a living Hermione to keep me attached to life."

"However, now I am at a strange point. It makes a great deal of sense that I should kill myself now, and use the Patronus casting to consume the life energy within the Horcrux network until there is only one Horcrux left, and then get assistance in raising myself. I could do that easily enough with a Patronus."

"Perhaps, you might do something for me to prevent me from killing myself so I can end your threat? Confund yourself to learn to care about people. Then use the Philosopher's stone to make it permanent, and finally, vow to never attempt to alter the Confunding."

EDIT ADD - I already used my response to the chapter over at Fanfiction.net for a different suggestion. If this seems plausible to someone, feel free to take it, make it yours, and post it over there if you like.

Has he been shown to have read something about Apparition? In particular, those words? If so, that's a feasible plan, and might be attempted... but I can't recall any such incident, and thus doubt the possibility.

That said, the fact that the Death Eaters Apparated in does not imply that there is no Anti-Disapparition Jinx in effect. Even though Harry is not known to be able to Apparate, it's the kind of thing that'd be a sensible precaution for Voldemort to have put in place.

It'd be better than dying, but it'd be unwise for Harry to spend his minute trying to figure out Apparition from mere reference to the process. It's not a terrible plan, particularly since he could go straight for his Time Turner if it worked, but there are probably better ones.

** how do you do the impossible? by knowing why it's impossible, then making one or more of those parameters untrue.

- escape is impossible because we cannot travel the distance required anywhere near as quickly as our captors (note: I say "our" as we, collectively are taking the roles of voices in harry's head, like the much-used griffindor, ravenclaw, slitheren, etc.)

- negotiation is impossible because the opponent is smarter than us, and believes we are a credible existential threat

- combat is impossible because we are outmanned, outgunned, and in the case of quirrel (he'll always be quirrel to us) outskilled.

also, why are we naked? it makes no sense for us to be naked. if you're going to give us a wand, give us some pants! -shakes fist-

possible attack vectors:

- make quirrel less intelligent. a whispered confundus seems almost mandatory for any solution, as a more intelligent opponent would think of anything we could think of, and counter it. possibly purposely botched memory charm?

- make ourselves seem like a non-credible threat

- make ourselves seem like not a threat.

- incapacitate riddle, use new intelligence advantage to fight remaining deatheaters.

- gain speed advantage for escape? rocket broom again? tough to fight apparation...

I think obliviation is our best bet. let's take a moment to talk about it- it's been mentioned as possibly *the* most overpowered spell several times over the course of the series. exactly what limits does it have? could we, say, give quirrel false memories of the prophesy he heard? alter his memories enough to fundamentally change his personality? turn him against his own deatheaters?

** Alright here's my best go at a plan:

tl;dr: it's partial transfiguration, stall with diplomacy through talking about dyson spheres, activate hermione, and various contingencies if the above fail.

Stall tactic 0: can begin this plan even as the very long oath-swearing was taking place

Stall tactic 1: Don't even use up all the 60 seconds; shouldn't be necessary, and don't want to make voldemort suspicious.

Stall/Diplomacy tactic 2: /there iss a threat to thiss world that will ssomeday kill every sentient being in the universe, and you and hermione will not be sspared. I wissh to tell you of it, and my planss to avert it./

Stall tactic 3: /I need to conssult with Hermione before I give dangerouss information to immortal Dark Lord./ (If Voldie is skeptical, warn him that Harry has no idea what the apocalypse is, and so caution is still necessary)

PLAN HERMIONE: Get her awake and informed as much as possible.

Stall/Diplomacy tactic 4: tell of his prophecy from firenze that he'd cause all the stars to disappear and he'd be innocent, then tell one possible explanation - how it's been his ambition to spread across the galaxy building dyson spheres

Stall tactic 5 (should be unnessary): give secrets if necessary. Dementors, muggle sciences, threat of AI, threat of bioterrorism, order of the phoenix, secrets about hogwarts.

.

While we've been stalling: partial transfiguration of any sort of channel down his leg or down Mr Grim's wand and body etc, underground, underneath every Death Eater and underneath voldemort. Tip it with a large quantity of C4. Make sure it's on a hair trigger he'd just need to release.

.

PLAN A: please let's all be buddy buddy and fight off death together.

PLAN THREAT: /Prophessy suggessts I will ssucceed. There iss no guarantee you will be around for it. Do you want to live in thiss world, or not?/ [On second thought, skip plan threat. Too risky. Go straight to Plan B.]

PLAN B: BOOM.

PLAN C: Stuporfy vs voldemort. He can't block it anyways, and a dodge might not work.

PLAN D: "Destination, Determination, Deliberation!" He's never apparated before, and it's crazy dangerous, but there's nothing saying it's outside his magical capacities. We haven't seen him read how, but the three Ds have to be the wizarding equivalent of "gas pedal to go, break pedal to stop". GTFO.

PLAN HERMIONE. She's smart, powered-up, and has had several minutes by now to adjust and plan on her own.

PLAN F: antimatter. Rocks fall, everybody dies. Hermione, Voldemort, and maybe Harry if he's lucky (as another Tom Riddle) respawn, regroup at a severe disadvantage.
