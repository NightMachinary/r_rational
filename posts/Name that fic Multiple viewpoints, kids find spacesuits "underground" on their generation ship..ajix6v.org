I recall reading a story maybe a year ago that had a lot of different viewpoints going on at once. Unfortunately most of them blend together in my head with other stories. One part stands out, where some kids on a generation ship or ringworld or similar find some spacesuits and a way to get outside the ship and see space while on a tether. I think I lost track of it after a few chapters and never picked it back up, and now I can't remember the title.

Anyone remember that story?


** You're probably thinking of [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/][Sideways in Hyperspace]], which was also posted on [[/r/HFY]]. The parts that you mention are in chapters 8 and 12.

** Right, and there were also some first contact stories going on at the same time, right?

Aha! Some clever googling turns up [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/][Sideways in Hyperspace]].

*** Nice find. It was gearing up to be really good. I liked all the characters and the premise was sufficiently mind-blowing.

** Sideways in hyperspace, it was really good, it's too bad it hasn't been updated in more than one year
