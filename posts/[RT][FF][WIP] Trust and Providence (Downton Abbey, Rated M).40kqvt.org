** Hey, this is quite well written.

Don't trust the sidebar or the vote count too much :) What gets the most upvotes are are things that are good stories in a certain sort of "hard sf/f" genre, often by authors familiar to and/or with this online community. It does help if your protagonist ignores story conventions, or is a munchkin, or models thinking skills for the audience, but these are hardly mandatory.

So in some sense, this is obviously not a "[[/r/rational]] fic," because it isn't the right genre. I bet most people on here haven't even read a single Jane Austen novel.

The thing it really has going for it is the whole "characters ignoring genre conventions" part - starting a story with characters being honest with each other is, ceteris paribus, rationalist catnip. Sometimes you also do a good job showing us characters using sensible thinking processes, which is my main internal criterion for actually thinking of something as "rational fic." I don't think you quite make it all the way to that bar in the couple of chapters I've read, but neither do most stories on here, so whatever.

*** Great points! Yes, I think Jane Austen basically invented the "rational romance" genre, since her work was largely in the context of / in response to the Sir Walter Scott style melodramatic Gothic romances that were very popular in that era.

The topic of "sensible thinking processes", when discussing human psychology and sociology, is a rather complex (and yes, fuzzy) topic. I'd agree with your assessment that I haven't made either of my main characters the epitome of emotionless, purely logical thought. Like any strong characters, they've got backstories, contradictory drives (i.e., physical, emotional), and inherited belief systems that make for an interesting mix of external behaviors. One of them is a lawyer, so he's a bit more internally consistent, trained in logic, and self-aware in his thinking, but he's also a human being, not a robot, and he's a person of strong faith in a Christian worldview, so that adds layers, some of which might not be perceived as "sensible", depending on the reader. :)

***** Good point. But emotions often war with rational thinking, don't they? Unless someone is very self-aware and exercises a great deal more self-control than the average sort of person.

My aim was "to show actual believable humans getting to something like a right answer, via something like a good process," so I'm intrigued by the fact that you don't think I really achieved that. Looks like I have a lot more room to grow, then. :)

** Hmm. I skimmed the first chapter, I think it's a bit of a stretch for [[/r/rational]].

I did find it interesting that people are fucking and proposing on the very first chapter, especially considering the 400k words that follow. I don't read the genre at all, but my impression is that the smart play in romance is to tease things out over a suitable period of time, with the inevitable and much anticipated crotch-rendezvous providing something of a catharsis for the reader. Is that not the case?

*** Ooh, interesting. Why do you think this is a stretch for a rational fic? According to the characteristics of rational fiction listed to the right, my story emphatically qualifies. (Note: it's not a /rationalist/ fic, as there is the inclusion of a supernatural element. Although the supernatural element rarely, if ever, has a material effect on the plot; it's not a deus ex machina device. It's just another input in the characterization.) I know my fic is primarily family drama / romance / historical, but I would think the qualities that make a story rational could apply to any genre.

Just a note: no one is fucking in the very first chapter. They're just kissing.

Yes, the average, obvious play in the romance genre is to waste oodles of time on a will-they-or-won't-they scenario, with a final proposal or marriage at the end. So overdone. In my own experience of dating and marriage, dating is the shallowest part of the relationship. The real interesting stuff happens when you're in a committed relationship for the long haul and you have to deal with life, with each other (warts and all), with things like illness and raising a family and navigating the in-laws, etc.

Since this is a /Downton Abbey/ fic that covers 1914-1971 (the first three novels are complete, and the fourth and final novel will be starting up soon), the story is about a fascinating and turbulent period of history, as refracted through the marriage of two particular characters, one of whom is a pragmatist and the other of whom is a moral idealist (which is true to their canon portrayals). Their philosophical conflicts drive much of their interactions. I take a much more rational approach to the plotting, characterization, and historical accuracy of the story than the equivalent portion of the TV show does.

There are multiple crotch-rendezvous happening, given that they're married for decades, but all of the sex scenes have a purpose that goes beyond mere sex. I don't waste anybody's time just writing hot sex scenes for no reason.

I also don't waste time separating them with contrived and unbelievable plot devices, and there are no human villains in this story. The antagonistic forces all arise from the characters' personalities and from the medical, political, and economic forces of the historical period.

**** Supernatural elements hardly preclude rationality, see: HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, Team Anko, To the Stars, Ra, see: almost every rationalist fic ever.

I don't follow Downton Abbey or even know what it is in story or genre in the slightest. Is it necessary for the fic?

***** True, you can be rational in a universe with supernatural elements, but I don't consider my story a rationalist fic because I don't try to demystify those elements in my fic using rationalist or scientific methods, and it's not an exemplar of rationalist techniques. Those elements are just assumed to be there, and they function in a way that illuminates the characters' psychology. There is a certain degree of puzzle-solving, in the sense that if you're familiar with the show and you think for a bit about my AU premise, you'll probably see where the fic is headed. Of course, the question then becomes: is the trip still worth it? I don't generally write with the intention of dropping bombshells on my readers, but rather with the intention of provoking clear thought about the psychology and dynamics of the situations that the characters find themselves in. And, if I get it right, with emotional resonance as well.

You don't need to have seen /Downton Abbey/, or be familiar with the characters, situation, or genre of historical romance to be able to follow this fic (although of course knowledge of all those things adds a dimension to the experience). It probably helps to have a rough familiarity with that period of Western history (i.e., when WWI and WWII happened). One of my beta readers, who has been with me since the beginning, has never seen the TV show and doesn't intend to, as far as I know. She's helped me make sure this story can stand on its own two legs.

***** Oh, wait: is it an unspoken assumption of rational fiction that the story posits a universe with a supernatural system in it? As in, can a fic that only describes a universe that bears a strong resemblance to our reality, with its general lack of provable supernatural elements, be considered rational for the purposes of this subreddit?

******** Basically, the rationalists have already optimized our set of physical laws. We have pushed raw physics to the limit and developed amazing technologies. There aren't a bunch of low-hanging fruit in modern society for a rationalist main character to pick up / use / do. That being said, you can still write suck a work set in our reality, it's just not obviously easy.

A rational version of Naruto is easy because you just say "well, let's really think about this set of rules" which nobody ever did when writing Naruto. You find exploits and patch them or abuse them and it comes out looking sharp.

In our reality, though, people spend TONS of time thinking "let's really think about this set of rules" and then they develop MIMO communication or make transistors a bit better or decide to codify a set of laws that allows for trials of a certain kind or something. This has already been done a lot, see?

So Rational fics set in our reality need to be more clever and subtle to get the same thing across. They still exist and they're great, but for a beginning writer (like me) it's easier to have a supernatural element and say "well, what would people rationally do here" since I can pick low-hanging fruit.

E: all that being said, I'm a downton abbey fan, and I'll check this fic out despite the intimidating word count

********* Ah, I see what you mean. Yeah, my fic isn't a thought experiment that explores the natural laws of our reality. It's a thought experiment that explores human psychology, both individual and in group dynamics, set in a specifically-identifiable period of human history. I have a lot of fun exploiting the spaces that Julian Fellowes left in /Downton Abbey/ (and there are many). Logic applied in a different dimension of existence.

So you guys normally like discussing the rules of science fiction and fantasy systems, not the humanities?

If you want me to delete this post, I will. I also recommend that the mods consider tightening up the definition of "rational fiction" for the purposes of this subreddit, so people like me don't stumble in. :)

*********** As [[/u/Charlie___]] has pointed out, Jane Austen (particularly her /Pride and Prejudice/) is a great example of rational thought applied to sociology and psychology. And it's a very tight, relatively brief novel. Definitely worth your time!

My favorite Jane Austen quote is: "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition." ― from /Sense and Sensibility/

**** You make good points. Maybe not so much a stretch as a hard sell, then. I think it would be difficult to take any non-genre fiction and make it appealing to this sub, let alone a period melodrama. Which isn't to say you shouldn't have submitted it, I might very well be wrong.

***** Thanks for making me consider the group's aims, though, and ask questions about whether this story is a good fit. This has been an interesting discussion for me, helping me to better understand how the rational-fiction community defines itself. I only discovered you all a week or so ago, although everything that the community seems to advocate are things that I have long loved in a good story. My degrees are in computer science, and I can't bear dumb fiction with obvious plot holes and a general lack of deep examination. The movies Inception (omg, recursion!) and Interstellar (omg, circular logic and a totally implausible abuse of information theory!---although the robot designs were awesome) drove me a bit mad. And don't even get me started on Independence Day. :)

Unfortunately, period melodrama (particularly fanfic period melodrama) is rife with irrationality and cheap devices. Writing something that the reader can logically follow from A to B without contrivances is unusual in this domain.

Note: I don't consider T&P to be melodrama (i.e., over-the-top drama, with exaggerated emotions and unbelievable plot developments or characterizations), but I have instead gone out of my way to make it as realistic and truly dramatic as possible, demystifying much of the melodrama in canon and replacing it with something that has more true resonance. Maybe that's the key difference between drama and melodrama: drama is rational, melodrama is just ridiculous, heightened contrivances to milk readers' / viewers' emotions.

I like pushing boundaries in intelligent ways, which is what you guys seem to like doing, too. Felt like my tribe, even if I'm not playing with scifi and fantasy systems in this particular fic.
