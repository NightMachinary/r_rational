** Interesting so far. Worlds with set roles and levels are common around here, and while this definitely has a distinct voice already, I look forward to seeing how it differentiates itself from the others with similar-seeming mechanical underpinnings.

** I'm interested in seeing where this is going, which will probably determine how I feel about the work as a whole. Thus far, I'm getting /Divergent/ vibes, though with a more litRPG basis to it. That's not necessarily bad, but it really depends on execution.

*** Hello, author of Paragon here. Thank you for your thoughts. This story is based loosely on litRPG mechanics, but I'm hoping it doesn't come off too level-up focused. The story isn't defined by the mechanics, but they will play a large role.

Also, big fan of your work. I look forward to when you release updates.

** I wish there was a third chapter. This is definitely the sort of thing I could binge
