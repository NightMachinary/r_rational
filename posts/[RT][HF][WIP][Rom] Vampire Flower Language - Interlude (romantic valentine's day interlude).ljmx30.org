** There's a question mark because it's maybe not the type of romance people were hoping for?

This interlude is thanks to a discussion with [[/u/ccc_037]] who constantly chided me to include more senses than just sight in my writing. As a result, I thought about how humans and vampires might seem different in terms of different senses. This interlude echos a scene in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/46647706][Chapter 5]].

** Just picked up and caught up with this story in the past day or so, and I love it so far. You've captured my favorite thing about mysteries in literature, where I find myself inferring and guessing facts about the greater vampire society based off the snippets we get from william and the interlude characters. I ALSO am a big fan of the romance, it's affirming as all hell. Not enough thoughtful, emotionally mature relationships in this particular genre, so finding one in VFL (that's the main thread of the story, no less!) made me smile ðŸ˜Š.

Keep up the good work, I'm eagerly awaiting more chapters!

oh goodness that's such a wonderful thing!! I am so eager to hear your guesses, but regardless I'm glad the writing is making you think about them!

Let me tell you, I wanted so badly to write a romance where there's conflict/etc but where the characters are being emotionally mature and making honest attempts to communicate well.

I also wanted to write something a bit different than the usual [[/r/rational]] fare, something in a genre more traditionally associated with women rather than the sci fi/fantasy/superhero stuff.

Thank you! Unless the story undergoes sudden and huge expansion in number of chapters (I realised the other day that instead of two chapters worth of content remaining, there's three), it'll be finished about six months from now. I hope the ending is worthy of the emotional energy people seem to be investing into it!
