**** Good Earth-evening,

I am known by my people as War Prince Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul, and I come to you with the gravest of news. Beggars are despised in the eyes of the Elimist (praise be upon him), but I do not write for my own sake and tonite the fate of the very galaxy may be at stake. Due to an attack by vicious Yeerk slavers, my ship has take damage and crashes landed on a planet. In my possession is a secret artifact vitally important to the war against Yeerkish tyranny. This artifact has ancient powers beyond your imagination so I dare not describe more here. It must not be allowed to fall into their grasp, lest all be lost. I require a mere 100,000,000,000,000 barrels supply of your Earth petroleum in order to refuel and repair my ship, as well as may be a few tons of assorted metals for electronic. I shall refine all necessary plastics myself, in order to minimize the burdens I must place upon you and the time of repair.

Please hurry, as even now Yeerk fighters are searching for my position. The price is very low, compared to the costs of freedom. Generosity finds its own rewards in the universe's time. Delay not, or we are all doomed.

Your hopeful freind,

Prince Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul, son of Noorlin-Sirinial-Cooraf and Forlay-Esgarrouth-Maheen, belovid war hero, defender of the Andalite homeworld and freedoms throughout the universe, etc.

****** I am very happy to get this offer and compliment, thanks so much! I really do love your work in this fic. You rock!

I would be willing to do so, but I don't want to "steal" your story at all since I love seeing you work with it, and also I don't think I have nearly enough skill as a writer. I will be happy to continue spitballing ideas your way, however. If I ever get the urge to write down a few paragraphs that might actually be usable, I will send them to you. Also, I am willing to be a full-fledged beta reader for you, if you want. I almost do this anyway, seems like, so might as well make it official.

I might not have reliable computer access in the next couple weeks, however, since the casing on the dumb Toshiba laptop I've been using broke yesterday and needs to be repaired. I'll try to send you a PM soon on some ideas I was playing with last night, regardless.

** Even though I glanced at other comments before reading the chapter, I did NOT see this ending coming. And now Tobias doomed all the humans to death by quantum virus. Yeaaaaah !!! (okay, probably not)

Otherwise, I wonder who the two next updates are going to feature. I hope we get to see someone new. The best parts of Animorphs were the host/yeerk POVs, and I really want to know about yeerk culture and how they deviate from canon.

And finally, a question for the author : are the animorphs going to meet the governor soon ? A major theme of the 'fic is how pressed for time the kids are, so they should try to coordinate with the military as soon as possible.

**** Sad face.

As far as governments handling secret aliens invasions go, I thought Parasyte had a very fresh take on the subject. The government figure out that aliens are invading pretty early (makes sense, they're not exactly subtle about it) and decide to cover it up as long as they can. In the meanwhile, they study the parasytes, learn their weaknesses, figure out methods to detect them, and by the time they confront them, it's a (somewhat two-sided) slaugther, and the military wins quickly.

I'm ashamed to admit that I rushed through reading this one in the hopes that Erek would be reviving Jake at the end, in a "what's going on elsewhere" epilogue. Guess I'll have to wait for the 16th.

**** I'm mostly just shocked because based on what I thought I understood, "checking" should have happened automatically, whether they did it on purpose or not. The Andilite form they use to open it is also the one they use to detect it, after all. I didn't actually think it didn't occur to them to check it. ...Although in retrospect that would be a valid interpretation of what I remember reading, huh.

*** Well, while what you suggest is commendably prudent, it's not that obvious. I mean, they were looking for an alien pod, they found something that looks a lot like an alien pod in the area they know it was in, and it's not like shipping companies spend their time dropping alien-looking ovoids in the ocean to trick foolish teenagers with attitude.

Though it could have been a decoy pod set to explode in case it was found by the yeerks, with no way do differentiate it from a real one without andalite telepathy.

***** My take on it:

You're an Andalite. You know you're on a planet with a Yeerk presence, and the presence of humans, who you probably know lack the technology to find you.

When a couple of humans with Andalite morphing technology find you, what's more likely? Some Andalite gave humans morphing technology, AND they managed to somehow find you when their only hint could have been advanced alien sensors or a message keyed only to Elfangor?

Or that the Yeerks have found the pod (whether by infesting Elfangor or with Alloran's tech), and sent Controllers to grab you and turn you into one of them?

Why would you stick around to find out?

So, naturally, you head into space. The Yeerks may still be able to hunt you down, but at least then they're much more likely to have to kill you to stop you in space, and we know the canon Andalites are willing to kill themselves in order to avoid infestation.

** Typo thread !

- There should be a separator between <Then we find a deserted island> and "Okay, let's go over it one more time"

- In chapter 5 (the first Tobias chapter), Cassie makes a list of dogs they could use to sniff out controllers. Then "Guys," Rachel called out, interrupting Marco mid-rant. "We could use a German sheperd to sniff them out." -> I think a line from Marco has been omitted here.

** Awe yes! You're using the art I made!

The ending was surprising. Why did the pod blast off into space after sending a distress signal? It could apparently handle rapid atmospheric movement but not operate in water? It seems odd that a escape pod couldn't handle a water landing. Something's not quite right here; this pod is not behaving like I expect an escape pod to behave.

** Heyo [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]],

Just wanted to check in and say I'm really diggin' your fic, here. It's just as good as published stuff out there; I just finished reading Brandon Sanderson's fairly popular Mistborn trilogy, and r!Animorphs: The Reckoning is stronger imo.

Also, in case it's of interest to you, I haven't actually read any Animorphs books, despite having had a handful on my shelf growing up. I get the sense that most of your readers have read the original series. I'm clearly not getting any of the references to the original series, but I have a perspective on whether or not the fic makes sense for someone who is unfamiliar with it. It has all been clear so far!

Keep up the awesome work. I really appreciate your contribution to the rapidly growing body of quality rational fiction.

Cheers,
