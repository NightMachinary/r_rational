**** One Punch Man palette-swapped so that all references to physical capability or violence have been replaced with hacking/programming jokes.

As a Unix systems engineer, it was fun to see a few references to utilities and methodologies we use in the real world (shoutouts to grep, awk, gdb, python etc), but I have to agree there's very little about this one that makes it RT or even RT-ADJ.

I'll say one positive thing about it, which is that I enjoy the treatment of "programming as a muscle" insofar as /yes/ practice is truly the only way to learn...

But that's kinda as far as it goes. "MY CODE ALWAYS COMPILES ON THE FIRST TRY" is a silly fun superpower but also in real programming, errors are a huge part of the computer's way of telling you what's /really/ going on with your code.

Failures and errors are part of a conversation you have with a machine. But that can't be explored in this fic because Saitama just gets everything right the first time.

So yeah. Silly, fun. Nonrational.

Edit: if you enjoyed One Compile Man but hunger for something meatier, I recommend [[http://thecodelesscode.com/contents][The Codeless Code]]. It's largely about the philosophy of programming and is fairly educational. (Anthology series of vignettes, not an overarching plot. Some mild worldbuilding.)

***** To be fair, physical combat is also presented as a conversation in anime/manga, usually a debate of the philosophies of the combatants - and part of the point of "One Punch Man" is that because Saitama just always wins with one punch, he doesn't get to do that and is bummed about it.

***** I mean, while I agree there doesn't really seem to be anything to this one to make it "rational" or even adjacent, I'm not sure I agree that the lack of realism in terms of capability itself disqualifies it. If, for example, the story were to realistically explore how people would actually respond to an inhumanly competent programmer, I'd say that could qualify as rational.

******* The most obvious approach, IMO, is to make the protagonist (or one of the protagonists) a third party rather than the overpowered coder themself, and turn it into a mystery story, trying to find out the identity of the coder, what they're trying to accomplish and why they can do the things they can do. Which of course this story does quite a bit of, but they were clearly going for style and humor over rationality, which isn't necessarily a bad thing IMO.

**** up to "Bang sat down at Nakamura's desk and opened his laptop" and I haven't seen any technobabble, believe it or not this is all /very real stuff/ being mentioned, so I don't particularly have confidence in this assessment, but obviously I might have to update on that later

EDIT: Okay, after having finished there was /no/ technobabble, all of the technical language used are absolutely real things, and obviously the achievements here are over-the-top but still ultimately grounded in reality in /some/ respect, there's no terms being made up to sound impressive or techy or anything, but it's obviously absurd in the standard way

**** Hard disagree. Sure, it's not in the subreddit rules, but it's a bit of a common courtesy here.

Enough people do it and it's not some immense barrier to post. I would prefer if whenever someone recommends something to actually explain why it's relevant to the rational subreddit, instead of just doing a drive-by posting. Summaries aren't enough; I want to know why it's a /rational/ recommendation.

** Not exactly rational but it was entertaining. Definitely drives home the sheer absurdity of powers that make x skill infallible!

Code that's magically written to handle circumstances outside of specifications, and the vast amount of intelligence/problem solving involved is so much less believable to me than canon one punch man! I do think the happy ending missed the point though, Saitama was still never challenged and King was still claiming unearned credit. Missed the themes of the characters and didn't line up with the story in my opinion.

*** Thanks for the comments! Just my opinion as the author: when I adapt / remix other works, I'm not committed to keeping all the themes and characters absolutely identical to the originals (e.g., in my Rick and Morty posts from a while back, Rick and Morty aren't /quite/ like they are in canon, either). My opinion on Saitama is that his true power is almost literally plot armor - no matter what happens, he will always have a successful counter, and that's just how it is in the OPM universe. He's depressed that he is never challenged. Here, he also faces that, but the combination of all the stuff he had to do still exhilarated him and pushed his limits, and also he felt good helping King. So he ends the day fairly satisfied, though this may not be permanent for him. As for King, well, I just thought it was funny. My version of Saitama doesn't care whether King gets the credit in the end. Anyway, that's just what was going through my head while writing.

**** Great points, I didn't really get Saitama enjoying helping King, between Saitama's seeming indifference and King calling him a dolt at the beginning, and Saitama's comment of "I defeated you 10 minutes ago..." distracted me from smiling at the challenge. Rereading it I can definitely see Saitama enjoyed the challenge of Boros, and the time crunch from King was challenging.

Awesome story by the way, thank you for writing it!

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Three years ago, he got into coding just for fun. Now, unbeknownst to all but a few, Saitama is the world's strongest coder, capable of writing flawless, bug-free code on the first try, regardless of the application. Growing increasingly bored, Saitama seeks ever greater coding challenges. Meanwhile, can his coworkers at Hero Corp. outwit the devious hacker working for their competitor, Monsters Inc.?

But really, Saitama's going to have a lot more AIs to contend with in the near future. You can't just drop an efficient, constructive P=NP proof on the world and expect business to keep running as usual.
