[[https://chaossnek.com/Story][Prologue (1/2)]] ~9k words.

This is the first of two prologue chapters for an upcoming quest to be hosted on Sufficient Velocity. A bit of a preview more than anything; this is intended to provide a some backstory, setting/worldbuilding exposition, and character introductions to inform the first player choice following Chapter 1 (i.e. - choosing a character). Due to the nature of the work and the setting, we (myself and co-QM Radvic) thought this necessary to avoid dumping players into a wholly unfamiliar world with little information other than "it's loosely based on LoZ," while also respecting player agency.

Many thanks to eaglejarl and Velorien; their work on Marked for Death is what inspired me to start this project almost two years ago. I highly recommend MfD if you haven't read it.

Hope you enjoy. Any feedback is appreciated! :)

** I'm very excited to participate in this! = )

Will there be worldbuilding lore we the players will likely never ever find out?

*** Probably. That said, there's a hell of a lot of lore and history, and 100% of it will be open to ya'll, so long as you can figure out how to get at it.

*** u/Hidden-50:
#+begin_quote
  not much was visible save for other guard towers and a few dozen islands of light along the walkways and walls
#+end_quote

save for -> safe for (?)

#+begin_quote
  Raolin stirred next to him, scratching as his chest.
#+end_quote

as -> at

#+begin_quote
  He tried to hide it, but not before Raolin saw.
#+end_quote

(hmm, that sounds like "he didn't try until his uncle saw". You mean he didn't manage to hide it in time, right?)

#+begin_quote
  perhaps she should find reason end the meeting sooner rather than later
#+end_quote

find reason -> find reason to / find a reason to

#+begin_quote
  â€œAll those times. if Father only knew
#+end_quote

**** "save for" is valid usage and means "except for". The "not before Raolin saw" is also valid, indicating that his attempt didn't happen before Raolin saw (at which point it was too late). The other two do look like errors, though.
