If you don't know about the anime/manga series, it's about a generation seedship running away from Earth and our solar system because a space faring species called Gauna bisected Earth in half.

Eventually, the generationa; seedship's captain got tired of running and decided to fight them head on.

I was hoping to discuss the story and idea in depth, as I am writing a fanfic that cross SGU and the anime.


** I do, actually! I've watched the first season on Netflix, but honestly I've found it fairly rational so far barring the photosynthesis technobabble. Sidonia improves its arsenal over the series with the introduction of Core Penetration Rounds, and even before that had appropriately-scaled weaponry with the Heavy Mass Cannon (despite apparently only having one, which is a bit weird) and the Interplanetary Missile.

EDIT: Even some of the series' tropes are well-justified - for example, the protagonist's mech (referred to as a Guardian in-universe) is a museum piece but out performs modern mechs because they are designed for ease of use rather than performance - he was trained on the now-outdated control system, so he can get more out of it than his peers. Similarly the newer Guardians are optimised for fighting Gauna so they don't have features that his does, like the anti-haugis coating that was unnecessary until the Gauna evolved.

*** My headcanon about photosynthesis is that they don't actually use the normal electromagnetic spectrum for input. They get that from hygg particles.

**** I'd prefer not to make the story more dependant on the necessary technobabble, to be honest. Oh, and Kunato seems to be ridiculously jealous and immature for a military pilot, to the point that- well, anyone that's seen the anime knows what happens.

** I like the anime well enough (it's got a cool setting and atmosphere but suffers from a boring-mc-with-harem setup) but it's never struck me as especially rational by sci-fi standards.

edit: also the background conspiracy plot of season 2 feels pretty typical of /non/-rational fiction to me - ie emphasizing coolness and drama and not worrying too much about logic.

*** The Immortal Committee is a danger to the captain's ambition of wiping out the gauna altogether in the LEM system.

Also, every second they're alive is every second they could gather information on Nagate Tanikaze, who unlike them, is a natural immortal, and could propagate immortality to his children. That's a threat to the power structure.

That being said, I don't think they did a particularly good job of explaining and showing how the immortal committee is a threat to Sidonia or why they chose to act the way they do.
