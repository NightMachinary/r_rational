** Honestly, I think the horror aspect in this Author's stories would be more effective if they didn't all have the same ending. There's never any suspense, because the protagonist always loses.

As always, there are metaphors to be drawn and ugly things to see, and sometimes there's even an interesting original idea. But there's this undercurrent of industrial sameness to it, where you always lose, even if you happen to win. It's almost as if the collection of stories as a whole is a metaphor for the individuals.

In most stories, you see rational behavior bent for sake of plot. In stories by this author, you see it bent for sake of grim metaphor instead; it's certainly different, but I'm not sure it's anymore actual Rat!fic than the former is.

I am relieved that comes across clearly. What you wrote there is about as concise (yet accurate) a description of what I am "about" as I have ever seen. My core is a featureless concrete cube and the intolerable feeling of grinding, repetitive, frigid banality is indeed what most of my work strives to capture.

I can't argue with that, haha. It is horror, after all. But I have some [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/scifi/14223][science fiction]] where a clever protagonist uses his brain to come out on top. You might also like my Little People trilogy, as it ends in an ultimately happy albeit somewhat bittersweet way. Likewise with The Black Pool, come to think of it.

Maybe it's just a difference in taste but I can't imagine /horror/ with a truly happy ending that I'd actually want to read.

Nope. It's not explained why violating the conservation of energy like this is reasonable, or why anyone set up society to be like this, or how society happened to fall into a state like this accidentally. The rules of this world are nightmarish and arbitrary, not sane and consistent.

You could argue that all of the irrational elements of the story amount to forgivable worldbuilding that sets the stage for the real plot. But the entirety of the plot is spent exploring this world. By the time all the irrational aspects of the story are out of the way, the story is five seconds from over. And the only thing supporting the idea that the character's decision to give up was rational is your own personal interpretation of the situation he was in, which isn't based on any strong evidence from the rest of the story because the rest of the story didn't make any sense.

I don't think that the story qualifies as "rational" on the basis of the character making a single decision, especially when it appears to be breaking the rules on the sidebar.

I mean, for starters, "nothing happens solely because the plot requires it" and "if the characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason." As much as I wanted to "buy in" and suspend my disbelief, I just couldn't do it anymore once our protagonist claimed that the escapee had bitten his ear and /nobody/ thought that it was a bit weird to encounter this when they had just heard an announcement that the escapee had a tagged ear.

To be frank, this feels like a perfect example of what doesn't fit in the genre, and I think that you know this, considering that you've described the story as a "lucid nightmare." If all that's required for a story to be rational is that a character make one reasonable decision then the term is essentially meaningless.

****** I think the problem I have with your characters is none of them have /it/. That /spirit/, as you said. They'll go so far, try so hard, get so lucky, and reach turning points, inflections in destiny. And then they just stop.

The man locked in the room has nothing else to do, so he sits in the chair and is hooked into the game knowing it's a fate worse than death. And then, paradoxically, to earn the death he already had available, he submits. He could've just destroyed everything there, ripped it to shreds, and waited to starve.

A man trapped in an alternate dimension is sent to prison by a government so insane it makes ours look reasonable, and somehow for years he forgets how to /jump/ between them, waiting until his release to even try. An act of submission to /Order/.

A man finds a girl that isn't dead or alive deep down in a parking garage with delusions of being a hole in reality. She grabs him and holds on tight, and he doesn't have the /Conviction/ to pull her to her feet and drag her back the fuck out of there.

It's bloody disgusting, watching a hero and knowing that they won't be tested at some critical point, won't get to /try/, won't have a chance to /see/, but simply fail, automatically, absolutely, with no saving throw.

It isn't often that I look around me in the Universe at These Broken Laws and have thanks that whatever put them all together wasn't /worse/, but at least it wasn't quite as awful as you.

But this is the crux of the problem! Individual stories of yours I might dislike more or less; I don't generally like stories with bad endings, but that doesn't mean they don't have a place. But the collection of your stories as a whole is tremendously flawed because it has no balance.

The certainty of inevitable failure visible in your work means that once you've read one, you've more or less read them all. It's all the more frustrating precisely because of how memorable the details are; the core is sick and diseased. What impact can a story have if you /know/ how it'll end before it starts?

I clicked this link knowing the story would follow the same general path as all of yours do, including not only the bad end but the mincing, pathetic, regret your protagonists tend to have right beforehand. I did think there might be salvageable interest in the details (there wasn't, this time), but mostly I just was frustrated enough with your work that I wanted to say something about it and it was common courtesy to actually read the story first.

If you do believe in balance, why don't you hide a story with a good ending in that collection somewhere? Not just a poisoned pear, but an authentic victory in the same way almost all of them are complete defeats. That one twist would massively raise the stakes for anyone reading the rest of them, since it would create the perception of uncertainty that's missing right now.

Imagine someone reading through your work. After a few stories, they get to predict the inevitable failure, and the suspense is gone; they're just picking over the bones. But then, surprisingly, they come across the good ending! A shock! Now, in every story afterwards, the uncertainty is back, the suspense is real, and it'll never completely go away.

*** I tried to read it. It did have potential and I was interested in finding out why they were all there, but I couldn't get past the ridiculous Tumblr strawman character. Over and over--"Hey, let's take a break from the plot for a few paragraphs so the author can ridicule ideas they clearly don't understand, using an unsympathetic caricature as the mouthpiece of their opposition." It's every bit as cringeworthy as if "Melissa" were to write her own story where "Andrew" is like "DURRR, I'M A WHITE PRIVILEGED CISHET DUDE AND I HATE EVERY OTHER KIND OF PERSON AND I WANT TO HAVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OVER THEM FOREVER BECAUSE I'M ENTITLED TO THAT," while Melissa effortlessly shoots down his intentionally flimsy talking points. If the author self-identifies as a rationalist, I would expect them to engage with their opponents' best arguments, not with the asinine funhouse mirror version thereof.

I mention that one specifically because the point where I stopped was when those two characters were having a ridiculously one-sided argument, in which the concept of privilege was badly misrepresented even by the character who was supposed to be defending that concept--but the "otaku" and "religious nut" characters were also unrelatable caricatures who seemed to exist just to mock groups of people, not as realistic depictions of different kinds of humans whose values can come into conflict.

Putting aside the strawman thing, it's fine to incorporate one's own sociopolitical opinions into a work of fiction, but if you don't even try to make it subtle, it sticks out like a sore thumb and comes across as soapboxing. I think the author achieved that subtlety with the human farm story, which I enjoyed a lot. The political point was conveyed by the story itself, not by having characters pause in the middle of the story to exposit it. But the one you linked, not so much.

Using caricatures is a legitimate technique that can be applied well or poorly. I think it was applied poorly here.

********* Sure, here are some ways I felt it was mishandled:

1. In my opinion, good satire ridicules ideas by having a character (or the setting) take those ideas to their extreme in a humorous way, and then having their humorous actions stand on their own. If you actually have the "smart" character start debating the satirized concepts with the satirical character, it ruins it. The debate feels hollow and one-sided, since one side is intentionally a strawman, and it's also so on-the-nose that it turns the rapier wit of satire into a sledgehammer. I'm not saying that that approach can never work, but I think it is very difficult to execute well.

2. The caricatures were unsubtle and mean-spirited. I mentioned before about taking an idea to its extreme. That might sounds like it can't be done subtly, but it can be. It's the difference between a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church! Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate; but I'm saved so I can keep all my money, it's okay for me but not you," vs a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church, Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate" while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a jeweled crucifix. That second example isn't exactly subtle, but it's subtle /enough./

3. There was nothing fresh or original about the caricatures. The "ha ha gross furry otaku" and "blue-haired SJW feminist who eats donuts all day and hates white men" strawmen, for example, have been done to death in online discourse.

Sorry for taking so long to respond. Your question was legitimate, so I wanted to put an effort into my reply.

That would actually be really cool! I was sort of hoping someone would say that was the case and that I would have discovered that if I read to the end. But if the point is supposed to be that they're "products of the behavioral sink happening in society today," I don't find the way they're represented at all convincing. Especially when they're used as vehicles to criticize real-world ideas without actually engaging with those ideas.

I'm trying to think how I can best articulate what frustrates me about the depiction...I don't think I would really have this issue with, for example, an "SJW" caricature being included just for comic relief. But to derail the story into a soapbox against, for example, the concept of "privilege," and to have the caricature exist just to offer up the weakest possible arguments for effortless refutation, strikes me as intellectual cowardice. The caricature, instead of just being a funny callout of a certain subset of ridiculous people, is now being used as a tool in a task it's unfit for.

For example, in the debate about privilege, Andrew characterizes it as being the natural result of people achieving varying levels of success though merit, and then passing their advantages to their children. Melissa lets this pass basically unchallenged, and Andrew concludes that privilege (as he describes it) is perfectly fair and not something to be concerned about. However, with respect to racial economic privilege specifically, the discourse surrounding that topic is more about how historically, systemic efforts to disenfranchise POC (refusing to rent or sell them real estate in certain areas, denying them jobs on the basis of their race, etc) created an inequality that persists due to the people who initially benefited from it passing down those advantages. In his rebuttal, Andrew doesn't engage with that aspect of the real-world debate at all.

There may very well be valid criticisms of the above description of privilege. And that's fine! But those criticisms should have appeared /in the story./ That is, if the author wanted to refute the concept of privilege in their story, they should have included both the complete argument for the concept of privilege and criticisms of /that/ argument.

Similarly, Melissa makes an argument that's roughly, "If the playing field were equal, everyone would perform equally. Everyone doesn't perform equally, therefore the playing field is unequal." I won't claim that no one has ever made that argument, but it's a clearly flimsy position that collapses under the slightest scrutiny. People who are well-educated in relevant fields and knowledgeable about the concept of privilege have made much stronger arguments in defense of the position that systemic inequalities exist, so if the author wanted to refute that position, they should have refuted /those/ arguments.

The character of Melissa is simply an unsuitable vehicle for conveying the author's views about the concept of privilege. I'll always be more impressed by watching a martial artist knock a skilled human opponent to the floor, than I would be by watching them kick over a cardboard cutout with a silly moustache drawn on it.

In summary: Caricature whose role is to poke fun at silly people = fine by me. Caricature whose role is to be a strawman so that the author can argue against a real-world idea without intellectually engaging with it = not fine by me, at least not in a work I found on a ratfic sub. Sorry about the wall of text, I got a little carried away.

*************** I empathize with your frustration about "not my job to educate you." However, I think that response has its place. For example:

1. People in social justice spaces--or really, any controversial spaces--are often confronted by people challenging their viewpoints in bad faith, with no intention of giving counterarguments any genuine consideration. In those situations, trying to educate the person is a waste of time, because they aren't open to information that conflicts with their existing viewpoint--in fact, debating with them just polarizes them further. I think it's reasonable to choose not to engage with such people. This applies to pretty much any community--atheists are justified in ignoring angry religious people who come in asking sardonic questions just as a vehicle to preach at them, religious people are justified in ignoring angry atheists who come in with sardonic questions just as a vehicle to preach at them, etc.

2. Sometimes, rather than trying to convince anyone, people are just looking to talk about their beliefs and experiences with other like-minded people. In those cases, at those times, those people haven't "opted in" to a debate. I think it's reasonable for someone to choose not to engage in a debate if they don't want to at that time. (Of course this doesn't apply to situations where the person is already actively participating in a debate on the topic.)

3. Sometimes the information being requested is so basic that, by demanding to have it spoonfed to them instead of just looking it up, the asker is wasting everyone's time. I think it's reasonable to tell someone to "just look it up" if the information is readily accessible.

Having said all of that, I think that anyone who explicitly sets out to convince others (in a particular work, or at a particular time) does accept the responsibility of fully supporting their point, refuting their opponent's actual arguments instead of their own strawman version of said arguments, and responding to the opponent's questions with sincere, informative answers. This includes social justice advocates. Many social justice advocates do rise to that responsibility.

Rational debate with social justice advocates is definitely possible--just as you say you've experienced in the rationalist community. But resorting to what you call base propaganda can never accomplish that. To answer your question--"If you can't engage in honest debate with a group (it's not my job to educate you et all) how do you deal with that kind of claim?"--the answer is that you move on from people who won't engage to people who will. There are countless essays and reams of discourse on the topic of privilege, for example.

***************** The "kill all men" thing has been brought up a couple of times, and I think it's critical to remember that the entire point of that sarcastic phrase is that mainstream feminists/"SJWs" /don't/ want to kill men. It's specifically mocking people who strawman feminists as man-haters who want women to rule the world. With very few exceptions, no one is actually advocating killing men, and the meaning of the phrase in context is not hateful toward men. The implication is basically, "Oh boy, I want low-income women to have access to healthcare--haha, I must want to /kill all men!/ It's funny because I obviously don't."

I think it's legitimate to argue that the joke is in bad taste, as long as it's acknowledged that it /is/ a joke and not in any way an expression of a sincere man-killing agenda. I'm not the biggest fan of it personally and I don't use it, but I often see people taking it seriously and holding it up as evidence that feminists want to kill men, which is missing the point entirely.

Putting that aside, I also think it's important to draw a distinction between "hate/derision," and the justified /anger/ of people who have experienced the effects of systemic discrimination in their own lives. Social justice advocates are often expected to present their viewpoints as delicately and politely as possible, lest they be rejected not on the basis of the actual argument but on the basis of its tone. Historically, however, that gentle approach hasn't worked as a means of achieving equality. Disadvantaged groups have made strides toward equality only by getting angry and loud and making the people with the power to change things uncomfortable. Being angry and loud didn't make their points any less valid.

You're probably right that you could cite examples of social justice communities being uncommunicative and hateful, but I don't think that would absolve you of the responsibility--if your goal is to convince people of your point of view--of engaging with the best arguments in defense of social justice concepts. As a rationalist, shouldn't your goal be to find the truth, rather than to win an arms race to dominate public discourse?

I think they lost the right to be engaged sincerely by tolerating genocidal rhetoric from within their ranks, and mocking objections to it as white male tears. This communicates that they do not acknowledge the humanity of a whole subset of people for racial and gender based reasons, and consider their degradation to be trivial.

The response to this is always to minimize or sweep under the rug the numerous examples wherein SJWs have proposed exterminating white males who do not crossdress or consider themselves women, while making some offhand comment about how those comments are fine anyway and anybody who objects to it is a big baby.

I don't want to die. My family is white, I don't want them to die either. It is not a comfort and does not excuse that sort of rhetoric that SJWs do not possess the power to actually carry out their threats. They may one day, and many historical genocides took the world by surprise, as the groups which carried them out were not taken seriously when they explicitly expressed the desire to commit mass murder. Right up until they were able to and did.

I think there is a core of good ideas in social justice but it is identical to the core of egalitarianism. It tells you everything you need to know that "egalitarian" is a dirty word to them, because they do not want any viable alternative. They want exclusive rights to define what it means to be a good person, the same way Christians do, such that membership is morally obligatory.

It seems to me that this feeling of "We're the good guys fighting the good fight" makes them feel as if whatever they do in the course of fighting their enemies is ultimately justified. That many things they would consider terrible if their enemy did it are okay for them, such as getting somebody fired over an internet argument.

That sort of thing actually is fucked up, inferior and contemptuous. I am not wrong to revile it, and getting pissy over a story which does not present your own ideology in a favorable light is immature.

It's the same reaction any time South Park makes fun of a new subset of society. Everybody else laughs while members of that subset sit there grimly, with pursed lips, even though they laughed with everybody else when it was some other group being ridiculed.

Suddenly it's not funny because it's something sacred to them, and they can't laugh at themselves, because they can't or won't see any flaws with their ideology or the behavior of its adherents. For example:

And Melissa's reaction--basically, "I'm trying to be an ally, how dare you reject my misguided and unwanted help"--is also a common pitfall, and in fact is discussed heavily in social justice circles as a behavior that should be avoided.

However, that behavior is not endemic to the movement; someone can believe strongly in social justice concepts without walking all over the people they're trying to advocate for. When the author tries to shoot down mainstream concepts like "privilege" just by connecting them to someone who behaves that way, instead of engaging with the best arguments for that concept, it's a prime example of strawmanning. If privilege is an invalid concept, it's certainly not "because some people who believe in it act like hypocritical assholes."

For example, even if 90% of people who like donuts are asshats, that doesn't equate to donuts not being delicious--you'd have to refute the best donut-related arguments of the most knowledgeable donut experts to draw that conclusion. After all, if a donut expert crafts an unassailable argument for the deliciousness of donuts, no amount of asshattery by their fellow donut-lovers can erase the validity of that argument.

The first link you sent seems to be directed at, but not written by, a social justice person. For purposes of supporting your argument that there's endemic toxicity in the social justice movement, material written by social justice folks themselves would be more convincing than a secondhand interpretation of that material.

The second link seems like an intersectionality issue; and yes, there's a lot of discourse in the feminist community about the pitfall of denying other women's lived experiences, and about how one person's brand of feminism can be insensitive or detrimental to other women. I've mainly seen it discussed with respect to white feminists trampling over WOC, who experience very different forms of sexism than white women do. It's something I try to be cognizant of.

I don't agree with this writer's attitude that other women /should/ be like her, in the sense of being so deeply passionate about her work that the misogyny directed at her slides right off her back. It isn't wrong for women to be affected by entrenched misogyny, and it isn't wrong to call that misogyny out. The problem is with the /misogyny,/ not with the women who can't just ignore it. However, I also don't agree with lashing out at her for being honest about her positive experiences within the tech community. If I take what she wrote at face value, the individuals who spoke to her that way were out of line.

This is one of those things that's controversial in the feminist community, since that community is not a monolith. You're always going to get that asshole who calls you a gender traitor for wearing makeup or wanting to be a stay-at-home mom. However, there are just as many feminists (if not more) vocally, vehemently pushing back against that crap. You don't see that as often outside of actual feminist circles, because it's not entertaining to people outside the movement the way the assholes are entertaining.

*********************************** So a couple things about the example you linked:

First, as far as I can tell, this company isn't actually hiring people. They're a platform for practicing interviewing and getting feedback. The interviewers they used came from tech companies. However, perceived interview performance is /not/ necessarily equivalent to hiring rate.

I think this is a critical distinction. Gender bias can come into play earlier in the hiring process than the actual interview, and a real-world interviewer's perception of a candidate may be influenced by the knowledge that they're actually up for hire. For example, one major obstacle for women looking to be hired is the perception that they're less valuable candidates because they may take time off work for maternity/childcare. This factor would not influence an interviewer's rating of interview performance, while still affecting their hiring decisions.

Second, it's important to note that when feminists talk about the obstacles women face in hiring, actual sexism by the hiring personnel is only one facet of the issue. The ways in which men and women are socialized differently, and the different expectations placed upon women vs men, are critical factors in understanding why women face disadvantages in hiring and career advancement. (For example, the maternity/childcare perception I mentioned before--the social expectation that women take on the primary burden of unpaid domestic labor like child and elder care is a serious obstacle to women's career advancement, not only for the reasons I already described, but also because women /are/ more likely to take time off work to handle domestic labor in practice and lose out on seniority as a result.)

Third, the trend toward favoring men-who-sounded-like-women wasn't statistically significant, so it isn't good evidence for a claim that there's positive bias toward hiring women in tech.

The article you linked actually discusses this to some extent. Their initial findings that men performed better than women in the interviews disappeared when they controlled for people quitting the site after one or two bad interviews. It turned out women were much more likely to get discouraged and quit. This is an example of the "confidence gap", another feminist issue related to gendered socialization that I don't have time to get into right now, but I can later, or you can read about it on your own if you want.

I need to go to work soon, but I will pull together some academic publications re: hiring bias (don't know if I'll be able to find anything specific to the tech industry) when I get the chance.

The goal isn't for interviewers to bias themselves in favor of women. They're being asked to examine themselves for bias against women, and make a conscious effort not to discriminate. If they achieve that and there's still a gap, that's not because the interviewers are evil sexists, it's because there's a systemic societal problem re: the way women and men are socialized that needs to be pulled up by the roots.

Addressing the confidence gap is critical, and that is in fact a popular subject within feminist communities and a common target for activists (e.g., interventions to boost the confidence of young girls, especially with respect to STEM stuff). If you think feminists aren't talking about that and are focusing exclusively on the actual hiring practices, you're misinformed. There is an enormous amount of feminist material about how gendered socialization and expectations lead to women being disadvantaged in the workplace, /regardless of/ any straight-up sexist bias by employers.

Try just googling "confidence gap," maybe? Like, google it on the actual Google and not exclusively in this one specific wiki that I've never heard of and have not at any point been talking about? You will probably find more pertinent information that way. It's /not/ a tech-specific issue.

I don't really understand your examples about feminism being "shitty to people in tech." You sent me that thing about the open-source website, but I had essentially zero context for understanding what was going on there. It was just a guy talking about events I didn't witness, aimed at an audience of people who were familiar with the events in question. I did ask you to give me material written by the actual feminists involved.

***************************************** Thanks, that helps. This is still hard to follow, but let me see if I have the gist. Gittip is a site for sending recurring donations to people. Some of its most funded users were diversity activists. These users were targeted with harassment. They thought that the people running the site should be proactive about telling the harassers to go away, and that by letting misogynistic site feedback go unchallenged they were tacitly condoning it. They wrote a bunch of material to this effect and then left the site. Is that roughly what went down?

I'm reading the forum thread linked from that "I resent you" article, and although Shanley Kane wasn't exactly /polite/ about it, there seem to be a bunch of people making reasonable and civil points in agreement with her. It looks like they mainly saw the whole thing as a safety issue. In fact, a lot of Kane's reasons for not engaging in a dialogue seem to be safety-related--apparently the Gittip folks wanted to livecast the whole thing or something like that?

Is your problem with the actual concerns the activist members raised, or is it specifically with Shanley Kane as an individual for being mean about it and not participating in a dialogue with the people in charge of the site?

#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure the author is making a critique of social justice as a whole.

#+begin_quote
  I think they lost the right to be engaged sincerely by tolerating genocidal rhetoric from within their ranks, and mocking objections to it as white male tears. This communicates that they do not acknowledge the humanity of a whole subset of people for racial and gender based reasons, and consider their degradation to be trivial.
#+end_quote

Which is why people of any given group (whether that group is rationalists, social justice, Trump supporters, etc) are often very twitchy about their group being strawmanned. Your opponents, knowingly or not, are constantly trying to reduce your group to its most unlikeable members.

Strawmaning doesn't have to be malicious (people usually don't think "Muahahah, I'm going to unfairly misrepresent Trump supporters to make them come across as racist and hateful"), and it can be subtle. Like, if the context is we're talking about self-identified rationalists, and I say people shouldn't believe that they're smarter than everyone else, or if I say "Fantasizing about a Mary Sue who solves everything by being A GENIUS is seriously unhealthy, even creepy", I'm not explicitly making a critique of rationalists as a whole, but it's still clearly harmful for the rationalists' image, maybe unfairly so.

  If your first argument against social justice concepts is "some nutter once said something about exterminating white people, therefore that's the core of the social justice movement in its entirety and the only position I have to refute," then that's a prime example of your strawmanning the opposition.
#+end_quote

It wasn't "some nutter". That implies it was only ever one person. Do you recall when #killallmen trended on Twitter? Was that one person?

Your original claim was that there exists only one person sincerely advocating for the mass murder of white men who do not identify as women or sexually prefer other men.

In my estimation, I already have. What you mean is that you did not like my arguments. That is unsurprising. Any objection to them you can raise, I can also rebut. Social Justice, apart from what it shares with egalitarianism, is at the root of it predicated on false assumptions. It relies on powerful stigma against challenging these assumptions in order to survive.

I don't reject you, how can I when I don't even know you? All I know about you is this one thing we disagree on. For all I know there's ten things more important to me that we agree about, and if I didn't know this one thing about you I'd admire you and want to be friends.

It frustrates me that you downplay certain things but I think our fundamental values largely overlap, and it was not cool of me to go nuclear over what amounted to mild disapproval.

That is a bad habit I have. I always feel like I need to be on guard against attacks that could come from any direction. I won't bore you with how I got that way because it isn't a good reason to be that way to people anyhow.

I always know before I blow up that I am being disproportionately ugly and will feel bad later but the temptation is always too great. I know what I shouldn't do but never seem to consistently implement that knowledge. When I get mad, all the restraints fall off.

I'm sorry I was a harsh, ugly person to you. You did not deserve the extent of what you got. You were magnanimous to be honest that you liked the story rather than trashing it because of my shit personality. That was cool of you, and I think I could learn something from it.
