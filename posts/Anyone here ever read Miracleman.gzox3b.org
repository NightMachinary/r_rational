/Miracleman/ was an early Alan Moore work (pre /Watchmen/ or /Swamp Thing/) I really, really like, and it occured to me that it might fit well into the rational fiction ouvre.

So, /Miracleman/ was a reboot of a British rip-off of Captain Marvel (Shazam!) from the 1950s, literally created to replace a black and white reprint series when the character was discontinued in the States. So, yeah, basic premise is the same, vaguely preteen boy says magic word to become a grown up superhero.

Alan Moore's story picks up when Mike Moran is a middle aged, married dude who no longer remembers his superheroic career, and plumbs into the plausibility of his own origin and history, before eventually going on to explore how superhumans could utterly change the fabric of the world, including sharing their powers and immortality. Very /Luminosity/, in a way.


** Miracle man was great! My favorite scene involved the note Mike Moran wrote on top of a mountain -- I hope you know what I mean. Fantastic scene and very interesting take on how a person would likely react to the whole Shazam type super power premise.

** I read it, and with no spoilers, it's an excellent rational work with a nice deconstruction/explanation of the overlap of clich√© origin stories.

** Actually - and I have an entire post in me trying to get out - I have been thinking about non-ratfic Rational Fiction, and I'm actually wondering why stuff like /Miracleman/ hasn't been added to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] wiki.

** Also worth noting, from a world building and character perspective, Neil Gaiman's stuff with the series is also well worth a look.

** Yes, I've read Alan Moore's Marvelman (that was still the title in Warrior magazine, which is where I first encountered it.) The title (and lettering on the original stories) was changed to Miracleman for the Eclipse/Pacific reprints and continuation, because they didn't want a legal fight over the name. It ended up in copyright limbo at least twice, for decades.

If it seems like something else? The influence almost certainly goes the other way. It certainly influenced my work - but my interest in it ended with Moore's last issue.

Trivia: Doc Future's first nightmare (not the one in the prologue, the first one chronologically) in Fall of Doc Future was inspired (if that's the right word for pure unadulterated nightmare fuel) by the two-page spread at end of the original Miracleman #15, and Journeyman was based on a character whose abilities were inspired by Aza Chorn. In Maker's Ark chapter 9, Journeyman refers to being afraid he was going to have to "go full warpsmith". That is also a reference to Miracleman #15.

*** I've always found the Marvelman/Miracleman name thing thematically interesting. I personally go with Miracleman, partly because it's more familar to me personally, partly because, well, I just like it.

But I do think there's something to be said of the word "Miracle" in regards to motif. A "marvel" generally refers to a feat that's great, but within the abilities of humans. The Hoover Dam is an "engineering marvel."

A miracle, though, that's something /beyond/ humanity.

** I read it and check every now and then to see if the Neil Gaiman run has been revived. I really liked it.

*** I suspect this plague happened entirely because they finished an issue and the universe didn't know how to react. Now all comics are Miracleman.

Well, Neil's probably got at least ten more years left in him. There's still hope...

** I only recall Miracleman from a brief mention in a fanfiction about how he died to The Fury. Cool to know the guy could share his powers.
