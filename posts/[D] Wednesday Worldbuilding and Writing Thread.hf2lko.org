Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** A couple of days ago, I finished writing the first draft of a novel...

... What do you think I should do with it?

I already plan on the standard 'take some time off, then revisit the draft with fresh eyes' to improve it; but once I've made the best draft I can, what next? Post it to my personal site, or to free writing gallery sites like RoyalRoad, or look into epublishing, or...? (I don't expect I'm going to make a single dime from this story; at best, it might provide some advertising for things I write in the future.)

(In case it makes a difference, it's [HSF][TH] with one background detail that's somewhere around One Small Fib on the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][Hardness Scale]], depending on how out-there you consider a particular physics theory to be.)

*** Depends what you want out of it. If you just want as many people reading your work as possible, royal road. If you want some chance of making money, try to submit to traditional publishers or just go the amazon kindle unlimited route (get some guidance of what it takes to self promote on amazon). If you want it to serve as advertisement, hold onto the book until you have another one ready, post it for free but put the other one up for sale.

*** I've been trying to focus my attention on other things the last few days: manga, podcasts, news, and other such distractions. But I'll put it this way; I just spent the last two hours with a sleep-mask over my eyes and a desktop fan as a white-noise generator, and ended up thinking up about one and a half chapters of a sequel to this novel. (The first line: "The secret to telling a story with a happy ending is knowing when to stop talking.") I seem to be the opposite of burnt-out from pulling off a NaNoWriMo. So... this is a thing that could be happening.

** I've been vaguely worldbuilding a hard magic system meant to work alongside modern physics, with the fundamental idea being telekinetic manipulation of matter. Magic users would at a basic level be able to control a fistful of material, with a natural affinity towards different types. Similar to ATLA, essentially, but with a scientific background. Instead of nebulous concepts like "earth" or "fire" it would be based off physical properties, but I haven't figured out any specifics.

Magic ability would be defined by "power" and "precision." Training to increase power would increase the maximum amount of matter you could directly control, like throwing larger boulders or heating something by a greater degree, whereas increasing precision would decrease the minimum size, for example launching a nail versus a brick, as well as allowing for finer control. Size would be directly linked to requirements for control, to prevent any easy mountain-throwing or atonic fuckery.

Magic capacity would probably be similar to muscular ability, without any inherent hard numbers and measured off tests of maximum amount or greatest precision. Like lifting weights, even an average magic user could wiggle a rock around all day, but tossing them hard might tire them out after a few hours and one or two large feats could put them out for a while.

These are all just rough ideas at this point, but if you have any thoughts about how it would work or noticed any glaring issues I'd love to hear them.

*** My first question would be how are you going to define these 'types' of material that can be used? Will people be able to control specific molecular structures, like H20, or only elements, like hydrogen and oxygen? If the latter, would someone with control over hydrogen/oxygen still be able to move water?

The power side of this seems to not only get you raw strength but also the heating and cooling and therefore the ability to change the matter's state. So what does the precision side have going for it? Atomically sharp projectiles? Generating sound?

Which brings me to a similar magic system I was thinking about not too long ago. Eventually, I started thinking that most of the "elements" could probably replicate interesting exploits from other elements. For example, if you can control small particles of 'earth' or water/liquid in the air with enough precision, could you technically oscillate them to make sounds (something I originally thought would be specific to wind/gas elementalists)?

**** So I've gone back to iron out the material definitions, and decided on doing it based off the states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, which in-univeree be commonly associated with earth, water and air respectively. Fire, instead of being its own category, becomes the high end of a secondary "thermal affinity" that applies to all three categories. With this, you can have "fire mages" using any source materials, from gunpoweder to gasoline to hydrogen gas, depending on their personal material affinity.

As for the precision side, it would be a necessity for most mages in order to use thier own abilities to the fullest extent. Higher precision would allow for faster, more precise control over all of the states of matter, so unless you're Mr. "I didn't ask how big the room was, I said I cast fireball" it'll be essential for everyday use.

***** Interesting, so can a solid bender use all solid material but only so long as it's a solid? If not, how are different state benders differentiated?

I suppose you could have it so that, for example, a liquid bender can only stick their magic into matter that is currently in a liquid state, but once the magic is in the matter they can change its state and maintain control of it.

Also, what sort of range and sensory control do these magic users have? On the latter subject, could a gas user controlling all the air in a room feel how it's displaced by objects/people? If this is the case then all benders with enough precision should essentially have a sixth sense from filling the air with small particulates.

****** Thats the general idea, with benders being able to control a wide variety of materials. Pure forms of different materials would be extracted and used as tools/weapons/heirlooms. As with modern society specialization would arise within the different states of matter and roles in society.

For example in the military defensive-focused mages would emphasize working with solids like lead or liquids with high viscosity to absorb impact, while offensive specialists would focus in more rigid materials like steel.

Additionally, the workplace would contain similar specializations. A mage employed at a power plant might work exclusively with liquids that have a high heat transfer rate, etc.

Finally yes, there would definitely be various perception tricks like a tremor sense, reading air currents, or motion through water. I dont have any hard numbers for ranges, but in theory a beginner could sense/control a few meters, a professional dozens of meters and the extremely rare archmage hundreds.

** So, urban fantasy vampire tropes usually have kingdoms (True Blood, WoD for example). It's a kind of feudal system which I kind of accepted uncritically as being "the way vampires are".

But in real life, we have everything from the uncontacted mysterious sentinelese people to North Korea's oppressive government to the soviets to China's... whatever they have going there to the Nordic countries pro-socialist stance while the American libertarians want to stop you taking their guns away while the king of Bhutan wants people to plant trees for his birthday instead of having a big state event and I know nothing about the no doubt super varied traditional tribal systems in Africa, South America, Australia, and the Pacific that suffer under the yoke of colonialism to this day.

So... the idea that vampires, who have much more self-determination (by virtue of living longer), decided that the 1600s England (or whatever) was the peak of society is kind of.... lol. Sure, maybe the English, American, Australian vampires decided that because they're influenced by their human culture substrate (but also... maybe not? if a man from the dark ages believes in the divine rights of kings, then he won't necessarily change his mind after 500 years of living as a god-king).

So, for aesthetic reasons I like the idea of My Vampires having a good-sized contingent with the traditional "Kingdoms", but it would be fun to have passing references to "Suriname has a Queen, of course, for diplomatic business with other vampire nations, but she's randomly selected from all the vampires who live in the country because they operate under a communist style of government." etc.

So... does anyone know any cool articles about systems of government / rule that are/were actually used in the world? Any cool ideas they've been thinking of for how an enterprising vampire might create her own equivalent of Sealand to govern using something like one of SSC's "political systems not much different from our own"? Any ways I can twist the feudal system to be a bit more interesting / innovative?

*tl;dr does anyone know a good article, which if written in Cracked style would be titled "7 weird systems of government that you won't believe are running countries right now"*

*** [[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html][Legal Systems Very Different From Ours]] is an in-depth look at... well, exactly what it says on the tin. Several of the systems covered (Roma, Amish, Orthodox Jewish) are from societies that are embedded in a larger one, which means they have to deal with some problems that your vampires will have to as well. Though these are also all underprivileged and marginalized societies - and human - so there's a limit to how applicable their systems are to immortal power-hoarding vampires. (Also don't do a Jewish-coded vampire conspiracy, that's tapping into a long and shitty history :-P.)

*** World of Darkness itself explores this very topic extensively, both explaining several dozen alternative ways vampires can govern themselves, and also in very, very extensive detail, why the "feudal" system works best.

Before we explore it, lets agree on several "vampire facts":

- vampires need human blood, and human blood is a scarce resource

- in general, vampires become more powerful with age, and in most cases, parent vampire is always stronger than their child

- unless killed, vampires can "live" forever, or nearly so.

- vampiric blood has strange, magical or addictive properties

- vampires prefer not to have mortals know too much about them

​

Now, if you cross that facts with one another, you soon see a pattern emerge. Older, more powerful vampires will amass more and more power, in order to control their supply of human blood, which in most cases means population control or land control. Older vampires will thus be able to fend off younger upstarts, unless said upstarts massively organise against them, because frankly, one millennium old vampire can tear 10 century old vampires to shreds, and proly eat them too.

What emerges, is a structure similar to a social pyramid: Ancient vampire(s) at the top, controlling entire continents. Elder vampires subservient to them, but somewhat independent. Average vampires below Elders, and fresh vamps at the bottom of the ladder.But the system also requires a sort of "trickle down economics" of blood. The Elders want the youngsters under them to be relatively content, non-rebellious and not making trouble, so they keep them fed and organised, preside over disputes, and lay down the law, so that the unlife would not descent into chaos and anarchy.

Any youngster who goes against that system gets eaten. Any Ancient/Elder who goes against the system gets rebelled against and eaten.

In the end, most of vampires organise along the lines of either a feudal system, or a Guild, or a kind of corporation, with a clear pyramid of power, and the responsibility that goes with that power. Its not that they want to, it is simply the only system that reliably works.

(It does help a bit that a lot of older vamps were literally feudal lords in their mortal life, and the Ancients remember the age of God Kings and Emperors - so the system feels natural to them).

Having said that, there are systems of governance in WoD Vampire, that are different:

- Sabbat: is a lose coalition of anti-feudal vampires, who do not care about being in balance with humanity or obedience to their elders. They maintain the coherence of their structure by the ritual of Vaulderie - they mix and drink each other's blood to create bonds of kinship and loyalty, without which they would tear one another.

- Setites, Baali, Samedi, etc - some vampires worship dark gods and demons, and thus their structure is not based on power and age, but rather on religious rites, and dogma.

- Oradea - basically vampire libertarians: old, powerful vamps who just want to be left alone, and only interact with one another to fend off the encroaching vampire sects.

- Anarchs - what it says on the tin: a mixture of communism and might-makes-right oneupmanship, unified only by their opposition to power and control.

- The Black Hand - a sect within a sect that is organised like a military group mixed with a research facility, and organised along strict lines of meritocracy, order and pragmatism.

In conclusion: nearly all vampiric systems of governance and society are based on one realisation: vampires are unequal, and the system must reflect and utilise their inequality. There can be no democracy between vamps if one is barely a human with fangs, and the other is a 1000 year old blood necromancer who can bench-press a bus and bite an anvil in half.

** *IMMORTALITY VS OVERPOPULATION.*

Can we discuss this old hat in detail?

Assuming the story contains biological "immortality" (which is simply a form of very good life extension technology). What would be the social and population ramifications, and how could overpopulation be avoided?

I know about some proposed ideas like enforced birth control or space colonisation, but these seem even harder to implement than a worldwide immortality serum, not to mention that even their best implementation would be to slow.

*** One possible solution has the world divided into an Elite class (who can afford the rejuvenation technology, or qualify for it according to some criteria) and a Generic class, who are not given access to rejuvenation technology. Overpopulation is avoided by very strictly limiting the numbers of Elite.

Social and political ramifications can then follow from that basis.

*** Presumably, immortality will be a gradual development. Even though life expectancy in the US is in decline, average worldwide life expectancy is continuing to grow every year, with an average rate of about 0.7% increase in life expectancy at birth per year since 1900. Something close to this trend is likely to continue. There are a huge number of illnesses that cause people to die, some easier to treat than others, but all need to be solved for immortality. We'll keep addressing the low-hanging fruit in every decade, setting the stage for the medical advancements of the decade to follow. By 2100, a life expectancy at birth of about 128 years would not be unreasonable. By 2200, that would likely rise to 300 years at birth, although, when we're talking about numbers that far out, odds are good that medical science would develop fast enough to more or less provide immortality.

Of course, we're already seeing the social, ecological, and population ramifactions of growing lifespans and the consequent explosion in global population. Birth rates have been declining sharply in the developed world. Increasing pollution is causing increasing global temperatures which is changing weather patterns, resulting in a wide range of ecological challenges. Higher population density and increasingly frequent international travel is making it easier for infectious diseases to spread rampantly unless strict measures are taken to control the spread.

Overpopulation, at least to some extent, is probably unavoidable. It tends to make families less willing or able to have more children, so overpopulation itself is the one guaranteed way to slow population growth. Some countries, like China, may manage to enforce regulations which maintain a reasonable population, but most countries probably will not, or at least not until the problem is extremely severe, and the point where action has to be taken will likely set the status quo for future population density in that country.

Space colonization to avoid overpopulation is probably possible, but highly unlikely. We can't even convince oligarchs around the world to avoid polluting the planet with greenhouse gases, so unless there's some kind of global revolution which results in a new technocratic, liquid democracy which is very forward-thinking, I'd say there's probably no chance of overpopulation being solved in a comfortable way.

*** 20:00 in East Australia is high noon here (South Africa). There's a lot of interesting nature around here, in the sense of attracting tourists (at least before Coronavirus kind of put the whole tourist thing in trouble). If you're interested in mountains, you have the pick of the Drakensberg range or Table Mountain; a baseline human child is unlikely to get worse than chilly. If you're looking for animals, there's a number of national parks of which the Kruger National Park is the most famous - survivability there might be a bit iffy if a baseline human child teleports in, because the animals might take offence if surprised (and an elephant taking offence can easily squash a baseline human child) but is quite survivable if that doesn't happen.
