Print book and Kindle Unlimited version should be available in a couple of weeks or so. For Amazon reasons, when I put up the Kindle Unlimited version, the Gumroad version goes down for 90 days. So if you want the platform-independent version, get it at Gumroad within the next week.

If you have no idea what genre this is supposed to be in, one of the better light novels I've read online is [[http://oniichanyamete.wordpress.com/index/evil-god-average/][Evil God Average]].

I don't have a sequel plot in mind (just a handful of ideas) and you're welcome to stake an opinion on what should happen next.


** Yes!

This makes me very happy. My only complaint is that it is short! :P

Thank you very much, Eliezer! I appreciate you taking time from your life to write - it's a rare treat to read really high level rational fiction!

Also, FYI, looks like some formatting didn't carry over on the Amazon description - I'm seeing underscores in place of italics tags.

** This was delightful. I'm glad I subscribed to the email updates on hpmor.com. Given this character, I can't imagine the next few months of her life being anything other than trying to assemble a ramshackle version of the internet, because she's going to go into withdrawal soon. If you've ever watched Humanity Has Declined (an anime about life in the far-off future where humanity's population is dwindling and has to meet an equilibrium with fairies whose primary motivation is sweets), the episode where humanity rediscovers yaoi manga and starts up conventions around it would be a great reference.

I highly recommend [[http://turb0translation.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page.html][Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?!]]. It's about a girl who gets resurrected as a giant spider in the middle of a labyrinth, and promptly has to run away to avoid being eaten by her spider family. Given that none of the monsters around her can talk, almost the entire story is carried on the back of her internal ramblings as she slowly goes crazy.

The translation above has most chapters, but since that translator isn't a native speaker of English OR Japanese, it can get a bit wonky, so there's a retranslation project going on [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/tagged/kumoko/chrono][here]] that has around fifty chapters done, and there's another translation project picking up where the original non-native translator left off [[http://raisingthedead.ninja/current-j-z/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/][here]], for 237 chapters of the main story and a lot of side story chapters. There's also a [[http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka-r17709/][manga adaptation]] that just started.

Thanks for bringing us more content!

** I'd be curious to see your take on chinese xianxia (pronounced "shin-shuh") webnovels, such as "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/][I Shall Seal the Heavens]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/mga-index/][Martial God Asura]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/tdg-index/][Tales of Gods and Demons]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/btth-index/][Battle Through the Heavens]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/][Against the Gods]]", "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]]," and "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index/][Stellar Transformations]]".

They all take place in worlds where martial cultivation allows you to become, for all intents, a superhero. Cultivation is ranked on a scale and requires meditation and time to increase through the rankings. The main character inevitably A) has some sort of power or artifact that allows him to progress at an extremely fast rate, and B) get into fights with people who look down upon him and are promptly trounced.

They're the literature equivalent of junk food: not high culture by any means, but still enjoyable to consume.

But if you don't enjoy xianxia stories, don't worry. It just means you had eyes but couldn't recognize Mt. Tai. ;)

**** Feeling inspired is beyond your control, but what do you mean there's no target audience? You're talking about a brand of Chinese martial fantasy. Chinese is the single most spoken language on earth and Chinese culture is very widely disseminated, even without counting the huge martial arts media fan base among non-Chinese people. That fan base is big enough to have enormous subcultures situated within it, like people devoted to individual actors such as Jet Li or franchises like Mortal Kombat. HPMOR has also been fully translated into Chinese, so there is interest in rationality among Chinese speakers themselves.

Consider that Journey to the West is very repetitive and it is very popular. So are things like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2 and DBZ. Many if not most magical girl / summoned hero sagas, etc. are very repetitive. (FWIW, these genres are also considered worthless in terms of literary quality.) Obviously, just because your source material tends to be repetitive doesn't mean you have to emulate them in that respect.

The martial arts genre naturally lends itself to munchkinism (think of Worm), a rudimentary form of which is already present in I Shall Seal the Heavens, and it also presents elements of traditional culture such as clan loyalty that are just begging to be subverted in the name of humanism. (Not to mention the desire for immortality that Taoism shares with transhumanism. OTOH, if you think Chinese readers would be less likely to pay to read your work, then your analysis is spot on.)

Of course, I've only read 38 chapters of I Shall Seal the Heavens (after reading your book and Unsong, which were great BTW) and I have no idea how terrible the rest are. I Shall Seal the Heavens is heavily focused on martial arts combat (it really reminded me of the later parts of Uproar in Heaven: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWV_ulSNFn0]]), hence my comment about appealing to martial arts fans.

(The example I have in mind is: [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17455]]) However, my bad translations of such a text back into Bengali would sound dry too. The color is irreversibly lost and would have to be reinvented by a talented writer in whichever language they're telling the story. (If you keep idioms intact, then those might transition smoothly back into the original language, but the problem is that good writers tend to break patterns.)

*** OH MAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT XIANXIA? XIANXIA IS MY JAM.

I have been ingesting copious amounts of xianxia stories as of late (read: past 6 months or so) in hopes of actually coming up with something interesting to say about the genre. I love the aesthetic of the novels, but they really ARE mostly junk food, which makes me really really sad.

Translations of xianxia novels are definitely difficult to do, due to several factors. How would you even translate 金丹 or 元婴? All literal translations of this sound absolutely ASININE in english. Golden egg? Golden elixir? Spirit fetus? These phrases do not convey the impact of the phrases at all. All of Xianxia really suffers from this sort of problem, because it isn't enough to just translate the characters, you also have to pick translations that convey the appropriate depth of 'importance'.

(I've been working on an attempt at a personal translated lexicon of Xianxia stuff in my off-time. Highlights of it include translating both 炼化 and 修炼 as 'Refinement' with contextual information telling the reader whether we're talking about refinement of artifacts or refinement of the self, translating 吐纳 as 'Aspiration', and translating 修士 as 'Aspirant' or 'Pursuant' as an attempt to make the semantic network of translated terms more compact.)

The concept of the Xian is really, really suited to optimization and rationality, though. Xian basically fulfill the role of angels in chinese mythology, as relatively benevolent supernatural forces of unearthly beauty and power fighting against demonic forces, but whereas in judeochristianity angels are created by god, in chinese mythology the Xian are all uplifted humans. The fundamental premise of the Xian is a promise that if you work hard at your supernatural kung-fu and devote yourself to following a Way (not THE way; there are generally three thousand unique Ways in most Xianxia settings), you will eventually escape your mortal bonds and ascend to boundless youth and power. Transhumanism as invented by feudal chinese scholars, pretty much.

God I could talk for EONS about how cool Xianxia settings are. There's SO many cool concepts baked into Xianxia settings that I'd love to be allowed to export into you folks' brains.

I'm not saying they're /innacurate,/ I'm saying that by rigidly sticking to the source material, fan translators sacrifice good writing on the altar of accuracy. It's like the subbed versus dubbed debate, but I'm on the end that's opposite from my regular stance. Japanese writing, for example, has a habit of telling, not showing, which isn't necessarily bad in any particular case (it's permissible in manga to stop stories from getting bogged down), but it doesn't exactly mesh with western sensibilities. And to clarify, it's not a Japanese thing so much as it is a foreign language thing-- each culture will have it's own trends and writing styles, and reading directly translated work therefore feels awkward.

To us, it has to do with what you /should/ do, and it doesn't make much sense for that to be associated with some arbitrary rules made up by angels. To them, morality is all about making angels approve of you, and improving society or optimizing outcomes is at best a pleasant side-effect. If "good" is defined by the approval of angels, then it's unclear why we should always endeavor to bother being good, and we would need different vocabulary to discuss actual morality.

***** You're right. A committed human utilitarian would not see committed non-human deontologists as automatic allies or trustworthy moral guides.

But this story takes place in a middle-ages fantasy world where semi-divine entities go around being /nice/ and saying things that match human instincts and are /mostly/ right in a very authoritative tone of voice (while leveraging supernatural powers). It would be very hard for a native to notice the difference between utilitarianism and deontology in this environment, and impossible to do anything about it if you do.

Did this come out of musings on Precisely Bound Demons and Their Behavior, or from somewhere else?

** You may find manga "[[http://mangafox.me/manga/yuusha_gojo_kumiai_kouryuugata_keijiban/][Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban]]" very interesting, btw. It takes common tropes like "summoned hero" or "hero vs demon lord" and the like and proceeds to explore, invert and deconstruct them in many fun and interesting ways in a series of short and loosely-connected stories.

**** No. The quality of the text changes dramatically when the main character is considering aloud ways to munchkin the situation and it seems like this is the only part of the story given such consideration. That's my biggest gripe. Apparent lack of effort.

***** I mean, given Eliezer's previous work with HPMOR, it's quite clear that the low quality writing style is intentional.

I expect it due to either a stylistic, stream-of-consciousness kind of thing, or a calculated optimization wherein Eliezer reduced writing quality in favor of brevity and ease of writing. It might also be a common style in the Light Novel genre - Anderkent's comment seems to suggest this.

As far as the low quality editing and vocabulary/word choice is concerned, as with the title, I am over 90% confident that this is as a result of attempting to create an authentic Japanese Light Novel translation experience.

I agree that there are very noticeable flaws in the piece that prevent it from being a masterpiece, but I think it very cleverly optimizes for a rationalist audience:

1. Eliezer has many things on his plate - the faster and looser the writing style is, the easier and faster he can write it and release it to us.

2. By focusing heavily on the rationalist elements of the story, it provides, at a relatively low authorial cost, a hit of rationalist fiction that fulfils the basic requirements of the genre. Since that is the element so many of us struggle to find consistently, while other literary needs can be met elsewhere, at a small cost to general utils, this story neatly optimizes for low-cost distribution of very specific utils.

I did feel it was quite short, but then, I've been reading Worm and associated fanfiction for the last few months, so anything under 100k words feels unbearably short.

If you are the kind of person who hungers for rational(ist) fiction, I think this LN is perfectly appropriate, unless you find a lack of quality to be an undeniable blocker to your enjoyment.

** While I greatly enjoyed your previous products and will be eternally grateful for starting this whole current of rational fiction, I don't think selling your stories like this is a good idea, as it puts them into the realm of products, rather than support for the creator.

Might I recommend setting up a Patreon profile and provide all your stories to the paid supporters?

I don't mind giving money to you, as a thanks for kicking off the genre that rekindled my love in reading, but I do not consider paying 0,99€ for such a short story to be worth the cost, as there are many other products that provide better value for the money.

*** So, you want to signal that you value EY's work and fiction, but do not want to demonstrate that you value them more than you value, say, a cup of coffee, or a candy bar.

By purchasing a good, you demonstrate that you prefer that good to all other goods you could purchase with that money. By refusing to purchase this book, you demonstrate that you prefer some other good you can purchase at a similar price to the book.

By complaining here in the way you have done, you are attempting to signal a preference you are at the same time demonstrating you don't have.

But, as said above, I am grateful to EY for what he did in the past, and I am willing to support HIM for that, but as far as this specific product is concerned I do not consider it worth paying for.
