** You know, I don't always like every twist and turn that this story gives us, and sometimes I feel like the revelation that we're presented with is not as good as the expectation that was in my head, but it's been running for a year now and the plot is actually progressing and the author keeps finding new ways to get us turned around and disoriented.

****** I...kind of like that idea, actually. I agree that it would leave them directionless, but that won't be a problem the revelation is given after they've developed some additional goals.
