Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm not sure if this fits best in worldbuilding but the thread is empty so you know I can play fast and loose with the rules?

Anyway, a lot of stories are about characters undergoing Personal Growth and Learning A Lesson About Being A Good Person, and other such things like that.

I re-read /The Giver/ about 5 years ago and I was shocked at how over the top it was: the second Jonas finds out the Evil Truth Of The World, he states in a transparently expositional way why that's bad and stuff. Sure, fine, he's a kid. But the eponymous Giver, upon hearing Jonas's outrage, suddenly goes, "oh yeah, my dystopian society is actually terrible, I am now down with you breaking all our most sacred laws". It doesn't feel like the Giver "earned" his epiphany: he hears that the world is bad and accepts it unquestioningly. He only offers minimal, perfunctory resistance to Fixing The World, and gives up on defending the dystopia pretty much immediately, when someone as aged as the Giver would be probably Set In His Ways; not to mention his personal history means that he has seen first-hand the benefits of the dystopia.

So, in rational fiction, how do you make characters earn their epiphanies? How do you make growth, where they change their most central opinions of the world, feel /natural/?

(I'm not specifically interested in /The Giver/, it's just the first "bad example" I can think of.)

Huh. It's been a while since I read it, even longer than five years, but I remember it a bit differently. I thought the Giver was most of the way toward rejecting his society already, what with how it unsympathetically killed his beloved (adoptive) daughter. It seemed to me that he just needed another person to tell him he wasn't insane. It's quite possible I remember it incorrectly.

I'm not really sure! But, when you said that I immediately thought of /Tigana/. Characters in that story change their dearly-held convictions. For example, there is a powerful scene where a character realizes his mortal enemy is human and deserving of sympathy. The character is so absorbed in his thoughts that he momentarily forgets to adhere to the social customs of the resistance he founded. Members of the resistance are supposed to choose a certain type of wine as a subtle signal and reminder of why they are fighting. Another resistance member notices that he accepts the wrong type of wine, unthinkingly--it shows how disturbed his worldview is, after learning the man he plans to assassinate isn't wholly evil.

It seems more natural if the character fights back at first instead of immediately accepting. Showing that skillfully, as in /Tigana/, requires setup. It takes work to establish a character so well that when they start acting unsettled it is noticeable. A change in worldview, however warranted, takes time--and although it is a rationalist skill to change your mind as soon as possible when you realize it needs to change, the act of realization should have a buildup or at least a triggering event. It is more believable when characters change in response to stress than when they change without apparent cause, and more believable still when characters spend effort carefully thinking about the implications of their new views.

I guess the problem with the Giver is that 'My student rebels' is not sufficient reason to change your worldview.

**** Regarding the death of rosemary , how it actually happened was different than you seem to remember: she was traumatised from receiving memories of war and death and pain, and so asked to "Be Released", and when she realised that it was death by lethal injection, she asked to inject herself. She seemed complicit in her own suicide. And then her memories somehow leaked out of her brain and into everyone else when she died, so the normal town folk were traumatised by the horrible memories and The Giver had to counsel them. So, putting myself in The Giver's shoes, he's holding memories that are so bad they drove his daughter to suicide, and if Jonas succeeds in his plan, he gives the townsfolk so many memories that they won't be able to "just get over them" like they did with Rosemary's memories which were much fewer. Like, I don't see the Giver being an actual enthusiastic participant in this plan without a lot of planning and reassurance, and I didn't feel like he earned it in the story

So yeah, that's how I feel about it.

I think your example is on the money: the character needs to be shown to be slowly working towards it, inciting incidents need to be shown, and so on.

***** Ah, thanks for explaining. I assumed that he blamed society for putting her in that situation in the first place. The memories they won't accept are his burden, and were too much of a burden for his daughter, so forcing them to accept the memories would make a sort of justice.

In fact, I have a copy of /The Giver/. If you look at page 144-145, the Giver talks about his anger at the residents. He says he refused to help them with the few terrible memories they had, last time, then goes on to discuss with Jonas how they'd hate it /so much/ if Jonas were to die and give them so many memories. He then thoughtfully excuses himself, saying he needs to contemplate what would happen if Jonas went away. A few hours later, the Giver shows Jonas what Release really means. While Jonas is distraught the Giver promises they can make a plan to make it better. Are you sure it isn't the Giver manipulating Jonas into the plan, after all? He even tells Jonas a few pages later that he has spent /years/ trying to figure out a way to change their society, but he didn't think it could be done until now.

I've thought about the general problem of making epiphanies seem more natural. /Ender's Game/ has a rather famous example; the main character responds by going to sleep, and lashing out at anyone who talks to him. It requires the combined effort of many people over many days just to get him back out of his bed.

****** Geez, looking for references in the original material? I can't compete with that!

It's strange that it seems much better thought out than I remember it being, perhaps it's because you only saw Jonas's point of view so you didn't really get to see the Giver's thought process in much detail. Or maybe my memory's bad, but I definitely was vaguely appalled at how simplistically the moral component of the story was written.

I don't really remember this. Is this when Ender is upset that they're rigging the game against him??

Gotta admit that unlike apparently everyone else in this subreddit I didn't "get" Ender's game, but I've been told you need to read it in your teens to really get it, and being an adult doesn't let you relate to Ender in the same way.

******* Yeah, seeing things through Jonas's POV does limit us. It makes one wonder... I'm surprised I haven't heard the theory that the Giver convinced Jonas to kill himself as part of a plot. I might just have to reread the entire story to see if it actually makes sense.

Ender's Game is probably easier to relate to when you are younger, but I didn't get a chance to read it myself l was an adult. The scene I was talking about is when Ender is finally told he was actually fighting the aliens the whole time. He basically shuts down in shock. Ah, I'm not sure I know what you mean by not 'getting' Ender's game, but I'm glad you mentioned it. Others who don't 'get' it are probably silent--they have nothing to say, or worse, they fear the social cost of not identifying with /every/ genius.

******** It's really funny, actually. I think Ender's Game is pretty meh (Rackham being kept alive with FTL was really cool, though!), but Speaker For The Dead is one of my favourite books ever, and I love the bizarre conservative wish fulfillment in the Shadow series (moving heaven and earth to save some fertilised embryos being the main plot point, and a gay character proudly saying he did his duty and married a lady and got her pregnant).

I also really liked the World Powers Competing For Supremecy type of plot. Basically Virlomi was a badass in that and I loved it/her.

*** You've had epiphanies like that, though, yeah? I mean it may have been a few years but all of us come to a number of realizations in our adolescence. Rather the definition of adolescence, even.

How did that go for you?

I mean, it seems pretty crazy from the outside and that's reinforced by how pig-headed we all are about doing it when somebody else tries to force us to... but in my experience, the actual process in the moment is pretty placid. Depressing, sometimes, but that's a placid feeling too.

The first sacred law is scary to break, but after that doesn't end the world the rest get easier. The hard part is picking up the pieces and establishing something new. Always more difficult to create than to destroy.

Now, fiction tends to want things to happen for a reason and tends to want that reason laid out pretty specifically and I do agree that The Giver falls down on that front. That said, the old man seemed very tired of the way things were. When I'm in that state, I'm especially susceptible to other plans.

In rational fiction, I recommend treating character arcs like any other aspect of the plot: Small steps with lots of foreshadowing, followed by a big payoff.

** so, i had an idea for a pathfinder setting.

basic concept, in the first age the kobold sorcerers became the world power, and through transkoboldism some of them became dragons. they created some transhuman servants (orcs and elves) as well. then came a war that ended their civilization, and left their towers of arcane power in ruin... and the dungeons are either fallout vaults to survive the magical apocalypse that used many powerful magical creatures, or military bases hidden underground to avoid scrying (including R&D labs to make more magical creatures).

this creates a wonderful setting for human heroes, to explore the lost ruins of a past civilization. and it also explains a lot of the nonsense in some dungeons- there was a war, and the ones making a lot of the old magic were a different species/culture.

this is the post-apocalyptic wasteland where dragons are few, kobolds are weak and hunted, and the great cities are now only ruins lost to time... and slowly, the humans are killing the remaining dragons faster than they breed. the old ways have been lost save for a few ancient dragon scholars, and the 5-headed postkobold dragon god, Tiamat, who is still angry that her civilization lost a major war. weapons left behind from the war range from owlbears and basalisks, to the tarrasque. it was a tippyverse of kobolds that fell to an apocalypse somehow.

and then we can add in a few things like infohazards... the feeblemind scroll is designed to destroy non-kobold minds that try to read that information. most deadly magical traps wont target a kobold (or transkobold such as a dragon), except for those in military instilations.

the war ended when non-kobold slave races somehow attained gods of their own, and many of the kobold civilizations gods were slain, driven insane, or imprisoned. and from there, civilization slowly began to recover as points of light....
