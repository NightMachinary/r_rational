** HTADDB is about 2/3 snark and digressions. Bitter is more straightforward plot. HTADDB is much longer and is rated higher on topwebfiction. Read Metaworld Chronicles on RoyalRoadL instead

** It's worth noting that Bitter is very slow in its progression. Although he posts a new chapter daily, each is quite small. Personally I like HTADDB better.

** They're not too close to TGS, but they're both great in their own way. I'd go with HTADDB, just for the snark and ridiculous plot.

** Bitter is definitely better IMO. I stopped following HTADDB then stuck in plot problem "protagonist become too strong". The only solution for such problem is an endless escalation, which become kind of cliche.

*** not the way moody is going with HTADDB... honestly I think most powers could be equally badass and it wouldn't break the world if some new summoned hero gets an awesome power (or an anti colin power) and tries to kill colin still I think too much random stuff is happening and the groundhog day power is not explained also the last arc was confusing as hell for the protagonist and me and the batman gambits where just too much for me

** I felt like neither of those were nearly as good, but of the two Bitter is more like TGS. He also has some short stories about a magical thief that you can dig up various places, those were good.
