Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** not exactly what you mean, but Discworld series by Terry Pratchett features a character, The Patritian, who is a hyper-rationalist/utilitarian autocrat, and rules a city state with an +iron fist+ exactly measured and impassionately pragmatic fist.

He is rationalist and utilitarian almost to the point of parody. He has exactly 2 traits that are not optimised for rational practicality: his love for crossword puzzles, and his hate of mimes.

*** You could take a look at [[https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/alan-kay-books][these recommended books by Alan Kay]]. If you haven't read it already, I recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker][The Power Broker]] by Robert Caro, and if you have read it, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson][his series on LBJ]]. Haven't heard of anyone who didn't get into those who is even slightly interested in nonfiction and got started with them.

I'd also recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041OT8O0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][The Devil in the White City]], which is a true achievement. It weaves together the story of the people who put together the Chicago World's Fair with the true story of a prolific serial killer who preyed on young women at the fair.

Edit: missed your yells at clouds angle, though honestly the above will be more useful to more people. But you could try [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULOPUY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony]], definitely a yells at clouds book but also pretty good.

**** If you enjoy historical nonfiction like /The Devil in the White City/, then I highly recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78508.The_River_of_Doubt][The River of Doubt]]/. It's the true story of Theodore Roosevelt's disastrous expedition to map an uncharted river in the Amazon.

Like /The Devil in the White City/, all of the dialogue and events in the novel are taken completely unaltered from historical documents such as diaries and letters. All in all, it's a very inspiring, but also cautionary tale about the furthest limits of human ambition.

From the blurb:

#+begin_quote
  After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil's most famous explorer, Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it. In the process, he changed the map of the western hemisphere forever.

  Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes and supplies to punishing whitewater rapids, and enduring starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning, and a murder within their own ranks. Three men died, and Roosevelt was brought to the brink of suicide. /The River of Doubt/ brings alive these extraordinary events in a powerful nonfiction narrative thriller that happens to feature one of the most famous Americans who ever lived.

It's a history of the Taiping Rebellion, the biggest war in the 19th century that you've probably never heard of.

Fanstastically gripping and readable, expertly weaves the social and economic background in with the more biographical story of the christian-prophet-modernizer-king who rose out of nothing to the head of one of the bloodiest revolts in human history, and transitions seamlessly to incorporating grand overviews of the military campaigns and international politics without losing sight of the individuals - generals, ambassadors, mercenaries, priests - involved.

*** Kinoko Nasu has some of the best rules based fantasy around, but he delights in non-omniscient veiwpoint characters, which means you have to peice things together yourself (or find someone who has already done so, I suppose). It's legitimately one of the best examples of this imo, but it's not delivered in the most reader friendly way so unless you also enjoy his works on their other merits (and the Fate works are good) then it might not be wort the investment.

You've had mistborn recced to you; that one is great. Stormlight Archives by the same author has a similarly great rules system but it's less well known in universe and thus less spelled out in text early on, also good fiction though.

Order of the Stick is a great webcomic example of this.

*** One of my absolute favorites is the RoyalRoad novel Dungeon Crawler Carl. The chapters up to the latest floor have been removed and published on Amazon, so you'll have to buy the first 3 volumes and then read the current chapters on RoyalRoad.

I really love the comedy, competence, and dark and tragic story, and how the novel perfectly blends it all together. That's an issue I typically find with more comedic novels, the comedy never blends well with the more serious story, and there's a lot of competence issues. Carl and his group is clever and makes the most out of the mechanics and abilities given within the System, and sometimes the comedy is even worked into major story moments brilliantly. A fantastic novel that I honestly consider to be unlike any other, with how unique and flavorful it is, but there's too much stuff to put into words and summarize here.

The only possible negative I'd attribute to Dungeon Crawler Carl is a slight lack of character writing, interaction, and building, but I think that's fine, given other characters don't matter too much and the concept of the story, and that enough is given about the main characters. Highly recommend this one.

*** If you can take translated Chinese webnovels, try Absolute Choice. It is incomplete and abandoned, but pretty big.

It is sort of a Chinese parody on Japanese tropes.

Official synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  A world filled with heroes with superpowers. A world attacked by calamity fiends. A modern world filled with wonders and dangers.

  Shi Xiaobai, a child from normal Earth, walked into such a world, proclaiming to be its king. But at the first signs of danger, he is forced to make a choice, one which he cannot refuse for time would repeat, making him face the choice again.

  He is not humble nor is he modest, but neither is he delusional. Yet, the Absolute Choice seems to make fun of him. Will the joke be on him or will he laugh at his opponents? There will be many watching his escapades, and there will be some joining him in his adventures.

  To see through the world and to grasp its truth, that is the destiny of the King.
#+end_quote

Due to a certain reason he presents himself as an extreme [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABniby%C5%8D][Chūnibyō]].

There are some plot holes, but overall author tried pretty hard to give explanations and keep stuff internally consistent.

Sample from the story:

#+begin_quote
  Before crossing over, he held a Seven Star Holy Sword in his hand while wearing Gold Dragonscale Armor. He stood on a Ten Thousand Tribulation Qilin, and he was battling the ultimate Great Demon God that was devouring the world. He remembered that, at his final moment, he had consumed his life force in a burning flame, issuing ‘Excalibur', immediately causing widespread destruction. The Demon God was annihilated. But at the same time, he was completely exhausted, resulting in him dying---in a game.

  When Shi Xiaobai thought of this, he sighed. “What I, Shi Xiaobai, was playing was not a game, but life.”

*** I read most of what's published. The setting is an isekai world with quasi-medieval tech and social arrangements. As a result, many tropes from isekai (e.g. the hero having a harem) and ways in which historical society sucked for women (power imbalances, limited professional opportunities aside from adventuring, access to resources mediated by men in their life) come up a lot.

The author (to my read) goes to pains to try and present these things as bad, both narratively and from the MC's modern point view. He also tries to present the women in the universe as people with agency who've been dealt a shitty hand rather than oppressed props to be saved.

I didn't read the discussion you're talking about last week, but if you're asking because mid-1900s-style sexism in SF/F bothers you, there's nothing like that in the story that will prevent you from enjoying it. If you're asking because you explicitly liked the way The Gods Are Bastards built a fantasy world that included a lot of modern/progressive/feminist social norms baked into the worldbuilding, this new story probably won't give you that. (Although we'll have to see what happens, it seems like the MC is planning to build a more modern/progressive/feminist social order, so maybe in a few months the plot will be more of that.)

*** u/Aqua-dabbing:
#+begin_quote
  so, has that changed since?
#+end_quote

I've been following this story since then and I love it. I think its sexism status has not changed, but it wasn't really as bad as you seem to remember.

As far as I understood from the thread at the time, the sexist thing that it does is to portray violence from men towards women as uniquely bad, and appeal to royalroad "white knight" sensitivities a lot. I agree that is sexist, but is not the usual kind of sexist.

Other than that, it depicts an incredibly sexist (and racist, and speciesist; and overall miserable) society. The protagonist is a modern-day Japanese protagonist that is kind of an asshole but not a terrible guy overall, so he is much less sexist than the setting (if at all).

The hero (not the protagonist) has a harem, which is sexist, but is there to follow Isekai tropes humorously.

The hero's party members are technically not all female, but pretty much. Also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/674405/bonus-2-in-which-the-heros-harem-go-to-bible-study][the author calls it a harem as well]]

*** If you know the author isn't sexist it wouldn't matter even if the work was sexist. I don't think it is though. If it was and you know the author isn't sexist you should just assume he has a point to make, or a particular theme he wants to portray..

​

I also don't get the people that complain about this kind of thing, most literature made before 1980s was sexist, with sexist authors, people still enjoy them and call some classics..

**** Generally I'd say that it's possible to criticize a literary work for its sexism while also enjoying it and/or calling it a classic. (Though most of the classics suck. Bite me, Wuthering Heights, you were shit when you were written and you've always been shit!) I can acknowledge the seminal place of Asimov in SF literature while also complaining that his writing is sexist as all fuck, and don't even get me started on Heinlein.

******** Societal roles aren't arbitrary at all in that sense; they're a reflection of the power dynamics of society. And in every society, there are plenty of people pointing out the nonsense of them, and at every timeframe of humanity there are less-fucked societies you can point to and say "Hey, this society is less fucked, why weren't you like that".

And you get silence, because they are all dead, of course.

***** Yes definitely criticizing something and enjoying it aren't mutually exclusive. But what I was referring here was more in a sense of 'not reading it because of the criticism', imho that's not optimal for many reasons.

​

In my view a work being 'insert criticism here' should not dissuade people from reading. Sure keep the criticism in mind let it alter your interpretation, avoid supporting the author if you feel the need to, but do not let it keep you from experiencing different types of fiction that could inspire you to create something new and fresh.

**** i agree with you. but i haven't read either of the author's works, just heard about them, so i can't speak for his character. and i actually have trouble reading some older fiction because of the sexism/racism/religious-prejudice thing, i have no problem when they don't focus too much on it and generally will ignore it and read them anyway if they do, but it does negatively impact my enjoyment enough that i prefer newer fiction.

Edit: to clarify, i tried reading The Gods are Bastards some years back, but couldn't get into it because while i like the "Loads and Loads of Characters" trope i dislike stories with too many MCs/POVs.

***** I agree I prefer newer fiction too, but mainly for a different reason. Imho writers have been getting better overtime because they learn and take inspiration from writers that came before them, a kind of writing tech if you will. So stories today tend to have better characters, editing and plots.

** Schild's Ladder. Really good, really out there ideas. Based on hard sci-fi yet ends up with things far more novel than any soft sci fi. Perhaps the most alien xenobiology that someone's actually tried to describe. Nice ideas about the far future. I liked the description of The Silencer physics laboratory. Lots of navalgazing about the nature of identity, not that that's a bad thing, the philosophy was often interesting. The conflict felt forced to keep the readers attention, it did work though, it's almost 4am here. I think it was a bit strange that there was only one laboratory described flying next to the horizon, lightspeed would have meant others wouldn't have played much of a role but I think they should have been talked about. There were some other inconsistencies and oddities but I guess every story has those.

** I recently watched the movie Palm Springs. It was very good, and somewhat rationalist! Spoilers for why, reveals a plot-point involved in resolution: They use the scientific method to escape the time-loop. Not just random mumbo-jumbo.

*** Ehhh. I loved it as a comedy and I'd second the rec on that basis, but I don't know if I'd call it rational, let alone rationalist. Setting up that kind of expectation might lead to disappointment.

The rules for time travel seemed to be inconsistent, for starters. IIRC they blow up the goat and the goat disappeared from the next time loop. They took that as proof that it worked and blow themselves up. But in the next loop, JK Simmons meets a version of the non-timelooped version of Nyles. Shouldn't he disappear from the loop like the goat did?(I might be misremembering this one, it's been a while)

Also the characters themselves. They left behind JK Simmons with just a voicemail to explain how to leave? What if he never got the voicemail for whatever reason? Why not just do it in the next loop after talking to him since there was absolutely no hurry to leave in that specific loop? Did they leave it to chance that they might consign this guy to an eternity in the loop just so they could leave as soon as possible?

Finally, the solution to the loop. The idea that one could make progress in a highly complex field of physics(starting as a complete beginner!) with zero ability to keep your notes and equations from one day to the next is kinda far fetched. But that's a minor quibble, tbf.

That reminds me, if you want a great, rational time travel movie, check out Predestination. It's on netflix in my country(canada).

**** Your criticisms are fair. I was really just impressed they did an empirical test of their solution to the time-loop instead if just deciding “hey, what if we need to do X” & having that work, so I say it was rationalist on the basis that the meta-strategy they use to get out would work in an actual time-loop situation, even if the specifics of the situation, mechanics, and solution don't really make sense.
