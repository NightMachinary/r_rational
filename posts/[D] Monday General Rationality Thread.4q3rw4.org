Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Hello I just found this sub through a link to The Mother of Learning and am interested in stories which have a well defined and immutable set of governing principals.

This is tied to a love for science which has lead me to obtain a Bs in physics and I am currently seeking to gain entry into grad school.

In my free time I love concocting fantasy ideas based around first defining a set of laws of physics and establishing a base line and history for that world.

I particularly enjoy redefining aspects of fantasy/myth/fiction into more scientific frame work my current brain child is a variation of fairies based on the ecology of ants and Termites and other social insects. the premise is a wasp derived social arthropod with a parisitoid ancestor. They have through evolution obtained the ability to steal and integrate DNA from other creatures into a malleable genome. This has produced strange specialized forms with well defined roles in the hive, notably The gene snatcher which is a genetic clone form the queen's DNA(a method employed by termites). They are responsible for collecting new DNA and injecting changeling larvae into developing young who will eventually be "called" back to serve the hive after learning from their society. The larvae which bypasses the immune system, injects itself into the developing notochord of vertebrate hosts where it sits dormant as the host develops while subtly spurring the host to be interested in new and different things. These creatures are also the only fey that are able to innovate and learn thus are very valuable to the hive but absolutely terrifying to other denizens of the world. I think I should stop here as it is getting pretty long...

I feel the social structure employed by social insects (as well as the very unusual mammals known as Naked Mole Rats who actually employ a similar structure) while they may individually lack in intelligence on a whole an emergent social cohesion forms allowing for great tasks. Ironic that I got into this after we found a termite infestation and myself discovering how little I knew about them.

*** Welcome! Always nice to see a new username around the forum.

Taking DNA from other living beings is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer][Horizontal Gene Transfer]]. Pretty much universal in bacteria, but also not unheard of in multicellular beings. And parasites that modify the host's behaviour are unusual, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-altering_parasites_and_parasitoids][they do exist]] and they're an excellent device for science-fiction stories.

Looking forward to seeing some of your stories!

**** Yep both traits are found in biology behavior modification is actually more common than you might think though and there is some evidence that it might be present in humans due to the higher incidence of risky behavior among people infected by Toxoplasmosis.

There is also claims that certain viruses may make their hosts more social during the incubation period.

As for stories I actually have little experience writing charecters and social interactions so I don't know how it will turn out. I will certainly need help that is for sure.

Most of my ideas are built for a fiction that is a mix of high fantasy(thus separate laws of physics) and perhaps a bit of science fiction. The issue is I can't stop with one world so I have actually a bunch of separate developing worlds that have actually fed of each other over the years with some branches dying and others splitting off.

Off the top of my head I can think of

-A dystopian society based around a viral based vampire "species" that "breeds" through infecting a suitable host

-A high fantasy world under threat from a extraterrestrial foe. I have the world structure for this as well as general events pretty well laid out but the little details beyond that are near impossible for me to figure out how to do. (I have a Prologue made and an idea for how it will end)

-A "modern" fantasy world suffering after a long environmentally cataclysmic war built of both nationalism colonialism and strong species oriented racial tensions. Complete with biological and chemical "super weapons", genocide and thermonuclear warfare. The main set point is the next generation after this war ended due to a bio-engineered virus mutating and becoming more virulent than expected, devastating all factions and forcing a truce. the surviving hominids are devastated such that elves have been forced to turn to cloning, dragons are solely able to reproduce parthenogenetically as the male line (or Z chromosome) is extinct.

I come up with so many ideas I can't keep up... to be honest...

Are people here familiar with White Wolf and the Storyteller System?

I was originally attracted to the publisher by Mage: the Ascension, which promised a tale of competing ideologies/ontologies and their paths to a transhuman state. And...well, you could do that.

But the story that White Wolf has generally promoted was "Greater powers than humans have would make for a Crapsack World, subtly or grossly worse than our own." This makes some sense when the powers belong to nonhuman entities with different interests than ours, but it was applied pretty universally.

Anyone else have this frustration? And/or run a "progressive" game that dragged the Worlds of Darkness out of...um, Darkness?

I've had very few chances to run games--there are few gamers where I live and my internet access is usually limited.

*** I'm ashamed of not reading your post earlier (depression hasn't left yet) but if you want a rational World of Darkness, there's a foundation left by Anders Sandberg on fleshing up The Technocracy.

As others have posted, World of Darkness follows the horror genre so it plays on the world being crapsack and going worse by the day but The Technocracy is the group of mages that want to improve the world, have actually won the Ascension War and are actively trying to bring post humanity and ascension to all of mankind through the use of science, rational thinking and technological wonders.

I'm a huge fan of the technocrats which are usually seen as antagonists but from their side, they're trying to help mankind but struggle with lack of resources and corruption among their ranks. I think they're perfect for a rational setting.

You can read more about them on [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090614202752/http://hem.bredband.net/arenamontanus/mage_technocracy.html][Anders Mage page using the Wayback Machine]].

My favorite are the New World Order which use psychology to improve mankind from cognitive bias and lead them to a happier and more productive life or Iteration X which use technology to enhance humans using cybernetic implants to create cyborgs. Iteration X aims for the merging of human and machine.

Anders Sandberg is a fellow researcher that was my first introduction to Transhumanism and rationality.

I think a rational mage chronicle can be run on their side and makes for a great beginning.

Another option is to run it with the mages finding these documents and having them question what they're fighting for. I loved Mage the Ascension because each side makes a good point and while it proposes playing the Traditions as the good guys, from a rational point of view the Technocrats actually make some really good points and are the good guys according to themselves.

Also I suggest you try using nWoD mage system as its far more stable than the old version. Dice rolls don't make much sense in the old World of Darkness while personally I found the new mage much more boring but with a more stable roll system.

** I find myself more and more derisive of media since I got into rationality (and I'm not even that into it, really, considering I haven't really bothered to supplement myself with any sort of learning materials/nonfiction to promote my understanding)

I'll scoff at things that are stupid. Or characters being stupid. Or just...anything being stupid in a work. But the thing is, I don't think stupid should equate to bad in the same way that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools][tropes are not bad.]]

Of course, there's stupidity and then there's /stupidity/. For example, there's moments that don't make sense or seem "stupid" that may just be to build dramatic tension, impart emotion, etc. For example, concepts like last words where someone says something and smiles even when cut in half or run through by tons of sword. Implausible IRL? Sure. But not necessarily stupid in the same way that Voldemort branding his followers with a distinctive tattoo in a visible part of the body is (Thief's Downfall, for those people who snark about concealment and such). And even in that sense, the Dark Mark, while stupid from a rational perspective, serves its use wonderfully in story as a device for JK Rowling. It's clearly evil, it acts as a cheap pager, and it's branding for Voldie's side. In both the literal sense and the marketing sense.

So....not sure where I was going with this; I guess I'm just annoyed by my newfound tendency to feel exasperated at stupid moments in fiction that may not be completely adherent to real world intelligence but do quite well as dramatic devices. Anyone else feel like this?

I'm trying to read up on recent political events and determine whether I've been backing the wrong horse. But all the communities I'm already part of are ones that largely agree with me, and I don't know where to find well-researched counterarguments that come from a place of reasonable discussion.

Similarly dividing issues into sides can be counterproductive, but at the same time useful at times. Sure every issue has hundreds of possible policy stances around it, but that doesn't mean we can't classify them into multiple camps. Indeed humans can't deal with a sea of anecdotes so we need to classify stuff somewhat.

The key to remember is things like right and wrong, good, evil, moral and amoral are all subjective terms based on our societal cultural norms and upbringing.

****** My apologies, I am new to Reddit and accidentally attached this to your comment instead of the original.

However, in regard to the specific example you mention, my experience with these people suggests a more complex situation.

- They place a very low value on life without current technological comforts.

- Conversely, they strongly believe in technological advance (though frequently without much individual understanding of science).

- They have heard many alarmist predictions that we must go back to a thoroughly nontechnological lifestyle to save ourselves. (Hollywood environmentalism, mostly.)

- They are willing to deceive themselves and/or others to preserve their comfort.

In less fancy language: they believe that you want to condemn their children to an indefinite miserable pre-renaissance existence (or worse); they believe that extinction would be better than such a fate. They figure we may as well enjoy ourselves now and forget about the looming dangers insofar as we're able. Those who are not fooling themselves about it are willing to fool you.

(A third class exists which is honest; you can find them among right-wing survivalists, the sort who hoard resources to prolong the good times as long as possible.)

An alternate stance also exists:

- People prefer not to give up their luxuries.

- Therefore government control is required to enforce environmental laws.

- It is more likely that left-wing totalitarians want more control over our lives than that the environment is in serious danger.

These two are not completely incompatible in practice, and one finds them together.

None of this is particularly sane, but problem is with their relation to the evidence, not the arguments themselves.

The same argument could be made back at you. What if making full use of the resources available to us here and now (or over the next double-handful of decades) gives us the best chance at hitting a critical threshold of knowledge and industry to begin colonizing off-world, and thereby massively reducing our chance of extinction?

Alternatively, what level of quality of "long term" do you think can be achieved for 7 billion people with no use of non-renewables, and with no undesirable side effects to the environment?

*** I wouldn't rely on the internet at all, to be honest. One thing I've found useful when thinking about complicated and controversial things is to basically list out as many (semi-reasonable) possibilities as I can think of ahead of time, even if they are somewhat stupid, and then consider various themes and assumptions common to the views I find most compelling. I mean "compelling" in an almost narrative sense here, which means sometimes views I do not agree with much still count as "compelling". Generally there are convergences that emerge from across many very different compelling viewpoints.

In other words, I advise that you don't look at individual arguments as you happen to come across them online, instead you should think about networks of arguments that exist within the space of all possible arguments. You do need to draw limits on what you consider somewhere, but if you don't rely exclusively on any particular point of view then weird outlier ideas cannot do as much to hurt you so you can explore further away from your preconceptions than you might think.

- I started on Buproprion in November 2015. The 150mg doses didn't do much, but when I missed days those days were noticeably worse. I don't remember when, specifically, I switched to 300mg, but it did make a noticeable difference, mood-wise. It's harder to say what it did for productivity (see below).
- I tried to make myself throw together a simple game for April first. I couldn't do anything but write a bunch of unused code-fragments.
- On April sixth, someone decided to put up a 24 hour game competition. I managed to submit an entry, then kept expanding on it after the contest was over, pretty much for the next month or so.
- None of the other standard intervention attempts (which more or less include diet and going outside, since I didn't have many other options) didn't show any reliable results, as usual.
- On May 15, I arrived at the [[http://louisianacenter.org][Louisiana Center for the Blind]]. I have been trying to put together something coherent to describe the first month there but it is not coming along very quickly. Suffice it to say, it's... different. My feelings are mostly positive so far but "mostly" is not "entirely".
- LCB is a 6-9 month program. It only took a week for me to go from "too pathetic to leave the house" to "I guess I'll go to Wal-mart this afternoon." Sweet merciful cool breeze in July, does that make a difference! (Also I feel like it's weird that I like going to Wal-mart, of all places, but whatever.)
- The most obvious changes from home? Being forced to interact with people on a daily basis for most of the day, lots of walking (the apartments are half a mile from the center, which probably isn't much compared to more realistic situations but it's a considerable difference from anything I've dealt with before), and the apartments do not have free internet and I don't feel like paying $50/month and so internet is less trivial than usual. Oh, and not so monotonous as home.
- Sleep was still being uncooperative, in spite of a fixed schedule. So I tried Melatonin and it seems to have helped some. My body still seemed determined to only sleep for 5 hours, though, even though I got the timing fixed.
- Productivity is not solved. There are still bad days. But I think it's safe to say it's improved dramatically. Over the course of one weekend, I wrote about as much as I had in the past 3 years put together, as an example. I'm trying to experiment with analyzing photos so I don't have to either hire someone or spend way too much time on calculations and debugging to do simple character animation. Etc. Not exactly 2001-2005, but the past month alone makes 2016 better than 2014 or 2015 in the productivity department.

Which has the bigger impact: Buproprion, or LCB? Are they both necessary components? How do sleep and the internet fit into this?

Food quality is not irrelevant, per se, but it's only a decisive factor if I'm drowning in sugar on a daily basis. Even then, I was in a hurry and just bought a couple candy bars at the dollar store for lunch yesterday, and the mental effects that I noticed were far less severe than I expected. (I need to shop at healthier places. I'll note, though, that I was at the dollar store because apparently my already impossibly skinny waistline has been shrinking dramatically since I got here and I neglected to bring a belt. I blame the walking for 3 hours a day in Louisiana summer.)

I cannot conclude that anything sustainable is to come of this, and I worry that the improvements, though rather dramatic, are not quite so dramatic as I want them to be (*mumbles something about gift horses*). Still, mentioning LCB in front of someone who would not make it easy to chicken out of enrolling was probably the best decision I've made in a while.

** "No matter how smart you may be, no matter how much money you may have at you disposal, no matter strength of arms or argument, you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. For all the bombs we have dropped, for all the lives that were lost, in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. There is not enough money in the world to truly command and control a populace. The best you can do, all you can hope to do, is create a situation where it is easier for people to do what you want than it is for them to do what you don't. Then no one will seek to oppose you or thwart you aim because it appears you are merely helping them to do what they really want to do. There is, in the end, no defense against cooperation." - Patrick E. McLean, How to Succeed in Evil

I would attribute that to fighting on two fronts, fighting Russia during the winter, fighting Russia with the US's lend lease backing, and the fact that the US had almost as much industrial capacity as the entire rest of the world at the time. I think with only one of these things to deal with, the might have held ground and built a longer lasting regime (at least on the order of the USSR in longevity).

I think maybe the USSR might be a better example for "you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. "

**** In context, it's a speech given by a former British intelligence agent to his son, who grew up to be a consultant for comic book supervillains. The book is kind of a rationalist comedy, with a Quirrelmort-like protagonist marveling at the stupidity of everyone around him and trying to manipulate them to his own ends, only to fail because he can't comprehend just how irrational people are. I haven't finished it yet, but so far I like it even if it's rather mean-spirited and cynical.

***** Not to say that it isn't a great story, but I'd like to no longer see the socially retarded rationalist as a main character. I think it would really help combat the impression of the Vulcan Rationality trope.

****** It's a dark comedy where the chief source of humor is people making horrifically bad decisions that hurt themselves and other people, but they don't care because they're stupid and/or insane. It isn't for everyone, I'm surprised even I like it, but I got to listen to the audiobook for free and have enjoyed it so far.
