** This story seems to be rather basic and unoriginal at its face. On the other hand the way I read it Anak seems to be rather tacked on and the name of the story doesn't make much sense to me either. Am I missing something?

*** The story's intended to be a mythologized version of the dawn of the scientific method and a deconstruction of feudalism---conventional fantasy in my view has a tendency to romanticize a period that I don't think deserves to be romanticized. Stories like The Hobbit tend to carry a subtext that industrial civilization ruined some agrarian idyll, and this is essentially a "take that" to that perspective. The characters are deliberately archetypes used for a didactic purpose and the writing is strongly influenced by Ayn Rand with some influence from Eliezer; I can see why that'd be polarizing. "Utopians" is referring to the worldview held by Ada, i.e. that creating a positive society on earth is possible; "last" is being used in the sense of "previous". As a member of a relatively privileged caste, Ada is largely insulated from the full consequences of feudalism---Anak is intended to show the bottom rung of the system.

**** Eh. It's less that I disagree with it and more that it is too on the nose and preachy without bringing anything new to the table.

Nonconforming Girl = Smart savior scientist & Priest = Irredeemable Insane Guy. Oh, and there's a random irrelevant slave added to show just how shitty The System is and nothing much else.

Well, at least the writing itself was decent and flowed well, even if I didn't like the plot.

*** Hadn't heard of the book; I based it on the same event though (my source was just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak]])
