Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I went out to investigate crashes at some faraway places in the nice, pretty, photogenic, lush, part of the state I live in.

As promised, here's some photos I took. I lost the ability to put captions on the pictures, so the ones that don't have captions are assorted road sections, wildflowers, and a few photos of kangaroos running in front of our car. They're similar to deer in the USA in that they are often hit by cars and damage the car. We probably had about 5 run in front of us, and I caught two of them with the camera. They are generally only active at dawn and dusk, but on the second morning we left the hotel at 6am, so that's why we saw so many.

** I live somewhere within a 50 mile radius of Charlotte, North Carolina. Florence is obviously not going to be as bad here as it'll be in other areas of NC/SC, but if it follows its projected track, it's going to be to our southwest, putting us in the northeastern quadrant of the thing. That's the part of the storm you're not supposed to be in, and it's projected to still be a relatively powerful tropical storm by the time it hits us. There's a strong possibility of 10+ inches of rain and 50+ mph winds, and being to the northeast of the center means there's a non insignificant probability of tornadoes forming in the area. Hugo came through the area in '89 a few months after I was born so I don't remember it, but I've seen pictures and heard stories. I have memories of Fran in '96 and Floyd in '99. Trees are gonna come down, and we're gonna be without power for at least a couple of days, possibly longer since restoration efforts are going to be focused on the areas to the east and southeast that were legitimately decimated. /And/ we're living at my grandmother's house at the moment, and because of where she lives it's always taken her a week to have her power restored after these big events, so there's no telling how long we'll be without power.

Speaking of living at my grandmother's house... If these emmer effers would've closed on our house at the end of July like they were supposed to instead of getting /two/ extensions, we'd've already moved and we'd be living in New York right now. Our house faces west (technically "west by north"). There's a 50 foot tall tree about /five feet/ in front of the house. I /think/ the wind should be blowing from east to west, so if the tree gets knocked over it'll fall away from the house, but I'm not certain, and the possibility of tornadoes adds to the uncertainty because there's no real guarantee of which way the wind will be blowing in localized areas. They're living in the house and renting while we live at my grandmother's house (we're making a $30,000 profit and we're going to use part of that as the down payment on the new house so we can't actually move until after closing) and the power's going to be out for a significant amount of time so if the tree falls we might not know about it until several days later. If that goddamned tree falls on that goddamned house... We're going to be fine, but I'm incredibly anxious at the possibility of this goddamned storm effing everything up.

*** Might be worth thinking about cutting off a few branches from the tree. With fewer branches and leaves to catch the wind, it should have better odds of making it through the storm, surely?

**** We don't have the equipment to do that and don't know anyone who does, and we don't have the money to hire someone to do it.

As it were, over the last 20 hours the predictions for this area have changed a lot, it's heading a bit farther southwest than they thought it would and it's also going to turn north slightly later, which means it'll have been travelling over land for longer by the time it gets here so it'll be a bit weaker and also a bit farther away. At the time I made that comment, a lot of spaghetti models showed it heading more directly west and turning north sooner, which would've put it significantly closer to our house after having traveled over land for less time. The official forecast had the thing pointed on a direct path from the ocean to the city I live in at one point, so I freaked out a bit (it would've had to have made landfall at Myrtle Beach for that to happen and it ended up happening farther north near Wilmington, but it still could've turned south and followed the coast before making landfall again). We're still going to get a significant amount of rain and wind (and my grandmother's house is still almost certainly going to lose power for an uncomfortably long period of time), but we're not going to get hit by a full-on tropical storm, just a tropical depression. I think the tree'll be fine, it's old enough to have gone through this level of weather more than a few times.

And now having typed all this and then checked out the local news, it looks like 10,000+ customers around the Charlotte area have lost power and a notable number of trees are down. So who knows? This stupid storm has been weird and hard to predict this entire time.

Ah? That's good, at least.

I hope your power loss is either for a comfortably short amount of time or, better yet, avoided completely.

****** Thanks. Power came back on literally like 5 minutes ago, it went out less than half an hour after I posted that last comment, we were only without power for right about 24 hours. Florence apparently went WAY farther west than they thought it would, it barely grazed us. They were predicting Sunday was going to be the worst day for this area, but it looks like the worst already passed with just a little bit of strongish wind and slightly more forceful than average rain.

Relevant results so far comprise one brief forum discussion (I didn't bother to save a link to it) and one imitation story (with Sasuke as the protagonist; deleted after a single chapter, which I downloaded), IIRC.

I also have one for ="ShaperV"=, but it's returned no results, IIRC.

** [[https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/autos/aaa-cheap-gasoline/index.html][Apparently]], discount-branded gasoline is significantly worse for engines than is gasoline distributed by established brands.

What gasoline stations do you pass on your daily commute? In my ~1.5 hours per day of driving, I see:\\
- Morning\\
- - Established\\
- - - Lukoil****\\
- - Discount\\
- - - U. S. Gas (2)\\
- - - US Petroleum\\
- Afternoon\\
- - Established\\
- - - Citgo*\\
- - - Wawa****\\
- - - Sunoco\\
- - Discount\\
- - - U. S. Gas (2)**\\
- - - Amera

There also used to be a Conoco station on my morning path, but it closed some months ago. There's one other closed (and being demolished) gas station on my morning path, but it's been closed (and had all branding removed) since before I started commuting (~1.75 years ago), so I don't know to what brand it belonged.

*I use this Citgo station because it comes soon after a Wendy's restaurant, so I can eat a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger™ while my gasoline is being pumped, rather than (1) messily and dangerously fumbling with the well-stuffed burger** while I'm driving or (2) spending a few extra minutes on parking at Wendy's.

**I find the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger (beef patty, lettuce, tomato, and bacon) significantly less flat, and therefore more difficult to handle, than the McChicken (chicken +tendie+ patty and shredded lettuce). (From my afternoon path: one McDonald's is accessible directly from the highway; one Wendy's requires a minor detour; and a Burger King, a McDonald's, and two Wendy's restaurants require major detours.)

***Yes, I directly pass /four/ U. S. Gas stations (not to be confused with U. S. /A./ Gas). (Two of them---one on each leg of my commute---were Citgo until a few months ago. Maybe the change has something to do with the upheaval in Venezuela, which owns Citgo.)

****Lukoil and Wawa are established gasoline brands but are /not/ part of the Top Tier group that was tested by AAA.

*** On the burger handling note, I agree that the mcchicken is easier to handle. I don't mind squishing a burger, I think that could work with a junior bacon so long as there is not too much mayo.

Also, I want to share a link re: commuting. [[https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/]]

It's obviously not going to apply to everyone (the driving could be necessary for the job itself, cannot relocate house, etc.), but I think it is helpful to consider the time costs alongside gas and mileage costs when budgeting for car driving.
