** While this story's expanding its focus, I'm afraid that it's in my mind starting to lose sight of the gem that's at its core. I wasn't expecting to read about Sombra and Bellatrix (why's she attacking Hogwarts now anyway?); I was expecting to - and looking forward to - read about Harry and Hermione and the Mane Six.

I hope that after this two-chapter digression, you'll be returning to those central plot arcs?

*** I agree 100%. Originally these last three chapters were going to be one long chapter entitled "Now You Know How Nice It Feels", because I didn't want to digress too far from the main theme of the ponies, but I also needed to establish some backstory so the ending arc would make sense.

But the chapter kept getting longer and longer, and somewhere around 20,000 words in, I made the call to split it into three chapters. I've tried to keep the delays between publishing the three chapters fairly minimal so as to avoid dragging the arc out.

Incidentally, I allude to the fact that they're an arc in the chapter titles, "Have You Heard, Part 1", "The Voyage", and "Have You Heard, Part 2" are the ending three tracks on the Moody Blues album "On The Threshold of a Dream", which when played back-to-back-to-back form one long song, (which is the lyric where the original title was drawn from). That song was also featured in a certain TV show in a certain context which is particularly relevant here.

** This chapter was sensational. Don't stress about people saying the plot is wandering too far, I have faith that both destination and path are well planned.

** This story kind of lost me after a while. I feel like it's too much has been changed from both hpmor and mlp for me to really get into it properly.
