** In case you dropped this fic and haven't looked back. I took a while to update but it did.

EDIT: How do I add both url in title and a text post below title? I have seen it happen.

Another EDIT: Not my fic in case it wasn't obvious

*** I don't think that's possible. You can have a text post with a link, though.

(Really glad you didn't abandon the fic :))
