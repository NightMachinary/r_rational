Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I've been following Dota 2's The International (the $25 million MOBA tournament that just ended) and the past two years have seen a surprising effort by OpenAI in developing an AI that can defeat professional players. Last year, the AI demolished a pro in a 1v1, mainly by stint of inhuman precision and mechanics. However after a year of advancing the AI to 5v5s, the AI was capable of defeating a ragtag bunch of 5 former pros/casters (all in the 99.5th percentile of players, though the game had many restrictions). Yet at The International, with some of the restrictions changed, they were unable to eke out a single win despite giving a very competitive showing. Dota analysts noted unusual spell/item usage (seemingly for short term benefits) and an inability to adapt on the fly to human strategy once the humans found flaws in the AI's behaviors.

OpenAI's site describes how they developed the AI's neural network for playing Dota and it seems to mainly revolve around incentives and rewards. The AI started with no knowledge and accrued 180 years of game experience using a huge amount of CPU/GPU's. As a layman with no knowledge of AI development, I find it both impressive and not-so-impressive at the same time. It feels like true AI is still so very far away when this current AI works like a pigeon. Of course, the game is many magnitudes more complex than anything you'd train a pigeon for, but the developers did note an issue with the tradeoff between shortsightedness and incomprehensibility (if the timeframe for determining long-term incentives is set too liberally, i.e. from "making actions which occurred soon before positive reward more likely and those soon before negative reward less likely"). They stated that the AI starts with random parameters and has to learn better parameters over time and that giving it "instructions" can limit it in ways, but I wonder if there's a balance to be achieved; if we want AI to approximate human-ish intelligence, maybe we should borrow from the human learning process where we're taught things or pick up heuristics that are either useful or we can rationally unlearn or improve if it's later insufficient?

(edit: last sentence was a mess)

*** I really think the courier usage was vital for how OpenAI beat humans the first few games, and the rules change for couriers made all the difference in the world in how the AI played and how the humans played.

For those with less contextual knowledge: In regular Dota 2 there is a unit called a 'courier' that each team has one of. This unit's job is to ferry items from places that you can buy items (your main base, a specific shop outside your base) to players. It's very fragile and can be killed and takes a long time to respawn, so you can't really use it during fights or near opponents at all. As well as more permanent items, you can use the courier to transfer consumable items that give temporary healing to your heros, but because there is one courier for the entire team you have to plan and share it and use it intelligently. Most teams in current professional dota 2 allow their 'mid' player to monopolize courier use for ferrying regen and items for the first few levels.

Anyways, in the OpenAI experiment, for the first set of games against a ragtag bunch of humans, every player and every bot had an invincible (not fragile!) courier dedicated to their own use. The openAI players used theirs to *constantly* ferry regeneration items to themselves, in a way that would be totally impossible in regular dota 2 for side lanes. This sufficiently changed the way the game was played that the early and midgame bore a lot less resemblance to regular dota 2 in terms of strategy and play, and also warped later stages somewhat. By making the game into something no human player had experienced before, it naturally gave bots a large advantage - they were constantly doing risky things and trading life by diving under towers etc. because the humans didn't really adapt to the odd environment well in the time allotted. When the bots played against the professional teams, at TI, instead of this they had only one courier per team, which made the game resemble normal dota 2 a lot more, and humans were way ahead of bots.

Looking forward to seeing if they can develop a more sophisticated AI system than what they had this time round, and maybe take matches off of humans in completely normal play with no restrictions.

PS: The grand finals were AMAZING this year, and also most of the other matches were really good too. OG vs LGD in the Upper Bracket and also Grand Finals were each an amazing set of games, well worth the time to watch.

This is unfortunately a consequence of the design of the AIs in question. In short (as detailed on OpenAI's page) the AIs can play a game, and /then/ learn from that game; they /can't/ learn on-the-fly. And all those hundreds of years of automated playing-and-learning on all those hundreds of GPUs will be against other versions of the same AI. (No doubt they've mitigated this last point by including in the training matches against their own in-house human players).

Sure, they can start the game with good plans, fallback plans, plans in case the opponent does /this/ or in case the opponent does /that/; but an opponent who finds a weakness in the OpenAI's strategy that genuinely didn't crop up in training is going to be able to exploit that right unto the end of that game.

However, that same weakness won't be there the following year; because if OpenAI is at all sensible, they're recording that game and adding it to the training data. This allows the next version of the AI to exploit the same strategic weaknesses - run that AI against successive versions of itself for a few iterations and you'll end up with an AI that either does not have the same strategic weaknesses, or is able to recover from the exploitation of those weaknesses. It might not be able to adapt on-the-fly, but it most certainly /will/ adapt between games.

**** Yeah, they did mention somewhere that the AI was locked to a specific version, but I guess I was expecting some more complex counter-strategies after so much accumulated game experience. Perhaps it's a limitation of playing mostly against itself. Even if they can include the few training matches against humans, it might not provide enough data as it seems to be learning through trial-and-error ad infinitum. One caveat is that the version they used only had about a week to adapt to the new rules, so it might be possible that they would have shored up those weaknesses given more time.

Part of that's going to be limited by the complexity of the world. I've never played DOTA myself, but I understand from context that it's a pretty complex world; and increasing the complexity means that the AI needs to increase the amount of training it requires to reach the same level of expertise.

Of course, playing mostly against itself doesn't help (unless it first learns how to exploit those flaws, it won't learn how to react to someone else exploiting those flaws) and neither does only having a week to learn in; but those two points just increase the odds of there being exploitable flaws in the AI in the first place. The inability to adapt to novel strategies on-the-fly is, unfortunately, pretty much baked in to the architecture that they're using.

I did 600 words on Saturday, that was the first writing I've done in 2 months

***** Here's something that works really well for me. Set a super-low effort daily goal for yourself. Very often, the hardest part of any daily endeavor is simply motivating yourself to get started. When I needed to exercise daily, I set a goal of doing only 5 push-ups. It was so simple and easy to do that I never missed a day without doing 5 push-ups. However, despite only needing to do 5, I often did a lot more exercise than just the push-ups. Granted there were plenty more days where I did just the 5 push-ups, but I did a lot more workouts than if I was trying to motivate myself into a full workout plan.

So for yourself, I strong suggest that you set a required daily goal of writing a sentence minimum each day no matter what.

*** I'm in pretty much the same boat as you. I don't have /advice/ here or anything like that, since I'm still fighting lack of motivation with few results, but congrats on putting in some time at all. That's definitely the first step, at least.

Best of luck with your own struggles, I need to make a schedule.
