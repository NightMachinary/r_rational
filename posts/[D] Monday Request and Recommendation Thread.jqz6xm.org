Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two][Copy, Paste: The Misadventures of Milo Two]] has been really fun. It's rational adjacent, but in a sorta satirical way. The protagonist is a munchkin at heart and tries to find ways to misuse his skills, and discovers some cool stuff for sure. He also thinks he's being logical when he makes impulsive assumptions that are almost definitely wrong, and then when he's proved wrong by his assumptions he's like "Yeah that was pretty stupid."

It almost feels like a jab at this community haha. Milo is 30, tall but pretty thin. He works out, but he isn't a powerlifter. At the start he's unemployed, and has been jumping from one job to another for most of his life. He's got a very short attention span and gets bored quickly. When he's offered the choice of getting power he impulsively goes the mage route because of the cool spells he'd get, and then tries to munchkin those spells. This almost kills him a few times because he's too busy trying to munchkin his skills instead of paying attention to his surroundings. He sits down and tries to make a focused plan for his future, and then immediately breaks it when he gains options to choose new skills. It's more of a jab at the royalroad community than here, but still, it's been a fun story. I'd recommend, at least as far as it's entertaining. There has been indications that the story and characters are deeper than they appear, and I've been liking the way the author drip feeds Milo's current state of mind chapter by chapter.

*** I second this, It's been a rather good read so far. My only criticism is that the protagonists' power level feels a bit "cheated". Yes, he has knowledge that puts him far above the 99th percentile when it comes to average scientific understanding of a medieval world but he unlocks frankly ridiculous abilities (notably Skim which is potentially "gamebreaking" and Fetch Book) within a couple days of arrival and almost instantly becomes far more effective in all classical adventuring roles (scouting, fighting, ranged, utility, etc) than his companion, Backlebutt, who's been living in the world for decades but is seemingly completely combat ineffective because he doesn't have a bow.

This falls a bit into one of my pet peeves: Authors (often subconsciously) assuming that people in medieval or primitive settings are stupid when this is just plain wrong--in fact there's a reasonable argument for stating that people used to be more intelligent than they are today because their ability to think correlated more directly to their survival odds. Yes, people in ye' ole' times didn't have as much knowledge as we do today, but it's not like they wouldn't be able to munchkin a system

**** I agree with the criticism, at least tentatively. We don't really know where Milo lands on the power scale yet, we only have one person to gauge his strength against, and give the social restrictions that person is apparently under, he is probably on the lower end of the scale. For all we know Milo may be decidedly average, at least for the upper class.

That said, its my favorite new read from royalroad recently, so I hope it stays good.

**** People in medieval or primitive settings are /ignorant/ generally speaking. They (serfs only) lack knowledge because of a lack of formal education. This generally means they are dumber. Not because all people were just dumber but because education correlates very well with iq.

A average peasants ability to think does not correlate with survival. They never gained any survival skills period. Because all they did was farm or die from preventable diseases. A 14 year old kid from Indiana has a better chance of living on their own. Because peasants stay on a farm for 30 years and then die. They never needed to or were approaching any kind of intelligence. Deliberately. The noble class withheld any form of literacy or education and filled their heads with religion and dogma.

Peasants are stupid. 1v1 modern people beat peasants in every metric. They are just shitty versions of us.

***** Your point is valid, but it's not quite what I'm getting at. Specifically, it's when a protagonist gets isekai'd, lands in a "System" world, and then, first thing, goes "a-duh, why don't you just do X to get super powerful Y. I am the first person in history to think about super obvious Z, now bow before my genius, because there's no way that you rubes would've ever thought about this completely novel idea without me" and then you hear the collective forehead slapping of every native king, archmage, multi-millennia old elf, etc. who somehow missed something so obvious that some random 21st century white dude figured out within days of arriving in a completely alien world with alien rules.

Peasants are dumb makes sense. Peasants even existing at all makes 0 sense in a litrpg world. It's one of the cornerstone reasons why I detest that genre. It has almost no internal logic or coherence. It's ideas from an intentionally unrealistic place (video games) placed into a setting with /presumably/ some realism.

******* It's not impossible to write it so it has some self consistency. E.G. you don't pick a class, the system assigns it to you based on your upbringing when you come of age. The peasant class provides highly limited advancement opportunities, and peasant parents raise peasant children. That would create even less social mobility than reality, since the nobles, or even the yeomanry would be stronger, smarter, etc than the peasantry.

However I would still expect levels to have an effect here, a small number of high level peasants should be more effective at running a farm than a large number of low level peasants. Which should have major effects on the worldbuilding.

Because every single idea isn't thought out. Nobody thinks of the consequences or reaction to levels. Nobody considers the impact or changes it will make in world building.

Desirable by whose criteria? If a [Yeoman Farmer] is more productive as a [Peasant], but also has a good chance of raising [Blacksmiths], [Merchants], [Monks], various adventurer classes, etc. and thus requires constant incentives, legal rights and privileges, etc in order to induce them to ensure they continue to produce generations of farmers who'll till the [Baron]'s land. Maybe the Baron would rather have the [Peasants].

I think this Barron is making a bad choice, in the same way that any real world ecconomy deciding to not educate the working class is a bad idea. But history shows that bad decision can shape society for a long time.

Or take take that other set undesirable classes, criminal classes. If the [Barron] is oppressive the [Peasants] might encourage their kids to perform minor crimes as one of the few ways out. A [Blacksmith] might want payment to take an apprentice, but any kid can try to nab a pheasant in the [Barron]'s forest and unlock [Poacher]. And that's a stepping stone to a real criminal career if they can level up enough to evolve the class.

Maybe the reason the [Barron] prefers peasants is because in the right circumstances a [Yeoman] can evolve into [Prince of Thieves] and start turning Peasants and basic outlaw classes into [Merry Men], and before you know it you've got a kingdom scale threat.

********** Those are all wonderful ideas. If the baron existed. If he had the ability or power to hold land. If 90% of the population didn't have the ability to completely override any authority he has given sufficient time.

The landed gentry are not capable of holding land in a litrpg society. They shouldn't even be able to be classed into because that assumes they have ever existed in the first place. Second of all the ability for farmers to even function in a litrpg society is also super questionable given the existence of 1000 monsters per each farm and a lack of sufficient manpower to ever cover all the farms needed to feed a country.

A litrpg country would be fed by monster meat, magic, or not fed at all.

You have reached the first layer of making a consistent and logical world, the appearance. A litrpg world is incapable of holding up to any scrutiny or basic logic beyond appearing to have some.

There's nothing inherent to litRPG that implies the monster density has to be high. Nor is there anything that says 90% of the population can override the gentry's authority given sufficient time. A [Baron] or other Noble class might get better per-level progression than most classes. And as a hybrid of a land manager and feudal fighter he might get the enviable ability to level up his combat abilities without doing dangerous things like raiding dungeons full of monster. That would severely limit the percentage of people who could override his authority.

I'd say there's only two real rules. A RPG style system encourages quality over quantity, and a RPG style system encourages people to specialize in their class' area of competence.

Neither of these rules veto the existence of a landed gentry. If anything they make it easier, since the quality over quantity rule makes it easier to run a society based around a small high level elite who're loyal to each other.

************ I guess this needs more explanation. First paragraph is about how a ruling class needs little to no opposition to function. Second is about the effect of social groups gaining more power.

A baron cannot exist if his people can oppose him without enacting some cost that makes it not worth it. For example a president exists because the cost of killing him would be astronomical for other countries much less an individual citizen. But when all of your people have a chance to become invulnerable to physical harm (or high level enough to repeatedly oppose him) then the baron has no way to enforce his rule.

I touch on this in an earlier comment but the easy opportunity to advance beyond your station necessarily leads to the elimination of that class group. We see this in history as well. When a specific class of people has the ability to rise out of poor circumstances that inevitably leads to it's dissolution. Serfs don't exist (in western society) because the people gained enough bargaining power to guarantee things like human rights and basic freedoms. In litrpg the serfs have infinite bargaining power.

A state cannot function without a monopoly on violence. This doesn't mean only the state can be violent just that a government has to have the only /legitimate/ use of force. When everyone can legitimize their own violence through overwhelming force it doesn't function. The fact that citizens can refuse the rule of law and reliably survive guarantees the total collapse of society.

Who says there's an easy opportunity to advance? It's a perfectly valid litRPG system design to say that there's no multiclassing and class choice is based on your childhood. So if you are raised as a surf the system will assign you the [Surf] class and your potential is strictly limited and never rises beyond your station.

Or to say that a [Fighter] and a [Baron] of the same level are evenly matched in combat. But a [Fighter] levels up by forming an adventuring party and seeking out dungeons and other risky things with a very high fatality rate. But the [Baron] gets experience every time he collects the harvest tax. So typically the [Baron] is one of the highest level fighters you're likely to see.

#+begin_quote

The state monopoly on violence is a fairly recent invention. It did not apply to feudal societies where at a minimum every lord had the right to enforce the law violently in their own lands.

More unsupported assumptions. There's no reason to assume the RPG mechanics mean a citizen can refuse the law and survive. If anything it means the opposite.

Every [Bounty Hunter], [Sheriff], [Town Watchman], will have superhuman powers for tracking and apprehending criminals. A [level 10 Blacksmith] who rejects the rule of law. Lets be generous and say the system promotes him to a [level 10 blacksmith]/[level 1 Outlaw] multi-class. How is he going to get another ten levels of Outlaw before the superhuman [level 10 Sheriff] tracks him down?

I can think of ways you could still make criminals plausible in such a system. But to say any citizen can reliably refuse the rule of law and survive, you're making massive unsupported assumptions about how the system works.

This. This entire scenario. You fundamentally don't understand what I'm talking about. That's not rejecting the rule of law. He is under rule of law. That is rule of law functioning perfectly.

If a citizen has the /capability/ to level to a point where he no longer has to obey the law then it has no legitimacy. I want to stress that a high level person doesn't even need to exist yet. The fact that he can exist means that this society would inevitably buckle under the strain of constant and unending power struggles.

The baron has no legitimacy of he doesn't have the force of arms to back it up. Force of arms being levels.

It would be an autocracy of the highest level individual. With thousands of individuals constantly dying and rising up.

An apocalyptic wasteland as ever more powerful people make their way to the top and end up dying.

The nobility would die out before 3 months because they killed a guy's dad and he got to level 80 after x years of grinding and wiped them all out because he held a grudge.

This is nonsense. Society will not fall apart overnight because it's possible for someone to level up to the point they're stronger than the current authority system any more than actual medieval society fell apart because it was possible that one day the neighbouring kingdom will get strong enough to invade. Historically the possibility of invasion didn't cause society to instantly buckle under the strain of constantly building bigger armies.

All you need is a strong incentive for the majority of people to participate in society rather than obsessively chase power. If the system makes it clear that you're already out the running for top dog once you get [surf] or [blacksmith] that would do it. If the baron is the highest levelled and most powerful fighter around, and most people who try to sneak of and grind die before they hope to catch up with them that would do it too.

It's certainly a world where it's easier for a small group or lone individual to make trouble on a national scale. But there's a long difference between that and society not existing.

****************** Not to mention a Baron self-aware of these rules would seek out and destroy medium-leveled people he can't control (whether or not they're lawful/criminal) to maintain power, likely while maintaining a propaganda veil to ensure the rest of the population cooperates. "Noble lines" might just mean a Baron's children have a levelling advantage and are more likely to take the power as it's passed on. Couple this with many "tiers" of this power, where every Baron is paranoid of his populus, and every King above him is paranoid of his Barons - or power vacuums which could feed new leveling. Then as soon as the first peasant newcomer manages to overthrow his local Baron, he's likely to get a stern talking to by the Higher Powers (even if they were secretly helping him) and will be encouraged to play nice by the game, with increased scrutiny if he tries to keep climbing. Overthrows may then just be shifts in power from one person to another, with the overall societal structure staying about the same. This is all, of course, perfectly aligned with the common medieval fantasy conception, and not too far off from reality - but with taxes and armies instead of levels and personal power.

*********** I am 75% convinced that a completely thought out worldbuilding of litrpg would look a lot like a XanXia world (sects of increasingly powerful people) that is mainly inhabited by the elves in the Azarinth Healer story.

The way the xanxia look would be flavour at this point. For example: monster around the centre of population is made of wood and fast breeding and getting exponentially powerful give a sedentary city of hunters that regulate fire.\\
another example: beasts in the continent breed slowly and do not grow in power. This lead to either a weak society that look a lot like medieval life, but with the occasional kaiju monster. or a society of nomad that hunt according to the power of the beast and/or organised breeding of beast.

anyway, that my two cents.

************ I could see some similarities, but I think there'd definitely be some differences too.

In Xanxia non-cultivators are usually portrayed as living rather normal lives. But in a litRPG world, even peasant farmers would have a thing going on where a small number of high level peasants would be more productive than lots of low level peasants. And they'd acuminulate levels by farming so you'd expect to see most farmers reach a decent level as they age. That will have a big worldbuilding effect.

More relevantly for a typical adventure story. Typically in Xanxia when you level up you improve in all respects, you're faster, stronger, tougher, etc. In litRPG I'd expect to see a lot more disparities. You'll have tank classes who at high levels could stand their ground against a charging elephant. You'd have wizards who could flatten entire battlefields but might die from one well aimed arrow. So unlike Xanxia you'll see interdependent and synergistic teams as opposed to individual masters.

************* the idea of peasant (individual that farm/grind for "society") is valable in any setting I think.\\
the idea of peasont (weak and stupid/non-learned individual that cultivate to feed a society) can only be true in a society that keep them weak and nonlearned voluntary or unvolontary.

examples of litrpg where peasant can be a thing :\\
levels can only be obtained in rare place or with difficult to obtain. Here we could have farmer-king, they are king because they have the power of good food source. Or we could have warrior-king, they have the power of saying to other give me food or else.\\
(with complementary noble and other class and state sanctionned assassin in case a non state accepted individual became too trooblesome to contain)\\
(incidantally this seem to be the world of "milo two" on royal road)

levels can be hearned pretty easily but are skewed toward combat and magic. This is the standard litrpg trope, where we do have boost to strength, but no boost to "grow speed" of plants, magic is an elistist art that snob dirt bound individual or is only capable of launching ball of destructive power (good for digging stuff in non-combat application, but not to grow food) meat would be major part of the food culture if monster/beast meat is edible\\
(this seem te be the world of "Azarynth Healer" en royal road)

level can be hearned pretty easily, they uncompass all potential skill that are acknowledge by "users\\
I have yet to see a good representation of a world building of this type of litrpg.\\
I have read good writing and compelling character, but not extremely good world building.\\
if you really want to dig deep in the "litrpg cant be good at world building" you need to take a look at three fact that are easily dismissed (the common way to dismiss this is the creationist mythologie : the world is like that, the end)\\
1) what relation does "the level system" have with "reality" ? is level a summary of reality ? when you level up, does it rewrite reality ? are level a new kind of "muscle" that the user can manipulate (generaly expressed as the "soul" in story) ?\\
2) beast/sentient divide : you need to answer that phylosophical question for the fictionnal world, otherwise, you cant say that animal cant have skills. where do you put the bar "can have skill" and "this is a person; an individual"\\
3) how did life evolve with an extra dimensional muscle (the level system). Are muscle weaker in general because it's more efficient to rely on the "strength" modifier ?\\
if the level system is a summary of reality and there is no divide of beast/sentient, does it mean that there are a lot less evolutionary dead end because living being in general are more informed of what they are and what are the consequence of their act are ? or maybe it means that all of reality is sentient in some way, because since there is no difference between beast/human, what make the difference between beast/non-living being ?

****** A litRPG system world that looks like medieval fantasy feels innately implausible to me since medieval fantasy worlds are defined by the feudal pyramid where most people are farmers, and litRPG systems lead towards quality over quantity.

If one high level farmer is worth many low level farmers, what is all that spare manpower doing? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/bsaire/how_many_soldiers_would_it_take_to_kill_a_level/][A quick google suggests a level 20 fighter can defeat 80 to 100 level one guards.]]. So what would be the consequences on a medieval society where the food supply was fulfilled by 100th of the manpower?

And then there's the unique timesinks of such settings: magic items and rare ingredients. A high-level farmer could farm faster than a low level one, sure, but maybe his expertise is needed to farm the finicky magic crops the city's alchemists need to brew potions? Perhaps going up levels only lets you farm regular crops twice as quickly, and the reward is being able to handle superior crops at all?

***** This isn't remotely correct and is especially not correct for what we would think of as primitive societies. Serfs in particular were more tied down and had less skills than an average peasant but even they would have much more knowledge when it comes to survival skills. We're talking about shit like building a house, starting a fire, how to effectively farm the land they have, how to identify edible plants in a particular region from non edible ones, and so on. None of these skills would be remotely present in your 14 year old from Indiana. This isn't to say that a modern person isn't smarter or stronger than your average peasant or serf but that's mostly orthogonal to their survival skills. This is of course without getting into how educated or socially mobile peasants actually were. The idea that a random 21st century teenager or adult in the US or another western country would have even close to the survival skills of a random peasant or serf is just completely laughable.

Serf and peasants would definitely not know how to build a better house. They have thatched roofing. Any shmuch in highschool could pretty quickly put together something more stable with the same materials.

Starting a fire is true. Random teens wouldn't generally know that.

Peasants were shit at farming compared to the worst farmer we currently have in existence. Just crop rotation would change everything. Justin the average teenager probably has enough random farming lore from history class to make a much better farm.

This is even an exaggeration. Crop rotation also dates back to 6000 BCE lmao. Cash crops are what led to soil depletion, not a lack of knowledge. Also, while serfs were generally rooted down, they were also the minority of peasants. Peasants in general were able to move around, contract with other lords, and so on to bargain for better conditions and the like. This was most prominent after the bubonic plague but was also a thing before it. Peasants also obviously had to move in to cities - not all urban growth occured as a result of industrialization.

None of these people (serfs moderns and pretty much most people) can exist on their own. A peasant can't build a house on their own. Can't farm on their own. They need innumerable material and tools necessary to farm and build. Or do basically anything necessary to live on their own. Modern people would integrate into society and their knowledge base would give them an undeniable advantage. They aren't skilled enough to do ANYTHING on their own. No way. They would die in 3 days. But so would a serf.

It was my understanding of the middle ages that most serfs were contracted to a lord who essentially owned them. They had no human rights and little freedoms. What bargaining power they had was easily overruled by any lord and they had no recourse beyond banditry or starvation.

Iirc serfs didn't go to another lord for contract. They were traded and sold to different lords with no say most of the time. I don't know how city serfs fit in to the dynamic but I can't believe that nobility gave them much power given how they treated most people.

***** I have to disagree with you on several points here. Peasants usually lacked formal education in the medieval world, but not always. There were Church run schools for peasant children, and it was normal for peasant teens to go to medieval universities.\\
The nobles did not withheld the education from the peasants. Usually they did not give a damn either way, but occasionally it was the nobles who ORDERED peasants to go to schools, usually to become clerks for the benefit of the manor. Nobles also did not fill their heads with religion or dogma; for one, it was the nobles who were most often lapsed parishioners, and had conflicts with the Church. Religiosity of the serf spread mostly via word of mouth and cultural osmosis.

Peasants in medieval age did not " stay on a farm for 30 years and then die ". For one, almost every young person would be expected to marry outside of their hamlet, and thus lived most of their adult life not where they were born. Two, every craft except for farming required the kids to quite literally travel to find a craft Master, become Apprentice, and then a Journeyman (named so because they were travelling craftsmen). Whole groups of peasants, like lumberjacks, seasonal workers, masons (hence, "free mason") were required to travel the land looking for work, getting experience along the way.

It was not uncommon, for example for a dig-digger peasant from France to travel the whole Europe back and forth and end up in say, Norway, digging moats, foundations and graves along the way from Iberia to Trondheim.

And ATOP of that peasant levies were supposed to form and join armies, often being recruited for 2-3 years in a row, if not more. And they were not just the memetic "peasant in a grain sack with a stick" but scrupulously trained, armed and armoured infantry, archers and siege engineers, who might have seen battlefields from Scotland to Rome in a single season.

So, your average peasant was actually someone who traveled a bit, met various people, held several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles, and probably licked some formal and informal education along the way. He would very likely be a "jack of all trades" who could do simple accounting, stitch a wound, dig a grave, ride a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, fight in a pike formation, sail a simple boat, survive for weeks in the wilderness, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, play a simple instrument, and haggle. All of those skills would require maybe not intelligence, not precisely, but a kind of hardcore cunning, practicality and people skills that combined together would be indistinguishable from being smart.

No. I don't know where your conception of the middle ages comes from. This is simply not true. Of course all of these things happen but they don't all occur in the average peasants.

What you described are extremely exceptional circumstances and then applied them to an average that doesn't exist.

They could most likely dig a grave, ride a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, and haggle but the rest are /highly/ specialized.

The fact that these two (several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles who could do simple accounting) are included in what the average peasant does makes me doubt you have any idea what you are talking about. Peasant levies are a function of war which was probably <1% of anyone's average life. And tradesmen have /one/ job that they excel at.

***** Modern first-world people have a terrible tendency to be hyperspecialised domesticated animals.

Peasants knew how to live off the land, and a single village of them contained far more of the knowledge and expertise needed to propagate the technologies they used in their lives than would be the case for moderns. In other words, medieval societies were far less /fragile/ over time than moderns.

Cut off a modern american farming from the outside world for 50 years, and do the same to a medieval european one- the modern town will eventually just be a less developed version of the medieval one, where the people don't understand their tools as well.

You vastly overestimate the quality of the average modern person. The process of civilization is to take men and turns them into insects.

***** Education and intelligence are correlated, but causation is a lot less clear than might be intuitive. Hard to establish this kind of causation with a study, but I think the smart money is on intelligent people deciding to spend more time in school and/or wealth being a third factor that influences both. IQ is 40-80% heritable (ranges depending on age, apparently), so that puts a ceiling on how much education can even affect it. Other biological factors like diet are much more likely to contribute to IQ than education, iodine deficiency alone can account for up to 15 IQ points, but there would almost certainly be non-deficient populations and individuals. There's some other research that kind of suggests higher modern IQ (Flynn effect, some suggestion of modern superiority in abstract thinking, which is less useful in most circumstances than people on here might think), but I think the correct framing is to think of the archetypical medival peasant (honestly that generalization is so broad as to be pretty ridiculous) as being basically similar to us, but in quite different circumstances.

I think the right frame here is to think of useful cognition as being instantiated in three ways (a generalization): hardware, software, and infrastructure. We moderns have the same hardware, alien software, and better infrastructure. That is, we are biologically largely similar in IQ, we operate on different but not really dramatically superior memoplexes, and our infrastructure is dramatically better. To the extent that we can do more and better, it's because we have discovered specific theories that we can look up, or we have better tools for thoughts available to us such as programming, easier to contact experts, and so on.

This is really why uplift is a BS genre, as fun as it is. A modern would be worse than useless in a premodern setting without a ton of handwaving. Maybe if someone was able to go back with a carefully chosen skill set, reference books, and equipment, and then got lucky, but that's really just acknowledging how critical the infrastructural component is. Moderns have an overinflated opinion of themselves, and the more you go back and read the (alien but intelligent) writings of the early moderns (~late medieval) the more obvious this is.

I don't agree that a modern person would be useless in a premodern setting. We as a people are incredibly educated and capable when compared to the average serf. Just taking highschool would give any person an incredible amount of advantages in practical knowledge. You probably have 1000 random factoids that would make you far more capable than anyone else in a medieval society. Basic econ 101 would make you a decently successful merchant. Taking meds school or any degree would make you rich as hell. Can you imagine an architect going back? Lucrative life just ready for the taking.

I don't actually know what the uplift genre is but if what it sounds like (modern culture inserted into a premodern setting) then it sounds like boring political thriller at best and a pretty stupid and ill though out fantasy book at worst.

The problem is that actually applying that knowledge is very tricky and depends on a ton of details that aren't included in our education. Modern education is a fantastic base to build from, but includes relatively little that can be directly applied, especially outside the context of modern society.

Most scientifically minded people are going to have a general knowledge of, say, how a steam engine works, but will fall far short of the essential related knowledge you'd need to fashion one, or even just get metal with the right qualities to have it not fall apart.

The ideal situation, if we're talking about a pure single person with no extra reference material, would be to wind up getting dropped in as the ruler of a stable, well to do realm. If you had the ability to command craftsmen and laborers, you could easily make up for your lack of details with their own prebuilt knowledge and focus on just the differences that are needed to improve their methods.

Trying to do so yourself without something like a deep, practical knowledge base of metallurgy or other materials would leave you hopelessly behind if trying on your own. Alternately, a deep historical understanding would help if you knew in great detail what the /next/ step is from their current tech base, since you'd know that it was something achievable from what they can already do.

  The problem is that actually applying that knowledge is very tricky and depends on a ton of details that aren't included in our education. Modern education is a fantastic base to build from, but includes relatively little that can be directly applied, especially outside the context of modern society.
#+end_quote

Yes. That's a good way to phrase it. It gives an extra head start to whoever goes back and then they can add to that with real practical know-how of the premodern setting. Just going back and using advanced knowledge has tons of logistical and practical issues that would be worked through but in the end any modern person would be able to find successful use out of modern knowledge.

There are so many things we take for granted. So many incredibly original ideas that haven't been invented.

French fries. Hamburgers. Snowboards. Tennis. Chess. Music.

All of those have logistical and practical issues but it's a limitless supply of cool ideas to implement and profit from.

Even something like a medical degree would be close to useless because so much of modern medicine is entirely reliant on modern infrastructure in order to function.

Sure, he stumbles on a cheat power early per genre convention, but it's sort of plausible given that he does it by leveraging a reasonable world difference (scientific knowledge one can get at any community college / bookstore / high school), so it feels less cheap than the usual convention of being granted special powers due to simply being a transplant / because the Powers Above thought it would be "interesting". And it's kind of hilarious the way he ends up bonking monsters with books, using a skill that apparently wasn't designed for combat.

Do low level peasants serve a useful function in a litrpg fantasy world?

Unfortunately all of these are short and quite incomplete, which makes it tough to get a good feel for them.

--------------

Primal hunter [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36049/the-primal-hunter]]

Decently written. MC gets lots of super cool awesome stuff for no reason, but still has threats and other people get pretty cool stuff as well. Minimal other character development. The psychopath literally gets the most character development. Really don't like how MC decides he no longer has a crush out of the blue right when his crush does something bad in a flashaway. Also the recent ambush is pretty bad idiot ball / power incontinence

--------------

Cadence Lee [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35925/the-many-lives-of-cadence-lee]]

Pretty interesting. The many lives seem pretty pointless without something else tying into them. It is good enough that I get interested in the people in each life, but there's no closure, and all the character development other than MC is lost each life. Maybe necromancers will actually be part of the story? It also really seems to cut away right when the story is getting interesting. Generally seems like it might need to be a lot longer to judge, since there doesn't seem to be a real drive or goal.

The system is really stingy. This could be good or bad.

--------------

Copy Paste: the misadventures of Milo Two [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two]]

Pretty Enjoyable. Competent writing. Hints at an interesting world with nobles monopolizing dungeons, and odd survival scenarios. The MC trivially finds a way to become very powerful in a way that lots of people ought to be able to figure out. I love using "non combat" powers cleverly to be relevant in combat, but scribe is hardly an impossible class to get, and telekinesis and slow time are obviously incredibly powerful and don't make that much sense for their supposed scribe use (slow time for a few seconds to read a book fast?). Personally I'm not a huge fan of the cheeky meta monster themes.

--------------

Apocalypse: Generic System [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system]]

Fun. Characters have some actual character, if kinda cliche. Interesting magic system with strong light analogy (lenses, filters, etc). MC does have a bit too much of an easy time making awesome toys, but given the context and current info its plausible enough. Also, quite importantly the other characters also get pretty cool classes and abilities too.

--------------

System Change [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35372/system-change]]

Junk food. super OP MC accidentally migrate to a new "System" Decently written, but needs some actual motivation and risk.

--------------

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles-reborn-across-nine-worlds][The Weirkey Chronicles Reborn Across Nine Worlds]]

By Sarah Lin of Street Cultivation fame. Quite competent writing. Cultivation means building a house in your soul, which explains why all the special materials are valuable and provides a nice analogy. The actual mechanics seem pretty vague and wibbly wobbly, so its difficult to predict what is possible. Huge scale threats and mysteries are hinted at in the beginning, but it looks like it will take a really long time to learn more or actually engage with those threats. Very slow growth for MC -- he just got his first ability. The demon enemies we do see are boring and generic. They just spawn out of nowhere and attack. Frankly the "Oh no, there are even higher tier demons!" is pretty meh anyway.

--------------

Artificial Jelly [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34030/artificial-jelly]]

Okay. Pretty decent premise. Kinda slow start. Considering how long MC was stuck in dungeon, doing... nothing really. The initial premise of an intern made a seed AI and snuck it into an MMO is fine as far as my suspension of disbelief is concerned, but the resource requirement / awakening other NPC's is definitely a strain in that regards.

--------------

Prophecy Approved Companion [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion]]

Okay. NPC becomes conscious. Some quite funny bits. Seems a bit rudderless. Not really sure where this is going, as it seems stuck in the Hero and NPC both having suspicions, but never quite have any realizations.

--------------

My Servant Is An Elf-Knight From Another World [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36796/my-servant-is-an-elf-knight-from-another-world]]

Okayish reverse isekai. Hmm, I feel like the continuous frenetic action and immediate threat of the last two thirds kinda wasted the stranger in a strange land / mystery / romance build up. One fantasy elf appearing in the real world was interesting, but a bunch of other fantasy creatures appearing at the same time all centered around the MC is just a bit much.

--------------

New Life of a Summoned Demoness [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36308/new-life-of-a-summoned-demoness]]

Surprisingly Decent so far. Tropy kill things to consume their essense and take their powers.

--------------

Yashima Chronicles [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles]]

By JacobK, an author I usually love. Unfortunately I haven't been as taken by his recent original works. This is clearly a Yojou Senki analogue, which he wrote excellently in A Young Woman's Political Record. It's enjoyable enough, but kinda... bland so far. MC gets a gamer/litrpg system gifted from a goddess, but then pisses the goddess off so much they lock the system away. Pretty amusing premise so far. They train magic and fighting on their own, and become vastly more powerful than anyone else with ease. In fact it was so easy they assume that everyone else is still much more powerful than them. There's very little tension, and the MC's strange mindset feels a bit out of nowhere, likely because its a carbon copy of Tanya's -- Tanya's ability was high, but felt much closer to what skilled enemies were capable of (with the exception of the cursed divine orb that had serious downsides). Her ability to win fights, but not the war also made things have consequences. The characters here are barely developed, making it seem much less meaningful.

--------------

Genesis Wave [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35943/genesis-wave]]

Losing interest, but decently interesting premise.

--------------

Sylver Seeker [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker]]

I'm definitely enjoying it. Gore seems a bit over the top, but its on brand for necromancer. Frankly the flashbacks seem pointless so far. Plot is clever, and MC is a pretty good level of OP, but still threatened. Kinda suffers from a common syndrome where MC is supposedly super selfish and mercenary, but then doesn't really act like it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a unsympathetic MC is usually a very bad thing.

--------------

Shade Touched [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched]]

Cute monster child is too smart. Needs more world exposition. Decent read, but a bit lacking in drive.

--------------

Soul Power 9999 [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36249/soul-power-9999]]

Kinda silly/dumb story about a soul that accidentally consumed all the other souls in Hades when the system took over and mulched the previous supernatural world. They go around accidentally head exploding everything they try to possess. Skipping the system taking over seems like kinda a shame, since the one flashback we saw was frankly more interesting than the MC's adventures so far. MC is way OP, but needs to protect their golem body, so there's some tension.

--------------

Fluff [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35958/fluff]]

Cute and pretty competent. Superhero fic about an accidental Villain who summons younger sisters / minions who want to help her be evil. Seems like it is headed towards being pretty dark, as the world is not fiat nice / comedic. This does have an interesting interaction with the cuddly premise.

--------------

Dead Tired [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37251/dead-tired]]

Very short. OP Lich wakes up to a Cultivation based world instead of a DnD fantasy. Wonders what went wrong. Pretty funny so far, but the humor is the type that (I suspect) will soon grow rather ... tired.

** [[https://fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]] is an excellent /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ and /Stargate: SG-1/ crossover in which Zuko and Toph have to work with the SG-1 team to get home (and defeat a nasty spirit on the way). You can tell that the author has put /a lot/ of thought into how to make two different series mesh, and it works really well. The characters are mostly rational, and when they're not, the author is doing it on purpose and has a good reason for it. This is one of those stories where instead of you saying “Why didn't the author think of that?”, the author makes you go “Why didn't /I/ think of that?”

*** Just sprinted through that one, I've gotta give it a second recommendation.

It's two universes I'd not even have thought of blending and it turns out fantastic, it's a bit on the short side for my taste but it's better to be wanting more I suppose.

I've gotta give the author credit for the language barrier, and the reasons for it here and why there isn't one in SG1 as a show. Sticking with getting characters to interact while only being able to communicate singular concepts is difficult and it's pulled off well here.

Toph is also sassy as fuck. As she should be.

*** Currently reading this based on your recommendation. I'm about halfway through.

If you don't like stories that kind of... praise themselves on how amazing and quirky and whatever their characters are? this might not be a story for you. (I think this is a common fanfic thing where the author write about characters they think are awesome and get stuck talking about it a lot instead of just having them continue to do awesome things like in the source material). There have also been some displays of headcannon/lore changes/attitude changes that don't seem necessary and kind of grate. But maybe they will pay off in the latter half?

I'm looking for stories (specifically things I can read online for free but other media is fine too) where the protagonist is (or protagonists are) from a modern day setting and then get isekai-style randomly transported into the past. How far into the past isn't particularly important but definitely preindustrial so maybe between 10000 BC and 1600 AD. Magic is *okay* but if it's included, it should be rather soft (no gamer-esque 'system' or cyoa-esque stuff please). Specifically, I'm looking for stories...

- ...that portray the historical era and culture realistically (research backed or strong worldbuilding)
- ...where the protagonist's primary tool is their intelligence, not magic or whatever
- ...that portrays the problems the protagonist faces realistically (eg. learning a whole new language and interacting with an almost alien culture)

Also early on, when they described wood-gathering and whatnot, the amount of physical labor starving kids are doing isn't in line with the limitations or abilities of a low-stated kid.

*** This spawned a binge read of the whole series this week. (They're only just passed Leviathan so far!) Pretty cool, for the concept of the character and the committee-style writing if nothing else. Enjoyed it a lot. Think the point system is a bit cheesy and ends up in min/maxing more than choosing for storytelling, but it's interesting that this aspect is kinda also part of the personality and power of the main character - so it ties in. Interesting to see "bored with life because it's all just a game with no real consequences" as a power personality - it's a feeling we've all known, just from beating a game too thoroughly or falling into internet nihilism, and it really fits Echo well - and means something when he overcomes it. One Punch Man similar theming.

** Still on the hunt for Crafting/Merchant/Trade based stuff.

I finally took a shot at Forge of Destiny on RoyalRoad and it was pretty well written. I enjoyed how fresh the xianxia take felt even though it felt like these were tropes that I should be getting tired of. The MC did not have some kind of magic star break down or find memories of a 9 million year old saint or anything. She comes from nothing and works her way up the ladder. Plot points are extrapolated and built on to world build properly. There's a wide cast of characters and each are portrayed uniquely. I would recommend it to anyone looking to indulge in some progression fantasy or wants to have a xianxia flavor of the week craving satisfied.

*** I really like Forge of Destiny, it does some pretty clever and unique things and the character development and focus is phenomenal. You really get a feel for all the characters, I don't think any other xianxias go into the individual characters as much as Forge of Destiny, which I really appreciate.

It takes a different direction than a lot of other xianxias too. The MC isn't some solo traveling murderhobo cultivating their way to the heavens faster than a rocket ship, she's more grounded in her speed and ability but is still what you'd call a "heaven-defying" genius in comparison to most other cultivators. And she's attached to CRX and her family as a vassal, which I thought was really cool and opens up to a lot of possibilities.

I also really like how female characters aren't just meant to be sexualized with no personalities as is common in xianxias and web novels in general. More than half the cast are ladies, all with their own backstories, personalities, and motivations, and I love how they're all developed. And they're all major badasses too, from snake girl to CRX to our humble MC herself. The MC is especially great, she's a support-type Cultivator who's taller than almost every male character introduced, badass, and intimidating as fuck.

Absolutely phenomenal xianxia, I put it up there with Forty Milleniums of Cultivation and Cradle as my favorites.

*** Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey maybe? The whole world has a different view on sexuality and religion, which the author infuses wonderfully into the daily lives of the main character and those around her. There's a lot of kinky sex, but it never feels gratuitous, and there's a lot of skinship as well between characters as well (not always romantic either!). Highly recommend because it's a great book and series, not just because of the romance and sex.

/Maybe/ Spice and Wolf by Isuna Hasekura. It's primarily a romance series between wolf goddess Holo and traveling merchant Lawrence. There's intimacy and skinship between the two that slowly progresses. However, it being a Japanese Romance, the development is slow as fuck and takes forever. However, the banter between the two is great, and the exploration part of it is also satisfying. YMMV

*** Definitely look at [[https://www.twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], Wildbow's third webserial. The POV character is Sylvester, but the other members of the Lambs, a group of Academy-created experiments, are equally important main characters. In the beginning, they're children, even if they're somewhat monstrous in their actions. They're roughhousing a lot, but also casually sharing space - usually leaning against each other, having their arm slung around the others' shoulder, sewing each other's wounds shut... Later on, Sylvester actually starts sleeping in a literal cuddle pile of his friends to keep his mind from falling apart.

If the setting doesn't appeal (very dark alt-1920ies with lots of biopunk, think Frankenstein), the main characters of his latest novel [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/][Pale]] are also very close and often hug each other to show support or offer comfort. Later on, they get a sort of fourth member of their group who they all take turns caring for.

People in the glowfic community have lower boundaries, being tightly-knit poly Bay Area people, and so in their fiction, it is normal for friends to pet each other's hair and cuddle. (Excepting Silmarillion elves, who see hairplay as sexual and instead cuddle and sing.)

Still very worth the read though). Main character is a tabletop gamer geek thrown into a gameworld, and figuring out the mechanics and magic system is core to every step of the story - with much of it discoverable/guessable by the reader as you go, so every page adds intriguing depth and worldbuilding mechanics, compelling you to think of the implications. Good luck to your productivity this month.

P.S. if you make it through the main story, read the Backer Stories, which are canon and are sometimes even better than the main plot. Fascinating stuff

*** I recommended some rational!Voldemort fics a while back in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fjmd7a/comment/fkvl4cr][this comment]]. I also have many rational adjacent fics focused on interaction between Harry and Voldemort in my public bookmarks list on Ao3.

*** There's that discontinued Aetheron story that was fun while it lasted. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/magic-and-mayhem-a-harry-potter-story-about-tom-riddles-diary-eating-an-si-of-sorts.368704/][Magic and Mayhem]]. Very different tone, obviously, but I think you'd like it.

** Anyone know of any vegan-friendly xianxia novels?

Most I've gotten into go into great depth exalting the consumption of corpses, and while I can ignore it for a while, it does get a little grating, especially since it spoils the escapism (I deal with this enough from real humans already)

*** Are you fine with killing in stories, or just not eating corpses?

Is it fine if the main character's an exclusive cannibal? No animals harmed.

**** I am fine with both killing in stories and the eating of corpses under certain circumstances

I just would like to read a few stories of this genre that aren't so abrasive to me, after having read and enjoyed several that were honestly a bit much in this regard

I am getting downvoted bigtime on this on [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]], but in this case I feel that reflects more poorly on the downvoters than on my comments or request

*** None come to mind that really make a point of it, sorry. As for stories that I'm pretty sure don't involve gaining power by eating things, if you haven't read them already you might try the first half of Way of Choices (by Mao Ni), or Forge of Destiny (currently getting rewritten from sufficientvelocity over onto RR).
