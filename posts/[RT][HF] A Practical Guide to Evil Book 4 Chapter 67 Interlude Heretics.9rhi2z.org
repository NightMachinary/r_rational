  Oh, they'd been insulting his friends the whole time. Maybe. He should check to be certain, Hakram had noted it was important.

  “By the fools, you mean the Woe,” he asked.

  “What greater fools are there?” the woman laughed.

  So now the list. They were nobles, since no one else would be allowed here. They weren't visibly being forced to speak to him. There'd be no collateral damage to innocents. Was it legal? Probably. Callow had some kind of treason law about insulting the queen, didn't it? It counted.

  “Right,” Hierophant smiled, and raised his hand. “/Boil/.”

Hilarious.

** A good chapter. It was a good reminder of what Praesian court /is/. The twins were there to dig for information and they failed. It felt properly dangerous, which is something we've heard and not seen, which is nice but unnecessary. It also showed us that Masego doesn't need constant reminders of who his friends are to stay loyal to Callow.

He's rebelling, which feels good. A wedge has formed between him and his fathers, which, in theory, can't be resolved. I guessed months ago that warlock would die or be AWOL, and I thought that, coupled with his comfortable life in the Observatory, would be enough to keep his loyalty. Turns out he just chose his own way.

I'm happy for Masego this chapter. He's standing up for what he thinks is right, he even (or tried to, bless his cotton socks) put a lawful spin on boiling someone to death by justifying it with Treason laws.

I like the differences between his magic and his father's in play. Masego saw everything as it was and decided that it was his right to punish those who wronged him; the epitome of Praesian "Might makes Right" culture. His father's contingencies is a show of power. No application of effort, just a challenge for anyone to beat his passive defences.

I can't wait for papa Heirophant to come home to Callow with the shackles off and I hope Cat buys him a barrel of monkeys.

** The interludes are always the best part of the series.

Masgeo's viewpoint is a fun mixture of amusing and horrifying, and the dynamic between him and his fathers should be interesting to see play out. Prase is always a cool part of the setting to see. And however this Praes-Ashur conflict plays out is going to be critical for Callow's future.

There was also a bit of musings about magic, which on one hand is kind of interesting in its own right, but I've also just about given up on ever getting enough of the magic systems explained to have a grip on what can and can't be done within it.

*** I mean, if we're going to define charming as deciding to boil two strangers alive for a petty insult, immediately forgetting it's happening until their steaming blood evaporates from their eyes, and then moving on to being dissapointed that they didn't quite how he wanted, then yeah. Charming.

He's most certainly a fun sort of monster though, in how he's so stunted and childlike in some ways yet absurdly competent in others.

**** I think 2 is actually the biggest probability, tbh. Every time we've had a Warlock interlude it's touched on his belief that basically no matter what this will all go back to the Post-Conquest normal they established- Catherine will be killed w/ out permanently alienating Amadeus, Amadeus and Malicia will reconcile, etc.

Maybe I'm reading too much into a couple of lines, but I would not be surprised if this is meant to allude to a sort of mental failure mode he's fallen into.

Oh come on, that has to be a gross misunderstanding of a Praesi tradition by a biased foreigner, right? I'm pretty sure Praesi lower classes aren't /that/ sociopathic.
