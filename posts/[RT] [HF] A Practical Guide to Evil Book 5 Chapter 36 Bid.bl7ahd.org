** I like how the big powers of the continent, Dwarves and the Dead King, play a long-term game of strategy, taking land without overextending when the opportunity allows and waiting it out when expanding would be risky, compared to the short-term thinking of everyone else.

Cat doesn't even seem to realize that a truce with Neshamah just means he gets to keep the defensive border region, snuffs out the traditions and stories of the northern principalities holding him back and he can just wait until any grand alliance shatters.

** Interesting. So Cat has formed a band of five, to face the hidden horror. A Pattern old and tested. If she was to face the monster, the trial and the pivot she would have the weight of the story behind her.

Figures the Dead King saw coming that a mile away and decided "lol nope" and left her hanging.

So, instead we get a conversation. First topic was Cat's trajectory. She thought that with her release from winter she was off of the path of becoming a monster like he professed. It shouldn't surprise me that despite that she still is, but it does a little.

But the more interesting bit is his offer. He was not kidding when he said he is playing the long game. She may think she could unite Calernia with a hundred years of prep time, but like the opening phrase of the chapter said, if you're not fighting outward, you're fighting inwards. I bet with just a couple years everyone would be at each other's throats again. In time, this generations of heroes and villains would come and pass. Then, a hundred years from now he can move again, I suspect to invade and bargain for a bit more land. Each time expanding little by little until he could just steamroll what was left. Facing heroes and villains horrible green (to his standards) that may not even have a grasp of story-fu. And who knows what he would be free to do in the meantime.

Jesus, its like a game of Go where everyone thinks they are playing on a beginer's board, but in reality it's a full board and everyone is too blind to notice.

** Hope we get to see the Dead Kings conversations with the other 4.

*** I'd like to see the Saint's the most. As much of a conversation as it'd actually be. "Damnit, stop cutting me, I am trying to talk to you, stop that! I'm not even really here - Fine! Out!"

**** I suspect that Saint might be able to cut him even if he's not even there.

**** I doubt he even bothered talking. Why waste time and energy on that, when letting her see his talk with Cat should be enough to drive an ever bigger wedge between the rest of the band of five and the resident zealot. Cat hesitating when offered a deal? Implication she tried dealing with him before? Oh you can bet Saint is raging right now.

***** She flat out says she went to bargain and backed out, after trying to prevent another. It's not entirely true, but it doesn't have to be.

** I was reflecting lately on how the way narrative laws that shape the Names and influence stories in the PGtE world compare to the concept of [[/r/teslore/comments/aqyo1f/mantling/][Mantling]], or the idea of [[/r/teslore/comments/6dfhsm/could_i_get_a_simple_explanation_of_the/][enantiomorphic configurations, in the Elder Scrolls lore]]. I think there are interesting parallels there. TES does not draw a thick line across a Good/Above and Evil/Below binary though, with its complex and shifting alignments to Aedric and Daedric entities.
