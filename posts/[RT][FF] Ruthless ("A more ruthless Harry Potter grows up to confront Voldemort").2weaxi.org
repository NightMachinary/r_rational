** Loved it. Been thinking of making such a character and story for years, could never get the mood quite right. It's kinda like "Perfume" by Patrick Suskind, which happens to be amazing. Any recommendations on similar works of art?

  "Harry was learning that there were good choices, and better choices, and the best choices. Just like there were bad choices, and the worst ones."

Oh hell yes.

** Not rational per say, but more like a short summarization with humor thrown in for good measure. Proactive is the word best describing this fic.

** This was honestly very good - possibly my second favourite Harry Potter fanfic.

** That stoic take on cuckolding really cut me to the bone. This is not a happy story, even if the main character would not agree. I feel faintly sick, in sympathy.

*** Yeah, Theo really drew the short end of the deal here, first Harry gets the girl and then he gets to make decisions on who bones who, and who gets kids first. On the bright side Harry seems like a person who isn't bothered by the day to day workings of a human life, so at least Theo and Hermione can be a normal-ish couple most of the time.

**** I may have misunderstood but I'm pretty sure he went back to kill them at the end.

***** Nah, if you read a few paragraphs back, he's thinking about his (future) children. I think it's just bad (ambiguous) phrasing near the end that could mean two opposite things that throws it off.

***** Huh, on reread it does sound like that, though if he can make the decision to remove his bad choice inducers (shadows) then I guess he could also remove their influence at the time of making his future decisions.

That is to say if he doesn't care about their death then why would he care about their opinions and their subsequent decision influencing?

***** Crap, I missed that. It looks like he is either going to kill them or else leave them.

*** Sorry to clarify the cuckolding, or the non-monogamy was what really spoke to you about his "good" choices? Not the murder or the torture or anything like that?
