From 2000-2003, there was this great 1000 page webcomic called 1/0, in which the characters had full knowledge of their existence in a webcomic. The first 70 pages are just crossovers and fluff, but then the deconstruction of having no fourth wall begins. The characters do experiments to determine the physical and narrative laws of their universe, debate the nature of their free will, sometimes rebel against their author, and find out their universe will end at the 1000th comic. Some of them become willfully ignorant of the existence of the author in order to stop worrying about his omnipotence. Its surprisingly deep for a low quality black and white comic.


** Wow, I think the first time I read this comic was back in middle school. It was a few years old even then.

Some of the stuff I remember liking: The author was allowed to introduce new rules to the story, but once he did, they couldn't be gotten rid of. This meant that once he brought one person back to life as a ghost, everybody would get to do so going forward. Likewise, once one character escaped reality by diving into their own thought bubbles, everyone was capable of doing that. That ended, if I recall correctly, in the characters going on strike until the author agreed to stop putting new rules in. Also, Zadok's continued attempts at economics were fun, as were his attempts to avoid the author's shortcomings by doing things off-panel where Tailsteak couldn't flub it. /Also/ also, the Junior war arc at the end had a lot of tactical thinking about what advantages they had and what threat a telekinetic ghost posed, even if it didn't end up being all that necessary.

It /is/ worth mentioning that the comic is quite frequently, uh, rather impolitic. It's hard building a criticism for the comic on that basis, though, because usually it's either a character having a bad opinion (and subsequently getting called out by the author), or the author having a bad opinion (and subsequently getting called out by one of his characters). The thing where Terra converts from lesbian to straight, sorta, is still an eyebrow raiser, though.

Definitely an /interesting/ read, one way or another. The author is not afraid of playing with big ideas. And I did enjoy it, ultimately.

*** The Terra thing is just her being heteroromantic(or biromantic) but being homosexual as far as I can tell

**** Huh. Maaaaaybe. Strip 669 has Ghanny describe Terra's situation as having a personality that causes her to abandon what is natural for her species, further saying that her heart and mind were in conflict with body, and that her heart was going to win. She seems to accept this description. Taken as is, that would likely indicate a heteroromantic / homosexual nature, yes. However, a direct analogy is drawn between this situation and a lesbian woman Tailsteak once knew, with the implication that all that stuff also applied to her. This makes me think that maybe Tailsteak had a misconception about homosexuality, in which he thought a homosexual person's personality causes them to veer away from their body's naturally heterosexual inclinations. If so, I don't think it was a /malicious/ misunderstanding, and certainly it was one that was cleared up by the time he wrote Leftover Soup.

*** He's still making comics, too. Leftover Soup was pretty good, I thought, and I haven't read any of Forward yet, but it sounds interesting.

**** Yup! I read through LS and Forward is... OK so far. Not quite as compelling as LS, but it feels like a necessary bit of thinking about a big idea.
