Anyone have an archived copy? I can't seem to find the fanfic through Google. It seems like a story I'd like to read, and I was quite saddened to not find it.

** It used to be hosted on AO3 but the archived links don't work anymore. Still, you can find it on the WaybackMachine [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160412235720/http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/8485900][first chapter here]]

** Here's some copies of the [[http://www.mediafire.com/folder/cjw4h6hez7gpv/The_World_is_Your_Oyster%2C_The_Universe_is_Your_Namesake][story]] in awz, mobi, epub, and pdf formats for offline reading.

It's worth reading through the github link as well, because there is an epilogue scene written (even though the story was nowhere near completion) and a folder labelled 'scenes' of discarded writing that never made it into the actual story.
