*** Yeah. The only remaining hope is that Thief or Robber managed to do something in the meantime that would allow him to Destroy the bindings.

Still, for all the comfort quotes from the future allow us, they only speak of Cat and not of her predecessors. That's no cliffhanger here, that's a chapter-long drop that is cut off inches before the ground.

*** I mean, I don't see that as entirely impossible.

Like, Procer has a lot of narrative weight. We are gonna fight them.

But Cat herself muses that while she can go anywhere she wants through Arcadia the fight will be a walkover. There is no way Evil vs. Good comes down to teleportation and burning Good's homeland. So Cat has to lose that fey power before the fight with Procer.

I feel like, in order to escape Diabolist, Cat has to lose or massively curtail her Fey nature, thus becoming a human and not BIND-able. Maybe Black can accomplish that, but it might take Malicia.

** Hot damn, 3/4 of a book of Cat having a massive power boost has just paid off for Diabolist.

I like how for all of her plots, Diabolist's backup plan was simply to wait for Cat to use Break and then Claim her freely. Simple but effective.

Plus I guess all of her talk of Cat's morality and the like helped her in Creation's eyes. Slowly attacking Cat at her foundations is probably the shit that the Gods eat up.

****** I'd say Take is more powerful. Fall is a powerboost, but it's a pretty straight powerboost. If opponent had an idea for how to deal with Cat's winter powers Fall doesn't really bring anything qualitatively different to the table-it's just same winter powers, but /more/ of them. Take, on the other hand, gives Cat a new power (great) while permanently taking a power away from the enemy (double great) and thus qualitatively changing the structure of the fight. It's effectively two aspects in one in terms of power.

** I think the question that needs to be asked is; how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here? It would rob too much weight from Catherine's own story for Black to kill Akua himself, and pretty clearly he isn't going to kill Cat. But he's also not really the kind of mentor who'd let his apprentice strike him down in some act of self sacrifice.

I think... Black might need to find some way to have Akua kill him with her own hands. That moment of high emotion could lead to Cat breaking free of Akua's grasp and transitioning, or transitioning and gaining an Aspect that then allows her to escape. It sidesteps the issue of the Calamites, and subverts the usual clich√© of the villain being killed by their own intended replacement.

I feel like the narrative is already on Cat's side. Akua even explained why - Squire is half Good and half Bad. It's true that in a villainous Role Cat would be boned right now but is she a Villain at the moment? She's fighting against her nemesis in their evil lair, her mentor captured and her army and all of her Kingdom at risk. It's even shown in the dialogue: Akua is doing the evil monologuing and Cat is talking about love.

The whole thing stinks of a Hero's most desperate moment before divine intervention or some such.

Cat kills him. Cat transitions into the Name of Black Knight. Since her nature as the Duchess of Moonless Nights is tied to her Name, she'll lose her fae powers when she transitions. This also means that she'll no longer be bound by Diabolist.

It would also serve as her defeating the Diabolist's Monster (herself) and the Pivot simultaneously.

******* It's got nothing to do with classic anything. I'm arguing that "Black Queen" has about as much flair as a floating turd, by the standard of names.

"Exiled Prince" is stylish. "Tyrant of Helike" has style, as does Dread Empress of Praes or Tyrant of Praes or whatever Malicia's actual name is. Black and White Knight has style, as well as buckets upon buckets of precedence. Adjuntant is also a stylish name.

Black Queen is no such thing, and therefore it is not going to be her name. It doesn't roll off the tongue and invoke a clear archetype the way literally all the other names do.

So I think the lines aren't as clear cut as has been implied.

That's my interpretation anyway.

Interesting. It may be a culture thing, but in my country's folklore it is a thing and an archetype. [[http://www.secret-zagreb.com/zagrebblog//2011/09/black-queen.html][Here]] is a write-up about a legend from the city in which I live.

When this whole "Black Queen" started I thought it was a generaly accepted trope, but after googling a bit I realize it is not a thing in the West.

***** Black Queen's probably not an actual Name; it'd be a nickname of someone's actual Name, which would probably have to be something like Queen of Callow - but since her formal title is /vice/-queen of Callow, she can't transition into that Name unless she revokes the "vice" part of "vice-queen", and declares independence from Praes.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/7z3207/chapter_67_middle_eight/][The discussion in /r/PracticalGuideToEvil has gone very differently.]]

There's been people pointing out that the 'middle eight', in our list of musically themed chapter titles, is the midpoint where things change. It's the breakdown, the bridge, the point where the music goes to a different space for a while in order to create contrast when the familiar section kicks back in.

And others stating that Akua vs. Cat looks like a straight up Villian vs. Hero fight at this point, with Cat as the hero... and there's no way that narrative ends with Akua winning.

I see this as how the 'apprentice kills the master' trope associated with the Black Knight happens. Black treated Cat so well that it would never happen normally, therefore we get mind control bullshit. And that in turn would cause Cat to transition into a new name. Akua already mentioned that a Black Knight with the power of the last of Winter would be significantly harder to deal with.

** We all knew that Akua would bind Catherine to her will. Like we all know that Catherine will kill Black. One can hope otherwise but it's not that kind of story.

Now, Akua will reforge Catherine to her liking. Give her purity of purpose, make her a villain in full. And in doing so, create the blade that will kill her, like every villain before her. My only question is: what Name will Catherine get, once she realizes that the only way to end up where she wants to isn't to rise as Malicia or Akua's second but to become Empress herself?

I'm willing to bet that black is not gone at the end of this fight.
