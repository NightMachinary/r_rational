** Not sure if I've read a rational Gato, Zabuza, and Haku confrontation... I wasn't super excited about this mission before, but you've convinced me. I'm genuinely excited and scared for our team of inadequate heroes. Can't wait to see how the conflict turns out!

*** Velorian did a rational Zabuza/Haku in Lighting up the Dark, but it was resolved more or less peacefully if I remember correctly. This act was actually the very first one I wrote, because I was just stuck on "what would a rationalist fight between ninjas look like?", and this arc was what I came up with. Very curious to see what you guys will make of it.

All in all, I'm just really happy that the overal response to this arc so far is positive. I was really worried I hadn't made it original enough, because as Yudkowsky once said "If you write a Naruto fanfic, you should skip the wave arc unless you have something really original planned". But I guess I also know now what he meant when he said "experience has shown that I have no idea which chapters my audience will like and which they won't."

** Thanks for the chapter. This part of the series always seemed to me like the author hadn't quite decided in which direction to take his story, that he was still laying out the setting and presenting it to the audience. Zabuza in particular, just seemed so different from what his reputation and history suggested he should have been like, as described much further on. So all in all, it's not a part I particularly enjoyed, in the original story.

But you're doing a good job making it interesting. Keep it up!

*** Cheers! I agree that this was when canon was still in its infancy, but maybe that's also the reason why it has a special place in my heart. This arc was when the story really grew into its own, and the fact that everything was still novel and you didn't have giant jutsu spam everywhere made it all the better for it. The show never really recaptured the magic of the original IMO, except in a few good fights/scenes like the one between Kakashi and Obito, where it really felt like it was a battle between two humans and not just living weapons.

ninja Villages -> Ninja Villages (or "ninja villages", but Village is capitalized in other places. Since "village" is used for normal civilian small towns, it'd be weird for Village to be a proper noun without Ninja Village also being a proper noun.)
