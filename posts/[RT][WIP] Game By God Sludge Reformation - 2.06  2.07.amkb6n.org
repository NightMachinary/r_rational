** more meta-textual madness

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if you've ever read it, but there's this one YA book I read some time ago, it's just a literal list of...
#+end_quote

I think this was the only reference I didn't get. Someone fill me in?

** u/lsparrish:

  You can't walk up to any publishing company and show them your million word long D&D session or time-loop epic or superhero tragedy and expect not to get laughed out of existence.
#+end_quote

So I guess the question is, are we referencing WtC, MoL, and Worm, /specifically/, or just the /idea/ of them?

#+begin_quote
  if someone started off a book by making jokes about Internet memes or something, you'd probably be safe in stopping right there.
#+end_quote

This made me wonder if ZB is a reference to the socially awkward penguin meme? Because if there's one thing I've learned about this serial, it is that it loves poking at itself.

#+begin_quote
  (Had I been writing a traditional story in a book, I might've gone the David Foster Wallace route of jamming footnotes down the reader's throat, but due to the potential annoyances of implementing something like that in an online format, I settled for abusing parenthesis instead. It didn't look the sexiest, but it got the job done.)
#+end_quote

I noticed when this was happening, but when I went back to reread the chapter, there were quite a few that I didn't consciously notice. Cheeky bugger!

*** WtC has made me immune to large parenthesized paragraphs. (I'll never forget "safely hidden within triple parentheticals" from chapter 73.)

** I see that someone has a lot of faith in Worm reaching TV show status.

** So Martha is someone else who is trying to improve. I kind of hope this ends up becoming a theme. I love watching characters realizing their flaws and working on themselves to become better people, complete with the minor successes (and possible backsliding).

Prediction time: DM affected the lives of every player in a way similar to what they did with By's. I've thought it was possible that DM's comment was a strategically aimed missile to alter By's life, but I hadn't considered whether it could have been intended to be a /positive/ change.

We have the God/Devil dynamic already, maybe there's angel/demon on your shoulders sort of thing. Dogsi's faction using the DM persona to get the players to confront their issues, and Vedsi's faction using the sludge to try and tempt them to relapse during the dream.

** Just started reading this, I'm loving all the meta-references and how much it deals with the medium of the work. I've thought a lot about web-serials as a medium, and it's really interesting to see some more opinions on it.
