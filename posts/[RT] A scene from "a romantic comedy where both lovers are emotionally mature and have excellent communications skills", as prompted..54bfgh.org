--------------

SHE is gowned in a black dress sewn with tiny emeralds, rubies, sapphires too small to detract from the darkness of her gown, instead giving it the illusion of a rainbow sheen. The gown falls modestly to the floor around her legs, and covers her bodice completely, but is incongruously backless. A thin gold circlet surrounds her head, set in front with a diamond the size of an eye. Her golden chair is set with cushions also gold-dipped.

She is sitting at one end of a marble table clothed in silk damasked with the tracery of ravens; a table long enough to separate her from the other side by further than a man could lunge in a single motion.

HE is huge, muscular, a full head taller than her, clad only in a thin white loincloth; and he is chained to a solid stone chair on the other side of the silk-clothed marble table. His face is clean-shaven, and somebody has braided silver flowers into his flowing brown locks.

MAN: I swear upon my father's bones that I will not attack you if you remove my chains.

The WOMAN's voice is prim in reply.

WOMAN: My father may also have died too early, Mr. Thoron, but when I was a child, His Grim Majesty recited to me every night from our family's accumulated list of behavioral guidelines. Rules thirteen through seventen are /quite/ clear about how to behave in the presence of an attractive captured hero... forget I said 'attractive'. I mean, you are, of course, but... oh, I'm making a fool of myself, aren't I?

MAN: Maybe a little.

WOMAN: Hold your tongue, wretch.

MAN: Thoron holds his tongue for no one! But in all seriousness, your Grim Majesty, my own people also have ideas about guidelines for dating. Chains do not enter into them, at least not on the first date.

The WOMAN taps her fingers thoughtfully on the table.

WOMAN: There is a significant cultural distance between us, isn't there.

MAN: One could say that, yes.

WOMAN: But is this really... dating? I mean... I captured you fair and square. I own you now. You're my harem slave, not a, a...

MAN: We're seated at a marble table waiting for a chef to cook our food. I am reasonably sure that this is a date.

The WOMAN covers her face in her hands.

WOMAN: It is, isn't it. Oh, god, I'm on a date.

MAN: To be exact, you chained your date to a stone chair.

WOMAN: Silence, slave!

MAN: You know what they say about women who have to chain their men to heavy stone objects.

WOMAN: I'm... I'm not...

MAN: I can't help but wonder if you also intended to keep me chained down while... inviting me in for coffee.

WOMAN: I... yes, I suppose I was. But if you're not chained down, you might...

MAN: Ravish your majesty's fair form?

WOMAN: Escape. Look, you, don't think I don't understand what you're up to! You're trying to seduce me! Yes, I know, I started it, but you're trying to seduce me only so that you can get away and get back to your army!

MAN: Maybe I'd ravish you first and then escape... you're blushing. Ha, you're actually blushing!

WOMAN: You should perhaps ask yourself how wise it is to taunt the Grim Empress when you are her captive!

MAN: You commanded that I be taken as your /harem slave/ and you're blushing because I talked about ravishing you. You're not... a virgin, are you?

WOMAN: Oh /god/ no. I've had the best courtesans in the Empire, male and female. So you'd better not slack off in, in...

MAN: You can't even say it. 'In bed.' Go ahead, try to say it.

WOMAN: What's /wrong/ with me? I'm the Grim Empress. I don't do shy.

MAN: Perhaps I shouldn't be asking, but... do you do long-term relationships?

WOMAN: Not... yet. Oh my god, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I'm thinking this.

MAN: With respect, your Grim Majesty, if a long-term relationship is what you have in mind, you might want to consider how to best proceed past this point and whether chains should be involved.

The WOMAN looks away.

WOMAN: We could have a long-term relationship with you in chains.

MAN: It might end up somewhat one-sided. Look, Empress Teirya, I'll be honest with you. I don't have any relevant traumas in my past, so I'd probably think it was hot the first time you chained me down. It would get tiresome the thirtieth time you were doing me.

WOMAN: You presume much.

MAN: /You/ named me your harem slave.

WOMAN: I did. And let's be clear on one thing, you /will/ be... what was that phrase you used? Something coffee?

MAN: Invited in for coffee.

WOMAN: Is that seriously what they call it in the Unconquered Territory? How does that even make sense? What does coffee have to do with sex? Is it a metaphor, for, for...

MAN: No, it's literal. The notion is, you're drinking with somebody at a bar. You head home together, and when you get there, whoever's house it is asks if the other person wants to come in for coffee. If they say yes, they've entered your house and that's one step closer to the two of you having sex.

WOMAN: And you call us mad. You Lightsiders and your crazy taboos! Not that it's not cute, but just... pay her, blackmail him, kidnap somebody. Or, I don't know, fucking talk about what you actually want from each other, maybe?

MAN: So what /do/ you actually want from me, your Grim Majesty?

The WOMAN stares down at the table.

WOMAN: I want that over-muscled body in my bed. I may want a long-term relationship. And maybe, god, I don't know, you were very nearly smart enough to defeat me. I /want/ you as my loyal lieutenant, and, and, shut up, I'm still talking. I might want you to father the next heir to the Grim Throne.

MAN: You understand that there are parts of that you can't get just by chaining me in convenient positions.

WOMAN: I know.

MAN: From what I've heard, your court's philosophy is based around people trying to obtain their desires. How will you obtain what you desire, your Grim Majesty?

WOMAN: Through... winning your heart by being really good in bed with you? Ugh, no, you don't have to say it. I wouldn't believe you if you pretended to be that easy.

MAN: I'm not. For me, it's about... well, it's about ideals.

WOMAN: Fucking Lightsiders! You always say it's about ideals! Can't it be about power and wealth and having your way with the pliant form of the Grim Empress herself?

MAN: No. I'm sorry.

WOMAN: I don't suppose this is as simple as my asking you what you'd want in exchange.

The MAN looks down at the table.

WOMAN: You want your homeland, the country of Yoruun, freed from the Grim Empire. That's... not on the table.

MAN: It's, it's not just Yoruun. You want me as your loyal lieutenant. I'd have to believe in what you were doing. In everything you were doing.

WOMAN: This /is/ the Grim Empire, I mean, you don't have to be /that/ loyal, a certain amount of trying to bend the Empire to your own whims is expected, it could include lower taxes or something...

(Both of them are silent.)

WOMAN: This isn't going to work out, is it.

The MAN smiles.

MAN: Maybe not, but /I'm/ not giving up just yet.

(Waiters silently enter, bringing with them plates of food.)

MAN: However, you need to at least unchain my hands enough to let me pick up the silverware.

WOMAN: Oh, we have slaves for that here!

Off topic question to everyone reading this:

How many of you upvoted this because you first saw it was a post by Eliezer before you actually read anything here?

I'm curious if people are more likely to upvote or comment on something when they see a familiar/famous name is associated with it.

I do upvote comments, though. I see it as a better alternative to choking a discussion thread with comments like "Me too," or "I appreciate the pun you made there." If I feel the urge to leave such a comment, I upvote instead.

Replace Grimm Majesty with Dread Empress, Lightsiders with Heros/Good aligned, Yoruun with Callow (and then the Unconquered Territory with Procer?) (....and then Malicia with a Empress more interested in men). Possibly no Roles, though, Grim Empress could easily be a mere title.

90% of "emotional maturity" in interpersonal relationships is recognizing that you can't force people into what you want. So the comedy here still derive from emotional immaturity. It's just that the emotional immaturity is so over the top that we don't even recognize it as "emotional immaturity' anymore.

  MAN: You understand that there are parts of that you can't get just by chaining me in convenient positions.
#+end_quote

I guess what I'm saying is that some people try to force <romance, love, monogamy, marriage, procreation> by means such as yelling and nagging, and a lot of why we think we can do that is because our Lightsider culture is descended from a Grim predecessor culture where forcing people to do <above things> by capturing and enslaving them as property was a norm. But it didn't work out any better for our ancestors - all they got were distorted and ugly mockeries of the love/affection they were hoping for.

Emotional maturity, at least in part, slides along the Grim <-> Lightsider axis, such that the Grim /culture/ is emotionally stunted. Recognizing that while you can <nag / yell / pressure / chain / enslave / lock in a tower / economically incentivize / threaten to leave unless they obey> someone to go through the motions of a wedding ritual, sex, exclusivity, and so on, you won't actually get their love and loyalty. (On the lightsider extreme, you get radical commitments to non-coercion, as seen in the polyamorous community and so on. This is extreme emotional maturity.)

That's what the classic rom com centers around. ~Hilarious misunderstandings~ arise because the two parties are essentially playing a zero sum game and trying to coerce each other / withhold information / assuming the other is trying to harm them. The fun part in this story is that we instead just /acknowledge/ one party is trying to coerce the other and run with it.
