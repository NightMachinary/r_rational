**** Considering anti-deathism is recently getting more popular, and mostly popular among young people, that probably isn't true. Anti-deathism probably also correlates with education level and effort put into attaining longevity, which also correlate with lower death rates.

All in all, deathists probably have around 0.014 chance of dying every year (i.e. the global average), and anti-deathists between 0.005 and 0.014, depending on how strong your rejection of death has to be to constitute "anti-deathism" .

(Which I really hate to say, considering that on this spectrum, I fall in the "flaming ideologue who regularly needs to hide his powerlevels" zone.)

I did mean on the order of decades, perhaps that was a bit unclear.

I would be very surprised if there weren't :)

(That is to say, everything has a reason, and it doesn't change the outcome of the results).
