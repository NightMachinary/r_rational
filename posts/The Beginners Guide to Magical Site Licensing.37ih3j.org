** Reposting. Not exactly rational, but the world building is pretty good, and the characters have their moments ("It's Basically a Fort" is a great example).

** This one is fun and fairly rational. Moves a bit slow once you come current, since he only posts about 3k word chapters twice a week. Might be worth waiting until it's done posting in July.

*** I once estimated that the story would finish in July, but I should correct that. The last update of the current "book" will go live on June 4th i.e. there are three updates more including the one that hits in 90 minutes. The sequel will begin fairly shortly thereafter on around June 23rd.

Er, if it's not clear from the insider information I'm the author. ;-)

**** It was one of those "J" months. Still, I wish you'd broken it into larger chunks. 3k words is just enough to whet my appetite. Then again, I've been totally spoiled by Wildbow.

Still loving the story, just disappointed when I log in after a week away and only read for 10 minutes.

***** Wildbow is a mad woman* so much quantity and so much quality. I don't understand why she hasn't been snapped up by a professional publisher.

I am planning to increase the speed at which the story progresses as I move into the sequel. My tentative plan is to keep my current median update size but do long updates whenever the story gets slow. Of course, that might work /against/ sating readers, as it will make the story more likely to end in an exciting place rather than in the middle of a sales meeting. Still, always keep 'em wanting more, right?

Anyway it's great that you're enjoying it!

*Or man, I don't think Wildbow has ever indicated a gender in public, but the writing feels female to me.

****** Here's a public [[http://forums.webfictionguide.com/topic/thinking-of-adopting-a-pen-name-thoughts][comment]] where he states his name and gender.

I'm actually surprised at the number of people who thinks he's a woman from his writing style. It's a hard thing to do, to write like a woman or in a way that the author's gender is not apparent over time.

I wish I could have tried guessing at his gender to test my ability to infer characteristics of the author, but someone I was talking to commented on his gender when I was only a few chapters into Worm.

******* I started reading Worm thinking the author was probably a he because superhero prose is fairly male dominated. I began to think "she" as I read because it has a very constant focus on the relationships of the protagonist and it is via those relationships that the protagonist solves problems. That's something I associate with female authors.

Of course, you can't expect 100% consistency with that sort of thing; it's really down to the individual.

****** According to the Twig Serial Donations page, Wildbow = John McCray. I'm presuming a guy at this point.

** Thanks for the share! I started reading it this morning and enjoyed it so far ("A New Character Has Appeared")

I also suppose it's a matter of time before "magic as engineering" becomes wildly popular as more readers pick this theme up =D
