** I can't believe this isn't higher. Very engaging story, world-optimizing protagonists, and although some parts suffer in writing ([[#s][]]), all chapters are still well above the average fanfiction writing.

Strongly recommended.

** Does anyone have a table of which symbols go with which fandoms? I'm part way through and starting to suspect I'd benefit from knowing more of the source material. I imagine it mostly has wikipedia pages, but I'm finding it hard to google.
