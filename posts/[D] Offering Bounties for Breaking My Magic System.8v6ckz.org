/(Note: This post was cleared this with mods ahead of time.)/

I am offering bounties for useful / fun / novel / setting-breaking ideas with regards to magic in a setting I am developing for a Rationalist Quest. Specifically, if I judge your idea to be useful to me, it gives me new ideas for filling out idiosyncratic details of the setting's cultures, or it otherwise helps me get closer to ironing out potential issues in a way I haven't yet considered, I will pay you $5 via Paypal or Venmo (will ask for details via pm), or 1 month of Reddit Gold if you prefer. If you also offer a good fix for setting-breaking ideas that maintains the desired setting, I will pay you $15 (additional, if the accepted setting-breaking idea was yours).

The level of consistency and detail I am aiming for here is somewhere between "would not be out of place in a Brandon Sanderson novel" and "you can do some physics to it without it immediately breaking everything." While there isn't a meaningful limit to the number of ideas I will accept, I have a rather high bar for acceptance criteria, and have already put a great deal of thought into this myself. If your idea does not clearly state assumptions and include significant critical analysis, it probably won't be accepted.

Of course, I am only one person, and I will never have it said that I--a mere mortal (/for now/)--thought myself above the capabilities of a veritable horde of rationalist munchkins. Hence this post. I would much prefer to get most of this out of the way so I can account for it in world-building rather than having players break it later.

/Additional Note: I will be omitting most of the details of the setting and mechanics for hopefully obvious reasons, including only information I expect to give players near the start of the Quest, which is also roughly what an average person that is particularly knowledgeable of magic would have access to./

** If I understood Energy Burst properly, a Prismatic mage should be able to make solid objects which disintegrate when forced or dismissed by essentially creating kinetic energy force fields in whatever shape they want. Such objects would be mostly useless for all direct purposes, of course. [[http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=821][An average punch]] contains around 150 joules, so making armor or weapons will rapidly exhaust the mage's mana supplies and render them ordinary not-elves again.

However, using such objects as industrial molds should be trivial. The force field only cares about repelling whatever material you pour into it, so molten metals can be contained as easily as any other liquid of similar density. A rank novice with a 20 MP cap can create a mold which will withstand 2,000 J of force before shattering, which is quite a lot when all you need to do is keep an otherwise stationary fluid in place until it cools enough to be self-supporting. This allows Prismatic mages to create arbitrary objects out of any metal this civilization has the capacity to melt, limited only by their capacity to hold the details of these objects in mind while creating the form.

Assuming mundane mathematics exists in this world, much of the limitation in imagination can be mitigated by meditating on the set of equations which define your object, rather than mentally simulating the object directly. However, that isn't the really important bit. The hardest part of setting up heavy industry isn't having the idea of an automated loom, it's having the technology to create sturdy enough parts to create such a machine which will hold up to wear. DaVinci had sketches of bicycles, but the first ones weren't created until the 19th century. This is because we couldn't translate the parts DaVinci imagined into reality with enough fidelity to make a bike which actually worked, and because we didn't have enough good steel lying around to make the idea practical until then.

With Prismatic Energy Burst Forging, the imagination-to-reality gap is gone. Precision forging of small, detailed pieces for intricate machines becomes easy the moment you have a machine-worthy alloy. In fact, smaller pieces are even easier to create than larger ones, as the metal involved will require less force to shape into the required form. The only hard limitation on the intricacy of machines is the intricacy of the most complicated part, and once someone has the idea to start mass-producing screws and other fasteners, even that goes by the wayside. Any part which could be broken down into simpler parts becomes easy to produce. The only limitations on the development of industry become metallurgy and the number of Prismatic mages available. That sounds like a real limit, until the first Prismatic mage starts making precision tools to replicate what they can do with force field molds. Precise lathes and other metal-shaping devices would allow normals to start creating replacement parts for machines, and once you have that, you have a full-on industrial revolution.

This trick also applies to the handling of any other fluid which humans don't want to handle directly. Glassblowing can be revolutionized by blowing the glass into a perfectly shaped mold which vanishes the moment the glass hardens. Poisonous gasses can be transferred between containers in perfect security by containing them in force field jars in the interim. Prismatic surgeons could make arbitrarily sharp scalpels and easily ligate bleeders all on their own, as it takes a relatively tiny amount of force to keep even a major artery closed.

Now that I think of it, the fact that no diseases exist means that trauma surgery should be far more advanced in this world than it would be in ours under the same circumstances, as you don't need to worry about the waste of resources involved in a "saved" patient dying of sepsis. Their wars against not-goblins should not leave thousands of crippled casualties behind, as civil-war-and-earlier battlefield amputations were overwhelmingly done to prevent infection, rather than to stop bleeding. Anyone who doesn't bleed to death should survive any battle wound, in the long run.

Just in general, a world with no disease will be so astoundingly different from our own that I'm not sure you can be reasonably expected to simulate it well enough to write a story with no plot holes, whether obvious or not. Food will either keep indefinitely or just become less nutritious over time as it breaks down, but you will always be able to eat it safely as long as no foodborne pathogens exist. Everyone should be drinking directly from rivers and streams, as without cholera and other waterborne pathogens, the impetus to create safer drinks like beer will not exist. Overpopulation will be solvable only through advances in technology increasing the amount of people you can feed with a given amount of land, war, or autocratic policies directly limiting the reproduction of the masses. In fact, this might be the major impetus behind repeated, failed campaigns against the not-goblins. Win or lose, a ton of peasants you couldn't feed are now dead. Insert conspiracy to repeatedly fail in conquering the ancestral homelands and/or prop up the occasional smart not-goblin warlord as long as possible to serve this purpose.

Screw the magic system, actually. No diseases is way more interesting.

Since joules measure work rather than force the mold can actually be infinitely strong provided it doesn't do any work - i.e. if it doesn't change shape / move around while full, or otherwise create energy from nothing.

This is /definitely/ exploitable with the right physics, for example making diamonds from graphite with an externally powered magical vise.

***** Yep, joules can measure both work and energy while watts measure power (the rate at which work is done / energy is transferred).

The way energy burst is specified joules are used as a unit of work ("100J change in physical energy per MP spent"). I.e. up to 100J can be magically transferred to the physical environment per MP. In a comment somewhere in this thread the OP mentions phrasing it that way after a discussion with their physics professor so presumably it's a deliberate choice.

*** [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]: Regarding your points about molds, I had to consult with my ex-physics professor co-QM about this one. He brought to my attention that the limits I specified on the ability was problematic. It is in fact total energy change to the environment that should be the limiter, so if you attempted to use Energy Burst to create molds in this way, they would be broken by the heat of the metals. Also, the forms don't last very long, and certainly not long enough to allow forging.

Thanks for your suggestion though, and I'll award a bounty to this for pointing out an issue that needed refinement. PM me with details or let me know if you prefer gold. (E: Donation.)

Regarding the disease stuff, this falls under setting-specific, so I won't be speaking to that.

Edit: I also realized I was making this way too hard. If Blue mages are allowed to manifest forms in the middle of a barrel of slightly molten candle wax or gallium or something, they can freeze themselves permanent objects around which ceramic molds could be formed. If they are only allowed to manifest objects in open air, they could do a sort of 3D printer impression by selectively freezing the surface and pulling the object out carefully. It would take a ton of skill, but they might be able to turn themselves into a primitive prototyping machine.

** Imbue Object seems ripe for abuse.

Can a mage Imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, and has the ability to cast 'Imbue Object', passing on a lesser form of its abilities?

Is mana or time the main bottleneck for imbuing objects? If it's mana, then Siphon on captured enemies, willing apprentices (who would be useful even if they never get trained), or other self-charging objects (if they are a valid target) could speed up the creation process enough to unbalance things.

What are the limits on mana capacity for imbued objects? Can a mage spend five years pouring power into an object imbued with Energy Burst, then release it all at once to destroy a castle in a single blow?

--------------

Transformation is permanent (unless countered with Heal)? I see two strategies that make logistics easier for an army.

First, transform every soldier into a "normal" form, so that all equipment (armor, boots, etc.) is perfectly interchangeable. This can also replace physical conditioning if the mages are precise enough.

Second, if animals are a valid target, transform a cow into a mouse (spending ~1 hour to shrink it), carry it where you're going (and feed it over time), de-transform it, then eat it. Depending on how hard it is to do, this may only be useful for Special Forces.

--------------

This is probably just an artifact of your summary, but one joule of electricity is /far/ deadlier than one joule of fire or water jets.

--------------

Telepathy can be heavily optimized through the use of code, although your familiarity/complexity costs may cover that already. "3-7" /sounds/ simpler than "A force of approximately 100 goblin-things are currently traversing the North-East pass", but it conveys the same information.

- It is theoretically possible (not known to be impossible) for a mage to imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, but this would take a staggering amount of magic
- Imbued objects can cast imbue object on other objects, but because of the minimum cost, you will lose efficiency with each step.

Time and mana are both important, but we're talking order minutes for an expert mage to put all of their capacity into an object. I suppose Siphon could be used on someone using the Imbue Object ability, so there is definitely the possibility of gathering magic from enough sources via Siphon to put much greater magic into something than is otherwise possible. It isn't physically possible for someone to concentrate for 5 years, but...

If you can offer an analysis with reasonable numerical assumptions on Energy Burst that convinces me this is setting-breaking, it is worth $20 (extra because there's an easy fix).

Wait, so if you get about 10% of your MP back per minute, an expert mage can dump all their MP into a new object every ten minutes, over and over? So for a four-hour work day I can crank out 24 wands? That seems super broken. At that point MP isn't even a limitation in a fight, because everyone has a bandolier of wands that they made the day before. And now your resource concerns aren't "I can only cast so many spells per day/combat" (per day already nuked by 10-minute regen time), but "I can only carry so many wands."

Especially if imbued objects can be used by non-wizards. In which case, wizards should never leave home. Just make wands.

One in a two hundred people is a trained wizard. So in just over eight days, everyone in the entire population can have a Wand of Healing. (okay fine, you need to be an advanced wizard to make wands and regen mana this quickly, so if you need to be in the top 10% of wizards to do this it takes society about three months to give everyone a magic item). I'm not sure that's what you want?

There is a significant upfront cost to Imbue Object (intentionally so) that I believe makes this infeasible; you get pretty strong diminishing returns by making wands. I suppose you could set an expert mage to mass-producing +5 hp potions or one-time-use campfire-starters, but I'm unconvinced that this is the best use of that mage's time, or that it would be particularly setting-breaking. If you don't immediately die from wounds, healing is going to be pretty plentiful anyway.

A handgun bullet, falling three feet, 1 cm^{2} of third-degree burns, or a defibrillator charge is about 500 J, and a cannonball is about 1,250,000 J (2500x as much energy as a normal attack).

It gets a bit crazy when you throw invertebrates into the mix.

**** The way I would fix this problem is to make it the holy grail of warfare that scientists think should be possible in principle, but haven't found a suitable animal due to the large difference in genes and size between people and bugs. This would make functional venom glands hard to replicate to a level of precision that actually works, with most attempts resulting in the venom leaking into the mage's bloodstream before the injection mechanism forms, with unpredictable variance in the effects. If it's ever done, it'd be difficult to replicate.

** The immediate idea for a possible exploit that could break the setting comes from the use of Transformation as a means of achieving Immortality by transforming into younger versions of yourself or other people. One possible change you could make to the spell is to have Transformed individuals still suffer from debilitating mental conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia that effectively cause their death even if their body is young. This would allow for the existence of a very interesting setting where everyone above a certain social or financial position can retain perpetual youth without having to deal with the massive implications of an undying ruling class.

This may not be necessarily setting breaking but another idea based on Transformation is the potential ability of a Not-Elf to transform himself or a trusted compatriot into a Goblin-Thing. The Transformed Not-Elf could use their superior Not-Elf intellect and technology to acquire a position of power and unify the Goblin-Things. This seems like a great plot bunny as the Dark Lord unifying the monstrous races is a classic trope for a reason.

Transformation does not allow fine-grained control of the target form, and does not allow for any changes except for mass or volume (including age). It cannot be used reliably for infiltration. You could transform into a goblin-thing or a not-elf or vice versa, but the details wouldn't be exact and your mannerisms would give you away.

**** If you just want to transform into a generic goblin-thing, does the imprecise essence impact this or does it mean that all that anyone can transform into is golem-like shapes without facial features or fingers or any smaller details like that?

Are goblin-things clever enough to collectively figure out that the powerful goblin-thing ordering them about on pain of magical death and surprisingly successful raids on not-elves is secretly not a goblin-thing, and would they care given that they have no culture and the strange goblin-thing with more magic than any five other mages is making their tribe more successful than any others in living memory?

Could this work repeatedly on a cyclical basis if the goblins only have word-of-mouth to pass down their tribe's history, or is word-of-mouth retelling more culture than they can manage?

  Transform one's body, or the body of a willing or subdued target to that of another form. The form must be based off of one's experience of living creatures, and must be vaguely organic in nature. The caster does not have fine-grained control of the target form, but can reliably produce the same form. The cost to reverse the transformation is negligible. One may "master" one form with a great deal of practice. Every successful transformation reduces the time it takes to complete the transformation by up to a few seconds, to a minimum of 3 seconds. A mastered form may be replaced by spending an entire day in another form (that form does not become mastered).

Convert elephants to mice, launch sacks of mice from catapults, convert back to elephants in the 3 seconds they are in flight, it's now raining elephants on your enemies?

Convert mice to elephant, butcher elephant and feed whole town/all your troops? (Or cows, if you want to be inefficient.) I know someone already mentioned doing this to transport cows, but why bother? Just transport (or catch) mice and have a mage who can turn mice into cows.

If I transform a 6 month old elephant into a mouse, let it live as a mouse for a year, and then transform it back, is it now a 20-year-old elephant (equivalent amount of aging as a mouse) or is it still only a 1.5 year old elephant?

** Firstly, this is a great idea! I hope all the responses aren't overwhelming you. With that in mind, here are some thoughts I've had:

- You've commented that Energy Burst travels via some illusory medium. Depending on what blocks it, that could lead to those fearing such attacks wearing protection like wide-brimmed hats with long veils. These wouldn't absorb energy but instead block the illusory medium. Of course, it could easily be that you can just target the hat and the ice spike will continue on through.

- It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

- When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

- In a similar manner to the Transformation for venom, could Energy Burst with green mana be used to produce a burst of nature-based energy in the form of poison or acid? That could cause more harm than might otherwise be possible, as minimal physical energy would need to be imparted. Of course, the substance would have to be fast-acting enough to cause harm before it vanishes.

- Is the time horizon of Luck distinct from its duration? If you've narrowed a battle plan down to two options, would it help to cast Luck then toss a coin to choose between them? If a personal stake is required, you could also bet on the outcome of the battle. From the sound of it, it would be hard to tell whether this works or not - it might be a sort of superstition that some generals have. It probably counts as relying on Luck, too

- You've mentioned magical backlash as a possibility that is more likely when Siphon is used. Would Luck help to avoid this? Also, could this be used to counterspell by sending mana (ideally of a kind useless to both sender and receiver) to a caster as they're casting?

- Would the magic present in the environment ever be a limiting factor? Depending on how quickly it's replenished, you could have the elves pursue a scorched earth policy of sending patrols through an area using mana, perhaps literally scorching the earth with it, in order to create buffer zones that lack enough ambient magic for the goblin casters to recover. This is partially inspired by Trudi Canavan's Magicians series, in which I think magic items are used with a similar purpose at one point.

- This is a little morbid, but without disease, famine would presumably be the main nonviolent form of disaster. However, no disease also means that amputating limbs to eat would be less risky, and the availability of healing magic could perhaps allow those limbs to be restored in times of plenty.

- It sounds like the default unit of organisation for mages should be a trio containing one with an affinity for each type of mana, one of whom knows siphon, so that each can benefit from the unusable mana reserves of the others.

- I'm aware that you're no longer offering transformation bounties, but two options that I don't think have been ruled out are transforming for superior eyesight and other senses, and transforming into a form that can fly. Both of these would be great boons for recon and guerilla warfare by the elves.

- How distinct are the mind and the brain? I'm assuming that Transforming an elf into an ox wouldn't diminish their intelligence, but what about transforming an ox into an elf? Could that make animal training easier?

- On a similar note, it might be possible for the elves to train large docile animals and Transform them into more dangerous forms for combat, but I expect it would be a challenge to have the Transformed animal fight effectively.

- Lastly, I know you're not looking for setting information but I'm curious why the elves launch attacks on the goblins rather than clearing out the wilderness in their territory, since that's a major cause of deaths and having more farmland would increase the elven population

It's stated that *matter* created with the form is temporary, but the implication is that /energy/ is permanent. That is to say, if you burn something with a Red Energy Burst it doesn't "un burn" a little while later. In that case, you should be able to use a Blue energy burst to precision freeze a form out of a pool of water. It'd require some craftsmanship, but I'd imagine "Ice Fabricators" in this way would be relatively common since it doesn't require a big MP pool.

** Hmm, one of the things I see is implementing a tax break (or reward, or whatever) for people who are sensitive to magic, but not strong enough to be actual mages to let you siphon off their mana. That way, you don't have to worry so much about exhausting your apprentices doing the siphoning to them.

Next, implement a telepathy based post office. The telepaths can work in shifts, and while they are on shift, they'll be 'in the post office' meaning you don't have to worry too much about where they are to send stuff to them.

You can also implement a scrying based message passing system: use writing or a sand table or whatever to draw your message and have someone scry it. This would seem to get around the complexity limits of telepathic messages.

Could you make a device that could recreate the scried image/drawing/letter? Then you have magic fax machines. You also have a magic printing press. (Example of how this could be done: energy burst fire in the form of letters, to simply burn them into your paper/parchment/whatever. Or energy burst an ice block with your letters sticking out and then just ink them and press.)

Write a 'code book' for telepathic messages. Take a page from ye olde maratime radio codes, and reduce 'common' message to collections of 3 letters (or whatever).

The post office lets yo gain all sorts of advantages from real time communication. Example: weather tracking, if a big storm is coming in, your telepaths can tell the post office in the port city (or whatever) about it, so they don't send out their fishing fleet (or whatever). I know ground based weather tracking stations were used with the advent of radio.

In addition, the post office allows for much more centralized government. You don't need to delegate decision making power to some baron if the village mayor (or whatever) can just ask the central government for what they want done.

If you can scry on some object high above, you can do things like send a kite up over your army, scry the kite, and get a birds eye view of what your army (and the other army) is doing. In fact, scrying on a kite for general recon should work all the time.

If you can revoke transforms at a distance, you can fire blue whales (or whatever) at people, by making the blue whale smaller, getting it over them, and then letting the transform go.

Telepathy also means you have a method of determining longitude while at sea. At local noon (or whenever) on the ship, you talk to/scry the post office in your capitol to find out what time it is there, which lets you compare the times and find what your longitude is. This is a pretty big deal in long range ship navigation.

You can probably use energy burst to mimic explosives. (Example, use a fire or electrical burst to flash a little bit of water to steam in a confined space). This lets you do things like cut roadways, fire cannons, quarry stone, etc much easier than ye olde pick and chisel method. If this works, you end up with star forts instead of castles, since castle walls don't resist cannon fire. This also lets you do things like have large stone blocks pre-prepared to block roads in the case of invasion, and when the invasion comes, you just drop the rocks. (IRL, South Korea has several pre-prepared big blocks of concrete to block roadways, etc in the case of invasion.)

You can do much more intensive training on people if you can heal all the 'minor' joint, ligament, bone, and muscle damage to the trainees. Train until your muscles are tearing off your bones, get healed, do it all again tomorrow. You can't do this this IRL because of long recovery times and the build up of incremental damage, but if you can heal all that, go wild.

You can probably get 'canned' food by using energy burst to sterilize food in an airtight container (e.g. a glazed piece of pottery).

True for building muscle, but not true for muscle memory. Seems like they could become pretty intensely good fighters this way, with a year tacked on the end to help build up any muscle strength they need that they didn't get because of the healing.

Alternately, it would be interesting if healing helped reduce the need for sleep due to resetting the body back to a point when it was rested. Could have long training sessions back to back with healing in between, for really any subject you wanted someone trained up quickly in.

Not interested in money, just very fascinated by the magic system and don't necessarily think the ability to make arbitrarily powerful magical items is a bad thing, but can be a source of flavor with massive mana battery/generators being high-value objects being carted to a place where a new wizard's tower is being built to serve as its foundation.

Or tree-lined magical wands that are good for only a few absurdly powerful shots, but can break the walls of cities so easily that city walls are only built to defend against raiders, not enemy nations.

** [Wrote these before reading other comments to avoid contamination, so may repeat things. ]

The *magic transferring* is going to be the biggest thing. You can effectively get around any of the mana restrictions by having enough minions to get the magic from them.

Depending on how fast magic builds up/dissipates in a person then you would either have arrangements with as many people as possible to regularly give you their mana, or have them all kept nearby for when needed. If it's a semifuedal society then you would probably make them your close servants/retainers. Having a large retinue would be important for retaining power and status. [This would end up being similar to how breath works in Sanderson's Warbreaker, or the magic in the Black Magician series.]

The next bit depends a lot on how much mana an individual can hold and for how long:

- if there isn't a limit and it dissipates slowly/not at all then you would end up with individuals building up as much as possible, under they are storing a nuclear level amount personally. (This would fit in well with the fuedal lords, e.g. each lord has a couple of hundred serfs who ritualistically give them mana regularly).
- If it dissipates or is capped then you would have people absorbing as much as possible, then putting it into objects and stockpiling those. (They effectively become mana storage batteries, but with a specific use.) Which ends up with a similar dynamic, but items are potentially easier to steal, deny access to, or buy and sell.
- If these items can be used by anyone, then you have an equivalent of the invention of gunpowder, where you could equip a group of soldiers with premade magic items, making them as powerful as mages for the length of a battle. This would be a potential way to explain why the not-elves have maintained military superiority, if they have squads of professional trained soldiers all with magic weapons, and the enemy has rare mages and lots of grunts. (Again the firearms analogy).
- Socially this also changes the role of mages from front line combatants to manufacturing weapons en masse, and means having a separate professional soldier class using the weapons.

If magic is capped/dissipates, but mass production of items isn't an option: You would have mages with teams entourages of dozens/hundreds on hand to power their abilities. E.g. in a battle situation a mage effectively acts like an artillery piece, with minions as ammo, continuously rotating to refill them. Tactically this means defending the entourage is important, and by killing them you can disable opposing magic users. Also since they are a limited resource the mages will run out eventually, so the side with the bigger supply has a major advantage. So how fast you use your reserves compared to your opponent is key. Meaning there might be tactics of forcing your opponent to use theirs up early in a battle.

Another way to nerf the imbued magic items would be to have them also slowly lose magic over time, or only be usable by the the original maker.

*Telepathy/scrying* gives a massive military advantage, allowing the side with the better mages (presumably the elves) to have a level of information and coordination that wasn't possible until the modern age. Obviously this makes it easier for them to set ambushes, send small groups to intercept, etc. Total information superiority is a big deal. So you may want to add an antiscrying ability? Scrying can also be used as an equivalent of telepathy, if you have someone write information in a pre specified location a scryer can read the messages. Which might allow you to get around some of telepathy's restrictions, in exchange for the added restriction that its one way. E.g. a soldier i the field can write out a page long report and leave it on top of a predeignated rock, bypassing the information restrictions on telepaths, With two scryers you can have an instant messenger style conversation with them each writing on paper and reading the otehrs paper.

Also, havign fast long distance communication means you can have a much more modern centralised state and culture than would be possible before the modern era on earth. Meaning fuedal lords would be much less independent, and news travels a lot faster. Which has various politicla and economic implications. Combines interestingly with people not being able to travel much because of the monsters etc, as that means walled cities with telepaths can be culturally and politically linked, but the people rarely interact in person

*Where does the food come from?*

- For the elves, you say they are on a small area of not very fertile land, does that mean they have a strictly limited population (much smaller than their original one) and frequent food shortages? That makes control of land and population control a big deal politically.

- For the goblin/orcs, do they have a cohesive enough society and enough intelligence to have large scale farming? If not I can't see them maintaining a population without magical assistance. This then opens the question of why they are good enough at coordinating for that, but not for other things.

Related to that, I'm not a big fan of the big dumb warrior race trope in general. Since its hard to do well without getting into uncomfortable territory. Though there are ways you can play with it. How do they maintain larg enough societies for food etc, if they are innately violent or stupid? Is there some limitation that only comes out as groups get larger? Could there be tribes who were coordinated enough that the elves could trade with them? That opens interesting possibilities with havign different not-goblin nations trading with the elves or acting as buffer states/mercenaries. Also allows things like selling some good quality weapons to one tribe and setting them off aginst their neighbours

*edit* also, there's al sorts of fun you ca have if invigorate spells can be used for magic power, intelligence, speed of thought, skill in magic, etc. But I assume those would be not allowed. Maybe make a hard rule that it can only apply to physical attributes? Being able to remove the need for sleep or food would aso be a big deal

*edit 2* Can energy burst pass through objects? If yes, then I create an extremely thin but large and wide sheet at approximately neck height in the middle of an enemy formation, killing them en masse. In general it would also be most useful to deploy very small shapes targetted at vital areas. (Tiny amount in the eye/brain is often fatal.)

This is clever and is indeed possible, although scrying itself has nontrivial costs to maintain. It is not an idea I haven't considered.

Heal, Rejuvenate, and Imbue Object would currently allow for this. Other abilities require the magic to be gathered up-front. I don't really want to have to model Siphon being used inside of a cast-time for other abilities, so lets just say that it works, but is very dangerous and is more likely to cause a magical backlash than to increase the effect.

** I've got a bunch of questions though I'm sure you'll answer them in the way that doesn't clearly break the system.

For Imbue object:

How does the Magic Ability get triggered after the caster has imbued an object? Can these Magic Abilities be triggered without a person to use them? E.g. Could I imbue a rock with energy burst to keep hammering the same spot over a long period of time?

How is the Magic Power of the imbued object determined?

Could you imbue a single marble in a bag of marbles with Imbue Object so that it imbues another marble with Imbue Object? And then later both of those marbles imbue two other marbles with Imbue Object? And so on until you had a bag of marbles with a lot of MP?

What happens if a caster tries to imbue an object that has already been imbued (but isn't yet inert)?

What counts as an object? Could a caster imbue a building with Soothe?

For energy burst:

Can the user control the density of the energy? E.g. Can a caster make a large block of ice that isn't filled with much energy and so doesn't cost much MP? Can a caster make a bullet that's imparted with a lot of energy?

What happens when the temporary object fades? E.g. Would this kill a person if they breathed the air of a green energy burst when it disappears?

What does a form consist of? Could a caster make a form that is oil and then burn it? Could a caster make a gold coin and sell it? Could a caster make gunpowder or other explosives? Could a caster make carbon nanotubes?

Do the created forms follow the laws of physics? E.g. if a caster were to create a large rock above someone, would it fall to crush them?

For transformation:

What happens if you reverse a transformation in an area that is smaller than the real body? How fast does this reversal happen?

For all blue magics:

Can these be cast on an involuntary target, either by a caster or by an object imbued with their spells? e.g. could you throw a cube of scrying at a person to take them out of the battle?

For telepathy:

Can a caster send telepathic messages to people who don't want them? Can a caster send a message that's very long but not very complex? E.g. Could a caster send the equivalent of tv static or me saying "Hi" on repeat for 1 hour?

Is a message sent all at once or does it happen over a period of time? If the latter, what happens if the target moves while the caster is sending a message?

For heal and rejuvenate:

Is the mind of the target at all affected by these? E.g. What would these do to someone who had memory loss due to being hit in the head?

So the thing is, I have intuitive/explicit models of how the magic /should work/ that are far more defined than pithy descriptions allow me to easily convey without prohibitive effort. Also, a lot of it is intentionally vague so as not to give away more information than I would prefer to. And simple illusion of transparency means that there are going to be numerous cases where I fail to adequately convey those intuitions even after attempting to answer clarification questions.

It isn't the case that the uncertainty in your mind created by lack of adequate description on my part can resolve to literally any interpretation. Indeed, a lot of the finer points are mostly already defined by the elements I have intuitively pinned down, even if I haven't actually considered them yet in that amount of detail.

TBH the whole process is immensely taxing and I'm going to have to take a break for a couple hours at least. I would appreciate though if you could not imply that I'm trying to cheat on answers, though -- this is just really hard to do for one person.

Iiinteresting. One neat thing I could see happening is armies having a set of "pole-and-cloth" apparatus to carry over their army's heads, much like a circus tent or whatever, made to look like the terain to block random burst scrying to find them; I would expect this to be more common around encampments, but a suitably ambitious general could do it on the march too if they're willing to sacrifice speed for security. You couldn't just carry it in a straight march, because then the movement would give it away, but you could have it in parts with the back end being pulled down and carries to the front which if your dye skills are good enough would allow a full army core to operate as though under camouflage. Not setting breaking, but might be a neat past exploit, and if it was successful at some point in the past would probably lead to any cores of scrying mages being trained in a wide variety of geographies so they could identify these constructs.

I would expect mages to be split into trios under almost all circumstances, unless it is certain that only 1 form of magic is needed at a location; with prismatic magic, they can shuffle their magic between different disciplines (ie three red , or 2 blue and 1 green, or 1 of each like normal, or almost arbitrary fractions of each; you would also expect these to be of a approximately equal skill level since that way there's no 'wasted" mana, which would probably lead to three man magic squads being a common theme in literature and in magic training; you'd here legends about sam, jack, and jane, who did x heroic thing in the past, but also john, james, and arthur, the professional magic casters who work together in the nearby city.

Possibly intended, but a red mage seems far more useful for large organizations, green for isolated locales, and blue for administrative work; I'd expect a cultural association with those positions after this long, although this would be somewhat counteracted by trios and the greater personal freedom they might have with their greater than average rarity and therefore disproportionate inluence.

** So I might or might not be braking your setting exactly, but arbitrary tf magic will do terrible, terrible things to your cultures.

The first thing you need to understand is that the earliest evidence we have for a humans capacity for imagination is [a furry](). Every cultures first religion is based around anthropomorphised concepts. Every culture that has ever existed has extensively used anthro characters in their art, religion, and myth. Significant fractions of your not-elves are going to not be not-elves.

"Oh, well, people into that stuff in our world aren't common, so that means people into that stuff in my world would be the same." Except the people historically into that have been the cultural and religious leaders, people like actors, shamans, artists, priests, etc. Which means that their culture is going to have a strong culture of exploring that.

Species swaps are going to be a huge thing, since rock eaters have at least one form that they are familiar with: their own, and mages specializing in transformation are going to be spending a lot of time swapping around forms so they can familiarize themselves. Are the rock eaters better miners? Expect a lot of miners to voluntarily become not-elf/rock eater hybrids. I expect that not-elves actually come from using transformation magic to optimize their stat-builds, which would happen anyways.

  When things disappear, what happens to the space they used to occupy?
#+end_quote

As the form materializes and travels, it pushes air out of the way. The energy required to do so is accounted for in the 100J delta-energy per MP limit, but is generally negligible. This does mean that attempting to use it in water or some medium denser than air is going to be less effective. When the effect fades, it does so gradually (you can imagine it continuously shrinking away into nothing), and whatever medium it traveled through will flow back to occupy the space.

  Telepathically communicate with the target individual. Complexity is bounded by one's understanding of the target's language. Distance is soft-bounded by needing to know roughly where the target is in relation to the user. This limit can be mitigated with use of scrying, and also with practice over time.
#+end_quote

If I'm reading this right, you can break this to create long distance military communications. Is the only Mp limit message complexity ? How do you define complexity ?

Write a code in which each command or information is keyed to one or two phonemes. Like, the TH sound in "The" is enemy and the TH sound in "fourth" is ally. Since there are languages in the real world with upwards of 140 phonemes, it should be fairly easy to convey any complex orders using at most 5~6 phonemes for trivial MP costs. Think morse code, except instead of binary you are working with base 140. Prefer using very common phonemes, and leave the rarer phonemes for weirder words.

Nail down a chair and train all communication officers (blue mages) to keep track of where the chair is in relation to them. Teach officers to end communications with a indication of location so the mage in the chair can relay back messages. Congratulations, you just created a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange][Telephone Exchange]] that can relay orders in real time, instantly, at all moments for little to no cost, directly to the receiver's brain. Even modern day military would kill for this kind of security.

Now put a Scryer just beside that chair for the duration of pitched battles. You now have both instant communications and the magical equivalent of satellite surveillance while your enemies are using scouts. You see where i am going with this.

Communications is the most broken thing in warfare that I know of. And these guys have communications that are impossible to intercept.

Some things in physics aren't arbitrary; they are mathematical truths emerging from rather simple assumptions. One would say common sense even. E.g. the strength of electromagnetic waves always has to scale with 1/r if the wave front keeps its energy. Say you assume that Maxwells equations do not hold; if rot E is not equal to the negative time derivative of magnetic flux density you can have perpetual motion machines because you'll be able to generate infinite energy.

Quantum physics is not where EM waves come from. There are phenomena that are so intrinsically linked that no matter what is going on, you'll always get an analogue. A finite speed of propagation of a disturbance in a measurable quantity means you get waves if the medium isn't overdamped.

Well, my point is that for some of these things, we don't have to run experiments. We can exclude them a priori due to certain mathematical theorems, e.g. calculus. I don't have to run an experiment to know that calculus is true. Similarly, I don't have to run an experiment to know that a vector field is going to fulfill stokes theorem if it is continuous and doesn't contain a singularity. Much of what physics today consists of is just math that will always stay applicable, no matter how the details actually work out. In a similar fashion, any mathematical theorem true in our universe, will also be true in theirs, no matter how the underlying physics actually work.

You have to assume that you can measure position and time to satisfiable precision. Then it follows from the difference quotient being a satisfactory approximation of a derivative.

For vector fields? Yes. If you lose energy in one direction, you gain it by moving in the other. I can write down an example if you want. Any loop that violates conservation of energy means you can move backwards and gain infinite energy.

As for the proof of the thermodynmic equilibrium situation see Frederick Reif:Fundamentals of Thermodynamics and Statistic page 382. He drew a setup where you need absorption and emission coefficients to be the same if you want to keep thermodynamic equilibrium and energy conservation.

Meanwhile the goblin-things can win wars just fine without any coordination, and have tons of novice mages that have no issue casting the (probably) cheap telepathy spell.

One way to patch this, and even improve the not-elves coordination, would be to allow weighted telepathic messages: make it so casters can expend more mana on the telepathy spell to give their messages more weight, and make it so that all messages received by a target are queued up in order of weight and played one by one. This way the goblin-thing novice mages can only cast low-weight telepathic messages, while the not-elves powerful mages can send out high-weight telepathic messages. The not-elves can even weight their messages according to their command rank, so important strategic messages from central headquarters are queued up before messages from low-ranking field officers.

  The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines (with restrictions on color of magic used; blue=water/ice-based, red=fire-based, green=electric, air, or nature-based, prismatic=no restriction). The energy released (heat change or kinetic energy imparted in terms of Joules) *is limited to 100J change in physical energy per MP spent*. The forms created in this manner are temporary; the ability is not known to create permanent objects.

**** Can I put in 0 joules? Because it says time to cast is proportional to energy and so is MP. So if I put 0 joules into the object it will be instant and take no MP. With prismatic energy form I can create an infinite array of whatever objects I want and the only restriction is that they aren't permanent. For example, I could create a bajillion copies of a barrel of black powder with a fuse about to go off, and place its form across the entire plains of the goblins (there's also no stated restriction on the location of the forms object). Insta-victory!

Putting MP restrictions on creating the form of the object is a little bit complicated. You could create a cost to create the form based on its mass-energy but then the "putting energy in to it" doesn't make much sense anymore with Earth physics (creating a kilogram of water is about the same as creating a kilogram of super heated hydrogen/oxygen plasma). You'd be fine ignoring General relativity, charging some MP per unit mass, and per unit thermal/kinetic/chemical energy.

But then there's an issue with kinetic energy and Imbue Object. Kinetic Energy has to be defined with respect to something, and if its the caster then you can create an arbitrarily tiny mass object so that a tiny amount of kinetic energy makes it still go arbitrarily fast, imbue object on it to give it the ability to cast Energy Burst and then that object can create other objects going the same speed as it (so 0 kinetic energy from its perspective). Then you have a normal size object moving arbitrarily fast. [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][Ouch]].

In addition to all this you make fraud an irritating concern for anyone with known prismatic abilities because with arbitrary form creation you can create any object (like say an official seal or a bar of gold) and as long as the con happens before it dissipates you're solid.

Here's how I would solve it in a way that retains as many of the original characteristics as possible. I would say: 1) You can place a magical marker on an arbitrarily amount of objects. 2) The process of placing the marker is fragile, super easy to break with access to the object, takes a long time, etc. (so placing it on goblin brains isn't a thing). 3) The object will teleport in front of the mage, paying a cost for any differences in speed/altitude (between the caster and the object) (this is to pay for kinetic energy/gravitational potential energy), and then energy can be put into it.

This way, the mages just prepare by marking a bunch of water/air/arbitrary object and then everything after is basically the same. The red colour mages would have to change from fire to combustibles. Also, there's annoyance because the Earth rotates so if you walk away from the object far enough you start paying some kinetic energy cost (if its on the other side of the equator and its like earth you have to change its speed by 1700 km/hr), but you can just assume that the planet is big enough with respect to the mountains/plains that it wouldn't make much difference in a military campaign.

Also I have to go now so I didn't get time to do my typical proofreading/seeing if other comments came up which make this duplicated, sorry about that.

So that means creating a super heated plasma (or high explosive, but there's issues with tech level and this only applies to prismatic mages) requires just about as much MP as a normal form. So if you can create normal everyday objects then you are also a one-mage fusion reactor and possessor of incredible destructive power.

To clarify, could you use (for example) 100 red mages, 1 blue mage, and 1 green mage to cast prismatic magic at the level of ~102 mages? 1 of each colour for the initial prismatic cast and the extra 99 to provide extra juice after.

Regarding the not-elves tending to lose in 1-1 fights or evenly matched skirmishes, I thought of the not-elves having dedicated red mages for the purpose of transforming willing soldiers into more powerful forms---stronger and faster versions of themselves, or deadly wilderness creatures, or even goblin-things. I'd expect the mass/volume limits to be the biggest bottleneck.

A force of soldiers transformed in this way would be most effectively placed as border patrollers, or they could be used to make inroads into the fertile plains.

Transformation doesn't allow fine-grained control, and only allows changes to mass and volume aside from the shape-shifting effect.

****** Hmm, are you sure about that? 1MP to kill quickly and easily seems on the low side, unless your intent is that magic users are overwhelmingly lethal when in range.

The obvious limit on the effectiveness of cutting this way is the energy required to break chemical bonds intersecting a plane and shear slightly to prevent clean rebonding. That's not much so it's going to allow scything a lot of people at once for that single mana point if they are in range.

Maybe special armor could make the energy cost higher, either a magical counter or a very strongly bonded material (diamond?).

If chemical bonds count as quantum physics then the natural interpretation would be to extrapolate the macroscopic relationship between sharpness and cutting energy indefinitely, and for cutting to become a first class effect (i.e. that which is severed stays severed as there there is no chemical rebonding). That leads to the absurd result of being able to dice up everything in range for arbitrarily little energy. So you probably want to keep chemical bonds, or come up with some mechanism with similar properties.

Would Luck help in a brainstorming session on magic exploits?

Candidate law of magic: /Luck isn't self-aware./ Luck exactly can't influence events its existence caused, because it doesn't see them coming. If someone notices that Luck prevents bodily harm more strongly than events the target doesn't like, he may cast Luck on a bauble to crush it if events don't turn out to his liking. He will find that Luck doesn't know to satisfy him, because it can't figure out that he might crush it, because he only does that because Luck exists.

In a /Too clever for their own good/ scenario, an archmage may wander the countryside to seek an ignorant dabbler who tries to rediscover Magic on his own. The dabbler must never notice or be influenced by the archmage, for he set out on his quest because Luck exists. If the dabbler ever imagines a Fortune spell /without/ the self-ignorance complication and tries to improvise a casting (achieving no more than waving his arms), the archmage would surreptitiously cast Luck on the dabbler. The outcome of the dabbler's experiments would then reveal to the archmage whether Luck's blind spot also covers nearby concepts such as the hypothetical Fortune spell. If it doesn't, he will discover just /why/ the Atlanteans built a self-ignorance clause into their Wish spell.

Are some future events easier to Foretell than others? I imagine a great beacon constructed for visibility to past Beacon Foretellers. Light it when the Goblins unite under a general once more to warn Elven civilization decades back to raise a generation of soldiers. Depending on how your time loops work, a yet more ambituous project could iterate through policies: If the policies you received work, send them back again. If they don't, vary them using what you learned. Beware that the time loop may resolve to a Goblin general, rebelling noble or third party sending back that which allowed him to conquer the Elves. Instructions may include magic exploits such as how to construct a better temporal telegraph.

- Are sapients the only beings with magic sensitivity or can, say, plants naturally accumulate Green magic? If not, could using /Invigorate/ to increase sapience (reason? wisdom?) expose a latent sensitivity in plants or animals?

- Can you use /Imbue Object/ on a person? If so, do the imbued spells drain from their MP or does the Imbue create a second Prismatic pool? If it creates a prismatic pool can the target access it if they're already sensitive to a color?

- /Energy Burst/ fills a "form" with energy and prismatic energy has no restrictions on what that form is. It's stated that *matter* created with the form is temporary, but the implication is that /energy/ is permanent. That is to say, if you burn something with a Red Energy Burst it doesn't "un burn" a little while later. In that case, you should be able to use a Prismatic energy burst to channel MP directly into a target without siphon by treating the target as the "form". If so, this WOULD allow for mana batteries. They're Imbued Objects with huge base charges that can prismatic burst mana directly into their user.

** I think the ability of some people to transform into birds has a rather large number of important implications. For instance:

> The goblin-things still hold the fertile plains

If your enemy can ambush you and slaughter you in large numbers with basically zero casualties, *and* has a birds eye view of the landscape, are the goblins really going to be holding *plains*? The goblins should be underground, or in a dense forest, or somewhere similarly dense with cover where the enemy can't simply be dropping exploding rocks from the sky on them with total impunity.

> people live in walled communities and typically only travel via caravan

Are you *sure* it's not easier, safer, faster, cheaper to go to your local travel-and-post-office, staffed by a red mage who will turn you into a rat for an hour and then put you into a little sack, to be carried by people who have mastered bird form whose job it is to constantly be making trips between villages, gizzard filled with lucky healing rocks, mail, and a sack of people-transformed-into-small-animals in their talons? Or if you can automatically learn to fly upon becoming a bird, have them make you into a bird directly and pay for your trip by carrying letters and stuff for other people.

This gets all the more powerful once you get to large cities, which presumably have a couple Magic-Pillars-Of-Turning-Into-A-Bird or disposable Stamps of Knowing Telepathy at the post and travel office or something.

P.S. I think transformations to something of identical volume and mass are cost-less under this system? I don't think you want people turning into teenage dragons or something at no mana cost.

P.P.S. Psychiatrists are definitely going to be spamming Soothe all the time, surgery is really easy now because you can heal afterwards, if telepathy doesn't care about distance then this is probably a primary form of distance communication (use codexes and pre-agreed upon shorthands to increase privacy and decrease message complexity),

I actually knew Transformation was insanely broken going into this, despite my attempts to limit it or patch it beforehand. I still included it because I wanted to find novel ways to break it and was happy to pay people to do the work for me.

Without giving too much away, the magic presented here is kind of auxiliary to other things that are much more influential. But it's still important to get the magic right, and make sure that it doesn't have implications which would make the setting inconsistent, given I also care about making it rational and simulationist.

** It's somewhat interesting to me that you can use Healing in order to farm up arbitrarily large amounts of biological matter. In fact, given that it is not specified in the text, can you use heal or rejuvenate on nonorganic materials? If so, you can farm up arbitrarily large amounts of everything. Even ignoring that, the world would be pretty bizarre if it was semi-trivial to farm organic material. I suppose it depends on how fast mana regenerates and how expensive it is to use Heal and Rejuvenate.

** There is some ambiguity in your listed MP amounts for various levels of magician experience. Do more-experienced magicians accumulate MP faster, so that the quoted amounts are /per day/? Or are the quoted amounts caps on how much MP a magician has the capacity to store, as they accumulate MP over a long time at a fixed rate?

If MP accumulation is relatively fast, we can do this:

If 1 in 15 not-elves are magic-sensitive, 10% of these have potential to be useful, and about 1/3 of these are sensitive to red magic, that's about one useful red magician per 450 individuals, so they're common enough that any reasonably-sized settlement should have one.

Every morning, the town's red magician spends one day's worth of MP accumulation to invigorate the strongest man in town. It only lasts for a minute, but he spends that minute pulling on a chain. The chain quickly lifts a very heavy object to a great height, from which it is slowly lowered over the course of the day to drive machinery.

(As many others have suggested, this could be supplemented by using siphon to concentrate MP from the larger number of "not enough potential to be useful" red sensitives)

Proposed fix: Invigorate supplies the target ability with a fixed amount of energy per MP instead of a fixed duration in time, so that it is not acting multiplicatively on how much work you can do in one minute. Perhaps invigorating strength adds an amount proportional to MP spent to your maximum strength, and supplies enough energy to use all of that strength for e.g. 15 seconds; but if you only apply 1/4 as much force above what you could without magic, you can sustain that force for a minute. If you just rest & relax, it all dissipates in maybe half an hour. Probably the maximum strength also tapers off over time if not used.

This would also add a little bit of flexibility to use invigorate when the timing is a little less immediate. One could invigorate a soldier when combat is imminent, leaving them some flexibility to use the enhanced ability at a tactically opportune moment (this might not be desired and might have been your motivation for 1 minute? rescale things as desired).

** With a frequency rate of 1 in 10 to 1 in 20, it ought to have a very significant impact on Elf culture, contradicting your statement about magical impact. For comparison, about 2% of people have green eyes, and 1-2% have red hair, which is far more rare, and yet is considered reasonably normal. Even for the rarer race distribution, 1/100 would be enough that almost everyone would personally know someone who could do magic.

Scry: Would suggest changing the double negative to "Only works under an open sky". Not really an error, just a clarity thing, sorry for picking nits.

Siphon seems ineffective if there is, as appears, a 1:1 correlation. It would allow type-shifting of mana, but does not seem to be good at gaining mana overall, and thus seems a fairly poor thing to practice, given that learning seems to naturally increase mana reserves anyways, which would usually be far more valuable.

The time-cost for transformations would seem to be largely irrelevant. Anyone who focused on transformation would presumably, after learning a form, do it repeatedly until hitting the minimum shifting time. This would seem to be a particularly advantageous form of magic practice, as it provides an explicit benefit beyond normal training.

Rejuvenate: There appears to be no rules regarding stacking effects. Therefore, repeatedly casting Rejuvenate on oneself shortly before one has recovered all mana ought to stack ever higher levels of rejuvenation. I believe you'll either want to clange this to only work on health rather than all abilities, or set some other limits. This is probably the most important note, as it can be comboed with essentially anything else for nigh-arbitrary power.
