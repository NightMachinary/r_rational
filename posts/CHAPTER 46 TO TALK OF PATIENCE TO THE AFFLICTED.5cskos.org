** ...I notice that Dylan's reworded oath is missing one thing that Mark asked him to swear to.

Mark's oath asked Dylan to swear that he was /telling the truth/ and that things would go bad /if Dylan was lying/. Dylan's reworded oath says nothing one way or another about truthfulness.

He promises not to hurt Mark, and to get Mark safely to Europe. But he's lying to Mark. And I'm pretty sure Mark didn't notice.

If you examine the oath, he only forswears injury, emotional devastation, and frying Mark's eyes in vegetable oil. He doesn't forswear, for example, telling someone else to injure or emotionally devastate Mark, or to fry Mark's eyes in vegetable oil.

More importantly, however, Dylan manages to swear /not/ to get Mark safely to Europe if/when Mark wants to stop working with him (which Mark plans to do /eventually/, even if he does stay until Malia Ngo is dead). Mark doesn't need to know whether Dylan is lying: Taking him at his word is sufficient reason not to trust Dylan.

******* It's his core values. Viewing Dylan charitably - as at least half of me really wants to - he sees a world that's gone /wrong/, that's obviously offending against his sacred values, and refuses to accept any argument otherwise because the world is self-evidently /wrong/! To quote a Chesterton quote from [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/25/book-review-whats-wrong-with-the-world/][another of Scott's great essays]]:

  I begin with a little girl's hair. That I know is a good thing at any rate. Whatever else is evil, the pride of a good mother in the beauty of her daughter is good. It is one of those adamantine tendernesses which are the touchstones of every age and race. If other things are against it, other things must go down. If landlords and laws and sciences are against it, landlords and laws and sciences must go down. With the red hair of one she-urchin in the gutter I will set fire to all modern civilization...

  She is the human and sacred image; all around her the social fabric shall sway and split and fall; the pillars of society shall be shaken, and the roofs of ages come rushing down, and not one hair of her head shall be harmed.

******* I mean, the author of squid314 is the same as UNSONG, so there's an extent to which I don't have to endorse the thinking to be right that this is the idea he's trying to write about. Dylan is clearly the embodiment of the rational learned helplessness -- that's why he's a rogue placebomancer. Because he is the embodiment of rejecting persuasive arguments from authority figures when they aren't what helps him /win/.

I don't think he is. Remember, that whole speech was a /lie/.

We have no idea what Dylan's motives are. All we know is that he's witty and persuasive, and a pathological liar and serial killer.

Actually, that's not entirely true. According to /Laughing To Scorn Thy Laws And Terrors/, Dylan was originally a rank-and-file ritual magician who vowed revenge after he was expelled, and he became a terrorist because he realized "hero fighting the system" is a better story than "failed magician begging to be reinstated".

********* I didn't articulate very well. I'm not saying his story is true, a reflection of something that happened but occurred in a different way, a metaphor for his existence, nor a useful lens to try and guess how he sees himself. It's probably just bullshit.

But he does seem to categorically reject the narratives of his opponents instead of trying to negotiate or reason with them. That is an actual tactic he uses, we can observe, even if we don't know what his goals are. And that (aside from being more powerful placebomancy, as you point out) is also a fair way to deal with the concerns Scott brings up in the article. That similarity was what I was trying to point at.

Therefore, he destroys that person's worldview to get him to agree and plans to use him to assassinate someone.

Also, he's letter bombed senators, recruited thugs, and scares people who live on the fastest boat in the world.

**** He's going to die horribly though, likely just after a massive "This is why you suck" speech from Ngo.

We know this for two reasons:

1. His entire brand of magic is prefaced on him being the main character. He isn't. His magic will fail him at a narratively important moment because the Unsongverse runs on narrativium.

2. Ngo can see invisible people. And is probably a demon. Neither of these are facts Dylan seems to know.

** Dammit, Mark. You were a good wizard with a bright future ahead of you, imprisoned for murders that you didn't commit, framed by a charismatic former friend with a mysterious past running a secretive terrorist organization. You could have won in only a few story arcs, if you yelled "I've never join you" and then swore revenge.

  “I, Dylan Alvarez -- oh, how should I remember how your stupid phrase went -- I swear I won't kill you, make someone else kill you, cause you to die in ways that may not technically count as ‘killing you', betray you, injure you, emotionally devastate you, turn you in, use you as bait, fry your eyes in vegetable oil, feed you to an alligator, trick other people into feeding you to alligators, cause you to be consumed by an alligator in ways that may not technically count as ‘feeding you' to it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, if by some bizarre fluke you make the terrible choice not to continue working with me, get you safely to Europe, or may my luck dry up and my head turn green and my liver explode and everybody die, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So help me God.”
