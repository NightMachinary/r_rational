** Harry's dialogue seemed a bit... affected, somehow.

Although, he wasn't always the most natural of speakers in HPMOR, so maybe that's just a faithful replication.

*** Judging by his greasy hair, Lesath is probably polyjuiced Snape, jealous of Luna's flowing blonde locks. Obviously. No doubt trying to find out what hair products she uses.

** The chapter feels a little bit too much like it's praising how great Harry and HPMOR are but other than that it's very cute.

*** You could look at it that way, but instead I think it's highlighting the differences between Harry and the rest of the world, in terms of what they know, and how they're employing the Methods. It's also showing how quickly the idea of rationality is spreading.

Probably mostly setting the tone. Also note, Colin Creevy is likely going to be an important character because he was present for half the chapter.

*** It /is/ from Ginny's point of view. And titled "the Halo Effect." I plan to look past this for a couple more chapters yet.

** I'm at least vaguely surprised that no one has pointed out one of the largest revelations in this chapter, even if it was in a fairly subtle throwaway line. Some of you might have assumed it before this chapter, but I know from the comments on the chapter one and two threads that not everyone did.
