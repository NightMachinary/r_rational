It's shown that if you turn into a fly, land on someone before they morph, and get sucked into Z-space as they morph, your fly body goes into stasis and your brain in Z-space continues running, and you experience sensory deprivation until the person who put you in stasis releases you.

So what happens if your little fly body dies? Do you get to spend the last 2 hours of your life deprived of your senses? Or could it be possible to... demorph the corpse?


** I think that the key is preventing yourself from losing consciousness.

If you can de-morph before the fly dies and you lose consciousness, you're good.

If the morph body loses consciousness, though, I think you're SOL, like that Secret Service Agent who permanently morphed into the President.

*** But why should you ever lose consciousness? Your brain is in z space, not in the fly. Why does it matter at all if the fly loses consciousness, or even is dead? Fly brains are tiny so whatever damage your brain would take through issues with the interface should be tiny although I guess the interface perhaps magnifies them to help you use fly signals better.

I think it would be more accurate to say that you're fine as long as the interface between the fly and Z space isn't squished. If the interface is squished then you can't use it to demorph and pull yourself out of z space.

Hm perhaps the interface between the fly and z space somehow doesn't work unless the fly is conscious. That seems like it would be a design flaw more than anything tbh - why should the fly brain be the middle man between you and the demorph switch? Whatever part of the machinery is allowing your brain to be controlling the fly should also directly control the demorph switch.

In fact, unless somehow the earthly equipment is responsible for keeping your brain coherent in Z space (which would be a fair mechanic, I think) what should happen even if you totally destroy the fly is that you just hang out in the void until the time elapses.

** You shouldn't be able to die while you're in someone else's morph, but I think you can demorph from corpses in general.

“It demorphed. David, I mean. While we weren't looking. Demorphed out of a corpse, turned back into David, and it had a ton of weapons, and it---it shot Rachel, shot Garrett, shot Ax.”

V3 in David's body in dies while morphed as Jake, then demorphs and continues murdering. They didn't have time to check if he had actually died or if it was just a lethal blow though, they called him a corpse but they could just be wrong.

Also, from one of the Marcos on the Hork-Bajir planet:

"You could demorph from a corpse, if your animal body was killed. But if you'd already been eaten---"

This seems to suggest that the body still has to be more or less intact, even if it's dead. Or maybe it just means that demorphing after you've been eaten doesn't really help?

I've been a bit confused about this because it never really comes up and it feels pretty important. They do use morph armor though, I'd always thought of it as for non-lethal damage only but it seems like it would work on actually dying also. That being said I haven't come up with a use for it, aside from death technically just being a KO if the rest of your party wins the fight and controls the battlefield long enough for you to demorph and remorph.

*** It happens later on in the story too during the field trip to Arn.

‹It's over,› I said, as the three fallen Marcos began to melt their way out of their dead and dying Hork-Bajir bodies, as the other Marco still standing moved back to cover the room, leaving me alone in the center of the floor.

I ctrl-f'd for corpses, but doing that for dead/bodies/demorph was a non-starter.

** Generally, 'stasis' means 'unchanging'. So I'd be skeptical that a fly body could change from alive to dead while in Z-space.

**** Yyyyyes, I suppose, but if Z-space is anything like as extensive as real-space, and things that go into it are placed randomly, the chances of that happening are too small to worry about in the context of every other possible thing that could kill you outside Z-space.

I guess that you'd die. Unless there was some kind of emergency demorphing system.

***** In canon your body is literally changing into whatever animal you morph. You aren't an emulated mind remote-controlling a construct body, and how you go on thinking with a fly brain is just never questioned.

There's a lot of close calls, but I can't think of an example of someone actually dying in morph. Pretty much every character including the Andalites assumes you would just be dead, though.

** As the OP points out, we saw Garrett maintain consciousness (or emulated consciousness at least) while in a morph and then having his morphed body itself tucked away inside /Rachel's/ morph.

This was intended to be strong evidence that it is at least possible under /some/ circumstances to remain conscious even if the functioning of the morph body is completely stopped (stasis is different from death, but in some sense they share this property).

We've seen a couple of instances showing that the interface might be susceptible to damage or disruption, though. People below have mentioned the unconscious person who ended up as a Tyagi clone.

And nobody's asked what might have happened to Cassie's mind once the bird body was thoroughly vaporized, including the nanotech that could have brought her back (leaving her true body tucked away in a Z-space pocket dimension somewhere, along with the little boy, with a battery slowly ticking down to zero).

*** So, I (think I) know that there's a "gate" located on or in a morph construct somewhere, and that's really what real bodies demorph "out" of. That's how the Ellimist transported the Animorphs to the hillside when the meteor struck, that's why it would be a problem to get eaten in morph, etc. Knowing this has helped explain a lot of little things throughout the series, but I'm fairly certain I read it in one of your comments here a long, long time ago, and I don't think it's ever been directly mentioned in the fic. This fairly minor piece of info is starting to feel like a cheat code or something - is it ever gonna be spelled out in the story? Or did I just forget it the first time it was mentioned and then somehow miss it every time I've dipped randomly into old chapters?

Quick edit: Also, ever since the Rachel seizure stuff started happening and I realized the emulator probably saves a copy of your brain every time you're in it, I've been thinking about Cassie a /lot/.

**** I dunno if it's ever going to be like S P E L L E D O U T spelled out, but it's been referenced directly in the text in a couple of places. The Reckoning sometimes has the property of saying things too little or too lightly or too quickly, so this increases the odds that I'll make it clearer in future text, but at the moment I can't promise it.

***** Cool.

Also, don't apologise for subtlety! I can't speak for other readers, but personally I kinda /love/ the moments where a thing is said little or lightly or quickly. Every time there's an "I skipped the obvious question" or an "I could tell what she was thinking by the look on her face" or whatever, it's like a little puzzle trying to figure out what's going unsaid. Solving the puzzle is uniquely very, very satisfying - I'm not used to my fiction challenging me like that.

Of course, that's when the hole is pointed out. It's perfectly likely that there are other things going unsaid, but they're things that characters aren't /specifically/ not-saying, so I'm just happily skating along and missing subtext left and right. But I'm not too worried about it :)

  Only six-three-four-eight-one. We do not understand. It is teleportation, but /teleportation/ is only a word; it is not a /meaning/. It is not a /how/ or a /why/.

  [We have the situation under control. Peter Levy and Tom Berenson will not injure Ax. Based on the interlink signals, these others with me are Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]

  We do not understand. Where are their construct bodies?

  [They do not have any.]

  This is not a /meaning/.

  [They are emerging directly from the gate, with no construct to disassemble.]

  This is not a /meaning/.

  [There is no evidence of footsteps or other disturbances to the area around us. Whatever process brought us here likely also brought Peter Levy and Tom Berenson and Ax and the gates of Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]
