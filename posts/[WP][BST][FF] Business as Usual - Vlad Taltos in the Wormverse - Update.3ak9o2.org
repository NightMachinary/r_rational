Business as Usual - Vlad Taltos x Worm crossover (Post Golden Morning) has updated several couple times, Mostly in the planning thread.

This is a two-thread project, the story is in one thread, the planning in the other. It's a practical writing exercise using what I have been learning from a book about plot and structure.

One thing I would like to point out to people that may not be familiar with Sufficient Velocity forums - Threadmarks are highly useful, and I am using them to track my active posts.
