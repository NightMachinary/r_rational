I've got a few of these already active in my campaign. I'd be interested in hearing people's thoughts on additional schemes this kind of villain might employ in a world where the D&D(5e) rulebook is an accurate description of how physics works rather than an abstraction to facilitate gameplay.

Example from my current game:\\
A Mindflayer using domination of a Kuo-Toa highpriest to direct the tribe to worship them as a god (Kuo-Toa are a humanoid fish people whose special ability is that any idol they worship as a god becomes a god).


** Munchkinry by villains in d&d is only fun if it results in something stabbable by the party. Otherwise it is a thing that happens to other people in the world.

For example, it's best to assume that the spell Fireball is the best possible fireball at a given power threshold. It has probably out-competed every other aoe fire spell or whatever. However, [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances][3.5 and pathfinder]] had a bunch of consumables that just made your fireball noticeably better than the next guy's.

Anyone with enough power to cast a fireball should have a bunch of black powder on hand in their component pouch too. It out competes clearly, and so should be the staple rather than the exception.

In your example, if mindflayers know they can flay a KT society and make gods, why would any mindflayers of sufficient skill even bother with goblins and hook horrors?

The stable state (like, whatever is read in the books) of Forgotten Realms says they don't, so they either can't or don't know how or whatever. Applications that adapt the stable state are just contrivances for the purpose of story, and stories need stuff to be stabbed eventually.

Passwall will sink any boat. Teleport will let you target a boat. Sink any ship with 3 spells.

Be a halfling wizard, weigh 80lbs. Cast reduce person, weigh 10lbs. Mage hand yourself around at 60ft per round.

*** I don't think that teleport thing would fly. Spell failure is based on how well you know the location, and "any ship" doesn't imply that you're familiar with it (so at least a 33% chance of a miscellaneous mishap, 10% to end up on the wrong ship, and 10% to probably drop into the ocean).

You'd need access to the ship to take a chunk off it for the teleport to work reliably so at that point you can sabotage the ship for fewer spell slots and attacks of opportunity.

** Any intelligent actor could quickly go infinite if they knew both the spells /Simulacrum/ and /True Polymorph/

Step 0: Make sure you won't fight with your infinite clones.

Step 1: True polymorph a pebble into whatever material components you need.

Step 2: Make a simulacrum of yourself.

Step 3: True polymorph the simulacrum into a true copy of yourself. Maintain until permanent.

Step 4: Have your new twin repeat the process. Go to bed and start fresh in the morning with your triplet buddies.

+Step 5: Be executed by the gods for daring to overstep your bounds+ Step 5: Enjoy Infinity

You should triple your numbers 12 hours if my logic is right. You might be able to cut out the simulacrum entirely depending on how you interpret the Polymorph any Object text (by polymorphing a pebble into yourself), making you multiply much much faster.

Though ultimately any exploit that undoes the setting will have to be explained away. Maybe exploits are how gods get made, and they then get patched, a la WTC Exclusions, whenever a new one is found?

The first one picks up a person or object (one action) and drops it into the hands of the best person in line (free action) that person drops it into the hands of the next person, etc. In one round, the person/object can crowdsurf an arbitrary distance.

Note that the CR does not actually serve as a damage-causing railgun, as that application requires shifting from RAW to physics halfway through.

***** I would have you pay for the commoners time/food/accommodations and 4 shift replacements. At useful distances this turns out to be more expensive then just using commonly acceptable ways of transportation.

Also even if you pay the commoners, their lord might take exception to why Joe Farmer is not dirt farming but standing around waiting for someone passing him an item.

Commoners aren't free and everything in the books while buyable isn't an infinite resource.

My general rule of thumb for fiction is can be summed up with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence]]

Rules and fiction may sound illogical or without reason because the story doesn't focus on that particular mechanic. If the player decides to abuse it the story changes it focus and reality will ensure.

****** Sure, but the spear won't do any more damage than it would normally.

The original concept of the railgun was "transport thing super far in 6 seconds by RAW but then throw it at the end and it keeps moving at the same speed as it must have had during transport and so it does lots of damage because physics." You can't switch in the middle like that -- if you're playing by RAW then you can transport the thing 1000 miles in 6 seconds but a thrown spear still only does 1d8 damage. If you're playing by physics then you can't transport the thing 1000 miles in 6 seconds.

*** I'd wonder if the Assassin would be able to determine your CEV accurately, though. Presumably it'd be better at it the more intelligent it was. The "you can cast any self-targeted spell on yourself and the Assassin" mechanic has got to be munchkinable, though.

Come to think of it, does the Assassin have its own XP and mana pool equivalents? It does have "all the skills and abilities" of the original. Can it burn its own XP and/or mana to increase yours beyond the 5000 XP it costs to make one? If you have access to an enormous amount of diamond dust, can your Assassin create an Assassin of its own, and that one create its own, and so forth?

Come to think of it twice, is there anything preventing you creating an Ice Assassin of something epic-level? The diamond dust and XP cost is the same regardless. Create an Assassin of something capable of casting Wish, or massively boosting your own stats, or producing items of significant monetary value.

Perhaps most important: there's no information about what an Ice Assassin does when its original/nemesis dies. Does it stop working? Does it just melt away? Does it instead become a completely pliant golem, doing whatever you tell it, until it disintegrates of accumulated damage at some future point? Is it, in fact, possible to create an Assassin using a body part from a dead creature at all?

***** Well, yes. The trick would be how well you yourself understood what your CEV would be. Sometimes it's difficult to predict what you might think under future circumstances, because the circumstances themselves might play a part in revealing options you didn't previously know you had. Or there might have been other external influences between now and then.

For instance, it might not be too difficult to figure out what you want for lunch if lunch is ten minutes away, but trickier to figure out what you might want for lunch a week from now. Or what your clone-self might want for lunch today if you split a week ago and you were an ice golem who hadn't eaten or rested in that week.

Something of an extreme example, I'll admit, and CEV guesses would presumably generally be at least roughly in the right ballpark (assuming that neither 'self' had encountered data which would change their CEV and the other one didn't know about it; there doesn't seem to be anything in the writeup indicating that the Assassin is automatically mentally updated on everything the spellcaster knows, or vice versa, even if the spellcaster can choose to look out of the Assassin's eyes at times. There's a telepathic link, and mention of command, so it might be assumed that the spellcaster could issue commands over the link, and possibly informational updates, but whether those would be total mental downloads or just the ability to effectively 'speak' down the link isn't made clear.

e.g. The spellcaster doesn't want the Assassin needlessly destroyed, so the Assassin doesn't take actions which, it seems, would lead to that end. But the spellcaster wants the Assassin to scout out a building. The Assassin goes to do so and in doing so walks out of telepathy range. The spellcaster then learns that the building is rigged to explode. The Assassin does not know this. Thus the Assassin's best guess at the spellcaster's CEV is outdated and inaccurate.

Even if the Assassin was within range, and could be commanded not to walk into the building, a telepathic link which was limited to the mental equivalent of voice commands might not be able to convey something more subtle. What if the spellcaster, after making the Assassin, undergoes a profound spiritual awakening, or sees a psychologist, or really gets into yoga and crossfit? The Assassin could be instructed about this, but their mental baseline would still be the old version of the spellcaster's, and they might not be able to accurately predict what the spellcaster wants out of life any more.

****** Would you be more comfortable if I had said "always act according to what I would want according to your best understanding of me based on the fact that we have the exact same memories and skills and are generally identical except for the facts that you want to kill me, you must obey all my commands, and you are actually made of ice even though you look like me to everyone who isn't me"? I felt that "my CEV" was a less verbose way to say very-close-to that, but I can use the longer and more precise way if that's better.

Also, note that telepathic commands are sufficient to convey any desired information. If nothing else, you can embed the information into the command, e.g. "Write down the following words, which are true: 'Mom gave me a red and green sweater for the holiday.'"

EDIT: I should have said that you can also convey arbitrary visual information by, if no better method can be found, relaying the RGB values of each pixel on a screen of known size.

**** Nope. There's no need for a check. Here's the complete text of the grappling rules as per [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#content]]

Grappling When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a Special melee Attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this Attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an Attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the Grappled condition (see Conditions ). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

Escaping a Grapple: A Grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

*Moving a Grappled Creature: When you move, you can drag or carry the Grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.*

** The lore says that through their madness from being broken by Illithids they end up creating entities resembling gods that can manifest, and that they can draw power from those to cast spells if enough of them believe in it.

That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a path to apotheosis, and even if that can happen, those entities are shaped by the Kuo Tao's beliefs, so anyone seeking godhood through that path will most likely suffer significant personality changes to the point that they might as well be considered dead, and the entity left, an entirely different person.After all it's created from madness, so any kind of stable transference seems pretty unlikely.\\
I'm not even sure that those entities created have anything resembling full-fledged personhood.

That said, a botched attempt at apotheosis could be a pretty interesting plot element to explore.
