Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I'm a bit late, but I just had a really neat idea: "everyone is now able to fly."

I know, I know, not /tha/ original. Here's the crunch:

- flight speed is just about 30mph (not exactly, but close enough)
- people fly in a non-aerodynamic fashion. It's like everyone has gimballed thrusters pointing them where they want to go, although g forces are applied evenly across the body.
- people accelerate based off of how badly they want to go in some direction, with a maximum acceleration of 3 g's. This acceleration is rarely reached without extreme willpower, however.
- people know how to fly reflexively, so it's impossible to accidentally injure themselves by flying (i.e. by accelerating too hard and blacking out)
- flying follows the laws of thermodynamics (it takes energy) but requires minimal energy expenditure beyond what's directly spent performing work (in a physics sense).
- flying feels like a relatively mild form of exertion, and exercises muscles in much the same way as swimming.

I do have a reason in mind for why everyone can fly, but while important, it's not germane to this post.

Now, I'm sure there are ways to munchkin individuals flyings (for example, most individuals can hold up their own body weight by their arms, so upside down people can transport stuff that weights quite a bit if they accelerate slowly). But what I'm more interested in are what you think could be potential societal fallout from this happening, from the immediate (a lot of uber drivers just lost their job) to the mid term (the military needs to reevaluate its tactics) to the long term (imagine a company with the slogan "park here, go anywhere." Cars are still useful on highways, but not as much in the city, so they have massive parking garages right after highway exits where people drop off cars, so they can fly the final leg of their trips)

What do you guys think?

*** It is no longer possible to out stuff out of reach of your toddler. Parents worldwide invest in cabinets with locks.

If flying takes about as much energy as walking, then people are unlikely to fly much further than they would walk. Uber drivers can maintain jobs as longer-distance transport.

Some people are going to get /seriously/ upset if you fly over their fence. Even if you don't land and were legitimately just taking a shortcut.

People in highrises will start using their balconies as front doors. Sometimes they'll accidentally get the wrong balcony, with consequences ranging from embarrassment to arrest on charges of trespassing.

*** Skirt and kilts become a very risky option, and are hardly ever worn. Some religions decide flying is wrong, or wrong for women and/or children, at least. Toddler reins become very important :-) Turns out children can go way faster than most adults because they just WANT things more Everyone with upstairs windows suddenly needs more security Can you stay still in mid air? If so lot of 'dead' space in tall buildings become useable Lots of no-fly zones, including military and commercial airspace, but also over nature reserves (don't want to upset real birds) Many fewer people want to live in city centres, whereas previously hard to reach suburbs become more attractive How far can you fly without tiring? You could cross the English Channel, which would create interesting immigration issues, but not cross an ocean, probably, so there would be a LOT of jobs guarding that airspace, at least short to mid term, before governments maybe learnt to relax a bit (or not) I guess Trump's wall is no use now...

*** There are probably new types of clothing, from shoes that are guaranteed to not fall off your feet while in flight, to jackets that insulate against the winds present at 30mph, to full-body raincoats, to packs that people put on to transport materials, to clothes that preserve modesty.

There will be a new set of norms around flying, along with a new set of laws to enforce those norms in the cases where they're about safety, privacy, trespass, etc. Unfortunately for the legal systems of the world, these new laws will probably be grafted onto the old laws in ways that aren't quite what you'd choose if you were making laws from scratch.

It's hard to get precise data on commute times, but my guess is that housing prices drop in major metropolitan areas and rise in the suburbs, since you're removing one of the sources of rush hour gridlock and consequently shortening commute times. (By the laws of traffic, this will not actually cause there to be less traffic, since lowering the disincentive to drive will cause more people to drive until you've reached capacity again.)
