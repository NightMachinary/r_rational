  IN FACT: While I was working on Antimemetics Division Tales, author DreamwalkerFae had the idea that there could be a second Antimemetics Division in the Foundation right now, with neither division aware of the other one. DreamwalkerFae's version is called the Counterconceptual Division. SCP-2358 by DreamwalkerFae and SCP-2111 by sirpudding both contain references to the CCD. Where does all of this go next? Well... anywhere... "

**** Seems a little unfortunate to censor someone for that. This is the discussion thread /for/ "Your Last First Day", right? Isn't it reasonable to expect that people have read the story linked by the OP before reading this discussion thread? Otherwise, what can we even talk about here?
