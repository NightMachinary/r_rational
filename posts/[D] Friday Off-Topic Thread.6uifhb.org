Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Yesterday, I watched the entirety of [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][Sword Art Online Abridged]] (about 2.5 hours covering the first arc of SAO) and I can recommend it as not just a parody of the original show (and MMORPGs in general) or a hilarious dark comedy that stands on its own, but also as a unique and compelling story in its own right where the characters have a surprising amount of depth and development.

I haven't watched the original SAO, nor do I plan to, but I had a really good time with Abridged and my only regret is that there isn't more of it. It starts off as a fairly typical, though very funny, abridged series where the main characters are crazy and everyone else is an idiot, but as it goes on the characters go through some genuinely interesting development and legitimately emotional moments that are subtly foreshadowed.

I'm not entirely sure how I got invested in the snarky asshole Kirito and closet psychopath Asuna, but the fact that I did is a testament to the show's quality. Their developing relationship is somehow both horrifically dysfunctional, unironically charming, and leads to them both growing as people. It's not /amazing/ development, but it happened to unlikable character archetypes I've never seen before in a way that's actually kind of believable.

Even if you don't get invested in the characters, though, it's still a good show. The comedy consistently got a laugh out of me, their editing of the original animation is excellent, the music is awesome, and they filled in the most infamous plot holes of SAO. I think the quality of the reimagining of the characters brings it up to the level of /great/ beyond just /good/, at least by the standards of abridged series, but the comedy is enough by itself.

*** Oh man, SAO abridged was awesome. It's the good parts of SAO (the premise and animation) minus the bad parts (the characterizations.) Honestly, it's pretty much straight up better than the original anime by every metric.

****** It seems so. I only just discovered these guys so it's the first I've heard about it, but they've proven they can be very funny and surprisingly dramatic so I'm looking forward to what they come up with. My only worry is that one of the reasons SAO Abridged worked was by fulfilling the missed opportunities of the original show and gave them a lot of goofy material to parody. The internet had given them a gold mine of material to draw from.

HeroAca, however, is a good show. Even its shortcomings come across as intentional choices on the writer's part to tell the story they wanted to and the characters already have fairly compelling personalities and development. It's not that I'd hate seeing them get reimagined as crazy stupid jerks, I just worry it wouldn't be as funny as the treatment they gave SAO. How much comedy can they squeeze out of parodying a good story?

******** I'd love if they did, but it's really common in abridged series to turn the characters into a flanderization of themselves. SAO Abridged went the extra mile by giving the characters development and consistent personalities in their own right, but much of the comedy was still based people acting dumb, insane, or sadistic. I enjoy that style of comedy and have come to expect it from most web series, I'm just worried I won't find it as funny with HeroAca as SAO.

--------------

I didn't get the chance to start work this week as I was hoping. The move went smoothly, but internet wasn't installed until Wednesday, and in the meantime there were boxes to unpack.

I did, however, get a chance to try out Prism at the recommendation of [[/u/Tandemmirror]].  I'm only an hour or two into the game, but already so many of the more annoying parts of the game have been sanded down to smoothness.  Some of the tricks and solutions were taken from later games, but not all have been, and while playing I was struck with the distinct feeling that this is what I remember gen 2 being like, even though it's nothing of the sort.

We'll see how I feel about it once I have more than one badge under my belt, but until then I think I can recommend it to any fans of the canon games.  That said, it /is/ really just an iteration of canon's design (so far).  It doesn't deviate too much from the core formula, values are tweaked but not overhauled, and the primary concern seems to have been preserving the feel of the original games.  With a half exception of the last point, this project shares none of these goals.  Still, it's neat to see other designer's approach to the problem of canon.

--------------

Playing Prism did give me a bit of an insight.  [[/u/InfernoVulpix]] is also checking out the game at the same time I am, and he had a great moment during the second rival fight where his team had been swept, all except for a lone Cyndaquil who was itself on its last legs, who used a move learned earlier that fight and evolved as soon as the battle was done.  Vulpix observed that “I could spin this into a dramatic anime episode if I wanted to.”  

We had both just prior discussed the merits of keeping Cyndaquil on our teams (it's not your starter, minor spoilers, sorry), but after this fight Vulpix couldn't possibly throw it out.  It was very much the sort of thing that happens in the anime, the sort of human-monster bond that the canon games claim to emulate but at their core don't encourage.  

I feel like in canon these moments are far too few and far between.  Usually what goes in your team is based entirely off of what you feel like getting--which means in my case that I am almost always defaulting to my hero team of old (Houndoom, Ampharos, Alakazam, Feraligatr, Machamp, Skarmory) instead of trying out new things.  There's no /bond/, no actual simulation of being brothers-in-arms.  Hell, I feel closer to my faceless soldiers in XCOM than I do in Pokemon, and that's not accidental.

I think by having a more unforgiving environment, more lethal situations, and an overall higher difficulty, these sorts of ‘anime moments' are going to be encouraged, not reduced.  In fact, the popularity of the Nuzlocke challenge helps confirm this, I think.  I don't think that people are attracted to a harder difficulty, they're attracted to the stories that emerge from overcoming obstacles and the camaraderie that they feel with their little virtual pets.  This isn't possible to cultivate when you stomp the game with your overleveled starter, restarting at the pokemon center if you somehow impossibly overreach.

Anyway.  Even if the game goes downhill from here, I think I'll have counted the time spent on Prism as well-spent.

** /This isn't really an issue at the moment, but I'm posting it here in case it becomes a problem for me in the future and in case there's someone else on the subreddit who might benefit in the meantime./

When I was suicidal, I had an unexpected issue:

Someone else, upon becoming aware of suicidal thoughts, might go, "I should talk to someone, and ask why suicide shouldn't be on the table."

On the other hand, when *I* would recognize that I was considering suicide, I would have that same follow-up thought--but follow /that/ up in turn by pointing out to myself that I very obviously have at least one reason to not kill myself or I wouldn't be talking, I'd be doing; and so either I'm looking for excuses because I don't think those reasons are good enough or I'm just searching for the opportunity to whine at somebody, and fuck /both/ of those possibilities, either one of them is enough to increase my self-contempt past its present point.

So, hilariously, during the period that I was suicidal I was probably more likely to kill myself than if I had been less self-aware.

Anyone have suggestions about dealing with this? The first thing that occurs to me is that, maybe, I need to believe that it's okay to need to vent about stuff that literally makes me want to kill myself, even if I have reasons to not kill myself and even if I know that it's just e.g. a chemical imbalance that's making these things look so bad. I'm really hoping, though, that somebody has a Third Way that doesn't involve what I can't help but mentally label as "whining," however inaccurate that term might actually be in this context.

/Meta level answer:/ If your long complicated trains of thought ("... and therefore I shouldn't seek help") conflict with your basic observations ('Okay, but I really feel like I need help"), you should probably assume that the long complicated reasoning is broken, and you shouldn't suppress the basic observations.

/Meta level minus one answer:/ If you're having suicidal thoughts and high self-contempt, it probably means your brain really shouldn't be trusted. When that happens, the Accepted Rational Procedure is to talk about your feelings (if only as a rubber duck method), seek second opinions and not jump to conclusions.

/Object level answer:/ Killing yourself is really really */extremely-mega-super/* bad. Annoying people by whining at them is (at worse) moderately bad. And if you don't want to bother your friends, there are therapists whose job is more or less "getting whined at", and who would love to accept your money.

Plus, when your ideas are really far removed from objective observations, it's easier for your brain to twist them in a given direction (in this case, self-hatred).

Yeah, this is what I'll be settling on, I guess. It still feels like whining and that still heightens the self-contempt but whatchagonnado? At least the self-contempt isn't suicidally high, so it's easier to take that step (which I figure I ought to do, even though I feel okay right now, because there's a difference between "your problems are solved" and "your problems have temporarily abated" and this is probably not a judgment that I'm capable of making from the inside).

--------------

It's so weird to think that "Talk to a therapist" is even an /option/ now, let alone an option that I'm willing to take. For the past few years, trapped in a small mostly-Mormon town as I was, literally every therapist was either part of LDS Family Services (a church-run thing) or endorsed crystal healing and gay conversion therapy.

And the LDS Family Services folks, I've discovered over the past ten years or so, are incompetent and untrustworthy, so I could never feel at ease around them. The closest I've gotten to having any sort of legitimate therapist experience in my entire life, come to think of it, has probably been through Scott Alexander's Ask Box. Being able to sit down with a competent therapist is going to be a pleasantly novel experience.

Yeah, but there's pride that keeps you from doing bad things and there's pride that keeps you from admitting you need to fix yourself. "Pride, of an odd sort that drove someone down instead of raising them up" to quote Wildbow.

I'm discovering this too, so I haven't really figured it out. But the way I see it, part of growing up as a rational guy is to realize that your don't need to win everything the hard way for your victories to be worth something. Like, choosing to do things in the way that puts the most weight on your shoulders just for the sake of pride... I think I've done it, and I was setting myself up to fail. Suck up your pride, and do what works. The big shiny pile of utility doesn't care how hard you worked to get it.

You should get some redundancy. How much do you value your life? How unchanging are your preferences/reasons? If your answers are anything other than "No value, and completely unchanging" then you should play it safe and develop things so that you will survive one reason changing.

Of course, this doesn't touch the main issue of being suicidal which is that you don't value your life very much. This can help prevent/slow a descent into that mindset, but can't pull you out of it on its own.

*** For your specific situation, have you ever visited [[/r/exmormon]]? It's the Reddit community for people who escaped the cult, and it is AWESOME! I have no connection to Mormonism and I hang out there sometimes because it's an entire community of loving, supportive, mostly-atheists who have all escaped from their own personal hells. They will listen to your rants about how awful things are in LDS.inc and support them because they all know exactly what's going through your head.

Perhaps most importantly, they can point you in the direction of counselors in your area who can help your specific problems, AND they can arrange public meetups so you can do your "whining" with people who really do understand. Some kind of social network re-established, I know leaving the cult often results in total isolation.

Whatever you do, know that what you feel right now, all of the betrayal by parents and trusted authority figures, all the fucked up things they told you about sex, all the pain and confusion and suffering...all of it is completely normal for people who have gone through what you have and there are tens of thousands of people who know exactly how you feel. And most of those people? They know from experience that things do get much, much better.

To clarify, while the Morg has definitely fucked with my head in ways that I'm going to need to take time to untangle, my most fundamental brain weasels have to do with bipolar-II (or something adjacent to it).

I'll shoot a line down on [[/r/exmormon]] just in case, but probably what I'm going to do is at least start with the services provided by my graduate school (since they're free and not run by wackadoos) and go from there.

** I finished reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Red Sister]] and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread.

I've tried the authors other stuff and didn't really like it, but this is on another level. If you're looking for some good fantasy to read, give it a try.

*** The key thing to remember is that crypto experiences rapid boom/bust cycles. If you are going to do well actively trading, you need to be able to handle both. Everything is rosy in the bull market, but panic will quickly set in when the crash happens.

That's why it is important to really understand the tech behind everything you buy and have the ability to avoid falling into unfounded hype or panic. For many, a passive buy/hold strategy based on the bigger cryptos may be a better option than trying to find the next pumped altcoin.

*** I've been active in crypto for about 6 months now, following the field since like 2012 (Back when I was a high-school student without any money). I've got substantially more money than you in there, ~40k at the moment, which is probably about 30% contributions, 70% gains. I use GDAX for ease of use, and Kraken/Etherdelta/Shapeshift for currencies that GDAX doesn't support. Currently very heavy on Ethereum, with an eye to transition more into Monero after Metropolis rolls out in September. My main tip would be to stick with the established projects unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Plenty of ERC20 tokens and coins without a clear use case (Or, without a reason to be highly valued, I'm looking at you Ripple), have burned people in the past. NEO/GNT/XRP/OMG all got hugely overvalued for a while. More will bubble and burst, but the core projects, with an actual use case, are almost inevitably going to rise. Bitcoin used to be a solid investment, but I'm not so sure anymore. At the end of the day, use your best judgement, invest what you can afford to lose (Completely, to zero. Crypto is better than it was, but still insanely volatile), and for the love of all that is holy, do not ever trade crypto on margin. The fees remain obscene and the swings can easily wipe out even a relatively well capitalized position.

***** I generally try not to put too much weight on graphs or patterns, I buy projects I believe in when they drop, and sell them if I think the amount they've risen recently outstrips the value they're currently worth. Something that actually has a working prototype, not just a forked repo and a white paper. I hadn't even heard of GEO, and after reading a little about it, am kinda dubious on it. The geosnapping thing is a cool gimmick, but there's zero reason for anyone to actually use the coin or secure the network, and I suspect it will become worthless over the long (10+ year) term. CVC is a cool project, but I think it's currently overvalued for what they've achieved. If they get some actual B2B partners or drop a bit, I might consider buying some. I keep my profits reinvested, I make enough at my day job and spend so little that I don't have anything to spend it on. My goal is to accumulate enough capital that when I go to grad school, it'll appreciate significantly over that time and give me more options re: not having a full time job while I work on other things.

As for the margin point, it's not uncommon for coins to swing more than 20% in a day, which can easily cause a margin call at 3-5x leverage. Getting called can wipe out your entire investment if the swing is bad enough. Additionally, while I'm not familiar with Bittrex's fee structure, that fee is usually per day, which adds up incredibly quickly. You're almost always better off avoiding leverage in the current crypto markets.

Finally, a core project is something like Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, Litecoin, or IOTA. Large market cap, established dev team with some sort of roadmap, working project that's been around for years, and actual use of some sort. Coins like CVC and GEO are more speculative, and comparatively dangerous investments. If you're lucky, they'll make far more, but the majority of them will probably be worthless in a few years.

****** Ok, I get what you mean. How do you personally judge when a project is overvalued? I know it's speculative, so I'm not asking for hard data or anything but what sort of markers do you use to make that sort of decision?

Bittrex, at least for smaller amounts within like the 10k range or lower, only charges you commission on trades you do. They take 0.25% of any trade but that's it. Again, at least for accounts with smaller amounts.

So then you don't play coins that have large percentage jumps in the day, as they're inherently more risky. You're playing the long game. I would honestly do the exact same if I was dealing with like 3-4 thousand dollars instead of 200, lol. Like I generally try and sell out if a coin rises to 115-120% or drops to 90% of what I paid for it. It's sensible but slow.

Between books he remakes whatever of his tools were inevitably shredded, maybe comes up with a few neat tricks to pull with things, but he never really gets to create unrestricted. The island? His work with the Colossus? Even his trolling future generations with fake artifacts? These are things you can tell Dresden would love to do in the Files, but can't because his allies and obligations tie him down. The complete lack of arcane threats in the beginning meant he had to do very little to protect Braavos, and he got to spend that time for himself instead.

Interesting character development, interesting dropping of technological knowledge into a world that maybe isn't quite ready for it, and definitely interesting creation of what is definitely going to be an epic legacy remembered for thousands and thousands of years.

**** Disagree with EY on this one. I feel like a lot of rationalists are privileging the hypothesis that the statues do no harm, and thus do not spend enough (any?) time investigating whether people for taking the statues down (notably including the people of the town/county who elect leaders who vote democratically to do so) might actually have a reason to do so.

It's not about feels and it's not about virtue signalling. For many it's about a claim on reality: that the continued presence of the statues contributes to continued veneration of what they were /built to represent/ (hint: it wasn't "history"), which contributes to entrenching a culture of bitterness, bigotry, and /false/ history. Not to mention feelings of continued hostility against the black community.

Like... Southern states are literally rewriting school history books to whitewash America's past mistakes and misrepresent the ideals and reasons for the Confederacy's secession.

Meanwhile liberals are supporting decisions to remove icons of a divisive and oppressive culture... But /they're/ the ones being accused of trying to erase or rewrite history.

It's nonsense. No one would be having this argument about Germans choosing to remove Nazi iconography from their culture, but we privilege Confederate veneration because somehow a proto-country that fought for slavery is considered not as bad as a regime that fought for genocide and world domination.

I don't mind if people think Hitler was worse than Robert E Lee. I mind if they think the gap between them is so large that Lee somehow gets a pass.

If there was a statue of Hitler on a street full of Eliezer Yudkowskys, they'd leave up the statue and decorate it with appropriate warnings, not try to tear down the statue. They'd point it out to their children and talk about how easy it was to get people to put up statues of things, and so they should be cautious about being influenced by what other people venerate. Why remove the lesson? Why pretend that the history of people putting up statues was other than it was? If people can't think through the lesson clearly and are so easily swayed by statues, maybe tear them all down to be sure.

****** Ahhh. Yes, this makes more sense if society is more or less all on the same page: when we live in such a divisive one and the culture that raised the monument is still successfully pushing its narrative to their children, I think the social effect of the statues reinforces that narrative too strongly to ignore: particularly since we can't actually decorate it with warnings without essentially having the same cultural battle.

Also the lesson is still being taught, and history isn't being ignored: this just removes the opposition's ability to normalize their narrative, /and/ removes the constant psychological harm to African Americans, who are predominantly on the same page about what the statue represents: a reminder that they live in a county/town/state that venerates someone who fought to keep them in chains.

On top of that, it takes up valuable statue real estate which we can otherwise use to venerate better people, like, say, Andrew Wiggin. As long as we're wishing :P

  It's not about feels and it's not about virtue signalling. For many it's about a claim on reality: that the continued presence of the statues contributes to continued veneration of what they were built to represent (hint: it wasn't "history"), which contributes to entrenching a culture of bitterness, bigotry, and false history. Not to mention feelings of continued hostility against the black community.
#+end_quote

In all politeness, that is exactly what "feels" and "virtue-signaling" mean. Whenever someone says things like "feels and virtue-signaling" to you, what they really mean 90% of the time is, "I am a nihilist about your morality; I believe yours is false and may in fact believe all morality is arbitrary; I refuse to be moved by moral appeals from within your system, or even from you personally."

A great portion of the arguments these days amount to people saying, "I'm blue, you're orange. We have different utility functions, moral realism is false, and therefore moral 'discussion' is only attempted mental subversion."

Which while amusing, confuses the point: people are not supporting Lee's removal because he's not perfect, MLK cheated on his wife and no one is calling for his statues to be removed. Equating them even as a joke is failing to acknowledge the difference. Lee specifically led a war to defend the institution of slavery. It goes beyond "not extraordinarily moral for his time."

*** Not that I agree with their methods, but it's kind of annoying seeing so many people equating the anti-fascists with the fascists, when the fascists' primary goal is ethnic cleansing and antifa's primary goal is preventing that.

As a non-white person, it feels like there aren't that many people willing to just condemn racism and racists outright, without false equivalences. Being a minority in any country means that you're never going to be 100% secure and safe, but just a few years ago it seemed like most people in the U.S. would have our backs. I genuinely thought a very large percentage Republicans would vote against Trump because his racism was unacceptable, but it turns out that it just wasn't important to them. I'm not black, but it disgusts me that Confederate generals, traitors to this country who fought for slavery, are venerated in public spaces. Those statues could be moved to a museum, but even if they were just destroyed that would be fine. I see a lot of Republicans and Independents taking neutral positions on this and many other issues brought up by this presidency, and I'm frustrated that people are tacitly supporting white supremacy. The idea that the neo-Nazis are a fringe group to be disregarded itself shows that the problem is very real, in that the majority of people in this country aren't willing to recognize the difficulties minorities and the oppressed face in this country. For every one neo-Nazi in this country there are a thousand who are willing to overlook it. Everywhere I see people downplaying issues related to intergenerational poverty, hiring discrimination, police violence, incarceration rates, laws designed specifically to target the poor and homeless, etc. etc. And so many people want to pretend racism doesn't exist anymore, and that BLM is equivalent to the alt-right. It's not Trump or the GOP or even the neo-Nazis that are the problem in this country, it's the average American citizen. I'm reminded of this MLK quote.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."

I swear to fuck it's the goddamn suburbs. No, seriously. I went all the way out to the Burbs this past weekend to attend a friend's LAN party. Three things surprised me: how homogeneously "white" everything was, even compared to white people in cities who have distinct neighborhoods and cultures, how much of a fucking bubble it actually is (their /sub shop/ was a carbon copy of all other suburban sub shops in human history... I don't know how someone accomplished this), and how /ridiculously high/ their standard of living is.

Like, my friend pays less on his condo mortgage than I do in rent, and he gets three floors and a basement with really nice carpeting everywhere, perfect insulation, clean everything, no mold or rotten wood at all, central heating and air. The only downsides are maybe not getting the ISP you want, having to drive everywhere (God that /sucked/), and living in a homogenized bubble that makes your whole life feel utterly interchangeable with all other lives.

Nobody gives this a name of its own. I think average (white?) people basically just think the vast majority of everyone lives like that, and then wonders why anyone's complaining when everything is so nice and easy. I partly don't like actually living the way my friend does, but I also seriously wonder how anyone can feel comfortable isolating oneself so thoroughly from, well, the rest of reality.

#+end_quote

I don't think this is true. Antifa's primary goal seems to be ousting Trump, with instituting communism and ethnic cleansing of white people as side goals.

Secondly, the alt-right (I cannot in good conscience call them fascists because they oppose large government and authoritative control) doesn't seem to actually want people of other races "cleansed" so much as put in their place and/or deported.

Thirdly, the vast majority of republicans, including Trump, are not alt-right or racist. The primary cause of contention is affirmative action. Republicans say "Treat everyone the same. Don't have hiring quotas, don't increase college admissions based on race, don't give extra welfare based on race, don't blame people for things other people did even if they're the same race, etc." Democrats say "White people did a bunch of things in the past that have significantly harmed black people and other minorities and it's their responsibility to do whatever needs to be done in order to undo it."

I think a rational person could end up agreeing with either one, but in my opinion, the former is less racist and also more socially optimal. I never kept slaves, I never killed or discriminated against or refused to hire people of other races. Neither did my parents, neither did my grandparents. Maybe one of my ancestors did, I dunno, but I shouldn't be held responsible for the sins of someone who died a hundred years ago against someone else who died a hundred years ago.

Yeah, poverty is an issue, and it has intergenerational effects, but these apply equally to poor people of all races. But are poor black people more deserving of help than poor white people? Making policies to help people in need is a good thing, but all of the laws and policies should ignore race and target the real issues. That's how you achieve equality, not by convincing all of the minorities that all of their problems are white people's fault and pissing off both groups. That's how you get Charlottesville.

Richard Spencer claims it will be "peaceful" ethnic cleansing. I'm sure they said the same to Native Americans before the Trail of Tears. I'm not saying Republicans are racist or alt-right. I'm saying they're the problem because they tacitly support those things by not giving a single shit about opposing them, oftentimes existing in willful denial that racism exists in the first place, because doing something about it doesn't benefit them. It's not about punishing white people for things that happened in the past. It's about eliminating the racism that occurs right now, today. Many people like you will deny that any racism exists, as if my last name won't keep me from getting job interviews or my skin color won't cause border security agencies to mistreat me despite being a natural citizen.

*** So... I may not be in america

And my observations can be not acurate since i havent researched the subject to a heavy degree but if you want to know my opinion on this...then here you go.

The whole situation conjured out of a stupid argument about a statue. For me its kinda important to remember and admit the history od the country whether it was good or bad. On the other hand is it worth it? The statue obviously needs to be taken care of once in a while snd its just a huge hunk of metal anyways.

Sure the actions of the neo nazis were obviously bad but i am perplexed by how much of a hate boner for trump people can have. He said that violence was comitted on both sides which is true since both antifa and the neo nazis came there to seek a fight even tho only the nazis run over someone with a car the contempt should still be given to both parties for inciting violence. People jumped to conclusions how trump wont call out the racist groups which he later did anyways calling out KKK and the likes.

I would just like to note that i am not a trump supporter nor i am in america so my opinion is of an outsider juat looking at the situation. I generally think that trump is a jerk and kinda unfitbof a president but hailing him the next hitler like some ppl do is a little bit extreme.

**** You have some decent points. Trump's most certainly not Hitler 2.0. He's not as competent, for one. But, in all seriousness, I don't think he's as intentionally malicious as Hitler was. Unless his persona is a masterful deception on Quirrelmort levels, anyway.

As far as your other points, you're doing two major things here that's misrepresenting things. You're minimizing the issue of the statue and its importance by writing it off as "a stupid argument about a statue". Historical monuments are important to a good majority of people. National pride (which is where the neo-Nazis seem to be pulling their passion from or at least some twisted version of it anyway) is important. Like really important. And the statue being taken down was a symbol of their pride being taken down by people they already felt were "the enemy". Hence their initial protest. On the other side, most non-Nazis were of the opinion that the statue should go down and they were also of the opinion that *being a nazi is bad.* Hence their counter protest. The nazis didn't really make things better when they had a pre-rally march chanting Nazi slogans and carrying torches, a la KKK, the night before. Thus, when the rally time approached, things were already heated and violence was practically assured. Especially considering that the nazis arrived as a militia of sorts, with shields, guns, tear gas and other assorted things. There's obviously more to this than that brief synopsis but I'll leave it there for now.

Secondly, you're drawing a false equivalency. What you're saying is a lot like when people say "Well, yea, it sucks that she was raped. But she shouldn't have been walking down that dark alley in a short skirt at 1 AM!" in response. They're not condoning the rape, not explicitly, but they're shifting the blame onto the victim. And, yes, her decision was obviously unsafe. But by bringing it up in the discussion in that manner, you're almost saying her bad decision to walk down that alley was equivalent to his bad decision to rape her. Which is not the case. The nazis were by and far most responsible. They organized the rally, which is their right. Even if you're saying hateful shit, you have that right as an American. But when you show up in the streets armed to the teeth, when your people exhibit military-esque maneuvers that indicate hours spent practicing (which somewhat proves intent), you've gone too far. I'm not going to pretend that every counter protestor was a saint. Some had guns, some had chemicals, and some probably came looking for a fight. But it's undeniable fact that the core groups of the rally /all/ came armed and ready whereas the vast majority of the counter protestors came armed with nothing more than words.

So when you say both should be denounced, you're making it seem as if their crime is equal. Even if that's not what you /mean/, that's what it seems like when you don't go out of your way to make it clear. And if that is what you mean, that their crime is equal, then I suppose we can't really proceed in their discussion because there's a clear discrepancy here. :P

Overall, I get what you're trying to say. But it's important that you don't oversimplify things, lest you do exactly what Trump wants you to do and equate racist neo-nazis with the people that fight against them.

***** I get national pride and i myself am a patriot but it is neither the land nor the money of the state that makes a country but people so my view is obviously biased. Also as i am saying i am looking at it from an outsiders perspecitve and to me the statue doesnt mean much and maybe thats why i am undervalueing its importance.

I kinda dont get your second point about false equivalency.

In terms of comparing the crimes of antifa and the neo nazis that were there. Only one side run over someone with a car but both parties came there (with weapons!) obviously looking for a fight and inciting violence and both should be put in contempt for it. And can we assign the crime of a one person to the whole group ? In some way yes since they were promoting it but i think the person in question should be judged as a unit in a court room.(unless he had some order from the leader of the rally of which i dont know about)

The whole fight and conflict between those 2 parties is a just a game of ping pong. One pushes to other to more extreme things. Both, antifa and the neo nazis are violent groups and both should be put in contempt

****** So. There was one specific, small group of counter protestors that came armed with guns. I don't have exact figures but that small group couldn't have made up more than 5-8% of the counter protestors. And that's a stretch. Whereas, almost everyone within the core groups of the neo nazis brought guns, riot shields, batons, tear gas, etc. The vast majority of the counter protestors started out peacefully; they came to protest what they saw as injustice and malicious racism. The neo nazis claim to have come to simply protest but, again, when you come armed so well and with manuevers that indicate you practiced for a militant confrontation of some sort, it doesn't paint you in the best light. Even if we ignore the fact that one of the nazi supporters ran a car into people.

Also not all of the counter protestors were part of antifa. A lot of them were simply church groups and regular people. Whereas everyone on the other side was a neo-nazi or supported their ideology.

I'm not going to pretend that antifa are saints. But, again, their crimes here aren't on the same level as the nazis. Most of the footage displays nazis inciting violence first, nazis saying they'll "fucking kill these people if we have to" and other, horrendous things. The other side, while pushed to violence in their own right, simply /wasn't as bad/. By a large margin. It's clear to see.

Again, it feels like you're saying something like "Well yea, this guy robbed the cashier at gunpoint. But THIS guy used the opportunity to steal a couple of candy bars. They should both be vilified." Even though you're not using the words equal, you're implying it.

******* ofcourse the nazis here are the main villains for organizing this thing and all but my point is more on the people getting triggered with trumps statement than trully which group was worse. Personally for all i care they both can go fuck themselves for the things they do. Its thanks to nazis that people there were killed and they started it but the shouldnt the man who stole the candies face some accusations aswell although i think the metaphor doesnt hold up that much because its a huge exaggeration.

My main point here is people will do everything to hate trump or his policies. He is a jerk but as i said he is no hitler. Personally i would hope to have a statement from him that clearly disaproves and calls out the alt right and other groupes although it can hard because those still are his voters...

******** Well, the statements he made were very non committal at first. He only denounced those groups by name after he'd already made two statements where he didn't and got /HUGE/ backlash. Like ridiculously high levels of it. You don't get points for being that late in the game on something that's so clearly wrong and hated nationwide.

As far as people constantly complaining? I mean, dude, I get it's probably annoying to hear all the time but this is their president. This is the guy that controls the fate of the nation (or at least has a big part in controlling it). And he makes bad move after bad move. People are constantly whining because Trump is constantly fucking up. And that's not something you want in your president.

I won't go far as to say that neo-Nazis would never rally if Trump wasn't in office but I will say that Trump has gotten the most endorsements from white surpremacist groups than any president has had in quite a while. And that's very telling.

********* yep thats why a statement from him denoucing them and calling it out would be cool but he would lose his voters :/

personally i would like it if he had some balls and went with it. I dont think he can get elected a second time and if he will then the democrats are doing something wrong...so why not just go out with a bang and if it will suceed he can actually get some additional support from people.

Edit: also fuck 2 party systems i think they are kinda stupid and promote the "we vs them" mentality that can break a country into a civil war.

********** 2 party systems are really, really annoying. Something as all encompassing and complex as governments of entire countries shouldn't be reduced to such a binary system. Unfortunately, I think that's just the way political systems naturally lean when they're democratic, assuming there's not any hard rules against such a thing. People kinda naturally are of an "Us vs them" mentality. It's like people that voted for Hillary, not because they're pro-Hillary but because they're anti-Trump. So it's just about which party manages to get most of that sentiment around themselves at any given time. And then it snowballs into what we have now. Like you could put a cardboard cut out and he could still be a decent candidate because so many people are so pigheadedly diehard on how they vote.

*********** Similiar situation happens here in Poland as well. Even tho we have multi party system there are only 2 main parties that got the most of votes. The PO and PiS and its annoying how they destroy the country by division of the population. Also when one party gains majority of the voters in hte parliament its a shit show because it tries to delete all the reforms of the previous party...

an example for now is PiS, they gained control of the parliament and cancelled all initiatives that PO made the good and bad alike without any consideration. They also changed the education system for some unknown reason that pissed me off the most (as i am a student). They changed the education system to resemble the previous system used in the times of PRL which admitedly worked well but it was changed by another party after getting out of the paws of the USSR. The thing is i am not mad they are changing it, it needs changing and it wasnt ideal but they are changing such an insignificant thing that i might puke. Its confusing for every parent and child and the system although flawed was already working good. Changing it yet again to it previous version is just a waste of moeny especially so that the change is so fucking stupid but you not only need new program of education of it but teachers may lose jobs and its a general upheaval for no reason.

about the change.

like some 20 or so years ago it was like this

8 years of elementary school

4 years of highschool

and then you can go for uni

then it was changed to 6 years of elementary school

3 years of middle school

3 years of highschool

and then uni

and now its reversed like it was 20 years ago(disclaimer i think its even more than 20 years ago but its just to get the general details)

personally i think its done to smugle money for the relevant people because "when you dont know whats it about, its about money"

also atleast in the multiparty system there are still members of the other parties in parliament that vote for the relevant groups of citizens like the workers party, the agroculture party etc etc

edit: although now a new party is raising in power as the old ones die so its not a clear cut situation. Some laws would need fixing and spreading the general awarness for politics in people but i generally thing that a multiparty system is the way to go

**** The USA is stuck between being a set of anywhere between 11 and 50 different actual countries bound together by a (largely) common civic religion, and an actual nation-state. This government (actually, its dominant party) offends people because it basically takes /some/ of those 11 nations (two or three of them) and tries to treat /them/ as defining an American /nation-state/, to the exclusion of both the other nations within the country (who get culturally offended) /and/ the civic religion.

You can't be an empire driven a civic religion /and/ an ordinary European-style nation-state.

*** I know I've mentioned it already, but screw the "Your strength as a rationalist ... reality from fiction" thing.

I feel that (like quite a few articles from the sequences, now that I think about it) this advice is the epistemology equivalent of a pickup artist column. Yes, it comes from experience, yes, it probably helps some people, yes, if you were already doing it it's gratifying to see it explained... but these advice should always be taken as very, very soft rules, not to be taken literally, and not to be cultivated as literal habits.

I think part of the problem is HP:MoR (and probably other fics it inspired) had its main character use these techniques effectively. Its a standard pattern in fiction: first you introduce a problem the audience can understand, then you explain the technique/method/lesson of the day, then you show a character use the technique to solve the problem.

It's neat and all, but it's super unrealistic and it gives the audience the expectation that, if they too apply these methods, then they can solve their problems too! Kind of like reading a Sherlock Holmes novel and thinking you can become a detective by looking at details too.

So to sort-of-quote Eliezer Yudkowsky, your strength as a rationalist is your ability to acquire a big shiny pile of utility often and consistently.

Ok, but that's not what I said. I said, "to apply ordinary epistemology to extraordinary propositions". Maybe you don't have extraordinary sleuthing skills. Maybe you're not the best-informed person in the room. Maybe you're just not so smart.

But the thing that makes the distinction here - between knowledge, smarts, and rationality - is that very smart, knowledgeable people can get caught-up in trying to treat certain sorts of propositions as /special/, or as somehow /beyond/ mere truth-values. That's when rationality as such becomes important: applying all your mere ordinary know-what and know-how where other people try to pretend you can't or shouldn't.

Well I think you had an important point about rational fiction. If it's truly rational fiction, the reader should be able to solve the story's problems as well as the characters can, and the problem-solving techniques ought to be ones that really work IRL.

If IRL problems are just innately less tractable than fun little book-puzzles, sure, but the methods ought to be things that really work, in the small if not in the large.

******* Meh. I like alexander wale's definition, "Fiction that encourages you to think about it". I don't really ask for more.

I mean, HP:MoR did annoy me, for the same reason a cop show where the scientist goes "ahah, I've traced the chemicals from the killer's boot to that one factory with 100 certainty" annoy real cops. Not because I want to learn anything, but I kind of feel like I'm being lied to my face.

I don't think fiction can realistically work as a problem-solving tutorial (or at least, I haven't seen it yet). You can learn something from fiction, because it gives you perspective or helps you empathize with people you'd been detached about before (Wildbow's stories do both really well), but I think most of HP:MoR's wisdom is untransmissible.

I guess I want a bit more real-worldiness from "rational" fiction, because I've read a whole lot of fiction that encouraged you to think about pseudo-ideas and pseudo-concepts using pseudo-methods. You get stuff that seems really deep when you're reading it, and then completely fucking fails to hold up under Fridge Logic.

I want to call something "rational" because if I try to think about it in a practical, real-life-y sort of way, it still holds up. I think you can also have rational fiction about stuff the /author/ doesn't even fully understand or deliberately leaves ambiguous, but which is nonetheless rational and real-worldy enough to /have something there/, in which case the Fridge Logic actually ends up being productive thinking about an open question.

/Should/ Superman surrender to Lex Luthor because humanity's world shouldn't be ruled by an alien? Is /Three Worlds Collide/ correct to model a diplomatic negotiation between three species as a contract negotiation between economic actors with three different utility functions -- or would alien minds consider our notion of economic rationality to be [[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world][just another human ideology]]?

Paraphrasing EY, "the Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao" (and yes, everyone knows that's originally actually Daoist, oy). To truly be rational, you have to have some use for the rationality that isn't just /feeling intellectual/. That need can always be satisfied more cheaply by sophisticated bullshit than by simple (but precise and therefore difficult) truths.

Paraphrasing Wittgenstein, who was rather more true to his own saying: "Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent".
