No answer there, just linking for posterity and continuity.

*** Hey that's my post.

No news from my camp. I certainly hope it comes back.

Author's reddit account [[/u/9adam4]] hasn't posted in 3 months though.

His Star Wars self insert story hasn't had any work since March either.

Maybe message him from the [[https://delphicserial.com/contact/][contact]] section of his website. I haven't tried that yet.

**** I cheated and wrote Star Trek for a bit:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ships-counsel-tng-other-insert-au.745996/]]

Time to suck it up and address the plot threads of Delphic volume 2. Especially since a lot of volume 3, "Rise of the Fiendish Four," is already plotted out.

Sorry for the delay.

** I loved the series so far, sad to see it go. Didn't get much press or response here, which is a shame.

The series was very well written, with a larger slice of life than any other superhero media I've consumed. Unfortunately, this combined with relatively short chapters and week+ release times to form a situation where not much plot would happen, for long periods of irl time.

The action that did occur was quite compelling and fun. I would love to see more of it.
