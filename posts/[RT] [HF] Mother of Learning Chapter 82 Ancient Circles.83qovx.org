*** I have always thought complex fantasy combat all boiled down to Physical/Mind/Soul if you don't have a good defense in all of them, someone good in one field could probably take you out in one attack. If you can't defend your soul, then one Avada Kedavera (Or whichever equivalent there is) is enough to take you down. If you can't protect your mind, you become a slave/brain dead. If you can't protect your body... well. You die.

But you only really need to be good at *attacking* with one of them. You only need to win in one area to win the battle.

***** I think it's generally good advice to specialize heavily, up until the point where you regularly fight things by yourself. A group of people each specializing in one offensive tree each will be better able to handle something over a group of generalists, because the single specialist will be able to defeat one area of something else's defences fairly easily. Say Zach, Hypothetical Zorian who only has mind magic attacks, and hypothetical Alanic who only has soul magic attacks, form a party. Each still has the same defences as they normally do. By specializing in one offensive magic each, they will be be able to overcome things with average defences in each tree more easily than a party of generalists would, because average defences in any tree would easily fall before specialized attack in that same tree.

If you're a single adventurer though, or just an overachiever, then yeah you need to have more variety in your arsenal.

***** Kind of. But that apllies to all of the three angles of attack. If the foe you are fighting is too physically powerfull for you to do anything, and that is the only way for you to attack. You are screwed. The same if your foes soul seems impervious to your manipulations.

So in order to become truly great you kind of need all three, but in order to defeat most foes, you only need to be good at one of them.

***** Yeah, great observation. Honestly, the magic system is half of what got me interested in this series. Wondering if the author made the magic system keeping the Realmatic Theory in mind or it's some kind of converging thought process among writers.

With regard to [[/u/Caliburn0][u/Caliburn0]]'s comment, I half agree. Zach & Zorian are good at all three magic types and it's something that's been building up for a while.

Zorian is great at mind magic (being a natural mind mage and trained by the spiders) and not so great at combat (which requires a lot of mana reserves and his inexperience). So he focused on soul magic (hard to defend and useful with the mind marker) and left most of the physical combat stuff to Zach (who is so overpowered he literally killed a dragon to test himself). And they have the knowledge of a bunch of mentors helping them out to make up for their inexperience and to give them an edge over other people (since knowledge in this world is stingily given to others so you literally have to meet the creator/master practitioner to learn it)

They've been winning because they're good at attacking with all magics.

***** Going by the theory that RR got into the loop by studying/changing a temporary marker, and that the marker is granted by one of the artifacts, then someone in Altazia must have gotten their hands on an artifact aside from the orb. Since the ring and staff are much harder to stumble on than the crown, and the dagger is more conceptually linked to removing people from the loop, the crown is the most likely choice.

Also, crowns mark a person as important. That links it conceptually to temporary markers.

None of the above is definite, but I would put money on it being the crown.

******* It is unknown if the Controller strictly /needs/ the artifacts to place temporary markers on or soulkill others. It is possible that those functions are embedded in the Controller Marker itself, and RR gained access to them when he Jailbroke his marker. Zach has limited Soul Sight and Zorian's marker is broken so they don't know that.

Given what we know though, it is likely that RR had some access to the Eldemar treasury and RR somehow managed to barter QI for temporary access to the Crown.

** I know it wasn't really mentioned much in this chapter, but if Z&Z can obtain the crown, who should get it? My thinking is if the Crown stores a fixed amount of Mana, then Zorian should get it. He's more efficient in using his Mana than Zach, and is currently much more limited by his small reserves. He'll take a long time to fill it up, but he could afford to use much costlier spells than he can currently. If the Crown stores an amount of Mana based on how much the user has, then Zach should get it, because the total amount of Mana storage gained is much larger if Zach's Mana is multiplied than if Zorian's is.

**** Even with that, I think the marginal benefit of giving mana-monster Zach an additional flat bonus is less than the benefit of giving mana-starved Zorian the ability to store huge amounts of mana. Zach can already cast just about any spell he comes across, and the crown gives him the ability to cast more of those. For Zorian, it is either impossible or extremely impractical for him to cast some spells that he certainly knows but hasn't practiced extensively.

Put in other words, giving the Mana storage to Zach gives him a quantitative improvement, and Zorian a qualitative and quantitative improvement, even if the quantitative improvement isn't as large as it could be due to lack of practice.

I'd imagine the crown would work well passed from person to person depending on the situation.

Mana regeneration generally scales with your reserves as well, so if that applies to the crown as well Zach may be able to do some utterly absurd things, like power a time stop. We can see.

I think in part this is because Zorian has such low reserves. In addition to him being really miserly with his mana, this means him being out of mana means him being /out/. Zach being low on mana means he can only cast a few more shields and some of his cheaper offensive spells. Zorian would probably just die against someone close to his level if he got as comparatively low as Zach does. Xvim did actually die when he got too low.

Zach also regenerates absolute amounts of Mana much faster than normal people, so a sustainable level of combat for him is still very respectable.

Unless the crown can store multiple people's Mana, it wouldn't. Mana is attuned to a single person and can't be used by someone else with any ease. There was a world building post that mentioned this I think.

******* Yes, so Zorian's combat style is well optimized for him having low reserves, and he has techniques and skills centered around that. Zach's style is optimized around him burning huge amounts of mana. As such, an artifact that lets him burn even more mana would make him a lot more effective. He can be much more wild and unsustainable, repeatedly casting massive spells that would before drain his huge reserves.

The crown seems to act as a battery for a person's personal mana. We don't know if it also enhances their mana regeneration powers, but generally, if you have a larger personal mana reserve, you can draw power up faster.

Zorian would benefit from it, but Zach would benefit more.

** Chapter 77

#+begin_quote
  The chapter in question described a small cult of mages, '*somewhere in Xlotic*', which worshipped an entity imprisoned behind some kind of 'dimensional veil'. ... After repeating this process gods know how many times, the cultists eventually assembled a fair amount of information about this entity, which the cultists called 'the *Golden-Feathered Worm*'. To Zorian's eyes, it appeared clear that this Golden-Feathered Worm was actually an imprisoned primordial, even if the book never actually identified it as such.
#+end_quote

This chapter

#+begin_quote
  He had barely finished speaking when the sandworm suddenly shook, almost like a dog trying to dry itself off, and a serious of translucent, glowing, yellow wings grew out of its sides. They were long and paper-thin, reminiscent of dragonfly wings, and looked comically inappropriate for lifting a creature like that into the air... but as the creature's many *golden wings* started slowly undulating like oars on a boat, the sandworm slowly lifted itself into the sky and then reoriented itself towards them.

*** This is a very nice catch, but I would expect imprisoned primordial to be much more powerful that his worm. Location/color matches somewhat. But:

Zach wouldn't be able to hold down primordial. This sand worm should have god blessing (like hydra in orb). It is far too weak for primordial. Gives enough challenge for Zachs simulacrum. Responds to calls for assistance (like hydra does to drake chameleons).

It is possible that we would see some more god-bless guardian animals with ties to other divine artifacts ( if they are not killed yet ).

** 1) I really like that nobody103 is reading this reddit and corrects the possible flaws we find in each chapter. Like explaining QI's attitude (he acted a lot like a teenager in last chapter), or how to exploit his knowledge. Z&Z would probably do it the same way anyway, but they explicitly talk about those issues now, so everyone knows they're aware of them.

2) I'm kinda disappointed Zorian wasn't studying Zach's blessing as the very first thing after the previous chapter. That's exactly what I would expect him to do - if he could somehow cast even very weak copy of the blessing, it would still be a low hanging fruit for him - it would magnify all his powers. Maybe it's only 'cast-once' enhancement (blood magic?), so he has to train very hard to be able to do it well? Still weird that he wasn't even interested in it this chapter, though ...

3) I do find the fight a bit disappointing, too. We were used to having detailed descriptions of fights (invasions, fight against QI, god-touched hydra, even last time on the airship - where we only see the simulacrum on one airship fighting), but now we just learn that the simulacrum teams sacrifice themselves / outright die. I understand that having free clones of main characters makes the clones expendable, but it still seems weird in-universe - it would make sense if they had some sort of agreed upon limits to what mana they can use, but nothing is said in the chapter.

4) Looking forward to how they change the attack at the Ziggurat in the next loop. They should be able to get more support - I really thought 20 mages is not that much, considering how many they had previously (I know - different fights, different continent - but still!). It's again not explicitly said, but I expect that they have to move quickly before some sulrothum reinforcements arrive. So they cannot just wait and kill all the sulrothum that come outside - and then go inside with all the resources they have. They still should try to loot everything there is in the Ziggurat, though - but that would most likely require them to kill every sulrothum around ...

5) We learned two new things that Zorian doesn't really understand now - some subtle wards aroung the Ziggurat and some sulrothum mind defenses (that he's obviously able to overcome, but it costs him a lot of mana). The wards can be either broken -> the strategy for getting the ring remains the same (attack group for distraction + infiltration group for getting the ring), or maybe it's not wards but some innate ability of sulrothum - which would require change in strategy (see 4) - maybe one frontal all-in assault? ). The mind defense could be a bit more tricky - but Zorian loves exotic spells / shaping exercises, right?

6) Another option I can think of - they've already been inside the Ziggurat and there obviously aren't any anti-teleportation wards -> next restart they can just teleport inside, open portal and attack from the inside. With distraction from outside or without. I still think the high priest will have some interesting loot on him (beside the artifact ring).

7)

#+begin_quote
  Zorian did find it kind of interesting how many otherwise obscure groups and individuals were roused into action as a result of their theft, though. Perhaps it would be a good idea to stir up some similarly great outrage back in Altazia, just to see if something particularly interesting would show itself in its wake...
#+end_quote

Attack on the royal tresury, getting all the interesting stuff (books, artifacts, basically anything useful) and running away should do the trick. (Although it says 'stir up outrage Altazia', which is continent containing splinter states, not Eldemar). Maybe they're gonna stir up outrage in every splinter state, to find all the interesting parties?

*** regarding study of divine blessing - I'm pretty sure neither Zach nor Zorian are proficient enough in soul magic to study reflection of divine magic on soul. QI was bragging (and he had enough proficiency to brag enough) about how few mages are able to study them.

3). The sacrifice thing is not that far fetched. While simulacrums wouldn't do what the originals won't, both Zach and Zorian (especially Zach) are OK with sacrifice since they are in time loop and it bears little harm. Zorian is less keen to die, but they are kinda immortal, so sacrifice could work for them.

4-5). As for further strategies - the sulrothum empire has some very interesting things, but most likely they will be postponed for post-loop period. They will have to interact with them a lot until they learn the high priest location, but I'm not sure if there is a way to unearth the method for wards/mental defenses of the sand worm. There's always kindnap/mindrape thing, but it won't work out as well as it work for aranea (due to distributed nature of their colonies and smaller self-sustaining communities to kill). The sulrothums live in the single place and it is too large to conveniently incapacitate/interrogate them. But if they find out the high priest location for ring, if they manage to disable the priest without raising a lot of fuzz, I don't see any reason Zorian wouldn't scry his mind for any useful knowledge

Very interesting in knowing the rings abilities. Also, it seems likely that it will have some hidden time-loop related abilities. If it does, that strongly suggests that all 5 key pieces have bonus power for Zach and Zorian which is a definite plus.

I doubt it will be as difficult on repetition. If they know where the priest is, they can either ambush him as soon as he leaves the temple, or they could find out where he is in the temple, teleport to him, take the ring, and leave. Maybe not simple, but achievable since I don't believe the wasps have wards good enough to detect Z&Z outside the temple nor restrict scrying and teleportation. The ring certainly has anti scrying defences, but it's much easier to find the priest.

Orb = info storage Dagger = Template change Crown = Soul Markers (esp since QI was the one that put Zorian in the loop) Staff = Rare magics? I got no clue? Ring = Access card into maker and other information?

**** If I had to make a serious guess, I think the ring's ability would deal with subtlety or disguise in some way. Rings are small and unobtrusive, so hiding the wearer from perception in some way makes sense. That said, invisibility and physical transformation are already achievable, so maybe something like being able to convince anyone that you are whoever you say you are? Kind of a stretch, and I'm not really sold on this line of thought.

Alternatively, rings in medieval times were used to stamp things with the king's personal seal, in order to verify that something had come from the king. Convincing other people makes some sense again, or maybe some form of true sight.

The staff makes a lot of sense as a magic weapon. The ability to shape ambient mana as if it were your own would be monstrously OP, so I think that's out. Maybe the ability to cast any spell that you are able to cast, but at maximum efficiency? Or cast spells almost instantly? Thats kind of what staves do in this setting, although they're much more limited. Would have a very nice synergy with the crown, and would be amazing for Zach.

Oh, maybe the crown is for Mana storage, the staff for Mana shaping, and the ring for Mana generation? Each is very strong on its own, but synergizes extremely well with the other artifacts.

If the ring is the symbolic source of power (as the seal) then it makes sense for mana generation. However, I'm not too convinced since the crown is the biggest symbol of authority.

Instant spells would probably be better against QI than huge amounts of Mana. Combat magic, as explained in the most recent wordbuilding post, is basically any magic that has a use in combat and is quick to cast. You can't spend an entire minute casting a single devastating spell, because you're dead by then. Getting better at combat is generally about getting quicker to cast the spells you already know. If you aren't limited by how fast you can cast spells, or are at least a *lot* better than your opponent at casting quickly, you can overwhelm his defences because you can launch so many attacks before they can cast a defence.

Remember how devastating QI was when he sped himself up with time magic? And why he needed to do so in the first place? He had a bunch of attacks coming at him, and not enough time to erect defences. And then he blocked all those and launched attacks that were quick enough that some mages didn't have time to defend against them. Imagine being able do that effectively permanently. Launch multiple attacks so that anyone you face has to either dodge (sometimes not possible), or have generic defenses that aren't nearly as efficient at stopping any one type of spell. And then just continually throw out cheap spells that the enemy has to respond to individually. Even if you don't have nearly as much Mana as the other guy, you can quickly drain him dry. I think in most cases, you could beat the other guy by firing two near simultaneous attacks that can't be blocked by any single defence. Xvim's shieldbreakers plus a force lance, or something like that.

It wouldn't be unbeatable, because you're still limited by your reaction time, personal spell knowledge, and Mana reserves, but I think it's of a similar level of OP as the Crown. In combat anyways.

*** The nature of these time loops give them several advantages that those going through time regularly would not have:

1. *Effectively Infinite Money*: After learning the locations of large mana crystals, easy-to-acquire-but-rare ingredients for alchemy, lost treasures, etc., they start off every loop with plenty of funds. This lets them buy secrets, tutors, training equipment for learning spell formulae, and whatever else they please.

2. *Risk Taking Without Risks*: Zach practiced his combat skills by taking on a dragon alone. Without the loop, he would be risking death from trying such a stunt. With the loop, if he dies, then he's back to square one. They can learn dangerous spells that might harm them during the learning process because all of their injuries (sans soul damage) recover at the start of the loop.

3. *Blatant Criminal Activity*: They stole an airship and killed several individuals in the process to acquire an easyish way to get to a distant continent. Outside the loop, they would forever have a country hunting them down, and their morals might stop them from killing the guards, but inside the loop, the deaths don't amount to much.

I'm sure I'm missing some, but this list should be enough to make my point: Zorian hasn't lived a normal seven years, he's lived a jam-packed, study-filled, adventure-laden time that even royalty couldn't get on the outside to the same degree.

One last thing of note would be the time dilation rooms. Zorian mentions that he's been in the loops about seven years /not counting the rooms/. These give extra weeks every loop of practicing mana shaping exercises that Xvim states are the bread and butter of archmages, improving their casting abilities that much more.

It's well known that despite the efforts of public education, there is a whole lot of good stuff that mages already know how to do, but keep to themselves. ZZ can beg, buy or outright steal most of it.

From what I can tell, there are basically three challenges that people face in a magical career, and if you can deal with all three, you can be good at everything.

1. Cost of ingredients. This affects alchemy and golem-making. Obviously a non-issue.

2. Precision. This includes disciplines that need excellent shaping, and also eg spell formulas that need careful programming. Zorian has the right mindset for this, he had the right mentor, he had motivation due to his need for efficient mana usage, and he had lots and lots of time where shaping exercises were about all he could do (early loops, black rooms, etc).

3. Obscure knowledge. Lots of the best combat spells are not exceptionally hard to cast, merely restricted in the library. ZZ have raided all kinds of secret and illegal stashes.

zorian can cast, flamethrower, severing disc, incinirating ray, plasma whip, fireball and flame vortex. where off incinirating ray and flame vortex burn pretty much all his mana and he can't cast too many fireballs either.

Cyoria is like one of the most mana filled area on the planet, zorian can recharge pretty fast there by absorbing ambient mana, and they were diving into the hole the actual most mana rich area on the planet (that we know off) so not very slow at all he should have had full mana when they started the assult without any issues.

the in depth shaping books are because zorian should look for shaping exercises that are good for the spells he wants/needs to cast, rather then xvim not knowing more, but why study something you wont have any use for when pressed for time as they are now.

mind defenses are super common, he states that pretty much every mage knows them in the early chapters when he just started learning mind magic, however most don't use them permanently and only activate them when they find them relelevant (like in combat), MIND BLANK however is hard to cast and used by a much smaller amount of people.

mind shields are described as "shells" they are basically a layer of something rigid protecting the mind, pretty much always with cracks and weak points that you can use to dismantle the defense, but generally a mind shield would give you enough time for you to beat Zorian, since he'd need to remove the shield, dismantling is cheap and time consuming, breaking is quick and expensive.

Mind blank is the immunity, but have the side effect that it drives the user insane if used too often, it's not a shield as much as it simply remove the mind from existance for anyone but the user, and since it does not exist nobody else can interact with it.

- 1 month with Zack there
- 6 months of improving himself, trying to impress Ilsa and Xvim
- an unknown but large number of 3-5 day iterations
- 1 month where Kirielle comes along
- 6 months where he's trying not to draw any attention because Zach's around and he's afraid of soul bonds
- 11 months of learning from the Aranea in Cyoria
- a very quickly ending iteration where he suicides to escape RR
- 22 months of staying away from Cyoria (minus 10 days)

Also, if the artifacts give some extremely useful ability aside from the time loop related one, it could make getting the other artifacts easier, so it makes sense to get really good at obtaining each individual artifact and understanding it before putting huge resources into going for the others.

If you mean the ring, then I agree. It means being able to fight for longer time. But the dagger is in the royal vault, and last time they tried it, the problem was their (lack of good) ward breaking/divination spells, I don't really think mana would help with that.

#+begin_quote
  depending on whether it gives flat or percentage Mana storage, Zach could have even more mana or Zorian could have nearly as much as Zach does now.
#+end_quote

From what we know, Zach and QI have the same base mana, so either way Zach would get 10x mana from wearing the crown (just the mana, not mana regeneration).

If the crown mana storage is flat, it would hold ~2250 magic missiles (QI has ~250 without crown, with crown it's 10 times larger). Last intel we have on Zorian (before he was casting invisible missiles) is being able to cast 35 magic missiles.

So if the bonus is flat, Zorian would get +2250, which means ((2250+35)/35) = ~65 times as much max mana as he has now. If the bonus is percentage, Zorian will get +315 max mana (10 times as much as he has now).

(Of course all of these numbers are based on magic missiles that Zorian can (probably) cast better than either QI or Zach.)

One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.

btw If they manage to get the crown reliably + early in each restart + decide to give it to Zorian, maybe he should start learning different spells - right now, even though he knows the more expensive spells, he is more focused on cheaper spells => trained them more == has better efficiency in them. He mentioned many times through the story that he doesn't care about the more expensive spells.

No, I mean the crown. Yes, Zorian isn't going to suddenly be able to batter down the vault doors, but it will almost certainly devolve to a fight at some point, and more Mana will help with that.

I mean, yes, the extra Mana will probably help with the dagger the least of the artifacts, but we don't know anything about the defences around the staff, the orb is apparently almost trivial to get now, and the crown obviously can't help getting the crown. I suppose the crown helps with getting the ring if they choose to follow the same method of getting it again, but I think the difference in skill/difficulty between getting the ring at all and getting it easily is less than not getting it and barely getting it. Also I wasn't thinking of that example, which is honestly the much bigger factor.

#+begin_quote
  One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.
#+end_quote

Thank you for the math.

It would have to be a rather long battle for Zorian to spend 65 times his normal base, even if gets more wasteful as a result of his Max storage being higher.

It would also take a looong time for Zorian to fill up the crown. I think that a normal mage can go from nothing to full in about half an hour, provided there's sufficient ambient Mana? ~33 hours of continuous Mana generation, and that's only if he spends none of his Mana. He'd also have to take time for sleep.

***** If the crown grants temporary loop markers, just give one to a royal or someone with access to the royal vault. After they see the invasion for themselves and learn that ZZ can stop it but need the dagger from the vault, they can just remove it from the vault without triggering all the wards and deliver it to ZZ at the beginning of the next few loops. No need to breach the vault at all, just bypass all those wards instead.

Of course getting the crown is another matter.

... but since he invested more effort into high-mana spells, it makes a bigger negative impact.

Furthermore, even for training purposes, the crown's potential is wasted on Zorian, especially so if the bonus is static. He will /never/ manage to fill the crown with his low regen rate, therefore his regeneration is the limiting factor, not his reserves. Only if he manages to amplify his mana regeneration rates, the crown will be a good artifact for him.

On the other hand, his proficiency with memory packets makes him the ideal user of the Orb.

He would have definitely had a much poorer grasp on her capabilities, and may have even failed to grasp any of her other thoughts at all. But that wasn't what nimelennar asked. He asked if he would he have understood any less of the message the matriarch left for him if he opened the package sooner, and the answer is no... because the matriarch specifically wanted him to hear that message and made sure it was in the form that was understandable to his mind.:
