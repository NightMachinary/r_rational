** I'm admittedly kind of uncomfortable with the narrator... he seems arbitrarily misanthropic, and this seems like rewarding him.

That said, my move as the DM (besides avoiding metaphysics-altering crap in the first session) would be to retcon gravity into being dependent on interaction between the Plane of Force and the Plane of Earth (I mean, it makes about as much sense as anything), and watch as the local deities get annoyed with floating around without leverage.

This actually sounds like an interesting setting idea...

It's the Tucker Max thing, where you say that you're "not proud" of something and then proceed to describe it with as much pride as possible - revelling in being an asshole while disclaiming your behavior, basically. This is the sort of story where even though he's telling it from his side, you get the sense that from everyone else's perspective he's just an unreasonable asshole.

*** Devil's advocate here: The things he says in the description of the woman are just as bad as the description of the gay guy.

**** Physical harassment ought I think to be considered worse than anonymized descriptions online.

*** That was epic. Literally.

Personally, I'm here with him. I've always hated psionics too. Still, it sucks being in a group that messed up. I feel for him.

  but apparently in his setting, elves can't have facial hair, so I said his eyebrows grew down to his belt

You know you've got something good when you're abusing loopholes in the rules before you even start.

*** See, this bothers me on both sides. Player: I want my elf to have a beard. Dm: I'd rather not have facial hair on elves. P: Please? D: Your character is~1/32 human. If you slowly grow facial hair.

Or

Player:I want my elf to have a beard. Dm: I don't want my elves to be super hairy like men. Player: please? Dm: no. Player: fine, I make my eyebrows really long. Dm: if I am saying no to a beard so you really expect me to ok waist length eyebrows?

Either option works. I know of no Dm that would find eyebrows better than beards.
