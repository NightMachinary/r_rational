tl;dr any recommendations for young adult rational or rationalist fiction? i would be especially interested in TV shows or films.

i've been hanging out with a couple of eleven year old girls recently (my cousins) and i mentioned (bragged?) that i had read at least three harry potter fan fiction series that were as long as the original series.

/and in one of them, harry is a rationalist and does science to magic!/

--/what's a rationalist?/

i sort of flubbed the response, but hoping i can do a bit better since i once saw a dog-eared bible in that house and i want to make sure these kids get many perspectives on life.

so, any recommendations for young adult rational or rationalist fiction? i would be especially interested in TV shows or films, since i have already given each girl a book set this past year (his dark materials, and few neil gaiman books).

edit: wow thanks for all the responses. still exploring them; i think some will become part of my new reading list. and sorry for not being around to respond.

** The Deltora Quest series was pretty good. It wasn't explicitly rationalist, but contained some interesting puzzles in and of itself, and is appropriate for eleven year olds.

The Artemis Fowl books aren't rationalist either, but they do have an intelligent vibe about them, for certain, and is, again, appropriate for eleven year olds. They're very enjoyable.

It's been a while, but Detective Conan is a fairly intelligent anime. It's really just kind of Sherlock Holmes /pint sized edition/ but that doesn't make it bad, I enjoyed it a lot when I was younger. I can't say for certain it's all that age appropriate (the majority of the cases solved are about murders, after all) but it's not all that bad. Very little explicit violence, no sexuality that I can recall, easy to follow, episodic plots, etc.

While not rational, I'll throw in a recommendation for Code Lyoko. Well animated, action packed, while still being very good.

As far as rationality in fiction, I don't believe much of it in the current sphere is suited to eleven year olds. I would never let an eleven year old read HPMOR (Pretty early on, we're privy to Draco talking about raping a ten year old, with Harry providing justification for his viewpoint to the audience. His justification isn't incorrect, nor does it make it right, but it's the sort of complex issue I'd never want to introduce an eleven year old too. Particularly female ones) A lot of rational fiction is, in my opinion, too advanced and/or complex for a sixth grade child. Ironic, considering how Harry complains so much about people censoring things BECAUSE he's eleven, but it's true. A lot of the rational fiction we enjoy on this subreddit deals with themes that I find a little too mature for children. That's just a personal viewpoint I have, and I understand if people feel differently, but I can't see most eleven year olds marveling at Jake's orbital drop plan (other than going "Oh, cool! Explosions!") or at Aro's subtle manipulation of the Volturi (with a little detached vampire bling for flavor)

Oh. Yeah. I, uh, totally forgot about that bit. Thanks for reminding me, since I've been wondering when to introduce my (much younger, from ten to going-on-fourteen) siblings to HPMOR.

(Maybe double-thanks are in order, since I'd been planning on doing it when I went home for Christmas)

***** I'm not sure exactly how far we got but I read a heap before he wanted to read it himself and then we discovered [[/u/embrodski]]'s fabulous podcast and so we have been listening to that together instead. Final episode out very soon, I think!

As far as I can recall there wasn't anything else I wanted to skip. I'm pretty liberal really, I think introducing some adult concepts can lead to interesting questions and discussions. But I actually can't recall anything else in HPMOR that I would consider 'adult' but the depth of the content did lead to some interesting discussions about topics like 'how we know what we know' and the like.

** Shockingly I appear to have beaten [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] to this but the So you want to be a Wizard series by Diane Duane is a pretty solid proto-rationalist YA series. Magic in the series is based on precise language and an understanding of the natural world and to be a wizard you have to take an oath to fight entropy. It also has a nice dusting of various mythologies.

** Don't know any rational movies.

For fiction that applies rationality to magic, I recommend the Incompleat Enchanter series by Pratt and de Camp, and the Lord Darcy series by Randall Garret. They're not explicitly "young adult" but they're definitely safe for kids. About the only reference to adult themes I can think of is when Lord Darcy pretends to be seduced by the Mata Hari expy in "The Ipswitch Phial" and that's all indirect.

** Philip Puilman's /His Dark Materials/ trilogy is YA, but it's also got a /lot/ of stuff that only adults will pick up on, which innocent minds will not. It's actually kinda one of the themes of the story. Good choice, that.

Susan Cooper's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Is_Rising_Sequence][/Dark is Rising/ sequence]] sometimes has a female protagonist, and is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd term it rationalist.

Around that time, I was reading /Dune/, but it's ... well, strange.

** I don't know if they count, but outdoorsy problem solving books like The Hatchet, Rascal, The Swiss Family Robinson, Jack London, seem somewhat rational to me. They're rather applied obviously, but there's a general element of take chargeism and creativity to be learned from these books that I think matches what rational books try to impart.
