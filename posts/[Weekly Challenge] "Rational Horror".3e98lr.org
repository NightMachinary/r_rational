[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dftrx/weekly_challenge_the_chosen_one/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "The Chosen One". [[/u/Kishoto]] is the winner with his story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dftrx/weekly_challenge_the_chosen_one/ct5tldq]["Clark"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/Kishoto]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
The prompt for this week is "Rational Horror". We've had a few discussions in this subreddit recently about what that might entail, especially [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bxvav/rational_horror/][this thread]]. Is it delightfully existential horror? Lovecraftian unknowability? People responding reasonably to a serial killer stalking them instead of running down into the basement? Genre-awareness? This is your chance to show your vision of that definition. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, July 29nd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

** Rules

The prompt for next week is "The Chessmaster". This is the character with layers upon layers of deception and backup plans for when the backup plans fail. Sometimes, being the chessmaster means sacrificing a few pawns. Other times, it means recognizing which piece is really the king.

**** Your in-document reviewer seems to have been a tad upset, but it made perfect sense to me. The fact that the AI was in the box was clearly stated in the beginning, and the minute his voice got faked, I knew what was going on -- she was scamming them all for reasons of her own. My initial guess was that now she has a "trust-worthy" sock puppet who can tell the world that no, Celeste is safe, really.

Also, the horror worked for me.

*** Niiiiice.

My only science nitpicks - because the more accurate, the more horrifying:

1. Saturn-orbits have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Terminology_graph][apokrone]], not apoapsis (that's Earth-only). Also lovely mythological overtones...

2. LIDAR and microwave RADAR can show a lot of things, but not everything. At 10km altitude LIDAR is basically only good for landscape features; you could tell that part of the ship is missing but little else. 2km gets you to ~1m resolution though. On the other hand, the microwave backscatter is highly revealing about the surface type - this could be seriously creepy and it fits well. The SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography) works from earth orbit @~100km, and from 10km the backscatter can tell which part of a flat paddock has been grazed most recently.

While you're right about aprokrone, which yes is a cool term, apoapsis is the catch-all for general navigation. You're wrong about it being specific to Earth, the term for that is apogree (from the page you linked :P

*** By about the second page, I was suspecting that some combination of the FTL ship's relatively unusual inertial frame combined with the FTL jumps would lead to a time-travel thingummy, which had caused the generation ship to have gone dark in some horrific version of the Causality Protection Conjecture...

... I'm afraid that the actual story didn't seem as fascinating as what I was hoping to see at that point. Maybe I was supposed to start feeling more unease with the unexplained phenomena, such as the exploring marines' local space getting twisted, but I didn't get much of any emotional punch from that before the explosion.

By the end, I was expecting to find a final gotcha of some kind, such as our FTL ship having drawn the attention of the spatial phenomena and dragged it to the Solar system behind them - or, given FTL-signalling/Time-travel phenomena, maybe have had it already be there when it arrived - but that didn't pan out, either.

#+end_quote

You probably want "Nicola" there. Also, later on you have "He's hardly been sleeping"; should be "he'd" to match tense.

I've seen the movie, loved it, and this is a great extension of the concept. It didn't work for me as horror because the scenes of torture were not evocative enough for me -- they felt glossed over, as though the story were hurrying on to some more interesting bit. The ending also left me puzzled -- if the copies are identical to him, why are they so antithetical to his own motivations? (No interest in revenge, willingness to work with copies.)

**** Fixed. Thanks.

Part of the "glossing" was laziness, the rest was as you described: hurrying on to the more exciting bit. In my mind, the more exciting bit was the horror of not being able to trust a copy of yourself enough to keep it outside of a cell, then being faced with many of them escaping with your precious source of power.

The copies (or rather their shared root copy) have had 48 hours to sit around and do nothing but think (although some of that time would necessarily be spent resting). They cleared their head from thoughts of revenge and instead moved onto more interesting ways to use the machine. My reasoning for their being grouped together would be their need for help avoiding Angier the original.

Thanks for the typo fixes and the feedback.

#+end_quote

Hmm. Personally, I had just written that one of as "Angiers is bonkers." I think you need to sell that one a bit more if you want it to be the horror conceit -- in particular, you need to sell it /hard/ when, just down the hall, you've got a man being tortured and killed over and over. In particular, it needs to /feel/ like the central concept, when in fact it's almost entirely offstage -- there's a brief mention at the start that he has cells for his double, and then we don't hear about it again until the end.

Maybe add some scenes of him thinking about / talking with his doubles? Them suggesting he let them out, that they can help? Something like that. Also, you need a plausible way for them to have escaped -- right now it feels like a plot hole.

*** It doesn't really feel like a story, more like a scenario being described. Needs some serious expansion in my opinion. except for that, very well written, the quality is high, but like ArgentStonecutter said, it needs a background, or something else to connect to, so that it can be more than a scene describing an idea.
