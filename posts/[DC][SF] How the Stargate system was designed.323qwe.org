*** Oops, sorry. I'll check more carefully when I post the second chapter ;)

And thanks for such an amusing read!

****** I'll be looking forward to it either way. Though if it's 65M years, please don't forget all your software QA lessons. The universe may not be a nice +lay+ place, but we do live here.

******** Sorry too many beers, and I wouldn't: it's too big for me/,/ so either it's too fat, or it's something//one/ so transcendentally beyond me that I wouldn't be able to meet my own standards of performance until I've grown a few orders of magnitude.

***** I can pretty much guarantee a second chapter would be disappointing. There's no story as such to continue, and the joke has been made. Knowing when to stop the joke is the key to humour. :-)

***** There is however [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3280p0/dcsf_baals_war_set_in_a_what_if_the_people_of/]] which is absolutely not a second chapter but may still be of interest for more Stargate deconstruction.
