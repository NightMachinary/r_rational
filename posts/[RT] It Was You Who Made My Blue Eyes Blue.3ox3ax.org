** I wonder if the only reason that no-one has induced a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot is because everyone concludes, past a certain amount of sparkroot, that if it were possible to induce a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot, someone would have already, which has clearly not happened, and therefore the risk of death-by-overdose infinitely outweighs the potential for a self-improvement loop.

Clearly we need to force-feed someone indefinite amounts of sparkroot to see what happens. If the answer is "they die", then we add an entry to the Tablets Of Enku that says "don't eat too much sparkroot" and then never speak of it again.

****** Well it looks like it does kinda? "Upon my first taste of sparkroot I knew volcanoes are upswellings of magma in the crust" -

either sparkroot allows you to integrate all of the sensory data you have ever acquired to coherent models upon models - with the implication that normal human sensors are good enough to get plate tectonics, which I highly doubt - or you get extrasensory data.

******* You can get Newtonian gravity from the motion of visible planets and the sun. You can get a rough idea of phase transitions and thermodynamics by watching cookery. Matter appears to be preserved in all understood cases.

Volcanoes physically grow during an eruption. Magma cools into rock, and appears in the caldera. Since matter can't just be created, it makes sense that it came from below. Since rock and magma are the same, and the Earth is huge, and the caldera narrow, the layer of solid rock has to be thin compared to the size of the Earth, since a column of magma below the volcano can remain molten for centuries. So it makes sense that the solid rock is but a crust, and the magma came up from below for some reason.

******** Yeah no, I'm not buying it. Sure, molten rock comes out of the earth - but "upswelling of magma in the earths mantle" - nah, thats too big of a leap.

How do you infer a layer of solid rock at all?

Equally possible is a fully solid earth with a single spot where unknown processes create lots of heat

**** I like to imagine that the original colonists of the island enjoyed a brief period of sparkroot-y genius before realizing that the only way to keep some well-intentioned idiot high on sparkroot from destroying the world was to tie up everyone's heads in pointless ritual. And if they ever needed to work against a world-ending threat, they'd still have the root.

  “Who even decides these things!” she asked. “Why is it wrong to know your own eye color?”

  “The eye is the organ that sees,” said Calkas. “It's how we know what things look like. If the eye knew what it itself looked like, it would be an infinite cycle, the eye seeing the eye seeing the eye seeing the eye and so on. Like dividing by zero. It's an abomination. That's why the Volcano God, in his infinite wisdom, said that it must not be.”

** I'm thinking the blue-eyed islander problem out and I'm thinking that the following things are true:

- If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any /true/ statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, all the blue-eyed islanders will leave the island.
- If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any /false/ statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, they will collectively correct themselves, realizing that it's false. Probably no one will leave the island. (EDIT: Or maybe everyone leaves the island?! IDK, I think my original conclusion was false now that I'm thinking about it more.)

*** The story doesn't mention it, but of course, this is a reference to the Fermat theorem. It requires a, b, x and n to be non-zero integers. If you don't take that into account, you should conclude that they must bathe every day, because any x can be very easily represented as a sum of powers of some non-integers a and b.
