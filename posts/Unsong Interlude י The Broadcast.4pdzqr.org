*** Yeah, I feel like the unrealism and the exaggerated descriptions mercifully created some distance. It didn't have the impact of something like the Red Wedding, which had characters I already cared about getting murdered due to simple real-world human evil rather than ontological Evil perpetrated by an Evil Maximizer.

That said... /shudder/.

Edit: Actually, "Evil Maximizer" made me realize that Thamiel seems less like a capricious evil entity than an optimizer whose objective is to maximize suffering in the universe. Thamiel does not hate you, nor does he love you, but you contain a soul that he can use to generate more suffering.

Okay, /now/ I'm shuddering.

** The worldbuilding of Unsong ... is starting to get to me.

TV broadcasting stops working sometime in the mid-80s, televisions and VCRs fall out of favor and eventually become relics. San Francisco gets flooded with LSD and blocked off from civilized society. The United States no longer appears to be a functional government, at least in the heartland, following some apparently quite violent war between the Comet King and the Other King. Russia has been overrun by demons.

And yet, Kim Jong-Un is apparently still the leader of North Korea, there are Apple MacBooks, the Internet is still functional, almost all the major companies are still around (per Erica's pitch), BART is still functional, Silicon Valley is still a tech mecha, etc.

Unsong does not aspire to rationality, I get that, but ... is there some explanation that will help me here? In Spite of a Nail is not normally a trope that bothers me, but the worldbuilding seems to go off in absolutely wild directions and then end up right back where it is in the real world. Is the answer just "don't think about it too hard" or "Uriel did it for reasons"? I'm otherwise enjoying the story, but hearing that /broadcast television/ is no longer a thing might be the thing that permanently breaks my suspension of disbelief, simply because of how radically different the world should be.

*** When I was a believer (Southern Baptist, a fundamentalist, evangelical, the-biblical-is-inerrant, young-earth-creationist denomination) I got annoyed at fellow believers who would treat semantic games about good and evil as a knock-down argument against the problem of evil.

Their favorite analogy was that cold was merely the absence of heat, and evil merely the absence of God (not a typo, they viewed God and good as perfectly equivalent). But seeing your comment and recalling that analogy... "evil" has a much larger solution space than "good". Evil would be the more energetic particles whizzing about, while "good" is a single stable state.

Of course, Thamiel has taken it one step further and actualized the literal opposite of people's values, so I think the reversed analogy falls apart.

I don't understand how this solves the question of the Cainites.

If anything, having a shitty GM /justifies/ munchkinry.

I don't agree with the Cainites but doesn't the existence of hell make their project more, not less, important? We're given a yardstick for the amount of evil that is already instantiated in the world; frankly, don't their minor human sins pale in comparison?

Omelas looks a lot better if the rest of the world is W40k.

Shit, is that the "compromise with sin"? I mean, I've never understood that quote. Compromise is good. Humans are all about compromise. Not compromising increases, not reduces, evil. And frankly, this hell is not hugely worse than the Babyeaters were. The "sin" metric is similar to, but does not match human evil.

I think this is a critical point. The divine is harmful to humans in both its "pure" form and "evil" form. Being turned into an empty minded shell repeating praises over and over is no more inline with actual human values than being turned into a empty shell of pain and torture. I think Uriel had the right idea in the first place, render the whole mess nonexistent via mathematics. So yeah, forcing the absolutely pure divineity to compromise with absolute evil is the only way to make something habitable to humans

**** Yes? I mean, you get a duration bonus due to the whole "eternal torment" thing, but the Babyeaters are an interstellar empire. And human population only really exploded recently, so Unsong Hell hasn't really had a chance to come into its own yet. (And probably won't have, if it gets abolished somehow in the end, which I can only assume will happen. Which would probably leave the Babyeaters as the greater sum-evil.)

There've been something like 100,000,000,000 humans since the species first began, and even if you cut that down to conform to a history that begins in 4000 BC you're still looking at billions of people being tortured for thousands of years.

They're an interstellar civilization. Since we only have one case I'm gonna assume that they have a population of about seven billion per planet, like us. They're r-type...

#+begin_quote
  "I know," said the Lord Pilot. "A lot of Babyeaters will die at first, but they're killing ten times more children than their whole adult population, every year -"

So if we're looking at a, say, twenty-planets interstellar empire, and a month of digestion, and a five-hundred-year history, even ignoring historic deaths, that that gives you 7 billion (babyeaters/planet)*(10 children/babyeater year)*20 planets*500 years*(1/12 years of suffering) = 58,333,333,333,333 babyeater children years of hell-equivalent.

Also you sort of added an additional 1000 to the number of humans ever, it's only 100,000,000,000 according to [[http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx][here]], which gives you about 100,000,000,000,000 person-years of hell which is only a factor of two off with the Babyeater number.

But each person in Hell suffers for an /eternity/, not just a really really long time. There really does seem to be a time dilation effect. Quote:

  "Or maybe we'll take him up on it, let him torture his mother for two millennia, and then not give him anything in return, just to see his face when he realizes it was all for nothing. Or maybe we'll take him up on it and give him a couple hours reprieve from his tortures -- because why not -- and then back here for another millennium.”
#+end_quote

They talk about millennia as though they're meaningless, just another featureless stretch of time in the eternity to be suffered. For that matter, the person Thamiel is describing was speaking modern English. Given that the apocalypse seems to be more-or-less imminent, it kinda takes the kick out of it if they run out of time midway through the first decade.

***** I'm going to take this question seriously. It was written so that this /matters/.

This is going to be a book about good and evil. How do people react to evil? How do they understand it? Do they tolerate it? Compromise with it? Try to fight it? Curse God for creating it? What if twenty years ago the Messiah called for the greatest crusade in all of history in order to conquer Hell itself, failed, died, and now the world is just sort of limping through the aftermath of that without really ever having processed it? Nobody's noticed it yet, but underneath the facade of puns and stuff this book is /really dark/, and it's going to get way darker.

I don't think I can do any of this without having first established evil as a concrete and horrible presence in this world. It's like Ana said. Without the Broadcast, we'd be tempted to view evil as just a funny divine quirk, like creating the platypus. It's not until evil gets flung at you in the most graphic way possible that you actually start thinking about it in Near Mode. This is why she made Aaron watch the Broadcast, and it's why I'm making you read about the Broadcast, and when I start telling you the story of the Comet King I hope that you remember that everything he does, he does because he lives in /this/ universe and not in the Care Bears universe or something.

But actually, another part of why I wrote this was the opposite of that. I hope that people who think "How can someone possibly live in this universe without freaking out?" has the sense to notice that our own universe has a lot of suffering, and to wonder how anyone can live in /our/ universe without freaking out. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/26/high-energy-ethics/][Extremism in thought experiment is no vice]], and when extreme cases are sufficiently pure and intense, they help us understand principles that we can apply to less extreme cases.

Well, here's your extreme case. Let's see what happens with it.

****** As someone who was waiting for this chapter (or one similar to it), I absolutely agree with everything you said, and don't particularly mourn the fun-and-pun adventure romp the first few chapters indicated Unsong would be, as great as a whole story of that would have been.

If anything, it's a testament to how well you can marry the two types of stories that so many people (far more than I predicted) seem to be so upset with the dark turn in the narrative. In any other moderately dark fiction this kind of chapter is actually fairly tame (we don't know any of the people in Hell, we don't care about them, they're just names and abstract horror made a statistic by the absurd numbers involved both in population and duration of torture). Things like this actually happen to characters we know and love in other stories, and that's when the real tears and gnashing of teeth tends to occur in the majority of the audience. I'll be interested to see if Ana or Erica or Aaron (probably not Aaron what with the POV narration, but who knows) end up dying and going to hell.

In any case, thanks so far for the wonderful story!

****** Evil brought into being by a supervillain who specifically set out to do it for its own sake is something very different from evil that arises as a by-product of thoughtlessness, perverse incentives and impersonal natural laws that are orthogonal to (or at least linearly independent from) any morality. By focusing so much on capital-E Evil, you might have destroyed the applicability of any conclusions drawn about it to the real world.

The suffering of souls in Unsong's Hell seems strikingly /gratuitous/ and /avoidable/ compared to any suffering in the real world. Thamiel doesn't seem to gain anything by it; he already seems to be an incredibly powerful being. Stopping him looks completely hopeless, given that even archangels cannot get rid of him (though Uriel nearly succeeded once by turning him into metaphor; so perhaps part of the solution is "in order to conquer evil, you need to stop personifying it"?). Contrast that with the real world, where evil often cannot be avoided completely; where a person who commits evil acts can be often brought under society's control to an extent, and commits them in order to satisfy some desire; where collective evil arises for example from performing en masse actions that would be otherwise individually justifiable. And where we might think how to redesign society so that perverse incentives don't arise, or so that people's desires can be denied or satisfied in a way that avoids suffering. Meditating on Evil Deeds done by Bad Guys doesn't seem to help much with that.

(For the same reason I don't like superhero stories, save for Watchmen.)

  underneath the facade of puns and stuff this book is really dark, and it's going to get way darker.
#+end_quote

Of course the book is extremely dark, and it amazes me continually that people call it "light hearted" that after reading about:

- an eagle gouging out one of the Pope's eyes
- babies being born with extra eyes
- fetuses forming unspeakable and blood-curdling messages in Morse code
- a copyright enforcement agency that is said to kill people for copyright infringement
- Uriel killing the firstborns in Egypt (and all the other plagues) so they would stop building pyramids
- people's skeletal diseases being randomly reassigned
- great massacres in Siberia
- deadly revolutions in China
- major territories in the South China Sea disappearing
- the collapse of the US into a bunch of states ruled by warlords who crucify their enemies
- an Archangel who is bullied by his brothers and chooses suicide (and the death of all Angels) as a way of stopping Thamiel's victory

This book is very dark pitch black comedy at best, and I wonder why people needed the broadcast chapter to start complaining about darkness. I guess the items above might be seen as distant (far-mode?), while the Broadcast rubs people's suffering in your face (near-mode?), but I'm really really surprised by peoples reactions...

***** Given the rest of the worldbuilding, it makes perfect sense that Hell (which is already confirmed to exist) works like that, and in fact it would be strange if this wasn't the case. Given that it exists, it is hugely important to the characters (and their motivations) and should probably come up at some point. It would be especially important to Ana, who has a PHD in Theodicy.

#+begin_quote
  “You tried to dismiss the problem of evil!” she said. “You tried to just say ‘God does lots of weird stuff', as if this -- ” she gestured at the screen, “was of the same magnitude as the platypus. You want to see why theodicy is a hard problem? Watch!”
#+end_quote

That isn't just being said by Ana to Aaron, it's also a message from Scott to the readers. You can't just dismiss Theodicy within Unsong as being simple or trivial -- that should be clear just from the way it's mentioned as a field of study, but that point is made more visibly here. If you, or anyone in your life, thinks that Hell is real? /You have to engage with the implications of that belief./ And they include Theodicy getting a lot more difficult. (I mean, you should do that for everything you believe, but beliefs involving the eternal torture of yourself and everyone you care about should probably be a priority.)

--------------

As to why it had to be so graphic and detailed?

Personally, I feel that when it comes to concepts like "horrific eternal torture", the imagination fails. (Other concepts that are difficult to imagine include anything with infinity or very /very/ big numbers, something you should all be familiar with.) It's too easy to gloss over. Those three words don't /hit you/ like that 1/3rd of a chapter did. But when it's /horrific eternal torture/, it /should/ hit you. It /should/ have an emotional impact. The idea that Aaron and Ana live in the same universe as /Hell itself/ -- if you care for the characters at all, then becoming a bit (or more than a bit) upset is reasonable. But it's far to easy to overlook over the words, when there's no fuel for your imagination provided with them. It's too easy to miss the implications, to refuse to emotionally engage with it. Well, you don't get that option here. Scott demands that you look, at least at this tiny fragment of it.

People have said (over in the comments on the Unsong page more than here, tbh) that it's sick and wrong and makes them feel ill, etc, but here's the thing: this was /totally predictable/. This is perfectly in line for everything else you've been shown in Unsong! Thamiel has shown up several times, been mentioned even more, the thing about unsong!Singer and his views on Hell was a while back in another interlude. Given all those.... did you realise what that /meant/? Did you figure out that Unsong contained this? If you did, would you have felt ill, been horrified, etc? Because if the detail makes you sick when the idea containing that detail didn't, then that's a kind of bias. By including the detail, Scott got people past that bias and into realising just how horrific Hell truly is.

#+begin_quote
  ... The only reason anyone can deal with it at all is because they never really think about it, they keep it off in their peripheral vision where it never really shows up clearly. It's like how everybody knew Hell existed, but nobody freaked out until they saw the Broadcast.”
#+end_quote

Again, parallels between the general public in-world and the readers. Everyone reading should have known hell existed, but they weren't overly bothered until this chapter, "The Broadcast".

--------------

Plus, I think Scott just liked the idea of a National Geographic Special about Hell.

EDIT: well, the author himself answered it, which makes anything I say pretty irrelevant. I'll leave this comment up anyway, just so you can see what I thought of it at the time.

******** This is a matter of aesthetic preference. Thamiel didn't do anything worse than a Disney villain - came in, made some threats, overwhelming despair, etc. That was my initial impression, and on reread it didn't really change. (It probably doesn't help that the preceding battle is pun-based, which for me sapped the entire confrontation of its seriousness - but I'd thought that was just Unsong being intentionally silly rather than a failure in tone shift.)

For me, the problem is the tonal dissonance, not necessarily the setting of expectations. Unsong wants to have Hell be a big, serious thing that the reader viscerally feels, but it also wants to have a chapter about the kabbalistic implications of "There's a Hole in my Bucket" and make a bunch of whale puns. If I come into future chapters with the mindset of "Hell is literal here" then I'm going to be less inclined to laugh at the jokes, and if I come in looking for jokes, I'm apparently going to get stuff about eternal rape and torture.

Part of my problem might be that I /already/ took Hell seriously in the real world. For quite a long time, I was one of those angry atheist keyboard warriors, and it was always the problem of evil and the existence of Hell that got my blood boiling. There are people who believed in Hell who just ... talked about it casually, like it was this natural thing. There were people who believed that God was going torture people for eternity and /those colossal assholes still fucking worshiped him/. I never believed in Hell, but the fact that other people did and did virtually nothing about it fueled a lot of my anger. Unsong is doing its best to dredge up those feelings, or create them in readers who didn't already have them, while still wanting to spend most of its time being a silly story.

Your post got me thinking so after 5 minutes of introspection I came to that : there's an element of realism to it because nobody's just happy or sad all the time, so I can relate to that, but it's also a fantasy in that it's almost always completely carefree or unabashedly wallowing in misery, and I enjoy both.

I still can actually. God is not good, or if he is "good" in some fundamental semantic kind of way, then he is not "good" in anykind of way corresponding to the human meaning of "good". Theodicy solved.

Funny story, in the process of losing my fundamentalist beliefs, I went through a several months period where I still believed God existed but that the concept of good as defined by God's existence was completely beyond human meanings of "good" or "evil", and that much of God's actions could be described as evil. I think I can understand how the characters in this story just adjust and keep on living their lives.

Also I think I empathize with Ana less in this chapter... sometimes the most logical conclusion is that your premise is wrong. In the case of theodicy, clearly God is not all good, all powerful, or all knowing, or some combination of these three. Since kabbalistic magic has words for the last two, I think the all good is the odd one out. Also, if Thamiel's plan was to manipulate Nixon into distributing the videos, or distribute them himself slowly (and Nixon accidentally messed that up) why does Ana think sharing the video around is a remotely good idea?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Totally agree with you here though. So many fundamentalists fail to actually seriously grok the idea of God torturing people forever. Those that do tend to either leave or make excuse about how hell is really just the absence of God. The few that both internalize the idea and keep believing it... well it puts a lot of fundamentalist actions and words into context, doesn't it?

That having been said, what always confused me was what business such a god would have in creating a universe in the first place- assuming omniscience, you can essentially simulate anything and get the same experience as if you'd actually created it. So what's the value in creating the universe?

Simulating a universe may be equivalent to creating it.

Also, as a kid, before I had quite heard of simulationist views of reality, I wondered if God's omniscience and omnipotence worked by viewing all the possible futures and then picking the one he wanted... and then it occurred to me to wonder if suffering existed and the rapture hadn't happened yet and miracles were uncommon was because this world was one of the futures he wasn't going to pick as real but he wanted to/need to know what happened in it anyway.

I didn't think of it quite that coherently but remembering it with my current reductionist mindset, that is about what I meant.
