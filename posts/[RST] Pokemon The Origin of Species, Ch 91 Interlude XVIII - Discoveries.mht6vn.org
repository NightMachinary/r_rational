The only way to stop all the bad things from happening is for every major faction to have legendaries of their own. MAD will then be in place and they'll keep each other in check, but until the political landscape shifts into that new equilibrium, there'll be trouble with only one faction wielding that incredible power.

I think that's what psychic warlords were back in the day. Close to the same argument could be made against the invention of the Pokéball.\\
Chemical warfare with smogmog, area denial with grimers. Firebombing with Charizards.\\
That hasn't happened, because the people on this world are no less creative, but far more reasonable. Don't think that would change. Thanks to Red's mass proliferation of Abras, you won't have much fun playing tyrant, anyway.

The threat that I see with killing/catching legendaries, is unintended consequences. Their origin is not natural evolution.\\
This implies Eldritch intelligent intent.\\
Waking up Groudon woke up the aquarium fish, this woke up Rayquaza. And those Regi-things.\\
Killing a legendary or catching it, apparently incurs "divine" retribution.

The risk in overthrowing the status quo lies in "What comes next?".\\
There are right and wrong answers, but not obvious ones.

Perhaps you should catch a legendary ASAP, to have a fighting chance of all the ones, that will awaken soon.

Higher capture-rates are replaced in this world by Pokeballs having capacity limits(?) and I believe it was at least implied during the Karen Intermission chapter that an Ultraball could snag a legendary, it's just so insanely, suicidally dangerous that nobody's survived the attempt.

I figured that this was an early design choice and nothing fundamental to the tech at all.\\
Why would it be difficult to condition pokémon for obedience to the trainer but without any regard for humans in general?\\

They're not, though. Blue's Shiftry is the best example we've seen of how the Pokeball conditioning tech isn't a guarantee. Even caught and conditioned that thing was still vicious and specifically called out by Brock's second(?) as a Pokemon which was only barely under control.

Another is the Squirtle/Tortodile injury incident. "When their blood's up" were Blue's words for how they can and do ignore commands to stop in the heat of the moment.

The main thing existing conditioning does is make targeting humans unacceptable. Other than that, a lot of bets are off. A ball that strips away all that instinct and makes them into biological robots is both monstrous and plausibly something someone would want to develop here.

It's just my theory, I could be /way/ off the mark, but it seems to fit with what information we have about the setting and mechanics of things.

Edit: and an obvious point - conditioning != training. The Master Ball might also be intended to imprint sets of commands, conditioned Pokemon still need to be trained properly. This might be designed to bypass that issue.

I don't see how being even more perfect would be considerably more extreme by any standard that values the original mind state of the creature.\\
I can't help but seeing the current conditioning being already extreme, because I'm anchored by real world standards.

Reminds me of Leaf being shocked at Bill's solution of simply copy-pasting an individual species-mind for a whole population to quick-pacify them. It's not that I can't appreciate the technical distinctions, but they aren't too interesting to me.\\

Can't wait to see your take on it.

Also I'm curious how Team Plasma will react. Speaking of Team Plasma, do they know of Leaf's plan for permanently saving humankind from the threat of wild pokemon attacks so that humans will no longer hate/fear pokemon? Do they know her plan requires humans to catch 'em all?

And does /Blue/ know of Leaf's plan? I feel like with his whole #WhatComesNext thing he'd ought to be collabing with her. Giovanni obviously knows Leaf has a plan to permanently end the threat of wild pokemon attacks that doesn't require a FOOMed Mewtwo, even if he doesn't know what it is. And it was Giovanni who gave Blue the idea for #WhatComesNext to begin with. Collabing with Leaf on her project feels like a no-brainer.

Also, Leaf's plan would involve catching /a LOT/ of wild pokemon, which would be a boon for pokemon research including Red's. And the sooner her plan succeeds, the sooner they can convince Giovanni that humankind doesn't need a FOOMed Mewtwo to survive.

Honestly at this point Leaf's plan ought to be the highest priority thing for all the main characters, with the Silph investigation only being the second-highest priority.

** I was actually thinking about the master ball a few chapters ago, and what a 100% catch rate ball would be in this universe. My guess is it has longer range and faster lock-on time, meaning you just have to point and catch - no throwing necessary. The thing is, it seems like that would kind of ruin the story. Sure, maybe it needs rare or expensive materials, but if a company can make one then a country could make dozens. Almost every legendary is caught within a few months, and it just seems like an anticlimax. You could shift to politicking about how you use the caught gods, but it would feel kind of strange tonally.

This made me dismiss the idea. But now it's being brought up, so I'm guessing there's more of an interesting story to tell here than i thought.

**** Could go with the materials required being incredibly rare or even unique. For a far extreme, you say it was made with part of a fossilized legendary, so literally impossible to reproduce.

For a less restrictive route (there will be more, but not soon), could go with it taking decades of research and then Mewtwo erasing it all.

It also seems that Hidden Power isn't understood. I suppose that justifies the name, but it makes me think someone is going to figure out how to get an Unown to fight, possibly as a downstream consequence of Red's Other research. Is Secret Power a move in this setting?

(Unown aren't in Sword/Shield yet, of course, so it's not a huge deal that the move doesn't exist (though it does have implications for the competitive scene), but once they're in the next game I expect it'll be back in the games again)

Could be tweaked further.

I'm imagining something like “But she's happy to cater to his new preferences, and seeing him consider a fresh viewpoint from his friend showed how much he'd grown” (though that sounds awkward even to me)

While it's no longer ambiguous for me, the sticking point is still the implication that this second line sounds as if they are only going meatless when Leaf is joining them for dinner, while the first line implies it as true for all meals even without Leaf. It's now Red's preference, not just Leaf's.

********* Ah ok. That description makes the text make sense, but is not the understanding I would have guessed from any of the text versions (though that might be because I'm confused as to why Red would consider that logical- why is it more okay if she buys it instead of him)

Maybe the first line should indicate more that she is concerned with his reduced meat diet, and views their meals during his visit as an oppurtunity to help him get healthier- but an oppurtunity she is willing to give up to have Leaf along.

My confusion has centered around the exact degree to which Red has reduced his meat consumption (mostly due to Leaf). I'd been interpreting it thus far as him only eating it a few days a week, and now this makes me think he never eats it (when the reality is he eats it if it is served to him)

*** I read after some revisions had already taken place--it's unusual for me to wait any amount of time on the 1st! As a result I noticed things that are a little subtler than usual, though:

1) but I'm definitely going to buy some stronger pokemon to round out my belt with other strong pokemon."

Strong pokemon thing gets a bit repetitive; this could probably end at "my belt."

2) and there are some other pokemon that can naturally use Psychic or Ghost type attacks but not Psychic ones, or vice versa... you've been measuring two different things?"

I think "Psychic or Ghost" here should just be Ghost?

3) "Oh, yes, I'm sorry I've lost all my manners... come in, come in out of the cold..."

"I'm sorry I've lost all my manners" here reads like an apology specifically about having lost his manners, which could be it? But if the sorry is about leaving them out there, and the manners are an explanation, a comma after sorry would probably be preferable.

4) Minoru how did you end up here?

Comma after Minoru.
