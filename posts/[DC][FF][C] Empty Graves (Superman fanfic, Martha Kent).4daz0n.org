** This really puts a different spin on the line, "If a time traveller hasn't gone back in time to stop you, how bad of an idea could it really be?"

** Well that was a pretty unique take on superman's story. Really enjoyed it too. The whole "time travel has consequences on the future but the evidence / memories dissapear" thing doesn't really make much sense, but considering the kind of wacky shit that is par for the course in DC stories, I'll take it.
