** So the Drow are fairly insanely strong. Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat. It was almost as strong, more technically skilled, and had a fairly ridiculous number of abilities displayed in this short fight alone (dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode - all in the space of a few minutes)

But again, Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat and this is fairly insane; Cat is one of the most powerful people on Calernia, and Urulan is just some Drow. The reason Cat picked out the Urulan sigil to fight was that they were the softest target In Great Lotow, which itself is just a random city picked because it was the closest one.

What do the /actual/ powerful figures amongst the Drow look like? Cat said she was heading to great Lotow to "declare war on an entire civilization", but that's looking less and less like a viable plan. And then there's the small matter of killing /Sve/, the Priestess of the Night. What does she look like?

Maybe there was something funky going on - Sve bolstering Urulan or some such - but that raises question on its own.

*** Yeah, Cat views this as a side-quest when it's been pointed out many times that Sve is a monster on a level of the Dead King. She probably predates Callow, owns an entire civilization and the fucking dwarves call her a breathing blasphemy. I'm not sure why Cat believes she can just stroll into her seat of power and kill her.

Cat is definitely in the top tier of power on the continent, she just has the skills of a toddler in comparison to others in her weight class, like the Sve Noc, who I'm pretty sure is probably equal to Cat when it comes to sheer power, but is rediculously more experienced and skilled at it, to the point that her servants that only have a fraction of her power pose a threat to Cat.

**** I'm not sure that changes the threat levels of the powerful Drow though? Cat had the edge in power, but it wasn't an /overwhelming/ difference, meanwhile this random Drow was far superior in terms of skill and had a fairly ridiculously sized bag of tricks to pull from. And it's a nobody among the Drow. We know for a fact that there are stronger individuals in the city, and that there are stronger cities out there.

This Mighty might have beaten Cat if she hadn't fought dirty, Cat who can beat a half dozen junior heroes on her own. A concerning sign when it's the lowest guy on the food chain.

And yes, the hypothetical Cat in ten or twenty or a hundred years would crush this guy - but that's not much help to Cat now.

*** Drow are powerful, but that power is lootable. Every victory adds the entirety of the losers' strength to the winners. Meaning if Cat takes out a bunch of drow half her collective strength, she's now at 1.5 Cats, and can repeat against a sigil that's 0.75 Cats strong. Repeat and it's exponential growth.

Now, under normal circumstances this doesn't work out well because drow are prone to backstabbing, and with good reason. But thanks to Fey contact magic, Cat can have actual loyalty from those she empowers. Which makes her snowballing her way to victory just a matter of time, unless the rest of the drow wise up and go on the offensive against her.

#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure there are concerns about this though.

For one thing, the loyalty from the Drow revolves, as you say, around the oaths Cat had them swear. There are nineteen of them, three greater and sixteen lesser, and it's a pretty safe assumption that Cat's done her utmost to make the ironclad.

But there are issues.

- First off, if all the loyalty centres around the Winter oaths, well, we know what Black has taught us about plans with a single failure point.

- Then there are concerns that letting Cat's Drow loot too much Night could let them break free. Firstly because Night makes Drow more powerful, and there are obvious concerns about leashing monsters more powerful than yourself both practically and narratively. Then there's the fact that the Night comes with knowledge and skill, and with the number of Secrets seemingly floating around (some that can evidently counter Cat's Winter powers), there are risks that the Drow might stumble into something that lets them break or subvert the oaths

- Then there are issues with Akua's involvement in the process, giving the idea of the auction, helping with the ritual and the wording of the oaths, being given the power ups to her second that she requested to better have a hold over the Drow, and potentially forming death squads. The involvement of Cat's traitorous lieutenant, who is smarter and more manipulate than her, does not instil confidence on a narrative or logistical level.

***** the only way you could subvert the fay oath in this case is by regenerating faster then the winter can eat you from the inside, and the problem with that is that it will probably not stop trying to consume you until you're dead, just the pain from this is absurd, but then we get to the 2nd problem, if you must keep the power regenerating you constantly forever do you have enough power to do other things with it? and does it even regenerate it's power fast enough to keep you alive.

​

don't forget winter is endless, night is not, the fact that the oath uses winter without passing through cat first means that oath is about as deadly as one can be.

There's surely got to come a point where the damage done just isn't meaningful anymore, or where the being in question can just crush the sliver inside them.

Or maybe Faerie oaths are conceptually unbeatable beyond anything else we've seen in the series - time will tell.

And there's still the (bigger?) issue with Drow picking up Night: where they might pick up Secrets for getting out of magical contracts.

Or the Akua issue.

******* how dealing with fay goes by normal standard is terrible, it might be beatable simply because Cat set a punishment so if you can overcome the punishment you've effectively "paid" for breaking the oath.

it's having unpaid debts to fay that are super dangerous, since a fay that is owed something can take anything they want from you, or anything of equal value to what they were promised at the very least and what they value and you value are two different things altogether so they can take lots from you since it have low value to them. and this power is pretty hard to dodge if not impossible, and is the main reason you never deal with fay, or if you deal with them you word the deal very carefully.

Fay got almost infinite power, but are bound by very strict ways they may use it, just like genies can't fulfill their own wishes.

however this is just general fay stuff so how much applies to PGtE is up in the air.

I think we've seen more than enough about the PGtE fae to know that they don't have anything like "infinite" power, both from Cat and from the actual faeries. And the trope of faeries being bound by strict rules was met, I think, by how entwined their nature was with that of stories (which was why the Winter King wanted out in the first place).

There are other stories worth pointing too as well, like the chained monster breaking free and killing it's owner, or how Winter always loses.

And again we've already seen Drow tricks beat out Winter magic, including but not limited too Cat's "creationally fixed body" powered by her actual mantle and not just a sliver of Winter.

or you know "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" trying to shirk a deal is trying to eat your cake and have it too, something very few get away with.

just like the chained beast is a story about power play, since you never know when the scales might reverse "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." have existed for a long time.

just like all stories with wishes have bad endings, or at the very least, return to their humble beginnings.

do keep in mind that Cat is running around in creation rather then arcadia, how much power she can use here is very limited, since even if winter is infinite how much Cat can use at any one time is not.

************ One of the first things Cat's Drow try to do is to break the bindings, so I'm not sure how willing they really are. At the very least, I expect that they could swing the circumstances of events into aiding them narrativlely - Cat's fudged bigger stories with less going for her.

And there are still the other stories that could come into play, Winter losing, Akua traitor-ing, single-family failure points fails, and so on.

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Cat ran into a /Drow/ story about how trying to instill cooperation ends badly. We just saw what happened to Black when he ran into a different culture.

#+end_quote

I don't think there's any indication that Cat's winter powers are endless. If you have evidence to the contrary then, please, share but there's none that I'm seeing

In point of fact, Masgeo explicitly calls out Winter and Cat's mantle as being finite:

#+begin_quote
  “The Saint of Swords appears to have, for lack of a better term, cut Winter itself,” Hierophant said....

  “Think of your mantle as a cape. Much like your body itself, it is a fixed object in the eyes of Creation.”....

  “The main difference being that your body is a shape, while your mantle is a pattern of power,” he said. “That power is, of course, finite. Not in the sense that using it spends it, but along the lines that the cape remains a cape -- it does not grow or lessen, as a living thing would.”
#+end_quote

And the oaths were set in place by the mantle.

Not in the sense that using it spends it, but along the lines that the cape remains a cape -- it does not grow or lessen, as a living thing would"

but as he says she can spend an infinite amount of power but just a finite amount at any one time, since her mantle is finite but the power it draws upon is not. since using power while not spending it makes it infinite, it's just that Cats not-infinite blanket can cover at any one time. so as long as the powers of nature work against her she'll never be able to freeze the entire world however long she tries.

ofc the drow try to break the rules, but they willingly bid for it, they bid for power not food, rest or a necessity to live, they were not forced to swear the oaths and that is why the chained beast would not work, especially since cat does not treat them poorly or harass them.

yes winter lose vs summer, unless they triggered another story during the fighting, since as you said fay are story bound, but wielding summer is not something you'll be able to do with night, since it's pretty much as far from that aspect as it can come, and even if they can wield it with night they probably have to get it from somewhere first.

yea drow culture stories were actually a thing i considered and that could be a point in favor of breaking free, since their stories could glorify backstabbing, but for someone to initiate that story they usually have to be named, not that there are not named drow, i'm sure there are, but they have probably been mighty for a long time now already. but it might also be the reverse since they had a sprawling empire and their culture comes from that and and a empire does not grow that big with as much backstabbing as the drow currently do, hence their stories probably glorify their glory days where people did not stab everyone and someone could be just without being harvested for it.

and even if one turns named and breaks free from the oaths she'll have anyone that didn't receive a name still bound.

Akua will probably do something, i guess we'll see what however.

when thinking about it breaking the oath might not be that hard at all, fairy oaths are usually easy to break, but as said you have to pay for breaking them, i can't think of a single story where the breaker goes without repercussions, the closest i've come with that kind of stories are where the payment have been delayed but it have never been completely avoided, and in that story it was because the time to collect the deal was a thing you could influence.

and if it breaks a fay oath then it's not just winter empowers Cat, since she'll have fairy story power on her side, and that is more then just winter, then it's the question if she can use this, being inexperienced as she is but that is another point entirely.

then depending on how it's worded, 160 years in arcadia could be a day here and vice versa, hence they could be free from their debt tomorrow depending on if it's THEIR years or the WORLDS years, that's how you get out of a deal with fay, not by smothering it.

We'll have to see how Cat treats them notably she's not treated Akua or the fae (Sher other chained monsters) particularly well in the past.

Cat is the Named in the story here. It's about what she herself has wandered into.

Yeah, this is cause for concern. Especially when Cat is hearing Akua ask for more control and influence over the Drow, /and then giving it to her/.

#+end_quote

Did I say that? Where?

But there's a question on what that price is, and a concern that for a sufficiently powerful being that price might not be meaningful.

There's also the issue with how the narrative gets framed. Is this a case of a slave willingly binding themself and paying a penalty, or a story where someone makes a pact with a dark power and gets their hand bitten? Those exist too, and serve to warn against meddling with forces you don't understand.

And once more, outside of vauge story stuff, there are the practical, logistical concerns surrounding all of this.

Winter is always a full tank, even if it's just 20 litre, it never need to refuel since it's never used up.

Night we don't know yet.

the chained beast trope builds on 2 things to work, since it's a story about power reversal.

the 1st is that one must be the owner or boss over the other/s where they can't leave (is fullfilled)

the 2nd one is that the "owner" must treat the "pet/s" callously or arbitrary, like killing one of them just to make an example or not listening and blaming the "pet" for her own failings, or the third is activity looking for fault in the pet simply so she can abuse them "fairly" (is not fullfilled)

The finale is that the "owner" is placed under the mercy of the "pet" either in such a way that the "pet" can choose to save the "owner" but chooses not to due to earlier abuse, or is temporary disarmed and devoured by the beast s/he can no longer control.

as I said it's a story about how you should treat any and everyone fairly as they deserve, if you misbehave you're still treated fairly even if she punish you in cruel ways.

the power of stories build on story tropes, the more common the more power they have.

the old and common stories we're usually there to tell moral lessons, or where there to keep children from doing dangerous things, like entering the woods. or explain things they didn't understand.

like don't deal with stuff you don't understand (or know the value off) since you'll be ripped off.

a bird in the hand is better then two in the bush, don't give up what you have for the chance of something better, be content and don't risk it all on a gamble.

all stories about someone being chained is about power reversal, and the one chaining people are always abusive, if it's about a circus owner getting locked in with the tigers or if the sergant falls of the cliffs due to none of his soldiers want to heave him up. Ivah is pretty much the enigma here, since there is actually a trope to pull from here, and that would be if Akua free as an act of love(what kind of love is irrelevant), him he'd have a clear shot on killing her captor or earning Akuas freedom in some other way. but that is a pretty much explicitly good trope, something Diabolist would have real issues working with but could work unless she completed a redemption ark.

Her being nonchalant about the issues she's facing is almost guaranteed to bite her in the ass, but it will not be because people can quench winter with night, if that's even possible since night is a aspect of winter or she'd never have her current title.

if there is any greater power cat is dealing with here it's the dwarves, and that might fuck her over since she know way too little about them, she's not dealing with the drow as a partner, if anything she's a liberator due to the nizi not getting harvested for any slight, however winter being winter have issues filling that role.

There are plenty of either ways to tell that story. You can run it scorpion-and-the-frog style, just for one example, where being nice to yout chained tiger /doesn't change the fact that it's a tiger./

Also, Cat hasn't been unnecessarily cruel to the Drow in the way that she has been to Akua (yet?) but she's not a gentle master either. Step out of line, even slightly, and you die.

And I've already given you other ways of framing it, even outside of the chained beast. If we sat down, we could both cope up with plenty more. Which story will end up being relevant? No idea! I don't think the serial has been particularly clear on how conflicting narratives are resolved.

At no point have I argued for there being some sort of special Night>Winter effect going on.

What I've argued is that greater strength could overpower lesser strength, or that specific knowledge could undo the magical ritual. This seems very consistent with the world we've seen so far winter oaths are unlikely to be more absolute than any other part of the world. Indeed, we just saw something comparable in the very chapter we're discussing.

I've said that the Night potentially can beat Winter /because we've just seen that happen/.

Winter is most definitely not some greater force that encompasses Night. They're related, certainly, but Cat calls the two powers out as being "both kin and foe" to each other. Cat's title reflects that relationship.

Yes, she's dealing with them as a semi-unwilling slave army being kept in line with the threat of death.

Which suggests to me that a different, more fitting story will be executed.

just one last thing about the proverbs and why i used them, there are tons of fables around said proverbs hence they are stories, not all of course, like "you can't eat your cake and have it too" is pretty new so while I'm sure there is a story somewhere out there that fits to that proverb too, there is none that i know of.

anyhow just google pretty much any proverb you know and story and you can see examples of it in old stories and fables.

Seems like a good idea to me.

I'm just going to be pedantic one last time and point out that the cake example has been around since the 14th century, and that most stories revolve around conflicting choices. Also, I don't think the age of a fable /in our world/ is really what matters - it's about the patterns that reoccur within the Guide, and the guide was constructed in response to the modern fantasy genre and the tropes and cliches that we the readers will be familiar with.

But thanks for the discussion! Here's probably a good place to leave it, with a new chapter coming out in a few hours.

#+begin_quote
  Drow did not take oaths, or make them, and so a few of the first dzulu to secure a corpse in the auction had treated their word a little too lightly. Three, to be precise. They'd tried to slay other drow under my banner, or hurt them. Their hideously *twisted and frozen corpses* had been hung from the long metal pole at my side, dangling softly back and forth. I'd not had to lift so much as a finger to see them die. The oaths had seen to that, *the sliver of Winter I'd put inside them devouring their bodies* from the inside the moment they acted in a manner breaking their word. The Night they'd taken was still there, stirring as they dangled.
#+end_quote

So it's definitely more than just destroying their heart or something similar, but still potentially something a Drow with enough power or the right Secret could walk away from (remember, it's only backed up by a "sliver" of Winter).

And that's without a Drow working out how to escape from the magical contract altogether, which sounds like the sort of knowledge that would be floating around somewhere.

I'm not sure whether the Night includes /only/ techniques or whether it also comes with knowledge of how best to apply them, but that's a fuckload of power even in the hands of a less experienced drow.

*** I think the way Cat approached this fight may have exaggerated Might Urulan's effectiveness. For the most part, the Mighty seem to be glass cannons- Urulan's attacks are insanely powerful, but he's got little in the way of defensive powers, and most of them go down pretty easy when she can land an attack. However, since Cat was under the impression she could pretty much roll any Mighty and they had basically no way to permanently hurt her, she's been charging into every engagement with the Mighty and broken their fists with her face.

If she'd, say had Ivah pretend to lead to bait out the sigil-holders strongest Mighty, and then sneak attacked them with overwhelming force, this might have been a much different fight.

**** What do you mean by exaggerating his effectiveness?

If you're doing a general powerscaling, I think Mighty Urulan would have performed much better against anyone who wasn't Cat, with all her crazy healing, cover creating, and battlefield mobility. For most heroes and villains we've seen the fight would have been all but over after the first exchange, and most wouldn't get a half dozen second chances to reset and try again.

If you're talking about against Cat in particular, then yeah I agree that Cat's approach was suboptimal at best. It's been a while since Cat's fights involved her using the creative tactics that marked her earlier fights. That's probably going to have to change soon if Cat wants to get things done.

In terms of the Drow's defensive powers, I want to point out that other than ludicrous levels of skill (which is a better defence than most have available) they've also a fairly good regenerative factor (regrowing fingers in a split second) as well.

***** I mean that the way Cat approached this fight played very much into Urulan's (and Mighty Drow in general, from what we've seen) strengths, and not at all toward its weaknesses. Cat herself was a bad matchup for Urulan, because Cat is a bad matchup for practically anyone, few people have as much raw power at their disposal, but she wasn't approaching it as a serious fight so when it turned out to be one, she was caught flatfooted.

An analogy I was thinking of is that this fight was basically like when you're derping around in an RTS, thinking you have God Mode turned on, and then you find out you don't when the AI wipes out half your dudes. It doesn't necessarily mean the AI is anywhere near as good a player as you are, it just that you didn't realize you were actually playing.

****** Oh definitely.

And if it came down to it Cat had options like her domain.

But I still think this is a crazy-good showing for Mighty Urulan. Being able to compete with Cat and make her fear for her life in a straight fight is one hell of a benchmark, and even if she's limiting herself to stupid muscle-wizard Cat (sort of unfair, I know, but you get the gist)... stupid muscle-wizard Cat is still one of the most dangerous people alive and can eat entire parties of Named for breakfast. Even approaching the fight in a casual manner she shut down a lot of what would otherwise been decisive moves by sheer virtue of being herself.

More immediately, Cat needs to get her act together quick and start playing this proverbial RPG seriously. This is the easiest fight she's going to have in this city, and she's planning on heading to more dangerous cities. She needs to take this as a learning experience and rethink a lot of her strategic and tactical decisions as she moves on to more dangerous fights.

** Possibilities?

- Now that Cat has killed an actual, important sigil holder, one who's probably been a name in the Drow "political" landscape for millennia, the other mighty might be more willing to deal, rather than insist on fighting to the death every time. Doesn't seem entirely likely, but it's possible.
- Cat might have to start slurping up that Night, if the weakest sigil holder in Great Lotow comes this close to creaming her.
- Cat might find a way to convert Night into Winter. On one hand, that could potentially make her Drow army more effective and strengthen their ties to her. On the other hand, that feels like a "sinking deeply into power" move, and those never go well.
- Another "sinking deeply into power" move, I can see Cat eventually discovering Night is just a ripped fae trick, and she can do it, too.
- When Cat kills Sve Noc, she takes the mantle, or employs her soul Akua-style.

Here though, she's earned this night. And she will probably get a lot stronger from all the night collection to come.

The one thing that might change that is that it seems like once you hit a certain level of Night you no longer really gain anything from killing Drow of a certain rank. So she may be able to have the corpses flow down the ranks because her Drow won't have decades or centuries to accumulate Night from low rank Drow. Even then she probably won't be able to extract years of service for them.

He made a big deal about how the Bard, himself and Cat are in this exclusive club. Now we see Night grants possible agelessness and pretty much every power Cat has through Winter to even its weaker members. How is the Queen of Night not also reaching for (or already achieved) godhood? He could have been lying for about a million reasons, but it didnt seem like it.

I also wonder with Cat having Night in her domain, if that will give her an edge with it if she decides to absorb it.
