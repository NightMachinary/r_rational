Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So, my Pathfinder group in the 'party of Kobolds attempts to become legitimate citizens' campaign ([[http://i.imgur.com/Ex8ujQW.png]]) I'm currently running has, almost accidentally, begun the Starfish Singularity. ...Let me explain.

For context, when they first set out from their dead dragon-ruler's lair, they looted an artifact-grade seed from his treasure vaults, and planted it in the center of their town. Over the months, this has grown into a fairly gigantic tree with the ability to take on and blend together the traits of other plants they graft into it (this is kind of a bio-punk sort of world, where mages can extract traits from plants/animals and hybridized them into others over enough generations, leading to uplifted familiar-grade messenger birds, gryphon-mounted strike-force knights/postal workers/tax collectors, and the whole human/elf/dwarf/halfling genetic clusterfuck. This also explains where half the D&D monster manual comes from). To make a long and world-optimizing story short, they immediately went out and found the largest redwood trees they could and combined them with the artifact-tree, resulting in a 5 mile tall living superstructure that led a nearby pseudo-nation of shared-subconscious-linked druids and awakened animals to be split amongst whether such a sacred thing as this world-tree should be shared by all or cleansed of such interlopers as the party.

Now, an insurgency of druids is a terrifying thing when you live amid the roots of a titanic tree - any animal could be about to drop some /fire seed/ IEDs or turn into a swarm of bears - and there was no centralized form of government to negotiate with or fight back against. Not all of the druids were hostile or accepting of those that were, however, and some Bardic Knowledge and Diplomacy on the part of the party got some of those they captured around to their side and figured out that convincing enough of the not-quite-hivemind would pressure the attacks into stopping...

One of the randomly rolled awakened druid animals they captured was a Starfish. OK, I thought, this isn't too implausible, their town is on a river, they have docks and the like. So they persuade the Starfish to go along with their plan.

'We made that pool of healing, right?' Yeah, I say, trepidation growing.

'And if a creature that has natural regeneration was placed in it, it would make sense that it could help speed that up, right?' I can't see any reason it wouldn't, I say, my voice cracking as their plan becomes obvious.

So they start cutting this awakened, consenting, druid-leveled Starfish into pieces in a healing pool, continually, in order to forkstorm the Druidic collective's value system. I love my players, but FML.

This is what forkstorming is: it's an idea from the likes of Eclipse Phase or other settings where you can fork your consciousness (admittedly, I'm pretty sure I made up the term itself, but the strategy is obvious), and you just do it constantly so that you win (be it votes or fights) by sheer, weaponized /demographics/ after outnumbering your opponents 1000 to 1.

Original stories like Mother of Learning had to work to make me care about Zorian and Zach, but when I read a Pokemon fanfic caring about our trainer from Pallet Town is like sliding into a pleasant groove well-worn by the games, anime, and the fanfics prior to this one.

The whole effect is that any inspired person can tap into this groove and make their story satisfying by merit of their plot-writing skills, without needing an assortment of worldbuilding skills to supplement it. It also attracts an already-existing fanbase of people hungry for variations of their beloved canon, so feedback is easier to reach as well.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Lots more discussion this week, but less code.  I'm going to set aside the two or three prototypes that are in various states of disrepair and drill down on the design documents.  I wanted to have them done by the new year, which is still a reasonable goal but not if I'm juggling other things at once.  Got to get the border of the jigsaw puzzle done, so to speak, so I know where we stand, before we start filling in arbitrary spots that might not even fit within the whole thing.

--------------

Spent a lot of time futzing about with a crafting system (which was when I realized the docs should be finished first), which owes a lot to the more abstract tool-property system that [[/u/Nighzmarquls]] is designing for his game.  The basic idea is that the player will eventually be able to craft/research their own pokeballs--rather than always buying the same five or six preset balls, different properties can be prioritized (such as lock speed, weight, damage resistance), limited only by one's engineering skills, materials, and ingenuity.

What I would /like/ is some element of randomized hidden information, similar to the ring/wand/scroll system in Nethack, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit][which I praised in my rational games document for permitting the existence of a metagame within a single player title]].  If a pokeball is made up of, say, ten different components, and on each run through we give them randomized technobabble names and have them affect different stats, would this permit the same amount of Science as Nethack?  Perhaps, but then it raises questions of how the player is able to finely tune a particular component without even knowing its purpose.

There's /something/ there, but for now I'm going to just pencil in “crafting/research system” and worry about the details later.  It's not a /central/ system in the game, but it would be nice to permit the player a bit of customizing freedom.

--------------

A lot of words were typed concerning Ditto's ability to transform.  As it turns out, there are a handful of related potential powers--one of the Legendaries supposedly in canon has the power to force mindswaps between two individuals, and on top of that the Jirachi wish system could be used to transform the player into a pokemon, if they decide to make such an ill-advised course of action.  All together this tells me that we need some sort of engine-supported means of having one creature basically “wear” the body of another.  

(This would be no problem at all if transformations were always /permanent/.  In that case you just copy the stats over and you're done--but if we want to be able to preserve and /revert/ to a “true” form, then it demands we organize our code a certain way).  

As part of the ramifications of this system, all stats are going to have a factor determining how much of that stat resides in the Body and how much of it resides in the Mind.  Height, for instance, is 100/0 Body/Mind, while Defense is 80/20 and Accuracy is 50/50.

--------------

As a tangent to the discussion on transformation, the subject of Mega evolutions again came up (since it can use the system), with about five different major ways of handling it:

1. just like canon, temporary, fleeting, and spammable

2. super boost, wears out the pokemon and they die

3. super boost, puts them in a coma afterwards, need to recup for a couple weeks and are unusable during this period (thanks to [[/u/DaystarEld]])

4. mix of 2 + 3: wears them out and kills them if they don't receive medical attention

5. a permanent 4th evolution

In the end, I think that option 4 has the best mix of options.  Mega evolutions are therefore exposure to a super-evolution stone, basically, which causes the pokemon to mutate to unbelievably high power levels.  This will eventually kill the pokemon in question, with the time frame available being inversely proportional to how much they use their newfound power.  However, players who first obtain a matching super-everstone will have the ability to completely revert the changes, which leaves the pokemon comatose--but alive.

In a nod to the canon lip-service about powerful bond (which they had no problem ignoring, but still), we could also say that mega evolutions permanently subtract some of the rapport that you've built up with your pokemon--so if you try using it on a brand-new pokemon, you'll find yourself with an absolutely uncontrollable beast, but even anything but the strongest of bonds will result in a rampage of some sort.

--------------

Some other miscellaneous conclusions we came to:

- Types will likely come associated with certain stats.  It might surprise you to find that Onix only has 15 DEF, but because of his 50/30/20 Rock/Ground/Normal typing, it ends up getting a bonus, say 200 DEF on top of its completely type-agnostic base stats.  This is a shift, but allows for things like alternate typing and breeding a type in or out of a bloodline, with appropriate effects.

- From the beginning we've followed the Origin of Species governmental division, with Leaders being essentially the military commander of a city with a separate Mayor who leads politically.  We have, however, decided to merge the two, with the understanding that a Leader typically keeps the old cabinet and administration.  This permits the player the ability to take over a town if they so wish, without needing to build in a weaksauce paperwork simulator as a counterpart to being Leader.

- Names of some stats have been shifted around: Initiative is no more; SPD now represents how frequently/effectively a pokemon takes their turn, MOV represents how much movement a pokemon has available, and moves are in general being renamed to Actions or something similar.

**** The easiest solution I could think of for Ditto's stat copy would be to give each unique Pokemon it's own numerical ID (something you'll want anyway) and just copy the Pokemon for a few turns. (or minutes, real time) Alternatively, each Pokemon has a body ID and a mind ID, which make up mental and physical attributes (is that what you were talking about). That allows you to carry certain other stats, like obedience and intelligence, over between possessions/bodies.

** So my mother sent me a link to a video that purports that cell phones are a health risk; specifically that they're causing cancer in people and that big businesses do their best to suppress that sort of research, as cancer is a multi billion dollar industry. I was naturally skeptical of this, as you can justify almost any BS scientific finding with 'Big Brother doesn't want you to know this!!', and have watched the video and am in the process of trying to research some of the things this video claimed.

[[https://youtu.be/wXax0-MTTsk][Here is the link to said video.]]

If any of you rationalists have about half an hour (the video is only ten minutes long but I factored in the remaining twenty for you to think/research the topic) to watch and comment on it, or even just comment on what you already know about the radiation cellphones emit and/or how that radiation contributes to cancer, please do comment and let me know what you think.

As I said, I've begun doing some basic research and will spoiler tag some of my findings to avoid inflicting bias on you or spoiling the video:

1. The video claims brain tumors leaked to cellphone usage are the leading cause of child death in the USA. Some basic research will show you that, while cancer has been the leading cause of child death by disease for quite a while, brain tumor rates have remained steady for DECADES. It's simply that brain tumors haven't really seen much advancement in treatment over the past age, compared to cancers like leukemia. So it's remained higher because other cancer death rates have been lowered.

2. The video, at around 6:10, claims that cellphones are altering human DNA. Several studies on the radiation cellphones emit, being non-ionizing radio waves, have been conducted and the only conclusive effect we've seen of this radiation is the ability to generate heat in tissue. It's why we use these waves in our microwaves.

3. The video, at around 5:40, makes an erroneous claim that Apple instructs iPhone users to carry the phone at least 10 mm from their body. The video fuzzes the other info and highlights ONLY that sentence when he brings it up. I call this an erroneous claim because, while it does indeed say that, the host purposely leaves out the part where it says to carry it at that range to ensure your exposure remains at tested levels. He also leaves out the part where they did tests with the iphone at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation. They did testing at the ranges mandated by regulation, which stipulates they do testing with it both at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation, and 10 mm from your body when carrying. And simply tell you that, if you want exposure consistent with their testing, carry it at that range. The host also makes a comment about how the text here can't be enlarged, as if it's some scheme by Apple to have this text really small, when in fact it's standard text size and perfectly legible, so that you don't read it. That point overall seemed like a blatant attempt to misrepresent facts and fear monger.

4. This isn't really a finding, per se, but the host has a segment at 4:43 where he uses a radiation detector to show the radiation emitted by several common devices, claiming that routers and microwaves emit about 800 microvolts/meter. Tablets emit about 2000 microvolts/meter. And cellphones emit about 40000 microvolts/meter. I have two issues with this. One: While I see the 4 among the numbers on the meter, I can't see the tolerance indicator of the radiation detector. What I mean is, as with volt meters, when you're detecting energies that vary so much, you can set the tolerance of the display to be in different ranges. So that the digital display only needs to hold 3-4 digits at any time. So I have no idea whether that 40,000 claim is true there in the video. And two: I can't seem to find any source for that 40,000 microvolt/meter claim. Googling brings up several websites, that all feel very conspiracy theory-esque, that say cellphones give off that much radiation; but it's all based on that documentary, as far as I can figure out. So I have absolutely NO idea if I can trust that stat.

So these are just some of my basic findings so far. I'd love to hear feedback from you guys :)

TL;DR: Are cellphones cooking our brains and giving us cancer? And are big businesses letting them, so they can keep bringing in the /dinero/? This video makes that claim. But how much of it is actually good science and how much of it is baseless fear mongering? You tell me!

*** Without reading your spoilers or watching your videos- my first thoughts are that since it's so trivially easy to detect ionizing radiation that no grand conspiracy could hide the fact that phones are emitting it. It would instead either have to sabotage all commercial radiation detectors and homemade detector blueprints, or sabotage our very understanding of which types of radiation are harmful to humans.

Since both of those would be among the largest international conspiracies to have ever existed I find it much more likely that some clever engineers found a way to safely use radiation to send information over large distances.

***** It's thoroughly depressing. If these people were half as concerned about /actual/ life-threatening problems (e.g. car accidents, pollution, malaria, diarrhoea, cardiovascular diseases) then they might actually do some real good in the world.

Instead they're doing real harm. I'm struggling to think of a good term for it, but I suppose I'd say they're misappropriating activism.

"Fighting the good fight" feels good, especially if you can cast yourself as the embattled victim who never gives up even againt your overwhelming, faceless opponent. It doesn't really matter from an emotional standpoint whether you're fighting against a tangible issue like HIV or a nonsensical one like vaccines causing autism.

Generally speaking, activism on an individual basis is limited by the availability of three resources: time, willpower, and desire. Faux-activism uses up all three just the same as championing a true cause would, except it has no benefit. It's literally worse than doing nothing, because you can drag other people down with you.

I really dislike this behaviour, to the extent that I'd be tempted to go on a crusade against it if it weren't for the fact that that in itself would be a dire example of a failure of priorities.

** I've been thinking about the concept of a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon][Moral Event Horizon]] and the question that appears to pop up is if there truly exists any action so irredeemably evil that it can't be forgiven no matter how much good one does before or after.

I can't help but think it's exactly the wrong thing to ask. It's not that certain behaviors are so bad that we cannot forgive the villain for it. I'm confident that for every horrific action, there are actions which can 'balance' it out. For example, did you brutally torture and kill one million people? No problem, just save the lives of one billion people. If that's not enough, then just by adding enough zeroes to the number of lives saved, one can be 'forgiven' for any horror.

I have realized that the Moral Event Horizon is in fact a heuristic rather than a commentary on how evil a given action is. If someone commits an evil deed, we can make a guess at how likely the villain will ever do good in the future (or how 'redeemable' he is). If the villain robs a bank but goes out of his way to not harm the hostages, we can probably say that he's not likely to commit genocide. But if he burns down the building a la Joker style, then he's a psychopath who is less likely to ever be a better person.

This comment is meant to discuss how people should approach Moral Event Horizons in fiction. It's not /just/ a statement of how horrible a person is currently, but rather how unlikely the individual in question will do good in the future.

Note that Moral Event Horizons are subjective and very from culture to culture. For example, being a slave-owner centuries ago wouldn't mean you are a psychopath, but nowadays you would be considered one if you tried to keep a slave.

Discussion Question: Is it ever justifiable to cross a Moral Event Horizon if you believe it will lead to more good or for the 'Greater Good'?

I'm of the mind that such actions will have negative effects on the mind and 'damages' a person's own moral compass. Actions change people. No matter the outcome, if someone had ordered a genocide and it worked out to save more people, I still wouldn't trust the person with the same level of authority they previously had.

That last paragraph about losing some of your own sense of what's right/wrong is probably true (or at least, difficult to show that it isn't) as your actions become more normalized, so you should both ensure you can't go farther and probably also take steps to prevent you from getting to make such decisions again.

*** The /Moral Event Horizon/ is not really about morality. It's about the sympathy the audience can feel for a fictional character. When a character crosses that line, there is a chance they may still be "good" but no chance that they will be sympathetic.

If a good character crosses it, they do it expecting to be hated by the other characters.

In real life the issue is more complex. If you are crossing a /Moral Event Horizon/ for the greater good it is more likely that you are wrong about what good is. That would be narratively unsatisfying in fiction (/Unexpected Consequences/ is a total cliche and /Well-Intentioned Extremist/ has been done to death) but Real Life doesn't care.

An example of Moral Event Horizon people worry about in real is an AI lying to its programmers for the Greater Good. Eliezer says AIs should be programmed in a way that "If [I decide that] fooling my programmers is the right thing to do, execute a controlled shutdown [instead of doing the right thing to do]."

*** One interesting direction to take this in fiction is the question of whether the ends justify the means.

For example; you give the example of torturing and killing a million people but then saving a billion. If those are independent actions, then it's trivially better to save the billion /without/ torturing and killing the million.

What happens in the case where you can only save the billion /by/ first torturing and killing the million?

There are a lot of stories that raise this question, where people try to create a utopia by doing terrible things, with varying degrees of success...

I thought Westworld's ideas and twists were all pretty unimaginative and expected given the premise... And then I had a look at [[/r/westworld]] and realized I was just looking at the top of the (meticulously foreshadowed) iceberg. There are twists behind the twists. Lots and lots of details that look like they're just minor continuity goofs or awkward lines have hidden meanings. It's a show you can approach like a puzzle. (Possibly the finale unveils them, IDK yet.)

(You can't approach it like a rationalfic puzzle though. The technology (and [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/01/her-isnt-realistic.html][the state of the world]] considering the existence of that technology) does not stand up to [[http://theferrett.livejournal.com/2084376.html][scrutiny]], so ultimately the mysteries are held together with strings and ductape.)

I am worried that the show is scheduled to last "up to five seasons" if popularity allows. It's not a monster-of-the-week sort of show at all. It's a story that wants to unravel its key mysteries and solve its characters' arcs and then be /done/, whole world goes up in flames. I /really/ don't want it to be dragged on for too long, and especially not for an /unpredictable/ amount of time where progress will be gummed up and new mysteries and new character arcs will be forced in. This would have done well as a single movie. *cough*

After so much praise I was expecting something more, but overall I felt like the show was good for people who weren't familiar with sci-fi rather than sci-fi fans who were already exposed to all the ideas in it. I think the last couple episodes wrapped up most of the problems I had with the show and elevated it beyond what it started out as, but overall it's not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be.

And yeah, the only characters I really cared about were Ford and Bernard, and a little bit of William. The rest weren't particularly interesting to me at all, and some (like the two healers who help the brothel madame) were infuriatingly irrational.

All that said, technically the show was gorgeous. Great acting and visuals and beautiful music. So I get why it's so popular, and overall I'm glad I watched it, since it's just 10 episodes.

The thing that immediately bothered me about the show was how similar the park was to open-world games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption.

There are ways around that, but it really doesn't seem worth it.

Besides that, you should think really seriously about how much space (wordcount wise) you have to devote to each of these many, many characters and concepts you're introducing.
