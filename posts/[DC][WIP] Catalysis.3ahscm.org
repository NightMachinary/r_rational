An AU Fullmetal Alchemist fanfiction where Ed does the impossible and resurrects his mother, but pays a steeper price then he could have predicted.

I wouldn't call it rationalist, per se, but I'd recommend it regardless. it spends a lot of time on exploring the politics and plots of Amestris, and on deconstructing the big picture of the setting: Hohenheim, Father, and Truth.


** I think you forgot to link to the fic. Is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141657/1/Catalysis][this]] what you're talking about?
