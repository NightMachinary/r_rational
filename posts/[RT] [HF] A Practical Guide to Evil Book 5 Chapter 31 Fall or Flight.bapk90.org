** Can someone find the exact wording to Cat's promise to Larat? Seven crowns and one: I'm guess the one has to be her own. Once the oath is fulfilled, the Wild Hunt will be subsumed into the Night? Is that why Larat is so terrified, that he'll lose his freedom once again and be locked into a role like he used to be with Winter?

And it seems like my guess later chapter is right: Cat is going to break the pattern of three by losing to to the Pilgrim, in this case by surrendering, but not before achieving what she needs to achieve. I assume the Narrative will prevent someone as genre-savvy as Pilgrim from mistreating surrendered soldiers, especially for someone whose stated motivation is that he dislikes unnecessary suffering.

I still believe that this is going to turn into a case where all three sides team up against an Arcadia/Hell fusion breach, and that's how Cat and Kairos are going to get leverage in negotiation.

*** To stay in Creation, the Wild Hunt bound themselves to and drew power from Winter. Winter is now merged with Night, and Cat's the High Priestess, so now she has even more power over them than before. I think.

This is her recounting the bargain to the princess of high noon, under a sort of bargain. I am unsure how bound she was to answer truthfully at that point.

*** Hmm a surface run-through might conclude:

- Bet on Vivienne/Army
- Lie to Pilgrim about surrendering
- Hidden Knife being Kairos.

​

Though if we assume she is genuinely trying to break Pilgrim's pattern of 3 trap maybe...

- Knife for Pilgrim. What does he do with a surrendering army when they need all the troops they can get to fight the Dead King? Perhaps the coldly logical 'greatest good' thing is to 'force' conscript them to fight the Dead King. (i.e. what Cat wants anyway)
- Lie to Kairos. She intends to deny him what he wants whatever it is on general principles that Kairos s a nutter.
- Bet on Vivienne/Army. Cat is assuming that Pilgrim is going to separate her from her army and require her abdication as Queen of Callow (as he demanded before) as a condition of her surrender. Thus Vivienne will be in overall command of the Callowans. Perhaps once that is done Cat will ultimately vanish with the Drow.

​

A lot of possibilities really.
