** So this is another story by the same guy who wrote [[https://korridor.rip/650-2/][Game By God: Sludge Preformation]] and I'm mainly posting about this web-serial because of how much people here enjoyed GBG (before we reached the end of it anyway).

Before anyone asks, it's not a sequel to GBG (unless he's lying again (or at least it's not /advertised/ as a sequel)).

So far, the story is a lot more straight forward than GBG ever managed to be even within the first three, very short, chapters so far. I really like it's take on how a tragedy can be so heavily distorted by the media.

Anyway it's about a renowned violinist who is hired to perform for an oddly-themed luxury cruise to nowhere. Having boarded with her attendant, Hallie Nordhoff hopes to see the journey proceed as smoothly as possible. Let's hope we get a more satisfying ending this time (has anyone noticed how much I was disappointed by GBG ending way too soon yet?).

  Note: For practical purposes, this serial is unfinished. At some point in the future I intend on getting back to it, but that's not likely to happen for a very, very long time, so don't wait on it.

*** I suspect the title and story is meant to invoke that impression.

** If you're reading this and somehow still haven't given Game By God a shot, I just wanna say that teddy^{3} is currently creating a webfiction experience like none other I've seen. Even in its incomplete state, I can't recommend catching up on GBG enough - I think time will tell how teddy^{3's} stories will read archivally, but following them chapter-to-chapter has been a blast and Ship Poster is already shaping up to be pretty great.

Most discussion related to Korridor ends up taking place in a dedicated channel on Alexander Wales' Discord server (linked from the Korridor site), and I suspect that's a big part of the reason why these threads and the story's own comments sections end up so sparse. Even if these stories aren't technically rational/rationalist, they're still definitely of interest to users of this sub!

** Just a meta post but why d/o/ we /see/ so much apologetics for not being pure rationalist fiction these days?\\
The trope definer for rationalist fiction, while being beloved of many of us, including myself, is a preachy morality tale, and generally rationalist fiction fails at being either human or fails at realism. ( I'll gladly take counter-examples for re-read/,/s my stack is getting thin. I might make this a top level meta post if it continues to annoy me.)

*** A lot of the apologia is because when people post things which /aren't/ rational fiction, they'll get comments to the effect of "but this isn't actually rational?" or "how is this rational?"

I generally consider those comments (and the apologia meant to head them off) to be appropriate, because this is a subreddit with a defined purpose, and there's a constant threat that it will become nothing more than just "web fiction" or "what [[/r/rational]] likes", which would involve a lot of drift from its original incarnation that might make it a less worthwhile place.

**** Apologies for my bluntness, but if rational_IST and rational exhibit the same complaints; I think you have additional evidence for an existing goal for the community, or you have just outlined your next long term goal; within the limits off filtering/,/ of course. Otherwise I agree with you, on intention, but disagree on the acceptability of it seeming needful.

** Defffffffffinitely misread that title and imagined a story about a rationalist protagonist posting reasonable, well thought out analysis of their world which happens to be chock full of people living by the Rule of Stupid who have a collective norm to try and censor, ban, and mock such content.
