** Can Gaelwyn affect insects?

Panacea made Atlas and she was hostile at worst, ambivalent at best, towards Taylor. What can Taylor+Gaelwyn make to boost his fame?

*** Define insect. Gaelwyn can affect /flesh/, which means muscles and fats, with some secondary control over things that are made of muscles and fats (like veins and arteries). My knowledge of insect morphology/physiology isn't great, but I would think that he'd only be able to affect certain parts of the insect that fall under his domain (namely, not the exoskeleton). So if you want a hulked out cricket, that might work.

As shown in 3.1, Taylor can control larger creatures like crabs, or other things that have shells or exoskeletons, so he could soup up one of those in some way, which might make sense.

The better application is probably altering Taylor directly. Gaelwyn can remove any extra fat and pack on (or tweak) muscles to give someone the Steve Rogers treatment. I'm fairly sure that Panacea /can/ do this, but doesn't for personal/psychological reasons.

(And obviously this is just Opinion of God.)

**** Hm. The classical "flesh" domain of Gaelwyn does pose a problem, until he delves more into modern medical texts and does experiments on phospholipids, actin/myosin, microfilaments, microtubules and cellular transport to see what he can actually affect on a molecular bio level...

And Taylor can affect anything with a "simple mind." Gaelwyn lacks the restriction of affecting minds that Panacea does... and he may be able to distinguish himself from her by healing and rewiring brains which possess a lot of fatty tissue in the form of myelin sheaths for Schwann cells.

**** It's already up, but once I do the next one, I will. If I do anything that requires precise knowledge of medical facts, I'll ask. I've been trying to keep them vague so as to avoid bogging down the wordcount and/or infuriating anyone who knows anything, but Gaelwyn's precise abilities, limits, and the workarounds for such are going to come up at some point.

I think Gaelwyn and Bonesaw would be interesting as well, but that'd be a pretty major thing that'll require a hell of a lot of run-up. Gaelwyn's arc in canon, I noticed, is a lot like Bonesaw's, but stretched out over a lifetime.

***** Hehe, I liked the dig about Atlas. Glad I called it on that one!

Worm!Gaelwyn is surprisingly emotionally mature. He'd be a great "been there, done that" mentor for Bonesaw if she claws her way out of the darkness. While we don't yet have a full sense of Limelight!Gaelwyn, he seems to have... naïveté... and a sad hound-dog tailing his master sort of a feel to him.

****** Hmmm, yeah, take that more as me being bad at voice than a deliberate decision. I guess I didn't want to write a sad, unsure protagonist. I wanted to write a "new world, new leaf" kind of protagonist. I figure the shock to his system, near-BBQ-experience, and sudden new social environment is enough to justify the changes, but it wasn't a conscious decision.

I am not an experienced writer.

******* I disagree -- it's wonderful writing.

Worm!Gaelwyn's been thrust into the role of primary protagonist and knows he needs to step up to fulfill that narrative and get over himself!
