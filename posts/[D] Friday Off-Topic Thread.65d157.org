Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I know I've said this before, but one of the most frustrating, exhausting, awful things in group projects is being the asshole who tells his enthusiastic teammates that no, what they're doing isn't good enough, and no, passing the tests imposed by the university doesn't matter, and stop making excuses for each other and saying you "don't want to show me your work because it's not finished yet" and stop being vague and telling me you "did an analysis" when what you did was write three paragraphs in two weeks.

Seriously. If there's one thing my coding school taught me to hate, it's people congratulating themselves (or me) for shitty, rushed, unprofessional work.

*** My partner for a group project this past semester failed to show up to meetings, failed to provide me necessary information in a timely manner (to the point of giving me crucial information /two days before it was due/), and wrote so poorly that I essentially had to write every stage of the project myself.

A couple of days after everything was finished and turned in, she emailed me in order to demand an explanation as to why I didn't give her an "A" in our peer review report.

*** I dealt with this in college/grad school by either a) doing all the work myself, and tossing their names on it, or b) largely the same as a, but sitting down with them for some private tutoring to bring them up to speed. It depended on how generous I was feeling (the latter was a lot more helpful than the former). Most of the time I got solid partners, though, in that I got to pick them myself.

In a "real world" context, just tell your supervisor your co-worker is slacking (if it is a case of them lazy, and not something more understandable, like a family emergency) and avoid working with them again.

** My depression came back full force this week for no reason.

It's...pretty bad. I kind of don't feel real right now. But it's all going to be ok. This time, I know exactly what is happening to me and why, I know how to deal with it, and I have already taken the steps to start that process.

HPMOR gave me the tools to do that. I recognize now, that anything I say to myself is being directly affected by an artificial mental bias I can't trust, and therefore I can safely disregard the darkness and not spiral into hopeless paralysis. I might not feel real, but I know that feeling is an illusion caused by my brain being stupid.

I've got an appointment to get drugs on Monday morning. Everything is going to be fine.

** Recently I've read Ender's Game for the first time and I really liked the mechanics of combat in space and other themes like orientation in zero-gravity, 3D space and all.

I was wondering if there were out there some realistic simulators for this kind of stuff, but upon searching I've only found regular flight sims, which, well, still operate within gravity so it's not exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for. So, can anyone recommend a realistic spacebattles simulator like that? Or at least a game with elements of one.

Barring that, some related book recommendations also are appreciated.

** I recently read [[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/][an article by 538 dissecting the_donald]], and in it the author uses a tool called "subreddit algebra", which allows you to "quantify how similar in essence one subreddit is to another", as well as remove overlapping subreddits to find what is most similar to that subsection.

Here's the top 5 of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] on it's own.

So without fanfiction, what's left is super STEM leaning. (And HPMOR)

And [[/r/rational][r/rational]] - [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]

And the opposite, without politics/philosophy we're pretty much all fiction. It's impressive how well this tool matches my intuition of the various subsections of the sub. A final note, it's also interesting what you get when you do [[/r/rational][r/rational]] - [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]], since that was pretty much the birthplace of the sub. If you take that out, you get pretty nonsense results of super tiny subs.

You can find the tool [[https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/][here]].

** From the infamous [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ecwl3FTG66jIKA9JRDtmg/videos][SiivaGunner]] (usually stylized as SiIvaGunner, for intentional confusion): An amusing (though somewhat loud) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSLtdYOb5Vw][rendition]] of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8cLqd47jig][sequence]] in /[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG][Super Mario RPG]]/.

As can be gleaned from their comments, SiivaGunner's videos derive a not-insignificant proportion of their allure from obscure in-jokes (e.g., "Surprise! This is 'Mislabeled Remix of the /The Flintstones/ Theme Song #211'! This time, it's remixed with a tune from /Megaman 9/!")--though the music usually /also/ is impressively remixed in its own right--but this video stands on its own particularly well, as long as you get the reference to /Super Mario RPG/.

Recent disappointments include /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087][Seveneves]]/ (three stars--and I didn't even bother to read the last third of the book, so that's probably being generous) and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34497][The Color of Magic]]/ (two stars).

/Seveneves/ in particular served to remind me of something that I've mentioned previously (but I don't feel like digging up a link, so I'll just repeat myself): /No author/ can be trusted to churn out consistently-interesting works.\\
- Stephenson: /Anathem/ (five stars), /Reamde/ (four stars, IIRC), /Seveneves/ (three stars), /Cryptonomicon/ (two stars, IIRC)\\
- Rand: /Atlas Shrugged/ (five stars), /The Fountainhead/ (four stars), /Anthem/ (two stars)\\
- Card: /Ender's Shadow/ (five stars), /Ender's Game/ (four stars), /Xenocide/ (three stars)

A book's summary is /far/ more important than the name of its author.

And how did they bend the rules presented in those manuals? (Is every lane in Paradise City sixteen feet wide, rather than the usual twelve?

I unfortunately don't care /quite/ enough to spend hours scrolling through a story to fix /every single instance/ of singular =they=.

*IIRC, I once got halfway through Chapter 5, but I then became indecisive over which /exact/ changes I wanted to make--and then Notepad++ crashed, losing all my work on that chapter, so I decided to start over entirely, but I didn't really feel up to actually /doing/ it.\\

I've had to do that on two separate occasions for work, mostly because I was coming in behind someone who was incompetent. "Human-readable" was not quite my experience, unless we're being really generous with the term. If you're coming into a project where nothing is named or described (and sometimes without other stuff, depending on language), the amount of work needed to get it /actually/ human-readable is so immense that unless you're only making very minor changes to a morass of code, it's usually not worth it. (Though I'm coming at this as someone who worked on kind of the ass end of software programming - might be different if you're programming microcontrollers or something.)

After all, that's a job for a computer. I recommend scripting in the general case, and this use case of search and replace is provided by pretty much all the editors. Or is it the manual process of editing that's your terminal value here?

This is something I've historically avoided, but recently while posting on a subreddit with a gender ratio probably close to 50/50, I decided to just roll with it. When referring to a specific person of unknown gender, using "he/she" or "(s)he" seems like an invitation to reply with clarification, even if I have no specific interest in knowing, while "they" will usually pass unnoticed. Many years ago I thought that gender-neutral singulars (such as "e" for "he/she" or "em" for "her/him") were cool, but that was before Tumblr existed, so now I find such pronouns somewhat distasteful due to negative associations.
