Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** [[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/][The Great Filter]] does such a great job at explaining the problems with keeping a secret from science that I find it difficult to ignore how easy it is in other fiction. Anything that science can prove to exist will eventually be discovered and preventing that discovery only becomes more difficult over time. Stories like Doctor Who and The Dresden Files only seem to get away with it by deciding humans are just in denial that the extraordinary exists, so mainstream scientists are too biased to study it rationally.

I started binge-watching Fringe lately (think The X-Files meets CSI with Altered States-esque mad science) and it doesn't make much sense how sci-fi tech used by terrorists and criminals are a secret. Presumably the conspiracy they're building up to will justify it, but it still seems like regular scientists should know something about these bizarre phenomena. For some reason only terrorist cells, insane scientists, and one corporation that might work with the military know anything about these world-changing technologies being used to kill people.

TL;DR Even if you can justify the rationale for keeping scientific information a secret, how do you actually go about ensuring discoveries are never revealed? If you say conspiracy, say how a conspiracy could do it.

*** I think the only way you could make it happen is with some sort of mind control/memory wipe and it would have to be more widespread than requiring you to actually seek out the person. It's also worth mentioning that small things are a lot easier to hide. Things like stardust and it's magical kingdom behind an innocent looking fence doesn't take much to keep hidden as compared to Harry potter with maybe 0.001% of the population as wizards.

You'd still need to some sort of conspiracy to keep the village of Wall under wraps, but it would be a lot easier and could probably be done with a conventional conspiracy. Everything works the same unless you go to one particular place on Earth so it just requires keeping people quiet and containing any leaks that do come out. Who's going to believe them anyway?

Having had a quick look over the list, all the discoveries mentioned are either ones that I have no prior knowledge of, or ones that I know (in hindsight) to have been correct (or at least to be currently accepted).

Example: the Doppler effect (described as derided because it ran counter to the then-accepted Luminiferous Aether theory re the propagation of light).

By and large, it seems that /most/ items on that lit were described as ridiculed for running counter to then-current ideas and theories.

Only application I can think of at the moment is stealth: if you hide something ten layers down, and you don't leave any traces in the intermediate universes, it'll be impossible to find even if you can pinpoint it down to the square metre in the base universe.

A big human tendency you need to take into account is spite. If you turn someone into a vampire, even if they know you can kill them by killing their progenitor, they may very well reveal you or work against you out of spite or some strongly held beliefs.

if you turn someone who is very patriotic, and don't keep a close enough eye on them, they might go to enough media outlets and police, present enough evidence, etc. knowing that they're dead as soon as they're found out by vampires, but doing it out of devotion to country.

or someone who is very spiteful gets turned to get control over them reveals the whole masquerade out of spite, etc.

If you only turn self-interested rational sociopaths (so they're only motivated by self-interested)...that's easier in terms of understanding their incentives, but there aren't many sociopaths who are smart enough to be useful and have enough self-control to be useful, since sociopaths are often very impulsive.

*** Assuming we're talking about the military coup at the end of Contratto: first off, taking over the USA alone would be impossible, because other countries would get involved, and easily overwhelm the vampires through sheer numbers and industrial power. Your vampire army needs to take control of (or at least take out) a sizeable portion of the world's militaries, or else they will keep facing foreign countries which aren't sold with the whole "superhuman species declare themselves overlord of the squishy sacks of blood" idea.

Then... it depends on the number of vampires. Physical strength and resistance isn't really a factor in a world of killer drones and armor designs/armor-piercing designs that get outdated faster than summer dress fashions. Unless vampires are immune to anti-tank shells, they're screwed. Even if they are immune to high-caliber weaponry, they're still screwed, actually, because manufacturing wooden rockets probably isn't that hard.

I'd say the vampires' best hope would be to turn a significant number of humans quickly, with as many high-placed converts as possible, and leverage the "if your father dies, you're dust" thing. Even then, lots of new vampires would probably refuse to cooperate, and the vampires would have to exterminate a lot of people before the entire industrial capacity of human kind is no longer capable of sustaining the fight against vampires and the remaining people would lose the will to fight back.

And that's leaving aside strategies like "capture vampires, torture the location of the elders out of them, capture the elders (easy enough, you just have to threaten to nuke their location and their cronies will turn on them), congratulations, the entire vampire population is now in your power".

Twenty. Not just 20 times strength but /20 times speed/.

Vampires can reproduce faster than humans, sprint at 400 m/h, and can have 20 times as much body armor and weaponry before becoming burdened. Say what you will about ground infantry being less useful in modern warfare, but when all your infantry are disposable mobile tanks, I think that changes the game a little.

And that's conventional warfare. Get one vamp in a population center and tell him to go berserk. You think terrorism's scary now? Hah!

Furthermore, it's easy enough to get people invested in radical ideologies already. Build an ideology around a condition that legitimately grants immortality and super strength and toughness... You'll have no end of recruits primed for conversion to loyal ideologues, ready to give their lives for the cause of vampire utopia.

The only real weakness of the vampires is the failure point of the sires. Cutting off the head actually does kill the beast in this case.

If someone comes up and puts the whammy on me and tells me "You're immortal now but if I die, you die, so you have to be my soldier" I am going to immediately begin work on a plan to place them in a steel case at the bottom of the ocean, after which I will go about my business.

***** The increased speed still doesn't matter against militaries that use airplanes and killer drones. I mean, sure, you're as fast as a tank, as resilient as a tank, slightly harder to kill than a tank, and if you carry a cannon at all times you might have the offensive power of a tank (though clearly not the ammo count). So your vampire military will be mostly equivalent to a bunch of tanks who can only move at night. Nowhere near enough to threaten an actual modern military.

Otherwise, they'd be pretty efficient at guerilla and asymetric fighting (can easily sneak in population centers at night and start killing or infecting people), but I don't think they'd be that good at getting converting lots of people. "We are the superior race and will exterminate / reign other all others" doesn't seem like a compelling ideology for someone forcibly converted, who probably still identify as human. Plus, every time you're converting someone, you're giving a potential enemy superpowers, and it's hard to do background checking in the middle of a war where you need armies of convicts.

Nah. You use a disposable middle-sire. If the enemy tries to go vampire, you execute the mid-sires, making their entire efforts in training their own vamps a waste of time.

Also I think you're vastly underestimating the efficacy of radicalization. Again, you forcibly convert nobody. You use the /current/, /proven/ recruitment methods of modern terrorists, and back it up with the fact that tons of people already idolize the idea of vampires.

*** Alright, a few hundred. All the money we need. Big Businesses.

It's not practical to have, say, all senators always be vampires. But you definitely always want some. You also want some of the people with a lot of power in each party. The ones who can influence other well known politicians. And of course, every few decades you need to replace your 'older' politicians with 'new' faces, even if they are all ancient vampires with makeup. But you probably don't need that many vamps. Instead you make a concerted effort to open up politics to influence from your enormous money reserves. Through the sinister, supernatural magic of the current campaign finance system you are able both to extract favours from vanilla mortal politicians and to make sure that people already friendly to your agenda have an easier time running. They don't know about vampires, of course, they just feel that since half a dozen top donors from the Fortune 500 seem to care so much about who is appointed Director of the FBI, there is no point in going against them. There's another election next year, after all.

So through money you get soft power over the legislature. You also get /some/ influence over who they appoint to the executive. That money also goes a long way toward steering nominations for the supreme court - the president got his job with your help, and the Senate can shoot down a Justice every now and then. You won't have all the Justices on the Supreme Court, but you will always have someone on it, maybe even the majority if you put enough money into it and have your politician vamps fight hard enough.

Vampire presidents though are a tough sell. The president has to do lots of ceremonial crap in the daytime. But you can have a few people in his cabinet because you control his party, and probably a few White House staffers too. As with the president, governors also have to do so very many ceremonial appearances, so you aren't going to have those either. However, you can get into the Senate and the House without having been a governor, so that's doable. And you do have so very much money to spread around, and party insiders to give you a boost.

Every now and then a powerful mortal politician will look like a potential threat and or good candidate for conversion. Take them somewhere safe and turn them. Have your vampire psychologists and FBI behavioural analysts observe. See if they seem amenable to joining you. Give them a good deal; accept them as a proper member of the conspiracy and give them wealth and power. If it looks like they might betray you, kill them and make it look natural. Who's to say a 60 year old politician can't have a heart attack? Not a mortal forensic expert, that's who not, because you'll have someone pull strings to make sure nothing unusual is found.

The hardest one is definitely the executive. You can make sure some vamps are appointed as top bosses, sure, but it will be pretty hard for any vamps to rise up organically through most of the departments, unless you want to focus on a few and have many vampires helping each other/sabotaging non-vamps in the battle for promotions.

The path forward seems to me to be "Make more vampires. Slowly take over everything." In some ways that's easier than maintaining the status quo with only a few hundred vamps. Probably focus on law enforcement rather than the lower courts (Though you need /some/ lower level judges so you have a pool of people who can one day sit on the Supreme Court), and agencies like the FBI and CIA and /definitely/ the NSA. Take over businesses. Convert CEOs who seem to be power tripping sociopaths. That's probably the easiest to turn group in the country. Offer them immortality, more wealth and more power. Make vanilla politicians more and more reliant on your money. Control more and more appointments. Build an army. Better yet, take over the US army. Vampire +Nazi+ Patriot armies are a staple of vampire world conquest schemes. Turn diplomats, Americans and foreign ones. Spread the faith. Have scientists. Secretly develop a plan for blocking direct sunlight on a massive scale. Maybe with a few hundred billion dollars and the finest scientists in the country you can deliberately cause the Yellowstone Supervolcano to errupt and shroud the Earth in a volcanic ash cloud that lasts for years, allowing your armies to march openly and destroy all military threats.

You were doing so well, and then you went and wiped out your food source.

Edit: I wonder how long it would take to clone/create a race of brain-dead humans with super bone marrow to provide a constant source of blood. A pint of haemoglobin rich blood averages out to only around 300g of solid matter and slightly more water. That's more than a current human needs in a day, but not /too much/ more. Theoretically I don't see any particular reason why it shouldn't be possible to create enough blood-factories to convert over large percentages of humanity to vampirism, giving them immortality and all those other bonuses. You'd want to keep some natural humans to do daytime stuff and avoid crippling overspecialisation of course.

Now granted, the sire dynamic where if the sire dies they all die would lead to some kind of fucked up situations, but I think it would still be a net improvement.

For example, those child soldiers and sociopaths who you were able to convince to wipe out most of humanity, they're not going away. They're immortal. They're going to stay around until someone kills them, and if you're not quick about it they'll have turned people of their own, so if you do kill them you'll be killing a bunch of innocents as well. But if you keep them around then a populate demagogue might convince them to follow another cause, and they're the core of your military right there.

And that's just one aspect. We're essentially selecting for an elite of people who are willing to literally watch the world burn so long as they can rule the ashes, and these people are going to be in power for all eternity, because they're going to keep people just one or two steps down the sire-line from them on hand and if the people rise against them, they have the threat of just straight up killing all those people with a single blow.

So, for me there is only one world. It's been growing and changing in my head since I was 12, and I'm now 27. Almost nothing remains as it was back then, but the process was very gradual, and for me it's always been one and the same world.

Long ago there was an /evil race of demons/, which the readers don't need to care about because they are all dead now (Yes /really/), but they were once very strong and hell bent on taking over the medievalish human world. The 'Good' Empire (Think Christian Rome) couldn't stand against them, because magic can do some really fucked up shit, and the dominant religion didn't particularly approve of things like messing around with time and space, body horror or lowly /commoners/ using magic. It became painfully clear that the demons were going to win. So. Some real tricksy people got together and decided that if 'Good' couldn't save the species, maybe 'Evil' was worth a shot. There are no actual forces of good and evil in my world, but, you know... Imagine the aliens have wiped out the US and Russia and only Nazi Germany remains to defend the species. So the Bad Guys save the species, annihilate the race of demons, and conquer the world. At this point, they refuse to step down. They feel like they would rather like to /continue/ to rule the world. Only they don't want to share power with the /other/ bad guys. So you get a few more decades of war and endlessly escalating magical research, a few strategic genocides and one or two apocalyptic Wrong Turns... And then a magical superweapon goes too far and obliterates everyone within ten fifteen ranks of the rulers and burns all the cities and towns and villages and lonesome houses and /especially/ schools and libraries to the ground. The humans that survive are the weakest in magic, the least educated. And they rather feel like the whole magical science thing maybe wasn't a good idea. So magic is heavily restricted again, and they try to rebuild civilisation without any of that industrial revolution or magical science stuff. 200 years pass, humans are petty cunts, and then a bunch of escaped slaves wander into the ancient (Well, 200 years old) ruins of Evil Capitol. And that's where book one begins. With people who know nothing of their history and are deeply suspicious of the skull architecture and the manuals and machinery and oh look, the neighbouring kingdoms don't like it that they settled in Evil Capitol, and now they have to learn magic so they can defend themselves and oh look it's making even /more/ kingdoms want to gang up to attack them and now they need to learn even more of the spooky old evil magic and technology and-. Well, I should finish writing book one first. Anyway, the whole series is fairly well mapped out in my head, and I've basically finished one book, but it was the first thing I wrote so it sucked, and now I'm writing a new first book, about the slaves who wander into Evil Capitol , and it's looking promising.

...I can talk about the world forever. Actually writing on the damn book is tricky. Discipline is hard.

Prions would likely play a significant role in the long-term stability of vampire organizations, in that sometimes a vampire would slowly start going completely crazy. Build-up of amyloid plaque, wasting diseases, and other prion-derived ills would be of serious concerns.

You can hand-wave this by giving them a healing factor, but that will change your setting; so, either incorporate prion-related historical disruptions to your world's backstory, or add a healing factor. If the former, a powerful vampire of crucial logistical importance manifesting a malady during the attempted take-over of a human country makes for great conflict.

*** I honestly don't think they could. Physical prowess isn't really relevant in the modern government. Lots of people, including the ones already "in control" of the government, have gobs of money. Fortune 500 companies are the top 500 companies in the US, controlling 6 of them could vary wildly based on what their rank is. Having six in the 400's isn't even on the scale of what you would need to control a government.

Most importantly, control in this case is relationships. If you're friends with all the important people, you have a lot of influence over their decisions. Basically the only way to make these relationships out of nowhere is to give them lots of money. And lots of really rich people are already giving these people lots of money, so you would a heck of a lot of money.

Mind control or compulsion of some sort would make things a lot easier, or a history of existing relationships.

All they would have to do is get control of their progenitors and they would be on exactly the same level as the first set of vampires.

Plus, all it takes is one of them going public and the jig is up. If anything, the one way to get absolutely prevent someone from controlling the common US populace is to tell that populace you're going to do it. The system still works at some level, politicians still have to get people to vote for them. And if everyone thinks vampires = bad, then no politician is going to want to be seen associating with vampires, which makes things a lot harder.

One question, are vampires immortal? At least in the sense of not dying of old age. If so, you could create a secret vampire culture of offering the reward of immortality to accrue political favors. I remember reading at least one book that did something like that. Though they had been doing it for quite some time already. So that's another question, what political and social platform are the vampires starting from? If they are the equivalent of a bunch of chinese businessmen buying six fortune 500 companies and moving to america, that would be hard. But if they are immortal and have already been doing this for the last 200 years, you could make an interesting story out of modern problems they are encountering expanding their political influence.

Terminal goals, in this case, are largely existential. The masquerade can't last forever, not with the expanding internal intelligence agencies and improving technologies. Every decade that passes expands what's required to keep the masquerade going, and that in turn expands the surface area through which the masquerade can be detected. A broken masquerade is (perceived as) an enormous threat to the vampires if it comes without a sizable increase in held power. A second terminal goal is power for the sake of hedonic satisfaction; it feels good to have unconditional power over other people and it feels bad for other people to have power over you.

I agree and disagree with your point about the United States no longer being the United States. The United States with Constitutionally-required blood donations and a Vampire-in-Chief is different from the United States that we currently have. But if pretty much nothing else needs to change -- people still wait in line at the DMV, there's still Superbowl Sunday, a free press, etc. then I don't think that you can go quite so far as calling it "not the United States".

/The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/, one of my WIP, has roughly four (oathkeeping, spirit calling, ritual magic, mentalism) presented to the reader with another three off-screen (eloists, elementalists, binders) for the sequels. This doesn't feel like too much to me, but if you're one of the ~3 people who have read up to the current point, let me know if it is.

/Glimwarden/ currently has two or three magic systems in it, but I'd like there to be more. Here's where you might say "it's all in the execution, stupid", and I ask you for some examples or some theory on what makes for good execution.

Having a single method whereby all is made possible makes one wonder why anybody doesn't pursue it, even if the costs are dire. That's one of the big sources of much silliness in rational fanfics: exposing just how simple it is to access godhood when there's only one, exhaustively documented way.

With a variety of weaker, more complex magics available, there's room for people to explore a variety of unique paths unavailable to us readers.

Theoretically a single magic system could be complex and fiddly enough to rival a real discipline like (for example) chemistry. I also imagine it would be just as hard to use for anything other than the relatively mundane, and just as much hard work for limited reward.

*** If you have multiple systems of magic, they should either be unified under some common metamagic or sufficiently distinct as to not be confusing.

Going from what I remember of TDWoD (up to the chapter where the kids summon the household-object spirit, I think), I'd say they're all distinct enough, with possible hints of some unification (e.g. spirits might arbitrate oaths, watch for rituals, appear when called).

Though if done poorly it could overcomplicate things, I think that defining the interactions of the systems can sometimes give a picture of how they relate.

TWDoD examples: are there any rituals that involve the sacrifice of a spirit? What about sacrificing somebody who has kept an oath for ten years, or who keeps twenty oaths? Can spirits take oaths, or interact with the mental realms? Are there any sacrifices that can take place in a mind? Can you take an oath to improve your mentalism?

In general, I'd say you have too many magic systems when a reader can't recall the overarching details (and specifics, if relevant) of each system when it is referenced. Theoretically there can't be "too many" as long as you provide refreshers when you think they might be necessary (though at some point it might strain credulity with no unifying theory).

*** (It's been a while since I read the story, so if I get anything wrong that's why.)

You can have as many magic systems as you want. They just have to be good.

Do your magic systems play a role in the plot? Do they influence the characters actions? Do readers look at what your magic systems do and say "That's really cool?". Do the interactions between your systems result in fascinating and clever outcomes?

I would say yes to all these questions. Ritual magic forces you to put explicit value on normally taboo subjects like the value of a human life, and this is interesting and develops the characters.

Oathkeeping asks at what point does the price of sweet magical powers become too much to bear, and how much suffering are people willing to endure, and this is interesting and well done.

I'm a sucker for mentalism. I love mind-reading and control, I love cool mental battles, and I just like mentalism. It doesn't bring up the moral or character questions of the previous two magic systems, but that's alright, you've already got two magic systems for dealing with weighty moral and philosophical problems, having a magic system that encourages and allows being clever, and being sneaky, and knowing impossible things, and secretly subverting people's minds, and the horror of discovering your ally is secretly enslaved to your enemy, and having incredibly kick-ass mental fights, means that mentalism earns its keep.

Spirit calling is okay, but the idea just doesn't catch my attention the way the others do. There are no moral or philosophical questions to explore. The power earns one coolness point for the spirits themselves, because glass lions and the like are neat, but otherwise the power doesn't really interact with the characters. It's just a tool for accomplishing things, rather than a catalyst for character growth, or a source of angst/horror/fascination.

Purely as a thought exercise, I'll tell you how I'd make Spirit Calling more interesting. The first change is that I'd make the spirits more inhuman. They'd be deathless creatures with strange, bizarre obsessions, whose bodies exist primarily to reflect and better enable their inhuman preoccupations. The second change is that the more the Spirit Caller calls on their spirits, the more they begin to think and behave and look like the spirits they call most.

This would mean that the spirits weird bodies become relevant, and provide a deeper insight into how the spirit behaves. And also, it would mean that the spirit caller would have to think very carefully about which spirits they choose to call, and it would put an explicit price on using this magic. It would interact with existing magic systems; Mentalists could protect themselves from this mental alteration to some extent, or encourage it. And lastly, I really, really enjoy reading about and brainstorming what profoundly inhuman intellects are like, and I think you might too, so there's that.

The main problem I feel comes with too many systems is when one massively outranks the other, but it seemed like each system presented so far was pretty well balanced, with a fairly equal amount of pros and cons.

As far as execution goes, one of my favorites was in Worm where, as we heard from characters with unique powers, it shaped their worldview, such as [the guy who could switch similar sized items, though I'm blanking on his name].

You make a good point re: powers vs. magic systems. However, the concept still applicable to systems, though more generally and with greater difficulty (see, e.g. the etherealists in /The Aeronaut's Windlass/ by Jim Butcher, whose contact with the spirits makes them a little bit detached from reality, and as they get more advanced, simpler tasks become more difficult for them.)

Also, /The Seven Towers/ had a really great society based on the core concept that everyone traded their shadow for a shadowy-type demon, and everyone had one, and the implications of that and so forth. I realize that's not exactly on topic, but it reflects a system-wide focus.

*** That actually works even better in a superhero setting for explaining [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainDarkMatter][Offscreen Villain Dark Matter]]. Supervillains keep getting more minions just by franchising their criminal enterprise. Even loose cannons like the Joker have a recognizable brand that some other criminals would latch onto and franchise for him. They supply him with what he needs as the face of the brand, and they get to keep the money he would otherwise burn.

*** A 4000 page treatise in which brilliant civil engineer Mario and his cunning and ambitious brother Luigi argue about the economic implications of floating gold coins, occasionally segueing into long, gratuitous discussions of the purpose of the enormous pipe system that covers the entirety of the Mushroom Kingdom. Together, they concoct a scheme to take over the world and make everyone immortal, which hinges on the thermodynamics-violating properties of Super Mushrooms. Princess Toadstool rescues herself.

*** I definitely agree that at a certain point, you start to make the system feel less real. I was working on a magic system a few years ago ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/16elxu/help_break_my_magic_system/][this one]]) and the deeper in I went, the less grounding it felt like it had. I don't necessarily think that this is unique to magic systems, since I feel the same way about real life physics; once it gets to the quantum level, I have no grounding and I get turned around easily.

** If you were to amalgamate a logically consistent TVLand version of our world, what would it be like? What would you leave out and add in?

You have lawyer type show, which mainly involves defensive lawyers. So the court is cogged up with hyper competent defense lawyers.

But at the same time, you have cop drama with lot of violence and hypercompetent policeman and amateurs of every stride.(Think authors, psychic, immortal, anything under the sun.)

So, if you send a criminal case to trial, you would have hypercompetent defense lawyers on one side, and a necessarily hypercompetent prosecutors to ensure that the case remains open and shut.

What about shows XFile and Fringe? I would say the Fringe Division is a successor to the XFile. The masquerade had already been blown, so if you got something very bizarre and strange, you call them in.

*** I recall seeing a hilarious erotica version of this a while back, to the effect of "all men have large penises, all women are able to enthusiastically accommodate them in any hole, no one uses condoms but there are no STDs, everyone is open to trying a new kink and will instantly love it, etc.". It went on for a few pages.

As for TVTropeLand ... it depends on how far you want to push it. If there are protagonists and antagonists but no extras, and the tropes are just the ones used in television:

- School is dominated by extracurricular activities.
- Work is dominated by interpersonal relationships.
- All problems are solved at the last possible second by a brilliant insight.
- Murder is much higher than in reality, but crime in general is low.
- There are far, far more serial killers than in reality.
- Criminals tend to admit to their crimes right away when caught, so there are very few long trials.
- Underdogs sometimes lose, but not when it really matters.
- Physical maturity happens much sooner. Teenagers look like they're in their twenties, while college students look like they're in their thirties.
- Once physically mature, people age much more slowly. A man in his sixties will look often look like he's in his forties.
- Good people tend to be pretty, while bad people tend to be ugly.
- The world is a fantasy kitchen sink, but they're all kept secret from the public and from each other. It's not uncommon for a werewolf, vampire, alien, psychic, witch, and superhero to all be working in the same office, unbeknownst to each other.

Somebody did a story about this, but while it was interesting and fun, it wasn't exactly the approach I would want to use.

It would be a totally serious story, with a focus on how all the various elements of TVLand fit with each other, with culture shock if we want to throw in a few trans-dimensional traveler from an otherwise totally mundane Earth.

*** There are fewer women than men. Women look a lot more like each other than men do, and they must either die young (from all that serial crime) or age less because there are even fewer in the older age brackets.

There is very little overt racism and it is always challenged. On the other hand black people are rarer and more likely to commit crimes, and possibly less likely to form mixed race partnerships.

Homophobia is all but nonexistent. Sexism still exists though.

Some small towns are absolute murder hot spots (Oxford, for instance).

Almost nobody smokes. Especially almost no Americans smoke.

American women have the magic ability to glue the duvet just over their breasts however they move in bed. All men wear underpants in bed.

Twelve step programmes usually work. Few people are overweight, and when they diet that works as well.

There is a disproportionate chance of getting pregnant the first time. An ordinary car door provides adequate cover from a hail of bullets. So does an overturned desk. Nobody ever get hit by stray bullets going through walls.

All encryption is easily broken. Computers are way better than in the real world, but only work for specific geek types.
