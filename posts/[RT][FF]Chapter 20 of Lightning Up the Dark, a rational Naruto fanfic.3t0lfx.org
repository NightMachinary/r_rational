** Wow, is Gaara OP or what? And intelligently crazy. That's bad. I can't imagine how Talk No Jutsu could affect him in this condition, and in a rational world his purposeful murdering disturbs me more than it did in Kishiverse.

A question. What's the difference between Naruto's smarts and Shikamaru's? Their training in childhood? Are they supposed to be equally intelligent here?

Also I love how Orochimaru is legitimately badass, flawless.

Good chapter. I'll grudge every following day until next week.

That makes Shikamaru a better team player, since he can explain to other people what he is thinking. Naruto on the other hand is very good at being creative and thinking fast in the middle of combat.

Shikamaru does have the fact that he was born into a clan of particularly intelligent ninja, who take education and training with appropriate seriousness, going for him. Overall, though, it's best to reserve judgement until you have a fuller picture of his capabilities.

**** Apologies to [[/u/eaglejarl]], but the Kyubey is more terrifying than his Kurama. Although Kurama is pretty damn scary, he seems (/SEEMS/) fairly humanoid. Kyubey has the nightmare of Knightian uncertainty cloaking its goals.

Their Orochimaru are fairly comparable, but that might be because [[/u/Velorien]] hasn't really shown him off yet. Orochimaru is more viscerally terrifying to me than the Defense Professor, but that might be the rapey factor kicking in. Regardless, Gaara is (seems) more terrifying than both Orochimaru because he doesn't even hide his deviant psychology. Orochimaru is probably smarter than Gaara, but it might even be more interesting if Gaara was actually the smartest character so far (besides Kyubey and Shukaku).

/secretly wants Gaara to be major character/

If you're up to naming suggestions, it would be pretty amusing to name the One-Tails "Shikako," from the motivated Nara in Dreaming of Sunshine.

[[/u/Velorien]], you're good at writing characters that scare me, and get me to empathize with despite their obvious status as narrative cannon fodder, goddamn you. [[/u/eaglejarl]], you're good at writing characters who I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY WANT WHILE THEY PRETEND TO WANT SOMETHING ELSE, which is pretty terrifying in its own right. You clearly weren't going for the alien feel, so I'm not actually sure how well you write that, but you do keep me second-guessing almost constantly.

Off the top of my head, they could be planning, analysis, deduction, creativity, manipulation, learning (as in absorbing information or techniques that already exist), empathy, genre savviness, and...I don't know, rationality?

If this is implemented, I'd see Kurama as being planning (doing the tricks with the shuriken and deliberately lying to Naruto to gauge his reactions), and I'd wager that the Shukaku would be analysis (obsessed with seeing new techniques, immediately figured out that the light-wielding ninja would have nothing more to show him). Just a random idea.

Are we sure Gaara's beast is super intelligent too? It looks like Gaara has abnormally huge chakra levels, since he got the tags from the obelisk and was not tired. That's more similar to the tailed beasts of canon than to the alien incubators.

Something along the lines of "You want to see interesting things not just now, but also as far as possible into the future as well, therefore maximise working togetherness and minimise things that make dangerous people want to kill you in order to maximise your lifespan and thus maximise the number of interesting things you see."

Except more eloquently put and padded out a bit. Also, I'm loving the Orochimaru is selling himself as the good guy, or maybe the necessary evil. It's just a better strategy when talking to recruits.

Also, on another note, in that one movie where Naruto goes in the past and meets his dad, I never got why /Naruto's/ memory had to be erased too. I mean, I get it from continuity perspective, can't have Naruto finding out who his parents are in a movie before he does in canon, but like, what was their explanation in-universe? I get Minato and Kakashi's memories needing to be erased, they can't know about the future, but there was no good reason to erase Naruto's memory too. Naruto was just about to return to the future, so how was him knowing about the past going to affect anything lol?

** My only Naruto experience is through rational fanfics so I have no idea about its accuracy, but I'm really liking the portrayal of Shikamaru. He seems like a good candidate for a rational fiction (and apparently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6781426/1/Shikamaru-vs-the-Logical-Fallacies][one already exists]]).

I'm assuming Orochimaru was the one that left the notes, and probably did so for more than just that one team. That lets him establish a perimeter so that his little discussion with Sasuke can go uninterrupted and unobserved without revealing his involvement. Clever, though I do wonder how he found so much dirt on so many genin; he must have been planning this for a long time or has comprehensive intelligence reports.

Gaara is apparently the host of the One-Tailed Beast in canon. That presumably means that he's a serious threat here. His sensory abilities and ninjutsu control imply that Gaara is leveraging that, and the distaste at drinking the blood from the heart suggests that it isn't total control (as does the fact that he isn't murdering everyone).

This might be a state that Naruto could also reach, though I imagine it has some serious drawbacks with respect to free will, morality, etc. Gaara's sand control and perceptiveness would make him another pretty hard counter to the Uzumaki style, so I wouldn't put any money on Naruto solo even with Nine-Tail's cooperation (or at least I wouldn't if he weren't the protagonist).

***** It seems to have problems with its perspective changes. Like Worm, the protagonist is done from a first-person POV, and everyone else through third-person limited. Problems with that choice is that the perspective character still shifts within the chapter, and Shikamaru isn't actually focused on as much as you would think. When Shikamaru is focused on, there is no easy labeling the author can give the reader due to the first-person nature of the shift. You get something that's fairly confusing and feels disjointed, when chapters are supposed to be units.

EDIT: Finishing what's there, it's actually more of a Kakashi-centric fic, as his Kakashi has stolen the fucking show completely. It's amazing.

*** Well, there are two ways of looking at that. In terms of the letter of the T rating, I have certainly stuck within the conditions of "some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes".

In terms of the spirit, I have written nothing that I would not have been prepared to read as a teenager. In addition, it's well-established by the end of the Wave arc that this story features regular risk of violent death, emotional trauma and even Lovecraftian horror, all happening to children, so if anyone is still reading after that, they know what they're letting themselves in for.

I do agree with you on the general point that exposure to kinky sex is vastly less problematic than exposure to intense violence, and wish that our culture didn't place these things exactly the other way round.

**** I think that there is a certain qualitative difference between the usual intense violence and what you've written here in terms of impact on the reader. The "acceptable" violence for teens is usually more about slaughtering enemy mooks or villains, who the audience barely even registers as representing sapient agents. Here you've done a crack job of getting the reader to empathise with Shiina. By the time she was captured, she was firmly in my "she represents a human, I care about what happens to her" mental bucket. The emotional response to subsequent snuff is much stronger than "oh another mook bit the dust, some guts may have fallen out".

Personally, I completely agree with you here. I think 99% of "Mature" content on fanfiction.net doesn't really deserve the label. Certainly, I would have gladly read most of it when I was a teenager and would have enjoyed it even more in those years. Still, by the silly convention of fanfiction.net, the kinky sex goes into M category and I'm pretty sure that this chapter is no more appropriate for teens than smut is.

The original draft was exactly the same in terms of what happened, but shown from a mostly neutral perspective. But the end result came out a bit dry and lifeless, so I decided that it would be better to have the doomed ninja be the viewpoint character, and show what Gaara looks like to normal people.

/Then/ I decided that I didn't want to create a faceless mook just to kill them off, at least not when I had a clear opportunity to avoid it, so I gave Shiina such depth as I could manage in a single scene. So if adding emotional impact to an already-decided death makes it snuff, then fair cop. Otherwise, I don't think the label is accurate.

I am not pointing to the lack of firearms specifically as a problem with the setting. But real-world ninja used cutting-edge technology for their time (in fact, they were among the first in Japan to adopt firearms).

Hmmm, food for thoughts. Are we advanced in every area that we could be advanced in, right now? Because if we aren't, it would be possible for ninja to forget the "tool" component of warfare in favour of personal power.

They could get around this by leveraging the "default" advantages of being a ninja - nigh-superhuman reflexes, hardened bodies, chakra use etc. That would leave them with plenty of potential for weapons that a non-ninja couldn't use, or couldn't use effectively.

As it is, it seems odd that the only standardised ninjutsu are the basic Academy ones (especially given that even those are ridiculously overpowered when used intelligently).

I don't think Genin rebellion is a real concern for village authorities (are you maybe thinking of a different fic?). Genin are the most brainwashed kind of ninja, fresh out of training before real-world experience/disillusionment can take effect. Canon also shows them dying in droves against individual Jōnin-level opponents. Extra techniques are not enough to overcome that barrier, especially if you don't have the experience or chakra levels to use them to their full potential.

#+begin_quote
  And how much overpowered would an intelligent user (like your Naruto) be if they had yet another basic technique?
#+end_quote

That happens anyway, though. It's not like there's a ban on Genin learning new techniques, and in principle a Genin could learn all the techniques they have time and talent for just by asking around. Plenty of people would know basic Genin-level ones to teach them. I'm just proposing that the learning of new techniques could be more guided and standardised, rather than haphazard and self-motivated.

#+begin_quote
  Ninjutsu stack exponentially, not summatorially
#+end_quote

They ought to, but I'm not sure that's really the case except with individual synergies like Kiba's Beastman Clone and Fang techniques. Whenever I think of canon ninjutsu users, it's more a case of them being able to handle more different situations as they learn more ninjutsu, rather than getting a huge boost in specific ones they can already manage. Maybe that's part of what makes Naruto's Multiple Shadow Clone Technique so powerful - it's already applicable to so many different situations.

You're doing that term-shifting thing again. A thing that shoots things could be a bow or a sling, which anyone can use with a minimum of training (though accuracy is another matter - but that's true of any ranged weapon). Narutoverse ninja don't even have those, relying instead on throwing weapons which offer no force multiplier.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Setting aside the fact that Tariki is ridiculously cynical and his words should be taken with a pinch of salt, the hypothetical scenario he's describing is that of lots of Genin surviving long enough to reach Chūnin or Jōnin status. At that point, they are already strong and have a bunch of techniques, irrespective of what they were doing at Genin level. I guess unless you go full-on Tariki and object to teaching Genin ninjutsu just on the grounds that /then they'd survive/...

As for numbers, there are several problems with a straightforward armed coup like you're suggesting. First, there can only be one Kage. Numbers will only make competition for the top seat worse among would-be insurrectionists, and we haven't seen any ninja radical enough to propose a different form of government. In fact, political savvy is not something we see among ninja until we get to the top echelons of authority (who need it as part of their job).

Second, as we see with Sand, a ninja village relies on daimyo support to function. Nothing is going to freak a daimyo out like watching his opposite number getting torn down by the ravenous masses.

Third, internal conflict in a village, especially conflict which ends up getting a bunch of Jōnin killed, is an open invitation to all comers to invade, and people around here don't seem all that shy about that sort of thing (three world wars in eighty years).

Fourth, real-world history suggests that what creates coups isn't a high number of contenders but more a combination of ambition and resourcefulness in the right/wrong people (to simplify the matter). And while power does beget ambition, culturally ninja are brought up to seek personal rather than political power. Besides, in canon Danzō is the only one to want to be Hokage for power reasons - everyone else either treats it as a burden (e.g Tsunade) or as an achievement to be earned (e.g. Naruto).

The Narutoverse /definitely/ has bows.

For one thing, Sasuke's Susaano uses one. For another, we see a flashback episode where Itachi takes Sasuke boar hunting, and Sasuke uses a bow to do so. I also believe that some of Gato's hired thugs used bows.

They have some advantages such as wider spread, more spontaneous use and a higher fire rate, but the only special thing about /ninja/ throws is how accurate they manage to be when throwing several objects at a time. After all, shuriken are in fact blocked all the time, whereas under the right circumstances arrows can punch through plate mail (and the right circumstances mostly involve quality materials and high accuracy, both things ninja have in abundance).

We've also seen Kidōmaru use a bow designed for ninjutsu-enhanced strength (the only Narutoverse archer I can think of). That thing could pierce Neji's absolute defence.

Finally, bows can be used for long-range sniping. Shuriken cannot.

Uchiha. The problem with them was that they had a gamebreaker power that made the common chuunin, maybe even the advanced genin, be on the level of a lot of chuunin, and a, S-rank Uchiha can take down a Hokage. In fact, Shisui could have taken the whole fire country if he had bothered to try.

Now of course this is a little outside of the (common genin + more techniques) area, but can you imagine a militarized nation with a lot of troops with /personal power/? I't like in Nigeria, continuous succession of bloodthirsty dictators, only there it's the kalasnikov.

In the present Kishimoto situation, a juunin can take down one hundred normal genin with ease, but I argue that it's pretty difficult to take down one hundred opponents who can shoot fire at you, erect walls, jet water and electrocute you if you touch the nearly invisible ninja wire that they can thread around you in a second, being in vast numerical advantage.

I think this is pretty much consistent with Naurtoverse power curve. The difference between genin and jōnin is enormous. A hundred genin could probably take care of one jōnin *if* they were perfectly coordinated and managed to saturate the immediate area with hazards. But even then, if you're against someone like Kakashi, he'll see it coming and substitute away, or burrow into the ground. Then emerge somewhere else, charge up one jutsu and wipe out all of your hundred genin in one strike. Someone like Gai wouldn't even slow down. He'll just run around punching everyone hard enough that they explode. Kurenai would cast one jutsu and everyone would fall asleep or go into la-la land or something. Not to mention the fact that a jōnin can disengage and re-engage at will and the genin won't be able to keep up.

There are two ways genin win: either they manage to somehow completely surprise the opponent, or he gets into straight up ninjutsu slugging match and stands there taking fire like a moron. I've always felt that Narutoverse battle-wizards mostly rely on overwhelming firepower and speed. Only the ones who have some special advantages stand around tanking hits, everyone else just dodges. Jōnin would have an overwhelming advantage both in speed and in accurately delivering firepower.

A matter of incentive, surely? Such things would be expensive unless mass-produced, and the people who would use them en masse (i.e. armies) do not fear having their weapons wrested from them in combat. Indeed, anonymous firearms aid illegal traffickers (who have a lot of influence in certain parts of the world).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

See above. Ninja are already capable of preparing gear in advance that does not have a meaningful chakra cost in battle, and in any case I doubt any such weapon could be on the same order of magnitude as the chakra cost of ninjutsu (which are often one-offs that are wasted if they miss).

As mentioned in another comment, there are things like bows which are strictly superior to shuriken in the right context (e.g. sniping, or penetrating an enemy's guard).

On the other hand, schizo tech notwithstanding, the Narutoverse appears to be set in a version of the Sengoku Period, the heyday of the ninja and the time when daimyo ruled, during which most Japanese commoners were illiterate.
