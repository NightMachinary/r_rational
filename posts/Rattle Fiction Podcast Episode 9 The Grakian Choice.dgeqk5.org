[[https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-9-the-grakian-choice][Episode 9]] of the Rattle Fiction podcast is now live!

This episode is a reading of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXcWkV-ce39d4091MEjaOIs691Y9bmGzJeRxzXcxj7Y/edit][The Grakian Choice]] by [[/u/ExiledQuixoticMage]]. The story was submitted as part of the recent Secret Krampus [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d9hc43/winners_of_the_secret_krampus_contest/][story thread]].

The Rattle Fiction podcast can be found on most podcast apps (except iTunes / Apple Podcast for now)...

Have a story you'd like to hear? Let me know, I'm very open to suggestions. I'm leaning towards rational fiction less than 50,000 words right now.

Enjoy!

** Nice! I enjoyed all of the contest entries, but this one was my favorite. Good to see it getting the audiobook treatment.
