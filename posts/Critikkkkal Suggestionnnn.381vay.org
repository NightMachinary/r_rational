Replace the term "magic system" with "power system". Why? Most posted here are highly uninventive, mostly because they cling to concepts like runes, souls, elements, and wizards that are magic's traditional ephemera. Magic as in abilities we don't have in real life is fun to explore; I think distancing that word would free people from limiting connotations.


** You're right, but at the same time, it's a bit of a pedantic taboo. I recommend reading Sanderson's Three Laws of Magic to see a good narrative approach to it.

*** I think the fact that people are clinging to these cliches shows that it's /not/ pedantic.

(As in, using one word vs the other is the difference between thinking "what can I imagine?" and "how can I slightly rejangle these old conceits?" At the very least, it's increasing the abstractness of---stripping the incidental baggage from---our terms, which is good.)

But urging people to scout beyond them is the point here, not eradicating the word magic. Suggesting a term with less baggage is just a means. Personally, I like how "magic" is used in coding: [[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)]].

** surely it depends on the particular story what sort of words you use.
