** this is a good story. i really enjoy it. unfortunately the story seems to ascribe to the stupid idea that good cannot exist without evil or that life cannot exist without death, and it equates immortality with Serenity's "purification" which painted smiles on everybody's souls. even so, it's quite enjoyable and there are not enough of even semi-rational sailor moon fics out there, so I highly encourage you guys to give it a go.

Also a little correction: this story mixes up Sapphire's and Emerald's genders for no reason whatsoever and without the author explicitly making note of it or explaining why they did that. It seems like the author genuinely believes that the character Emerald is male and that the character Sapphire is female in canon, when in fact it's the opposite. In canon Sailor Moon, Emerald is female and Sapphire is male.
