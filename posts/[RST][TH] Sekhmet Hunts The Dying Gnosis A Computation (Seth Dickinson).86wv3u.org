  "A Plant (Whose Name Is Destroyed)."
#+end_quote

That story is a bit silly. It seems like it derives all its power from the freakish unintuitiveness of determinism. But in all the world, there has only ever been determinism and randomness. A correlation with your will is generally called "a power that you have". Its strength depends on the degree to which it is maintained as you "change your mind", which is not a nondeterministic thing but an abstraction on the function of your behavior depending on more recent evidence.

Nobody can get to the future without passing through the present.

It was still very beautiful and very sad, of course.

***** I think the central conflict in that story was less the semantics of whether Hayden "has power," and more how the knowledge that everything would always happen the way Hayden wanted it to affected Naveen's perception of himself and their relationship. So I wouldn't agree that the story derives all its power from determinism being unintuitive.

******* I guess we have to conclude that, for whatever reason, he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's okay with it. That's the only possible way for it to not have happened. I don't think the universe necessarily tends toward what makes Hayden /happiest,/ just what he wants, even if it hurts him.

Edit: Also in retrospect, if he'd wanted Naveen to be okay with it, Naveen would have been. So I guess the problem isn't that he doesn't want to be matched with the right person, it's that he doesn't want someone he's with to accept the subsumation of their will.

The story can claim that all it wants, it still won't be true. This universe only exists because an author claims it, so it's parasitic on ours. A true random universe doesn't look like this, nine point [many, many, /many/ nines] times out of ten. See GAZP vs GLUT, as linked; it's about exactly this scenario. An intelligent character would correctly derive the existence of a literary author far, /far/ before they were reduced to claiming random chance. From the inside and the outside, you can see the shape of probability, and Hayden's power clearly conforms to some regularity. After all, the opposite of that is just that it's random. And depending on the shape of that regularity, his power may or may not be able to be commanded; evidence in the story suggests that it is such that it may. Hence demonstrating as false his assertion that he has no control, any more than everybody else in the story does.

I think we may just fundamentally disagree about how to interpret fiction, then. When I read a story, I accept its premises as long as they're /internally/ consistent. The probability that a universe containing those premises could actually exist doesn't factor into my reading.

The premise of this story is that all things are prewritten and that Hayden always gets what he wants. I accept this premise and from there I conclude that everyone's /wants/ are also prewritten, including Hayden's, and that what's unique about Hayden is that his prewritten experiences always correspond to his prewritten wants. I don't think there is any real-time correspondence between Hayden's mind and the events at all. I would come to a different conclusion if I rejected the premise as you have, but I don't reject it.

I guess I would say that I accept a universe's /existence/ but not its /metanarrative justifications/. Things are as the characters observe them at the time: that is a given. However, descriptive claims made within the text about the nature of its universe are metanarrative, and may simply be a product of the author being confused about probability.

You cannot write a story that tells me outright that the universe depicted therein is truly random, when every fiber of the universe screams of order. (The map exists in the territory; the author's brain is part of the universe...) One side of that plot contradiction has to yield, and I'll pick the metanarrative one every time.

The laws of thought and probability are true no matter what mechanical turns you force on it. If you write a story where the problem of induction is actualized, and a character in this story believes that the sun will come up tomorrow when it /doesn't/, I'll say that does more discredit to the author than the character. It is a /cheat/ to declare random a fictional universe that objectively only exists because of the order in your own. Objectively, it does /not/ exist at random no matter what you claim - you're lying to your readers in a way that exposes the separation of author and fiction as scam.

************************** Ah, sorry.

I'm talking from a perspective of [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/][compatibilism]]; basically asserting that the free-will debate (which espouses a conflict between free will and determinism; claiming that free will requires the retroactive ability to "have done otherwise") is entirely confused, that determinism is not only not at odds with free will but the only thing that allows us to have will in the first place, and that ultimately the exertion of will is not some act of /changing/ the universe (the "mutable" view) but a fact of the matter as to why the universe turns out to be the way it ultimately does, deterministically, turn out. Basically positing will as computable and computed via physics, such as while all the future of the world is already inherent in its causal beginnings, this fact does not diminish but rather enable our will.

From the compatibilist view, the fact that all the events in the universe are already written does not pose any hindrance to human will, but merely shifts the question towards the challenge of understanding the mechanism or system by which it is written. This then points towards [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference][Solomonoff induction]] as the mechanism that determines the thing that is "proper" for an agent to believe; the truth of the world to the degree to which a thinking being can reasonably be expected to discern it. (You may tell relativity from the statics of a bent blade of grass, but you cannot tell relativity from a black image. Belief is a function of input.)

Note that Solomonoff induction is near perfectly equivalent to the mechanism by which you would predict the next bit of a sequence given all the previous bits and infinite time: ie., perfect compression assuming underlying regularity and no preconceptions.

As such, when Seth Dickinson feeds me a world which looks superficially like ours, in which events mostly happen for systematic reasons, and then tells me that /the events in this world are preordained; they reveal no greater structure/, he's either lying to me about the world or about his mechanism of discovering it. (It, of course, being cribbed from our own highly deterministic and compressible world.) The theory that this universe is from the inside perfectly random, has a prior probability of 1 to [the number of possible perfectly random configurations of particles and fields]; the theory that this universe is from the /outside/ perfectly random has a prior probability of 1 to [the number of possible stories of this length describing random worlds]. Both of those are very small. A perfectly intelligent character in Seth's story would deduce the existence of Seth via complete simulation of our universe /long/ before they arrived at the part of theory-space where truly random worlds live. And if there /is/ some structure that predicts, ie. compresses, this list of pre-written events, then the fact that they are pre-written is irrelevant to the question of whether we may exploit it. After all, to the extent that it is compressed by this structure, it would just be pre-written that we would exploit it, as humans do.

If the correlation is such that Hayden gets what he wants but all attempts to exploit this by others fail, then that itself is a mechanistic fact that reveals details about the implementer of this correlation. (Namely, the sort of spite that points at a sentient.)

*************************** OK, I still don't think I'm understanding.

First, I don't understand what it means for the exertion of will to be "a fact of the matter as to why the universe turns out to be the way it does." It seems like you might be saying that exercising free will just means understanding why things are happening. Is that correct?

Second, I don't understand how knowing the rules by which the universe was generated is exploitable, when the universe already /has/ been generated. (Or at best, in this scenario, decompressed--I take the story at its word that it all came into existence at once, rather than being computed linearly from an initial state.) You're in page 50 of a book on a shelf, you realize you're in a book, you comprehend the structure of the book sufficiently to predict exactly what will happen next...okay, now what? The rest of the pages are already there.

(I don't think we're even using the same definition of "exploit," because you've already said that exercising free will doesn't mean changing anything, and my idea of exploiting something definitely means using it to effect change.)

Your position that the author is "lying" about the characteristics of a fictional universe he created also doesn't make sense to me, but that again I think just shows we have incompatible perspectives on literary analysis.

I don't think there's anything in the story that would be inconsistent with an outside sentient having created the universe or even just having rearranged it to fulfill Hayden's wants (Gary Stu fanfic?), but surely "Hayden doesn't want anyone to successfully exploit this mechanism" is also a viable explanation.

#+end_quote

No; rather /understanding/ free will is equivalent to understanding why things are happening. Exercising free will is a question of, in the /inside view/, choosing one of a series of previously relatively evenly ranked actions to take in response to consideration. From the /outside view/, it's one taken in a way responsive to whatever lever you currently care about socially reinforcing. The point is that all these attributes are psychological, not mechanistic: a free choice and an unfree choice run on the exact same physics.

#+begin_quote
  Second, I don't understand how knowing the rules by which the universe was generated is exploitable, when the universe already has been generated.
#+end_quote

Right, and there's the key of it - if the universe that has been generated is compressible by human will, then "the free decision of what to do next" is a legitimate abstraction over the /function that has already been computed to generate it/. You're looking at a snapshot and saying "obviously you cannot change this snapshot", but the decision isn't the sort of thing that can /change/ the snapshot, it's the sort of thing that /explains why the snapshot looks the way it does/. The psychology of the humans embedded in the snapshot predicts the subsequent frames. We can exploit the power because "humans exploit the regularity" is an abstraction that /compresses/ the mathematical regularity of the frozen immutable state of the events that were always going to happen the same way. The computation and resulting behavior that are free will from the inside, are merely a part of the regularity from the outside.

#+begin_quote
  surely "Hayden doesn't want anyone to successfully exploit this mechanism" is also a viable explanation.

Right but "X happens, then Y happens, except when you try to deliberately exploit X in which case Y doesn't happen" is /much/ less parsimonious than "X happens, then Y happens". And "X happens, then Y happens" is exploitable via deliberately making X happen.

******* After reading, dropping in to write down my own disjointed thoughts.

'all things have been written'. Hayden is as much a puppet in the writer's play as anyone else, have things happen to and around him without his permission. 'Everything I need happens', not anything he specifically wants or does not want to happen, and also not necessarily according to his own values, but according to what the writer wants to happen to him (his perception of the writer's motivation being what the writer feels needs to happen to him)... the motivations of the writer are the area of interest, what the writer accomplishes in designing the universe-seed such that this happens. There's also the question of Enshagag's background mythology, how that meshes with all of humanity, what happened to the others 'gods'.

The Cthulhu Mythos comes to mind--the end feels important, revelatory. It's not that Hayden can't be happy with a subsumed will, because he's been in many other relationships, which didn't go as far, didn't run into the same issue. He wants to tell Naveen secrets about the universe, things which aren't revealed in the story. The more time they spend together, the more him telling Naveen those things becomes inevitable... he feels that /knowledge/ would make Naveen unhappy, he doesn't want to make Naveen unhappy, the drives to share (and to let Naveen know what Naveen wants to know) and to keep Naveen in ignorant bliss are in conflict. There's also the question of if the writer has its own motivations, not wanting certain knowledge to be widespread. Maybe the knowledge itself happens to be about the writer, its motivations, the god/human meshing, what the whole thing is about... ('Actually, you're a fictional character in a short story about me, and the story is about to end', except that's probably going too far out of the contextspace, which includes the 'Laws are terrible things' impression.)

...if imagining it as in fact locked to 'maximum happiness'... but then why wouldn't every partner be like his earlier partners, partners who were happy together with him (and then moved on/died) without there being enough of a bond to want to share things with them... also why wouldn't his first partner be perfect and also live forever with him, enjoying the same benefits. Writer-related/-relationship perks. Sadness at times of death? If what he needs (from the writer's perspective)... and possibly Naveen is just a necessary tempering, for him to flirt with revelation to others until he can finally let himself do it one day and become more truly happy than holding all the horribleness to himself, even though he doesn't want to share it and make others have to bear the burden with him...

If that universe does have an 'end of eternity', I wonder how Hayden dies, or if not-dying has something to do with the writer's intentions (/the secret knowledge about the universe that Hayden doesn't share with Naveen).

I think living with a set of facts pre-written by an author may be a cosmic horror, but it is not intrinsically unknowable in the way that the story asks us to believe. It would make narrative and cosmological sense, of course, and Hayden can simply be wrong about how it works.

Of course, it would make the point that "this is the only decision I know is independent" delightfully hollow. Maybe our author's into hurt/comfort?

** This story is an old favorite of mine. As far as I can tell, it's been a few years since it was last posted; hopefully this will be a chance for new folks to discover it!

Edit: Someone asked for a blurb but the comment is gone. I'll provide it anyway. The story is an extended allegory about the eternal war between natural selection and cognition as mechanisms of change, which plays out across the backdrop of humanity's struggle to bring about the Singularity and defeat entropy.

** Wait, so I'm going to see if I understand this correctly.

Essentially the universe is stuck in a loop, always resetting when Sekhmet eats Set. And this is because once Sekhmet eats Set and returns to a point earlier in the beginning of the timeline, Set is reborn from her the moment 'Thought' comes into existence once more, with the evolution of the antecessor apes.

And each time, if I'm getting this right, Set gets a little stronger. He grows a bit bigger, the difference between the two of them getting smaller and smaller. And this is good, because the ultimate goal of life is the creation of the trans-humans that could arise from the reconciliation between cognition and natural selection.

And so in the end, when Sekhmet turns to run, is it because the cycle has been repeated so much that Set has finally become strong enough to hunt Sekhmet? If Sekhmet hunts and absorbs Set, the universe simply ends in enthropy; so I'm guessing if Set manages to catch and absorb Sekhmet, the way forward will be clear?

*** I think it's something like that! It's not /entirely/ clear to me, but I think the idea is that humanity reconciled the two algorithms by making Set-strategies the most fit. Sekhmet is now forced to reward the "strength" that will defeat her. I think the ultimate goal is not necessarily the creation of the transhumans, but the transhumans succeeding at preventing heat death. But I'm not 100% sure, I find the ending kind of hard to interpret.

My headcanon is that the allegory is playing out in a massive simulation being run by Coeus and the other transhumans, hence the iterations, but I don't think there's anything definitive on that point in the text.

**** Well, but like ... this is kind of self-aggrandizing isn't it? Cooperation isn't random. Altruism isn't random. Those things have always and ever merely been greater interpretations of Sekhmet. We don't think the Good is Good for no reason, we think the Good is Good because it's pro-social, and pro-social wins.

If there is such a thing as Set, we have not yet given birth to him, and his birth, when it comes, will not be a defeat but a fulfilment of Sekhmet.

***** I think it's because Sekhmet and Set aren't meant to be defined by their outcomes, but by their methods. As far as I can say the story isn't actually about Evolution, but about Change. Sekhmet is meant to represent all the change caused by natural, emergent processes, like evolution or how the stars formed, and Set is meant to represent the change caused by cognition and thought.

And in the end Sekhmet usually wins and eats Set because all the thinking beings in the universe couldn't figure out a way to stop the natural heat death of the universe. If they ever did, that would be a triumph of cognition over the other vector of change, and Set would win.

Sekhmet and Set don't represent evolution or survival of the fittest, but two different methods of change and creation; emergence vs. design.

***** IIRC the problem Sekhmet presents to the transhumans in the story is basically that of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]]

*** I think this is mostly spot-on, but for the very end: "Behold Set..."

I took that to mean that the Sekhmet who speaks with Coeus /becomes/ Set for the next iteration. She says that Set was born from her own flesh, a corruption of her paradigm--which is exactly what a Sekhmet who starts believing in something besides raw strength would be. So Sekhmet, who is the only deity for 99% of the universe's timeline, births and becomes Set, and then chases herself until she meets Coeus and the cycle moves forward.
