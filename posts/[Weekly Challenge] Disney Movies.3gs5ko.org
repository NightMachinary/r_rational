   :END:
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3fxp28/weekly_challenge_clones_clones_and_clones/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Clones, Clones, and Clones". [[/u/eniteris]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3fxp28/weekly_challenge_clones_clones_and_clones/ctsxkb0]["Spur"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/eniteris]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's prompt is slightly different from the usual; instead of a trope or genre, we'll be doing a specific canon of work. The theme is "Disney Movies". Pick you favorite Disney movie and write the rational version of it! (Depending on the response, we might have more of these in the future; if you have a canon you really think would work well for a challenge, add it to the list.) Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 19th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]], and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week's prompt is "Science Is Bad". We're all familiar with [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/][Caveman Science Fiction]]; this is your chance to do it /right/. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad][See the entry on TvTropes]]. Your challenge is to do this in a way that won't be cringe inducing for people in this subreddit. Yes, you can also use this opportunity to do "Engineering Is Bad" instead.

*Next week's thread will go up on 8/19.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

Forgot to mention it's 1,586 words.

Now that the competition's over, I'm posting the [[http://pastebin.com/Nyd09Kyg][notes]] (spoiler warning). A lot of them I've already summarised in spoilers in comments below. Note that most of them are just world-building for my own purposes, not meant to be gleaned from the story.

Also, very clever title.

I think it's rather remarkable that all the submissions so far have been for different movies. Quite an appreciable coincidence!

*** You did a very good job conveying the tone and feeling of the setting, with Djinn and Zion. Though your usage of both Agrabah and Arabia made me scramble for the Disney geography Wikia. :)

** Making the Best of a Good Situation

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/16mSYmQIyuBzRqoUKOowx3S7NfnG1NotK1bqGWVesE6c/edit?usp=sharing]]

I meant to post earlier, but I wanted to make it as good as I could in the time I allotted myself. It's still a little unpolished, but it's my first attempt at writing fiction. All feedback is appreciated.
