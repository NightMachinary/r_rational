** Lol at this graph:

Look at the error bars! Also, look how the level of the blue column isn't even the mean of the data.

*** Do you see a /teeeeeeny tiny/ little dash between the box 'Better Performance' and the blue column around 0,10%? That's the actual end of the error bar. They just don't know how to display error bars in a clear manner, but the blue column /does/ have smaller error bars than the gray column and a proper mean.

**** Hmmm, you're right, I guess the upper part is supposed to be pointing to the actual bar.

But even taking that into account, their own data shows that there's no statistically significant difference between using this thing and not using it, so I wouldn't get your hopes up

** Looks like a typical pseudoscience scam to me, especially with the overuse of "frequencies" with no context, "scientifically confirmed" thrown around, and overall style.

Could someone link the two studies it's claiming "confirm" it? I couldn't find any citations.

Edit: In hindsight I'm pretty sure this is a sarcastic post, in which case you got me good

*** You are basically right, but I kinda messed up the joke by sounding too serious in my comment that I deleted.
