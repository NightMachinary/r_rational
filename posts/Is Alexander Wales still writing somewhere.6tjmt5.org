** Writing yes, publishing, not so much. Glimwarden will start updating again once I've written to the end of the first book and not before; that might be a while. I've written a novel and novella in that time, but won't be publishing those unless it's traditional publishing. I did write about 80K words of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ in the last year, linked to in this thread.

(I have also posted a few things to this subreddit under pseudonym, especially to the weekly challenge, but those are of somewhat lesser quality because I use them as writing exercises and don't do much editing, so I don't want to link them to this account.)

Have you read +Last+ /[[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][Dark Wizard Of Donkerk]]/?

  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w9prq/the_dark_wizard_of_donkerk_alexander_wales_rthfc/deb8lpl/][As fair warning]], this is /super/ rough. It was written Nov 2014, Nov 2015, and Nov-Dec 2016, at a pace of roughly 2,000 words per day throughout (edit: that math doesn't work out). There was never any beta reading, nor any editing beyond what I did in the course of rereading sections, so there are whole chapters there that have only had a single pass through my brain at high speed.

*** I can highly recommend this. It didn't read as particularly unpolished to me either.

*** I hadn't realised this was completed! Just finished reading; I find myself thinking that, given there have been spirit-callers before, the most important thing a spirit-caller should be doing is to arrange communication devices that allow others to communicate like spirit-callers can. Maybe not permanent in the longest term, but they would only have to remain in use until near when the next spirit-caller was born (a self-duplication-on-command function would help), but otherwise everyone would be back in the same place within three generations, all items/wards/prices intractable again. Even items that would imitate specific communication signals would be helpful, such as a very specific oathkeeper-related one...

(That aside, at the end somehow I kept thinking of the ending boss fight of BioShock. *amusement*)
