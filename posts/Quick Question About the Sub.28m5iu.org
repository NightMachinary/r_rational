** I think that for me, it's because I see so many wasted inventions and plots. The set up for the /Terminator/ movies is that there are killer robots and a human resistance fighting a timelike war with each other, and the movies explore such a vanishingly small fraction of the possibilities inherent in the premise that I can't help but start thinking about what I would do if I were in charge of the franchise. The same goes for a dozen other movies, comic books, and novels.

Fanfic is also a lot easier to come by. Because it can't be sold, it's free and online. As far as a subreddit goes, it's easier to link to something that you can instantly dive into than a book that takes money and effort to acquire.

I also think fanfic takes a lot less effort. Most of the characterization and world-building is already done for you; it's easy to write with someone else's characters and use the details of their setting, but it's much harder to build something new from the ground up. (At least, that's been my personal experience - others might disagree.)

Oh, definitely this. Half of the heavy lifting is already done for you when working with an established universe, and it lets you spend that much more time on the plot and deconstruction / rationality / munchkinry / etc. I think that's the main appeal of fanfic for rational writers.

** Mostly because this subreddit exists almost solely due to HPMOR.

We like to read fanfiction, and recommending fanfiction isn't surprising after that, especially if it has characteristics that we like. Similarly, there isn't a whole lot of rational published work that hasn't already been discussed to death.

** Comprehending, mastering and dominating a world you invented is the literary equivalent of a straw man argument. Comprehending, mastering and dominating a world someone else invented is proof of smart.

*** I wouldn't phrase it exactly that way, but I agree that this is the primary reason for rationalist /fanfiction/. A character who masters a world you invented to be masterable, or finds flaws in a world you designed to be flawed, can potentially possess a kind of "cheating" or "easy" feel. The morals of American prisons are no better than the morals of Azkaban; if there are no Dementors there it's because American politicians have no Dementors to use, not because they're better people than the Wizengamot; and American prisons are worse in ways that Rowling couldn't have imitated without breaking her reader's suspension of disbelief, at least the wizarding world isn't imprisoning marijuana users that we ever saw. But even so if Azkaban were a feature of a world of my own invention, someone might ask whether Harry's reaction to it, or the fact that other people in magical Britain seem not to notice it as a moral horror (just like Americans don't notice the moral horror! Rowling was not being unrealistic!) would rest on wobbly floors. They might accuse me of having constructed an absurd parody for political purposes, where Rowling is not as easily subject to this charge. There are stories you can tell in fanfiction, in /someone else's universe/ which readers nonetheless aren't pre-blinded to the way they're blinded to the opportunities and horrors of real life, which you can't easily tell in any other mode of literature.

******* Seems rational to me, actually. Why wouldn't it be difficult or distracting to tell whether an author is setting up a deliberate straw target, and why wouldn't it be a cleaner reading experience if you didn't have to wonder?

***** Maybe something like "Suspension of Disbelief Bias" or "World Consistency Bias". In the second case, where they would claim that the world was created as a straw-man, perhaps "Moral Interpretation Bias."

***** I don't think it's a bias, so much as it's a standard technique: point out that the reader has already made a particular error. "Reader, you think you are moral and would object to Azkaban... but you already have accepted the real-world Azkabans." It's the same as the example of hindsight bias in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/]] - it's not necessarily hindsight or status quo bias in any particular example, the reversal just demonstrates a particular bias in that particular example.

** It's easy to post fanfic because you're not demanding that people spend $25 to enjoy a book with you. Several people also write the stuff.

Actually, we /should/ have a thread where we discuss books that actually required real purchase.

** Working within an established world, you can skimp on part where you have to create yourself a universe to work with, and hope that your readers' imaginations fill in the gaps with what they know from canon.

Then you add the 'rational' bit and it's illuminatingly obvious what difference it made, because that's the delta from the original work.
