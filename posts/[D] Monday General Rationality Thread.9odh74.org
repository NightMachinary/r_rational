Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I am disturbed by how much more accurate my predictions have become since I started working from the hypothesis that a majority of the people I interact with are literally non-sapient.

Stupid, petty office dramas, previously baffling to me, suddenly make sense if the participants literally have no theory of mind and cannot imagine that other people have different knowledge and different experience. Operational failures that should never have happened now make sense if the responsible party was just an automated thing with zero reasoning ability that was knocked off its script. I've seen bizarrely repetitive, non-interactive story-trading behavior that is, for the first time, understandable when I recognize it as a memoryless markov chain with a large chunk size. My previous hypothesis ("stupid people are still people") failed to predict me being told a story for the fifth time, then immediately being told the story of that story being told to someone else, including a complete retelling of the first story. I've been surprised a lot less often now.

Or maybe I'm just grumpy because being locked in a room with random people for eight hours is a creative form of psychological torture.

**** I am being /slightly/ facetious. My prediction record mostly takes the form of the number of days in a month that I find myself ranting about having to fix something so simple, so well documented, so I-saw-you-understand-this-last-week that I completely failed to imagine what could possibly have happened while my back was turned. I'm down from three to one! This is mostly about me deciding to stop predicting that certain things can't happen, and dramatically increasing the rate at which I expect to see errors that humans shouldn't make, to better match my observations.

Though I do make a few specific advance predictions. They mostly take the form of guessing which branch of the dialog tree the NPC is going to recite in response to something that happens. This should ideally have a /near-zero/ success rate for people with meaningful internal experiences who don't suffer from trauma or intrusive thoughts or something similar. The fact that I can remember guessing right five times isn't something I would have expected. I don't think I should be able to guess more than general themes - getting sentence-level predictions correct, ever, for more than just a few common jokes or particular phrases or simple concepts, is unsettling. My model of another complex person shouldn't be that good. And if someone has regular intrusive thoughts about "I once knew a guy who the computer didn't like, as demonstrated by this one particular incident that I will recite in full", then... well, that's kind of sad too.

So, basically, I'm complaining that I have to deal with idiots and talkative boring people. I'm also indirectly asking for advice on dealing with talkative boring people. My current strategy is "Give up," but that doesn't seem optimal.

My general strategy is "draw strong boundaries, but act as if nothing ever upsets you".

Basically, if someone is about to tell you a story you already know, tell them "Is this the story about how X did Y? Oh yeah, I heard it. Good one." Then change the subject if possible. The trick is to be fluid enough to push the conversation in one direction, without looking like you're impatient with your interlocutor.

***** That's called small talk, people do it because they feel awkward if there's more than one person in a room and they aren't talking.

​

It's normal, it doesn't reflect low intelligence.

Sometimes it's just boredom. Most people are boring, the bar for what they find entertaining is low, just watch some television and you'll see how boring that is.

​

Another way of calling what they are doing is: Being Friendly.

​

The way you deal with them depends on what you want.

If you want to be liked you give them the silly replies you know they'll like i.e: Really?! No Way! He actually did that?! God has a plan. etc... Just agree with what they say in general and repeat what they said with different words.

If you just want to get them to stop talking and don't care about being liked, just give 1 word or less low enthusiasm replies i.e: hmm. smile without showing teeth*. nod*. cool. yep. sure. mhm. etc...

​

You should try to understand them instead of just being annoyed by them. It not only makes it bearable it is also helpful.

​

PS. It's your responsibility to let them know you already heard the story, you complain they don't have theory of mind, but at the same time act as if you didn't..

​

Edit* you don't need to be as blunt as some of the comments suggest, most people are socially aware enough to understand when somebody doesn't want to talk. Not only is being blunt very rude, it's also very uncalibrated, like threatening to hurt somebody for using your stapler, it turns you into the asshole instead of just not interested.

****** I typically do give low engagement, 1-or-fewer word replies and polite-but-unenthusiastic smiles. As a general policy, I try to avoid being actively rude, and being reasonably approachable actually is a part of my job. Despite my private and internal bitching, I can just deal with it.

Understanding people is unlikely to make this more bearable. The root of my frustration isn't actually any individual person; When I made these comments I was in a foul mood because I was peopled out and open-plan offices are very well optimized for turning introverts into misanthropes.

While I don't stand by everything said by 16-Oct!Anakiri, I will defend myself a little bit, since you did call me out. I agree that it is generally the listener's responsibility to keep track of what they have and haven't heard, and communicate that fact. But I don't think that holds when the time between retellings is literally fifteen seconds. That speaks to a level of inattentive autopilot babbling that actually was unthinkable to me until I observed it. Which probably is due to the typical mind fallacy, yes; I was aware that many (most?) people can automate smalltalk, but I dramatically underestimated how automated it could possibly be.

******* I remember a discussion on slatestarcodex about "what universal human experiences are you missing without realising". This.

I can automate the delivery of my message (word choice), but I can't steer a conversation without thinking. I didn't realise that people could actually do that until you told me just now.

That possibly explains why I like to talk about "deep" topics all the time but others don't; I am not optimised for small talk which others find easy

******** In fairness, I suspect this was a small-talk master who, for whatever reason, was unusally inattentive at the time. I don't /think/ that most humans have social autopilot that good.

But then, I can barely automate word choice, so I wouldn't know any better than you.

I would say, though, that all of the other commenters were completely correct to scold me. Just because someone finds it easy and desirable to spew vapid nonsense, doesn't mean they can't enjoy talking about "deep" topics if they care to, or if they're prompted.

******* Now that you've explained it further I agree with your assessment. I said that because that's what I could infer from the information that was available.

But yes if it's an open office and somebody just told a story and less than 10 min later somebody else that was present repeats it, then it's indeed that persons fault and it's reasonable for you to be annoyed at them.

Consider that maybe you're not interacting with the “full version” of the “complex person” in front of you, but rather one of their autopilot modes that's a construct made of habits and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM][laziness.]] How much it differs from the “full version” is another question.

Depends on the power dynamics. +Try to politely ask them to have irrelevant conversations with you less often.+ This one doesn't work, AFAIK. Or ignore whatever they are saying. On an autopilot mode, there is a chance they won't even notice that you're not listening to them. If you can't make your brain keep them filtered out, try wearing headphones when in their presence (if it's allowed) with some instrumental or classical music playlist.

This is only true if the person to whom you are talking is actually putting meaningful mental CPU time into the conversation, as opposed to running the mouth on auto-pilot while letting the majority of the brain dwell on other things.

If you want to consistently get people out of auto-pilot conversation mode, you'd need to find some way to regularly get them off-script. (Note that some people may resent being forced off-script, because they /want/ to spend time thinking about their grocery shopping or that really good-looking <person of desired gender> from Finance...)

** Is it strictly right to classify purely theoretical physicists as scientists?

My understanding of science: The collection of observations and the creation and testing of models to learn about and predict our universe with our best confidence.

My understanding of theoretical physicists is that they are more like mathematicians, taking axioms (our observations) and looking for patterns and relationship to produce equations (models). They certainly /contribute/ heavily to science, but so do mathematicians and philosophers.

Is there a better definition of science that differentiates between mathematicians and theoretical physicists other than just saying that physicists /intend/ to produce maths for the sake of science, because I don't see that as a qualitative difference.

Am I wrong in saying that? Is there something else that I am missing?

*** I like to think that theoretical physics involves considering results from experiments that experimental physicists have interpreted, and produces hypotheses that could eventually be tested. Mathematics does that too to some extent but I think much of it has become highly abstracted from concrete physical roots.

*** 'Science', the word, isn't just a verb people do, it's also a noun for a community people can be a part of. The really short proof that theoretical physicists are scientists is that they're part of the science community.

That is, if you look at who they talk to at work, who they cite and are cited by, which conferences they attend, which journals publish them, an experimental particle physicist is closer to a theoretical particle physicist than they are to a biophysicist.

Anyhow, theorists contribute to science (now using a third definition as the publicly replicable advancement of human knowledge about the world) a whole lot more than philosophers - if one made this quantitative, there's probably a pretty clean classification boundary.
