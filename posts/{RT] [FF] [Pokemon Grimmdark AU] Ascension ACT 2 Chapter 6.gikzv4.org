*Summary:* Red had always loved dragons. He wanted them. He dreamed of them. He desperately awaited the day he'd get a charmander, something that would one day reign as a mighty charizard. Unfortunately Red ends up with something quite different. Something cute. Something... cuddly. In a world where size is power and innocence is weakness, it will take all of Red's power to survive.

*Note 1:* This AU incorporates characters from the game-verse as well as the anime-verse

** I really enjoy your work! One note, I think there might be a mistake, Oak says that Red doesn't speak a single word, but Brock hears Red give Mawile an order.

*** Typo thread? Typo thread!

Brock calls for a 2 hour intermission but Oak decides at the end the battle is about to start after 1 hour has passed.

*** No. Chapters can take varying amounts of time to write. For example, the end of Act 1 took over two months. It's not really plausible to do that. Also, that makes it feel too much like a job if you know what I mean. Still, we do try to get out a couple of chapters every month, across all of our fiction.
