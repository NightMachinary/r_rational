*** Probably autocorrect for 'shinobi'... does the author read this sub?

** I'm now severely confused. Are these new chapters in some sort of alternate universe from the first few? There are all these weird inconsistencies that make no sense otherwise.

*** FanFicBias decided to try writing a few chapters of a rational Shikamaru in the regular canon setting of Naruto, hence the first three chapters. I assume that FanFicBias liked what he wrote and chose to leave up those chapters while he restarted all over again on chapter four. Think of chapters 1-3 as a proof of concept with all later chapters as the actual project.
