Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** What's the right biome for a place with dry, mild summers and wet, cold winters?

In an area with eastward prevailing winds, I have, going east to west, ocean, temperate rainforest, mountains big enough to act as a rain shadow, and my problem region. Think Washington State, with the problem being in Yakima. For the last thousand plus years, the problem region has been under a magical effect that enforces heavy snowfall during the winter. This means total yearly precipitation is much higher than it should be, but it's seasonal, and all snow. I don't know any real-world analogues - I'd appreciate those or other guidance.

*** A low mountain pass or valley would probably do the trick. In summer, moist air would rise along the nearby slope, the water would condense and then the raindrops would fall on the slope, leaving the valley dry. However, in winter, the same would happen except that snowflakes would be more easily carried by the wind further up the slope, over the peak, and then down into the valley. Any snow which settles on the peak would also tend to eventually get blown off the peak into the valley.

For a real-world model, I found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood,_California][Kirkwood, California]] (and the nearby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_Mountain_Resort][Kirkwood Mountain Resort]] which sees an average of 39.4 feet of snow per year). To quote Wikipedia:

  Kirkwood has a dry-summer subarctic climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification: Dsc). Summertime is very mild, with little precipitation, while winter is very wet and cold.

**** Great reasoning! Thanks!

Pictures of the area show pine trees and desert grasses, which is a pretty unfamiliar mix to me. If I didn't see it myself I'd have thought it was an overly-literal attempt to answer the problem. Nice terrain for a wilderness D&D adventure though.
