** Someone needs to write "Rules for Actual Despots" to get some best-practices going. Most of these only really make sense if you know you're an Evil Overlord in a specific genre.

For example, there are plenty of reasons to torture someone in my inner sanctum instead of an anonymous hotel room miles outside my borders. My inner sanctum is logically the most well-defended place in my kingdom, while an anonymous hotel room is merely security through obscurity.

And yeah, most of the time there probably /is/ just one thing I want to know before I kill someone. The words don't have any mystical powers, unless I'm within a piece of genre fiction. If I knew I was in a piece of genre fiction, I probably wouldn't be an Evil Overlord, given their mortality rates.

*** Besides which, it all depends how /awesome/ you are. A sufficiently entertaining Evil Overlord can calmly explain The Plan to a rioting crowd of civilians and then have it all go through flawlessly.

Also: anonymous hotel rooms? Inner sanctums? Join the modern age and build some regional police stations already!

And one additional tip, for everyone here specifically: I will drag myself off the internet - tearing myself painfully away from the sweet, sweet competence porn - and actually go conquer the world.

*** If I knew I was in a piece of genre fiction, I would shoot for being the harmless running gag. They're the ones most likely to survive (through sequels and fanfics as well).

** Most of these are great, but...

30, 31 and especially 98 are, well, as Topher said in /Dollhouse/: "I said classic sci-fi errors, now you're just attacking good storytelling." I mean, seriously, these have nothing to do with the evil overlord's schemes.

Poor choice of images for #059, since Decima knew full well that Samaritan wouldn't take orders from humans, and that's exactly why they built it.
