Not sure if this is the right place to do this, but me and a friend often have weird little thought experiments, and last night we got on the topic of slowing time powers. Really cool and powerful if they function right, but what if they don't?

I proposed that his power is: Your body and perceptions are drastically sped up, to the point where 1 second in real time is 1 hour to you. Fortunately, you are also rendered ageless. Unfortunately, you can't turn this power off. You are forever stuck existing at this speed.

Now, we typically put things in so that you don't just die from existing, or it'd be pretty boring. So your power effects physics enough that nothing crazy happens there. No spontaneous combustion from moving, no mach punches accidentally shattering your limbs. I'm not sure if such classifications are possible in the real world, mind you.

So basically the question is this:

Can you survive without going mad? Is there a productive and "heroic" thing you can use this power for?


** Assuming that we handwave away things like inability to move, and say that somehow your caloric needs are the same (which is to say, real time, rather than you-time) so basically you just have 3600 hours of free time for every hour that passes in real life, and you don't need to eat, sleep, etc during that time, then we have a start.

This will also ignore issues like being able to open/close doors, and so on. We will not ignore issues of computers, though. Computer use will basically be impossible, and you'll be much better off walking to libraries, or doing original research yourself, than using computers for most things.

The first thing you'll need to do is look up things like abacus and mechanical calculators that are hand-operated. Slide rulers would be good. We're assuming your aura of "this object starts operating by my physics rather than realtime physics" extends to things you're touching (which is reasonable because you need to be able to move your clothes and open doors and stuff without causing instant plasma and fusion). So we start experimenting and looking for the largest objects you can interact with and "pull" into your physics.

We'll do things to track time within our physics, too. A mechanical watch kept pressed against the skin, perhaps.

If we can get a mechanical typewriter working, that's great. With an abacus, a slide ruler, a mechanical calculator (if it works) and a mechanical typewriter, we're ready to get started living. First off, although the internet is right out, there's tons of reading to do. Take all the time you never had to read and learn literature, physics, philosophy, life sciences, and history. Go and see the sights. Do what you want.

Take time and read more. Get the equivalent of bachelor's degree level knowledge in all the fields you can think of, and go further in as many as you can. Become the impossible modern polymath. Learn to read and write in all the major languages, and ancient ones, too.

Read encyclopedias and textbooks. Learn indexing. Learn library science and paper organization methods.

Begin your career. Write. Write fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and art. Write science. Write your experiences.

Index everything carefully and present it well. Tables of contents, careful bookbinding, summary papers, documents, and even summary books will be important. If you want, start by translating texts and documents between Mandarin and English. Or just go where your mind takes you. Write a dozen books, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, write until everything has been said, and then some. Carefully catalog everything and make summaries. Make the diligent indexing nature of your work, the process, and the orderliness itself part of your nature. Know that when you lose your mind, you will lose it to order, not chaos. Decree that when you do imperceptibly go over to the madness, you preserve your early works.

Let your insanity be the insanity of right angles and catalog cards and preservation, rather than destruction.

All this learning, all this writing, it's the work of an entire life, more than entire life. You'll be an expert in every subject matter, and have written more than any human ever has. The task before you, the total cataloging and synthesis of humankind's knowledge, is monumental. None would dare even begin to try it alone, armed with only mechanical tools. This doesn't bother you, though.

You have all the time in the world.

If you set that up with a very fast-polling gaming mouse and a fast computer running a lightweight linux (hopefully you already have one, otherwise it's probably faster to steal one) you could make something happen. one keystroke per 4 seconds, or 15 keystrokes per minute, would let you program, but you'd still be very slow.

I'd be willing to bet that you could get to a 'normal' response speed by throwing enough money at the computer, though it would look like something from a past era. Custom-built keyboard and mouse. Lightweight/realtime custom Linux distro. 240Hz monitor for color, and a custom CRT for real-time-to-you monochrome terminal interface. With care and a good deal of money, I'm confident you could get about a 1995 computer (with better software etc) at 3,600 times normal speed.

******** Easier said than done, since designing and building chips probably involves a ton of testing and waiting for chemical reactions to happen or something.

More importantly the max rate of 1,000 Hz is based off of the max polling rate of the USB standard. You'd need to find a standard port that polls faster. Thunderbolt might, or maybe you could find a mouse that somehow plugs directly into a PCIe slot or comes with its own custom expansion card that does the same.

Older motherboards used to have Serial or Parallel ports on their backpanels, which might have a faster polling rate.

********** i think "wiring it directly into the computer" is probably beyond the scope of my knowledge, but from what I know, making it so inputs interact well and quickly with the computer is a question of a bunch of different standards and architectures interacting and is fairly complicated. It's possible polling faster than 1000Hz is trivial using current standards and the lack of literature mostly has to do with the fact that nobody currently chars (heh) about typing that quickly.

I'm sure this is possible, just expect it to be a ton of work and expect to spend a ton of time reading sheets on i/o standards

In any case, point is that actual computer speed isn't the issue, it's things like bus speed for certain things (or I guess i/o speed for the hdd if you're using that instead of an ssd) or polling rate for peripherals and monitors that's the problem

**** A laptop might be workable, but there's the matter of power requirements. How often are you going to need to change the battery? How many batteries and chargers are you going to need charging continuously in slow-time to keep your fast-time laptop going? Or would you transfer power via specialized hardware (laser system with safety cutouts etc)? What will the power draw be for that location? What will the cost of electricity be?

Comms... /should/ be feasible. If you were only writing plain text, and were a reasonably experienced typist (as you would most likely become), you'd be punching out maybe 5Kbps on the keyboard, 15-20Mbps slow-side. The problem is when your laptop comms chips are running 3600x as fast as the receiving corresponding chips outside the effect. You'd either need custom "slow" hardware plugged into the laptop, or you'd have to do all your communication via something like USB drive - upload your writing, plug it into a port on another machine, move until that machine is out of your effect. Assuming USB3.1 drives at 10Gbps, and assuming you can get half that rate as a transfer speed, the drive could still upload in slow-time a couple hundred times as fast as you could type in fast-time. That's plenty of wiggle room for adding in things which aren't just plain text.

In fact, your major bottleneck would be your internet speed. If you could set up a server which handled the store-and-forward aspects, and had Google Fiber speeds (~1Gbps), that would translate to you /effectively/ having at least a few hundred kilobit. Old ISDN speeds, more or less, and of course the lag for anything would be dozens of minutes to hours, but it would still be a viable communication channel, even if not exactly a real-time one from your perspective.

You could send and receive email, even if it took subjective years for people to respond. You could browse websites (probably with images switched off, a lot of filters active, and by massive prefetching and cache stuffing on the slow side, but it'd be /possible/), although you'd probably have to give up things like noodling idly through Imgur. Non-image-based subreddits should still be workable-if-slow in text mode, for instance. And you could preload all links in image-heavy subs and come back in a day or three.

You might never be able to communicate in person face to face with anyone ever again, but you could write, you could send and receive photos, and you might even be able to do the same with short videos if you were patient. Even so, it'd be like living in a frozen solitary confinement jail cell the size of the planet. I imagine you'd be able to temporarily pull small animals into the area effect (hopefully without damage going in or out), so you'd at least get to pet kittens and puppies if you wanted, but would the effect be large enough to encompass an entire additional human being?

*** Computer use could be extremely viable. Simply steal "ie: walk in and take and then leave" a few dozen computers. Set them all up in a single room whee they can all be used at once. You could read a huge number of things online by utilizing multiple machines to do the lookups asynchronously. Most sites load in ~0.5 seconds on a modern machine. That's a 30 minute wait. Also, scrolling via pageup/down would take at most a minute or two. Slower than most people are used to, but within a reasonably speed.

Also, you could emulate a much older machine and play older games that way. Some of them can run at tens of thousands of frames per second. You may have to write your own controller software for a keyboard that uses capacitance changes to trigger keypresses though.

** I had a guy like that in a superhero setting that never really got off the ground. His super-speed just sort of got stuck, and the physics of it was such that it just seemed like everything was moving really slowly.

So yeah, assuming that you can still interact with the world in a meaningful way, then you're golden. My guy set up special computer monitors for himself so that he could view them without the refresh rate making it unintelligible, and of course there are lots of books to read. He used tape recorders to leave messages for people, and special equipment to speed up speech to the level that he could actually hear it. His ability to respond nigh-instantly to local disasters made him a hero - he could rush into a burning building and extract people from it (suiting up in milliseconds to avoid smoke inhalation). He could respond to gunshots as soon as they happened through the microphone system around the city. And he could kill anyone who really deserved it by slitting their throat, which meant that he didn't /need/ mach speed punches.

He didn't actually have an immunity to starvation though, so much of his effort was put towards fulfilling his ~x3,600 dietary needs. His other big problem was staying sane - mostly accomplished through having tons and tons of pen pals (that were, from their perspective, communicating in realtime).

Logistically speaking, he needs to eat every eight real-world seconds, which is a bigger issue. I imagine pallets of MREs and bottled water disappearing at a steady rate from his base of operations. The logistics of waste management are also something to consider - the average person urinates 0.8 liters to 2.0 liters per day, which becomes a torrent when it's happening at 3,600 speed.

***** Our protagonist needs the same amount of facilities as 3600 regular people. That's not too much. An army base would suit him fine, and in a big city he'd be a rounding error.

There are other problems, though.

1) What about breathing? Ambient air pressure won't supply you with enough air in time. Without special equipment, you suffocate immediately. With special equipment, everyone around you is going to experience some strong air currents.

2) What about heat transfer? The molecules around you are moving 3600 times slower. That feels the same as a near-absolute-zero environment, so you quickly freeze to death. If you counteract that by making your power act as a heat source, then the people standing next to you are cooked in seconds.

3) What about the shockwaves that follow you wherever you go? Your walking speed is supersonic. Sure, try standing still for a moment. You're still moving your chest when you breathe, and your heart is still beating. That's already a staggering amount of sound energy escaping every second, because it scales with the square of speed. And God forbid you clap your hands!

4) What about traction? Gravity is 3600 times weaker. Making a normal step throws you kilometers up, and jumping takes you to orbit. You're also leaving large gashes in any surface you try to walk on, even diamond.

5) What about material objects, like clothes? Let's be generous and say the superpower is transferred by touch, and then cancelled when the touch stops. That means touching any object, including the ground, will create shrapnel that can kill bystanders. At least the ones who are not already dead due to points 1-3.

6) What about interacting with bigger objects? Pop quiz, what happens when you try to open a door? Depending on how far your superpower is transferred, you might melt the door handle, or rip the lock out of the door, or blast the door off the hinges, or any number of other things.

All in all, this superpower turns you into a human-sized wrecking ball, which moves impossibly fast and constantly emits deadly amounts of noise, heat, and shrapnel. A kind of self-propelled explosion.

Differential time rates between observers without a substantial gravitational gradient or velocity difference is simply Not Allowed.

The question I'd be trying hardest to answer is: just what the /hell/ is going on with my body? How can it possibly be doing what it appears to be doing? What's the nature of the effect, what is its /boundary/? If I swallow a watch, does it start running 3600 times faster? Is gravity accelerating me downwards at 36,000 m/s/s? If so why don't I hit the ground with unfathomably horrific force from a twelve-inch jump, and if not why can't I [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28escape+velocity%29%2F3600][jump into orbit]]? If I spit, does my /saliva/ fall at ten meters per second per second or at thirty-six thousand m/s/s?

The prospect of running experiments with water clocks filled with my own excreta is not an appealing one, but I could easily see it being necessary.

  Is there a productive and "heroic" thing you can use this power for?

Ultimately, if you can figure out what makes you ageless and apply it to another person, you have just cured Death. And if you can figure out how to harness and manipulate the time-acceleration phenomenon that applies to you, you've just given mankind an almost unimaginably powerful technology.

** I don't think you would be able to avoid going at least a little mad.

The only things you could interact with that would be fast enough to not bore you would be high end computers, and even then, any sort of internet lag would be intolerable. You certainly would need a different kind of monitor though. 60Hz just isn't going to cut it. Fluorescent lights are similarly not good. You will spend a lot of your life in the dark unless you use incandescent lights.

I'm not entirely certain about how LED lights and LED monitors might work.

You would likely gravitate into a Google facility, and start programming for a living between page refreshes on reddit.

** I did a play-by-post Mutants and Masterminds rpg following such a hero, which went on for 5 years. Only my character had it worse to start - only his mind was sped up. Fortunately, he was able to get a mental computer interface surgically installed (which exist in that universe, though it's prohibitively expensive for most). He probably still would have gone mad anyways, but he happened to befriend the internet - or rather, a virus that was designed to capitalize on computer downtime worldwide to build a supercomputer, and somehow went sentient. Jane from the Ender sequels, if you will.

** Well, once you get past the obvious things, like finding a natural disaster and hauling people out of it... I would go somewhere quiet, somewhere away from people, and spend a few months appreciating the beauty of a still and silent world. Got to find something I can come to terms with living as, and I think a hermit would do just fine. First, work out a schedule. 1 day realtime = about 10 years your time, so find some people that can make a real difference/do cool things with the right information, and update them every decade. Hell, with all that time, you might as well pick your top 1000 and leave notes explaining the issue. Also, sleep is important, so try to kind of mimic regular sleep patterns. Also, loved ones. Write them notes, give them 60 seconds to respond, come back in a couple days. Remember, brevity. Learn how to read expressions and body language very well. Solve crimes. Bullets move at about 3.5 kph. Do as you see fit. You could go around for a while just finding people doing interesting things and helping them. And, of course, with effective immortality, you could make some really neat things. Cover entire cities in beautiful graffiti. Assassinate corrupt political figures. Build something that can fly.

  He has no transport. If he wants to travel, he has to travel in a conventional car or train or bus or plain. But the field might accommodate a bicycle. And in theory he can run for as far as he likes. He can take a full night's sleep inside the envelope and be vulnerable only for a second. He can walk into a building and kill everybody inside it just by waving a finger through each throat, and be out of the building and a mile away before anybody can blink, leaving just shattered doors torn into pieces like this steel plate and a hundred people all falling and hitting the ground at once.

  This is not a comic book. Somebody shoots a bullet at him? He just walks around it-- if he sees it coming. Someone sneaks up on him? As soon as he feels something touching the back of his head, an iron bar, let's say, he can go to high speed mode and duck or dodge it. A trip-wire? From his perspective, he runs into it at regular pace and hits the ground like any normal human. It's not fatal, he recovers in a second. An explosion? He walks away from it and watches it happen. We're at T plus ten minutes and democracy in this country is over.
