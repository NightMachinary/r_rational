** Summary: [Post-Rebellion] In the frostbitten American Midwest, ragged Magical Girls vie for territory to survive the unforgiving landscape. One such girl is Sloan Redfearn, who wastes away in Fargo, North Dakota, nursing a grudge and watching her hopes slowly die. But when Kyubey approaches with a unique opportunity, she becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens to topple gods.

10/10 writing and characters, would recommend to any connoisseur of rational literature.

Advise that readers familiarize themselves with the PMMM world before reading this fanfic.

*** Read that summary, saw "every character is completely evil" and preemptively dropped it.

Not really interested in stories that seem to delight in assholes being assholes to each other, even if they're smart.

**** FWIW they don't really seem evil, at least up to chapter 7 (which is where I'm at). I recommend you try it out.

**** I've just started reading and I'm 5 chapters in and doesn't seem to be like you think, so far.

There are interesting dynamics going on, I'd say, but it doesn't seem to me that "every character is completely evil".

I could be wrong and something may happen but so far it has been enjoyable, it's not TTS but I'm still enjoying it.

EDIT: well seems like everybody is sort of insane but the more I read the more I enjoy the plot.

**** If you can't recognize things like nuance and need to view characters through a black/white spectrum, perhaps literature is not for you.

***** Not only is your reply incredibly late, it is also incredibly stupid. My entire point was that the summary portrayed the characters as unnuanced and two-dimensional, making the story sound like poor literature.

If it makes you feel better about this incredibly poor decision you've made, I did later read the story and mostly enjoyed it. The summary is shit and fails to sell the story.

*** The summary sounds like an edgy 13 year old wrote it (ohhh!!! i can use the word 'cunt'!! my mom won't find out!!!!), and definitely doesn't make me want to read the story, even if it's good.

** Off-topic, but a little nagging irrational part of my brain is still mad that there's no [[/r/rational]] fic of PMMM simply entitled "Puella Rati Madoka Rationa". It's a stupid title but I feel like it has to exist and be good anyway.

*** The protagonist, who immigrated from /Gurren Lagann/, prefers to be called "Rad-oka".

  Rad-oka

Surely she'd be from a crossover of /Fallout/ with /Gurren Lagann/ with a name like that.

***** It was bestowed by her best friend Homura, who claims to have received superpowers via the bite of a radioactive monster (she's not sure which one). He power is to instantaneously retrieve and switch between whatever personal armaments she desires, and customise them to gain implausible benefits.
