** I was going to link to this: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/]]

But that 300 seconds per day thing limits your options.

That being said, it's still possible to do a binary search with three hundred seconds-- if it takes you 10 seconds to perform an action and another 5 to write down the results and later results based on that action (ie. you querying 15 seconds ahead recursively), you can go down 20 iterations, and 2^{20} is 1048576 actions to search through for an optimum answer.

Obviously the number of iterations you can go through for each answer depends on the time necessary to do an action, but that's easily enough for some stock trading.

This is assuming you can change the future based on what you see, though.

  You don't have to use all the seconds you have at once, but can't look further ahead than 300 seconds by any means.

A few clarifying questions:

- Is my (up to) 300 second glance the 300 seconds immediately after I activate the ability, or could I pick a random time in the same day to view?

- To what extent can I "change the future", and how does that interplay with my ability? Imagine I'm walking home and I get a bad vibe, but my home is 5 minutes away. So I use my ability and see that someone hiding in the alley by my house would attack me. Am I able to change this by turning around and walking the other way? If it took 150 seconds to view that, and then I decide to go a different route and use my ability again immediately, would my vision change?

- Any unused minutes from the previous day vanish at the end of the day, right?

Glimpsing into the future is stupidly powerful, even with the restrictions you put on it. My first thought is that you could probably use it to "hack" people and get what you want, especially since viewing the outcome takes you no time. Decide what you're going to say, view the next few seconds to get their reaction. If it's not favourable to you, decide to say something else and see how that goes. If you use up 3 seconds for every snippet of conversation, you have the opportunity to try out up to 100 different things in a conversation.

That's only depending on how much you can influence the future though. Before I try to really break this ability, I'll wait to see if you can change the future or not. If you can't, then I have a different set of questions entirely.

*** 1) The glance is the 300 seconds immediately after you activate it (unless you decided to cut it short to save seconds).

2) You can change the future depending on what you see. If you decided to do something, look into the future, and change your mind, if you look again you'll see something else.

3) You cannot save seconds for the next day.

Alright! Munchkin away.
