*** Seconded.

This story also suffers from a real lack of good villains. [[#s][spoilers]]

Also, just look at this chapter. I know for a fact that no one is gonna tell this concubine goddamn anything. This whole "teacher" thing is gonna last a really long time, and no one is going to fill in this lady in on the culture of Bekhai. She's a professional political concubine, shouldn't adapting to different cultures be something she's trained in? Instead she just assumes the worst out of the mc because he, a young adult who they know is new to the city from an isolated mountain culture, isn't perfectly fulfilling a role in their culture.

** It seems like you're posting a lot of different stories here --- maybe it's worth indicating why you feel each fits in this sub? (I'm not necessarily skeptical, since I haven't read any. It might help orient prospective readers though.)

*** I have actually submitted this story before about two years ago. I thought it was worth resubmitting, especially since the author has been very productive in that time.

The reason that I submitted a bunch today was because I just got the end of Joie de Vivre and Far Strider by Raga which are both more traditional Rationalist Fiction. Basically self-insert fanfics where the MC munchkins the magic the industrialize the settings.

*** If you like rational fiction, then you can read Savage Divinity as 'rational protagonist against an irrational world', with some mental trauma thrown in as spice.

If you like rebirth / transported, then this is one of the better selections available in that genre.

If you like Wuxia, then Savage Divinity can scratch that itch without the broken English and bad grammar you would be subjected to while reading most of the other content in the genre.

If you don't like Wuxia... well, give it a try and it might change your mind.

** Here is the story description

A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford.

This is a cultivation style story and in my personal opinion one of the best. The author dispenses some of the worst traits of these types of story's. Arbitrary levels and non sensical exponential economies. The MC slowly gains power and tries (most often failing) to use science to revolutionize the world. Another it is really only after ~300 chapters that you start to see this. The reasons that he fails so often is because this is a different world then ours and the author has well reasoned world building to explain why gun for example would not work.

I also find the characters well rounding and the story over has made me laugh out load a lot and nearly cry serval times.

*** Thanks for the description!

Are there any things you think the story does especially well? What do you like about it? Do you think it's especially rational/rationalist?

**** The last couple arcs seem to be creeping in that direction, but at the moment I definitely would not say that it is.

**** I find the world building to be very good. The author does a very good job thinking through the consequences of how the "magic" of the world effects how people and society work. The focus of the story is not really science industrization (that is more of a side plot that has come into focus in the last few chapters). I definitely find that the story follows the characteristics of a rational story.

Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

the main antagonist force is actually EVIL as in corrupted humans that are saddistic cannibals and want to end all civilaztion

MC solves most of his problems through being massivly OP

****** Individual defiled act rationally within their circumstances. It is not that the defiled are evil for evil's sake. They are evil, as the MC say, because they have magical herpes.

As for being OP. I disagree with this. The author has shown that Rain works extremely hard to achieve his skills. Yes he is among the strongest of his age and in the last arc became the number 1 talent in the empire. But his peers are close in power and the older generation can still kick his ass.

******* I think i dropped it like 3 months ago so not really clear on some of the details but:

does it matter if its magical herpes making them evil? in the end the faction is evil so it becomes a conflict of good vs evil (also weren't the more powerful ones fully self aware and that's how they were able to hide like laughing dragon?)

he actually gets "heavenly water" that lives inside him and then can heal any wound that doesn't kill him immediately; which happened by pure happenstance, and also lets him restore sanity to the defiled. Also wasn't he the youngest person to make the spiritual home thing inside of him and he did it by accident cuz of his "brother"

******** There have been a number of rational elements creeping in of late, especially with his more recent goals revolving around improving society via expanded education and intellectualism, but anyone going into this story looking specifically for those elements will be in for a frustrating time.

I've been enjoying the story a fair bit, and will continue to do so once the current hiatus ends, but I don't think it belongs here either, and I downvoted the post for that reason.

*** Dude me too. I couldn't handle it anymore. I liked the MC enough to keep reading it, but not even 25% of the time did the story focus on him (not the whole story, but for a good chunk of chapters). Too many POVs.
