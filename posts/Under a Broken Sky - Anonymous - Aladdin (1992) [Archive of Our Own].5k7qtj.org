** This was a piece of fanfiction submitted under Ao3's [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/yuletide2016][Yuletide]] fic exchange. In this exchange, fanfiction authors write requests for each other in October of what they want, and also enter in what they are willing to write (fandoms, characters, etc). Usually only rare fandoms (so no like Naruto or Harry Potter) are accepted.

Then, they are assigned recipients and begin writing. Fics are revealed on Dec 25. It's like Secret Santa, but you request a piece of fanfiction and write fanfiction instead of receiving and giving physical gifts. Tons of fun.

This fic appears to be an expansion on a fan theory [[/u/xamueljones]] linked here the other day [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5j6fg0/a_rational_take_on_the_movie_of_aladdin/][(link)]], that Aladdin is set in the post-apocalypse. It's mostly exposition without real plot, but that's normal for this sort of one-shot. I enjoyed reading it.
