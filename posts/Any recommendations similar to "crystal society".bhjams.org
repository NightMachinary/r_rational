New to the genre but gawd damn it's an epic frontier to write in


** You have read the [[https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Mentality-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B01N7TK5EF][two sequels]], right? (Though I just learned the third book isn't that good, apparently?)

*** I highly suggest the second book and the first half of the third book!

**** the second half of the third book was a little bit nutso but I kinda liked the way it exemplified the (effective) moral of the whole story.

I'm not into the pony angle at all, but this story had lot in common with Crystal Society (especially the second and third books). The thing I liked about it was the same thing I liked about the Crystal books, how the story is largely through the AI's point of view.

**** Really, it's the pony fandom's fault for producing such good content that even total outsiders are forced to enjoy it.

** I'm not done reading them yet, but [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B01MUI3TG0][The Divine Dungeon]] series is essentially about a runaway AI process (in a Xianxia world.) So far (I've read the first three books in the five-book series), it has accidentally created a zombie plague, semi-purposefully destroyed entire cities (killing off their entire populations) in the process of powering itself, and /entirely/ purposefully created and released mosquitoes into a blissfully pre-mosquito world.

If you know /Dungeon Keeper/, the AI is essentially a sentient Dungeon Heart, acting as its own dungeon keeper (which is just how Dungeon Hearts work in this setting.) The AI also /used/ to be a human, but, because it doesn't retain much of its original human preference function, it's more intuitive to just think of it as a straight-up AI.

*** Seconding this. I'm up to date to book 4, waiting on 5, and it's excellent.

It also appears to somehow share a universe with the author's other work, the Completionist saga, in which not Elon Musk is forced to take the fall for an environmental disaster, vows to put big oil out of business, and somehow in the process finds and uses a dungeon core (which may or may not be Cal) to create a near-perfect VRMMO that serves as the story's setting.

I mean, it's never mentioned again, but that prologue is, by itself, worth a read even if you don't intend to read the first book.

** If the main characters can be uploads instead of AI's then Permutation City, Bobiverse, lots of Ken Macleod (e.g. corporation wars), and the Rapture of the Nerds. Also Utopia, LOL? by Jamie Wahls. Nexus by Ramez Naam.

If anyone knows any other upload stories I missed up, please comment.
