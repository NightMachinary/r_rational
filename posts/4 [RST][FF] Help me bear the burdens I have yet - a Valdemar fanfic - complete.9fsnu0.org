** How much canon knowledge is required for this story?

*** Zero! It's a pretty obscure series and most of my beta readers haven't read canon. You should start with book one of the series, though - the link for the overall series is here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480]]

**** Thanks. Was this the final part of the series, or it's just this 3rd volume that's been completed?

***** Just the third volume. It, um, keeps going for quite a while - I've written up to volume 6 and there is more to come.

****** :D

I'm binging these a book at a time, and loving them! Also finding heaps of fan music, which mixes in very interesting ways with this more complicated portrayal of the setting :)

******* There is a LOT of fan music! (I think I linked to some of the songs that are Relevant to parts I've written, and more come up later in book 4). Curious what part of the mix you think is particularly interesting?

******** Mostly the contrast between e.g. the raw and uncomplicated emotion of /Battle Dawn/ and the less fantastic world of grief, logistics, and treatises of ethics - there's a fun kind of meta-fic in thinking about how such music would be written in this story, and why it might be popular!

** Started reading (from the first book) it and it's quite enjoyable so far. Can't help but feel apprehensive about the eventual deluge of romantic mush drowning out more interesting things, though.
