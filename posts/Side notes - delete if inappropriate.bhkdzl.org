** I would suggest posting snippets to the Friday Thread since off-topic postings are meant to go in there. Once you get to the point of sharing actual chapters or the entire story, then the Monday Thread would work just as well.

I don't think anyone will be bugged by you posting this as a top-level post this one time, just remember the Friday Thread for the next time. So there's no need to delete this for now.

*** Thanks, will do in future. I have just under 70,000 words at the moment, it will probably top out at 110,000 or so. When I finish I will check through and edit it for consistency before I start posting large sections of it. I just wanted to know whether this is the sort of thing that some rationalists find appealing.
