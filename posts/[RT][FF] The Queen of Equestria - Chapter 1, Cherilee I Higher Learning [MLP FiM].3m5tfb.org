** It's intriguing, since most authors who write about Diamond Tiara tend to prefer to write her growing into a better person, or as someone who is deservedly punished. You're going in the opposite direction and whole-heartedly embracing her more sociopathic traits.

I think the story will depend strongly on what challenges she will face and how you can still have the reader support her despite any initial feelings of dislike.

*** Diamond Tiara (and similar "bully" characters in other media) has always intrigued me.

Seriously, here's a character that just has a seemingly natural ability to assert their dominance on the people around them. If they could focus that ability and actually put it to good use they could accomplish some incredible things with their life. Exploring that idea is definitely going to be one of the main Rational focuses of my fic.

As far as I've witnessed, the Brony community has a rather unanimous dislike for Diamond Tiara. It's going to be an uphill battle to keep her true to her character as being highly manipulative while still making her someone who can be empathized with. I think I'm up for the challenge though.

Thank you for the feedback.

Fortunately, you have the rationalist community here, who have previously demonstrated the inclination to empathize with /Lord Voldemort/. You'll be fine.

***** Friend! You're confused as to who the ultimate evil is in HP!

It's not Voldemort. It's Umbridge.

****** I would like to see someone write a fic that makes Umbridge sympathetic. A few ideas come to mind but I've already been putting off continuing one of my other fics.

** I like it so far, but you really need a proofreader. There are some duplicate words and missing letters (and too many "at least"). You can make a post on this subreddit to ask if someone is interested in doing proofreading. People have successfully done that before.

*** I would love to have some proofreaders for future chapters.

I've never seen any posts on this sub looking for proofreaders so I assumed it wasn't really the place for it. But if there are people willing to do it than I will definitely make a post about it in regard to my upcoming chapter.

***** Really? Great.

How do you want to do this? Should I send you a PM with a link to the next chapter when I finish it?
