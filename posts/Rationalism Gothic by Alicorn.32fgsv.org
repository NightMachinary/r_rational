I'll go check out if there are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hoef9/any_good_rational_horror_stories/][any good rational horror stories]].

What's the status of eaglejarl's "Pay attention"? I wasn't a huge fan of the Two Year Emperor, but maybe it would be worth checking out?

**** Thank you. I only found posts about the kick-starter campaign, none about that was obviously discussing the finished product.

The "Buy now on Amazon" link doesn't work for me right now. [[http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=David%20K.%20Storrs&search-alias=digital-text&sort=relevancerank][Here is the his amazon site]].

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][Gothic fiction]]. I didn't really know the term before, either. "The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French roman noir."

  Politics is the mindkiller. You do not need to come up with thoughts about politics. They would only kill your mind. Rest now.

  You donate to effective charities to signal virtue to your friends. They are impressed. You feel cold. Friendship isn't about affection. You signal louder and louder to nothing and no one. You have never done anything real. You are not real.
#+end_quote

These had to be my favorites.
