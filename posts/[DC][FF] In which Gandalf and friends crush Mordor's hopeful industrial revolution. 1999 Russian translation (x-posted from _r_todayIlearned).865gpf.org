** I read this a few years ago and enjoyed it. The author assumes the role of an historian from the world of the lord of the rings writing hundreds of years after the events of the trilogy. The trilogy is treated as heroic epics passed, and edited, through the ages. This book is set during the same period as the ring wars and written based off the notes and diaries of a Mordor field medic.

The book is interesting on its own virtues and even more interesting in the context of the lord of the rings trilogy. It is interesting to see a progressive and industrializing Mordor with education and public works and compare it to the dread land of orcs, goblins, and black magic. This explores the change of ancient legends and the trend of the winners editing the history books when they are written after the war. I highly recommend the book.

** It's quite nice world deconstruction until it tries to be a spy novel.

*** yeah the second half was too distant from LOTR and since I wanted to read more of the first part type of things I disliked it.

Furthermore all those secret services would be unfeasible with medieval elvel of bureaucracy and communication.

** I only just started reading it but it already uses a lot of the "science!" and deconstruction tropes favored by this subreddit. Given that it was written in 1999, is internationally popular, and seems to have actually gained traction on a mainstream subreddit I thought it was relevant enough to be here.

** I honestly didnt like this book very much. It felt like a point by point rebuttal of the LOTR trying to prove there was some moral ambiguity. Unfortunately, Tolkien wrote LOTR so there wasnt any moral ambiguity in the story itself. This is deeply covered in his letters, the Silmarillion, and his other writings.

While the story is excellently written, and the author is good at providing an occasional self-referential nod that is similar to Pratchett and Adams, I couldnt find myself enjoying the story in the context of Middle Earth. It was too much of a contrast against the original story that originated it, especially regarding character motivations and portrayals.

I felt a much better follow up on the Middle Earth saga was that Silmarils in the Fourth Age story that was posted here several months back.

Edit: found the story it was the fifth age not the fourth [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/]]

** I recall there being a rational LotR fanfic, but I can't seem to find it on this subreddit.\\
Is this story it, or I am thinking of something else?

*** I believe the story you and [[/u/skytroupe]] are referencing is the below one but I could be wrong. It's excellent but sadly seems abandoned at this point.

*** there was one set in modern world where Elvis Presley survives a ground zero nuclear explosion.

He survives cause:

A silmaril is anathema to decay so it blocks all harmful radiation.

Being an awesome bard he nullifies the shock wave

And Melkor blocks the fire balls
