** 100% younger Yudkowsky is disappointed in his older self for not having already solved it and it turns into a therapy session.

** Unfortunately, I'm not good enough at modeling present Yudkowsky to go with this, and /definitely/ not comfortable with playing my hand at modeling present Yudkowsky modeling a hypothetical GPT-4 modeling past Yudkowsky.

EDIT: Come to think, GPT-3 can probably already model past Yudkowsky pretty well, given that it's reasonably likely that the sequences and various other things are in the dataset, but you expressly forbid that.

  Edward: But how will you know you programmed the box correctly?

  Eliezer: Well, we'll get to that later. First we need to actually build the box,

This is maybe the /least/ Eliezer thing I've ever seen labeled "Eliezer:".

I'd say this is a close contender for least eliezer thing =)

***** That's true, and the hyper-intelligent thing too, which is not really coherent.

I wonder how he made them though, did he get access to the GPT-3 api?

EDIT he has one more [[https://gist.github.com/ekmett/6cd785180659e3c2f9284e5128c11025]]

My other bugbear is that people clearly edit these things, but don't disclose this. In there the end is clearly edited I think, since GPT-2 doesn't come to a nice ending IMO. It makes it hard to judge GPT-3 if people don't say how many samples they generated and how much editing they did.

** PAST EY: You just have to program Coherent Extrapolated Volition into the value system of the AI.

PRESENT EY: No, no. I liked that idea, but it was clearly flawed. It doesn't take into account...

PAST EY: Really, though, I've thought this through. Coherent Extrapolated Volition is when the AI bases its actions on what someone with perfect information /would/ want, not just what they /say/ they want, and...

PRESENT EY: Okay, now I get why this was a bad idea. Past me was stupid. I should have remembered that.

FUTURE EY: Hey, you're one to talk. I can remember how stupid each of the two of you were, and there wasn't that much difference.

(Author's note: I am not calling the EY of any time period stupid; I'm only observing that it seems to be a universal truth that people look upon their past self as having been stupid)

(Takes over the world, repurposing EY(2030)'s atoms in the process, thereby neatly solving the alignment problem by aligning the superintelligent AI with a reasonable approximation of EY(2010)'s values)
