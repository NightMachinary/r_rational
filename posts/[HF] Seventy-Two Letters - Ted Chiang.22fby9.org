** Another good story by Ted Chiang. I liked how the world the narrator lived in had classical ideas of nature like spontaneous generation and the male contributing most of the characteristics of the children be the reality of the universe. I've read some other stories that have done similar things, but those were usually fantasy, not sci-fi (like with stars being people and a flat world in Narnia).

** That was good fun. Somewhat guessed where the ending was going before it arrived, but good nonetheless - I suspect it would have been less predictable if I weren't coming to it directly from a subreddit where self-reproducing loops are generally recognised as /powerful stuff/.

** About a third of the way through reading this, I realized it was by Ted Chiang, whose book I had on a shelf but hadn't yet read. Sure enough, this story was in it. Almost through it now /(Slow reader/) and I'm completely in love. Can anyone recommend other stories by this author, outside of those in "Stories of Your Life and Others", namely "Tower of Babylon", "Understand", "Division By Zero", "Story of Your Life", The Evolution of Human Science", "Hell Is the Absence of God", and "Liking What You See: A Documentary", or at least let me know which one I should read next?

**** Apologies for not searching first. I haven't been on this subreddit for very long, but looking into it, there's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1y5x3k/everything_by_ted_chiang/][another post]] with many of his stories linked, including "Exhalation".

** A fantastic story. One of my favorites of Chiang (and I generally love his writing). Really liked the childhood scenes, the mythology and his treatment of it. Nice to see it linked here.
