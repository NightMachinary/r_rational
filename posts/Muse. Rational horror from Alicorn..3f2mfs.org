**** Even in /Luminosity/, that is a relatively minor point where the world didn't act right, not that the main characters didn't enact plans that made sense given their assumptions. The author was trying to execute ideas that their plotting skills failed to really match, and the world-building buckled under it--which is forgivable in my book. But they tried. That makes it rational in the genre, but flawed.

That's really all I ask for in speculative rational fiction: try hard to make the characters and world act right, given the genre. I didn't get that in /Muse/, despite the sorta-kinda sciencey-based story. The story world didn't make sense, even in sci-fi terms, and the characters also didn't act right for what they were supposed to be doing.

There isn't really...a thing described and deeply rooted in the world, just a situation that happens to people. And people don't /really/ act like they should, if they were professionals on a professional mission or people living with...a thing. Too much explanation that is needed doesn't happen, because it isn't a story about these people, technology, other worlds, or the...thing that happens. Just its effects.

It is a story about a thing that happens. And that's fine. It's a good story.

--------------

Questions I would have answered (quickly) to make this short story more rational:

- *Why isn't this a quasi-military mission, with all that implies?* People just sort of flop around, literally like tourists. It not being highly structured suggests even more alien things than other worlds, when it comes to human organizations.
- *Why didn't they have medical personal?* Just...why? How can anything...that happens have happened? And if they had deep, functional society (which seems to be the case) where was /their/ artistic and meticulous medical science? We currently treat minor mental issues with a boggling variety of drugs. This story suggests...they don't, even when it would massively improve quality of life? Ehhh...
- *Why didn't anyone on either side ask any questions about anything?* In addition to not sending a doctor, they didn't send an anthropologist? Are these proactive and curious explorers or bored college professors with generic expertise grinding through their tenure? Is this a society based on...what it was without anyone interested in this...thing, did no one find the visitors interesting? Whatever the case, how did the crew miss it? The crew figured it out very, very fast later on, but also jumped to a lot of conclusions that /could have been dead wrong/. So why didn't the locals talk to them about /anything/? With the developmental implications, this seems...stupid. Either they could work at a level where their...situation wasn't noticeable and yet they never worked on the obvious problem, which isn't logical, or the explorers were criminally negligent in their mission, which isn't /rational/ or otherwise supported by the plot.
- *Why didn't they treat the alien planet as an alien planet*, or even ask questions about it? Which leads to-
- -the big one for all sci-fi: */Why isn't this ALL being done by robots/*. No AI, fine. No robotic explorers sent on automated missions, or at least being controlled from orbit? No. Just, no. You aren't writing sci-fi anymore without answering the robot probe question.

Failing that last one ultimately makes this fun space opera fantasy, and less "hard" sci-fi than /Stargate: SG1/. Being written as if fleshy people had tasks to do in space exploration, which simply isn't true /now/, it fails at almost the first rational sci-fi hurtle. Which is fine, as space opera is seldom very rational.

--------------

Let's go down the list in order:

1. Things happen /because/, we never hear the reasons. Conflict is purely artificially constructed. See: my iPod rant, below.
2. The conflict is with the world, and it isn't even explored if this...thing is a good thing or not, which is actually an argument in the real-world analog of this situation when it happens to real people...though less dramatically. That discussion is never even mentioned, because that would detract from the horror. Even though...it is kind of insensitive to people with real...thing issues in real life.
3. Nope. In fact, no one solves any real problems at all, let alone intelligently. We don't really learn what resources there are, what people know, or why they do what they do. They just do things and we watch.
4. And no. We learn almost nothing, especially about FTL, alien worlds, alien cultures, sci-fi cultures, or really anything at all. In fact, they don't have smarthphone level tech like handheld video and music /while on an FTL ship/, which is a /huge/ fail of imagination. You bet your /ass/ the first FTL explorers will have the ability to /personally play music on electronic handheld devices/, just like people did in 1990. Sigh.

Again, still a very, very good story. I think what the author wrote works, and was most importantly what they wanted to write, it just isn't at all good /rational fiction/.

--------------

-edit

*tl;dr*

This isn't rational. World building matters. Rational fiction horror looks more like /Andromeda Strain/, and less like an episode of /Star Trek: TNG/. Still a good story. I liked ST:TNG, mostly.

***** I don't think rational scifi has to be "hard" scifi, which is implied by your robots question.

The fact that they don't use robots doesnt -really- detract from the rationality. It could be explained simply by them not having the tech, and yeah its possible for a world to exist where they have FTL but not robots. Not to mention that it is a diplomatic mission in practice so they might not be able to use it as it would offend their hosts.

And I think similar things could be said about most of your other points. meaning, I don't think they are the causes for this to not be rational.

Having said all of this i do agree that the story is not really rational, even though it is generally nice. The reason for me is simply that the characters themselves did not act rationally. which is more abstract, but I think going into the specifics is not the solution in this case, because any of the specifics (why wasnt this a military mission could have easily been "solved" by having one of the people mention how "this mission really should have been a military mission, if not for colony politics we should have gotten much better protection" or something similar)

But as a whole there are too many small points which when combined prevent this from being "rational" in my eyes..

This doesn't logically follow. Lots of small points could have been covered by a single sentence:

*/The entire scatter recovery plan hinged on this single, admittedly poorly-funded mission, run by their group of dedicated volunteers./*

Now every stupid mistake is explained. Done. But it doesn't do that, because even that would distract from the elements that the author wants to focus on.

I actually /listed/ what I felt was most wrong, because even if it was a series of small things, they weren't unsolvable issues. Altogether, there was a lot not covered. Even in a short story, where space is limited, these sorts of things need to be dealt with in rational world-building, and they weren't.

It isn't about being "hard" sci-fi, which mostly means the math and science has been done and is explicitly shown, but about having a well put-together world. Instead of sci-fi, we get space opera, because none of the science questions are even lampshaded. Even though it is otherwise a good story, /Muse/ doesn't fit together at all, even when a few words would have fixed the problem. And that's a shame.

******* i may not have explained myself properly, what i meant was that all of these things could have been solved relatively easily without significantly effecting anything important in the story.

nothing would have changed if the author added "if not for those stupid politicians" or "if only we had time to charge the robots to send them instead", other than the fact that we could be assured that the author thought about those things. so yes, we would know the author was aware of those points and decided to make a story where they wouldnt be relevant.

but nothing in the story would change significantly.

On the other hand my problem with the many small irrationalities is that without them the story would just not be the same, i.e. it would not be possible to get the same horror.

I'm not sure I agree with this point. Let me stretch to a mathematical analogy, namely the distinction between consistent and complete. Most of what you're arguing is that the world building isn't complete. You point to a bunch of things and say "I think that needs further justification." The world building hasn't answered everything.

On the other hand, the story is certainly consistent with everyone acting as normal, intelligent people (at least, prior to muse exposure). That is, for each of your objections you can come up with simple, plausible extensions to the text that would answer them.

#+begin_quote
  Muse doesn't fit together at all, even when a few words would have fixed the problem.
#+end_quote

To me this seems bizarre. I care not a whit for completeness, only for consistency. Again, this is the difference between a character who is an idiot and a character holding the idiot ball -- holding the idiot ball means that the world (in particular, the offending character) is inconsistent. In contrast, a character who is dumb isn't bad writing, it's just a character who's stupid.

Full disclaimer: I think that, as descriptors, rational and rationalist are not particularly meaningful. I chose the title as I did to parallel last week's contest.

******** To my mind, the entire exploring post-"scatter" society in /Muse/ is holding the idiot ball. It is not just that the reader has to assume things, which is fine, but that they have to make /excuses/ for stupid things the characters do. In an otherwise good story, that's mediocre storytelling.

I was able to suspend disbelief while reading the story, which is why I say I found it a good one /despite/ this issue. But the moment I finished the story, literally that /second/, my brain started poking holes in it. That's bad for a rational story.

Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f2mfs/muse_rational_horror_from_alicorn/ctng031?context=10][the author says it isn't meant as a rational story]], so...

I use the sidebar definitions in this sub for the terms /rational/ and /rationalist/, as those *are* in fact meaningful. Words do, in fact, mean things. Maybe don't use words you disagree with, if commonly held definitions are a problem for you.

I don't hate that you suggested this story. I liked it. But it isn't a rational story. Please don't try to weasel out of this with semantic games. And perhaps consider using words that mean things to other people they way they usually understand them, and just disclaim ahead of time if you think an entry might be sort of weak on the sidebar-defined rational elements. I'm sure people will still enjoy well-written submissions.
