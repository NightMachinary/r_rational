** Recently got around to finally reading The Thrawn Trilogy for the now defunct Star Wars expanded universe. Very impressed by it, probably the closest thing to a rational take on the universe that's been published. Among the many munchkiny tricks employed, it also works to answer questions like "Why don't starships just run off of AI, instead of being staffed by thousands of crewmen?" and "Why was the Emperor (who as far as we saw just shoots lightning out of his hands) so valuable to the Empire?" If you're like me and somehow missed them, worth picking up.

Also, Practical Guide to Evil is fantastic. Working my way through book 3 at the moment, not looking forward to reaching the current frontier.

*** I read the first book in the Thrawn Trilogy and enjoyed it, but had trouble finding the second (I've got a pdf of the third). How does the second book compare to the first? I'm not sure if it's worth me trying to hunt it down while I still have other stuff lined up to read, but if it's even better than the first one I'd probably go for it anyway since I really liked book one.

If one were very interested in books, learning how to use IRC is probably very worthwhile, and a lot easier than the alternatives.

** Some works that piled up in my backlog.

*Fanfiction*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle][/Man in the Middle/]], a /Sword Art Online/ fanfiction. Instead of focusing on the people trapped in the death game, it shows a government-sponsored rescue operation conducted by programmers and engineers. A fascinating deconstruction of SAO's premise, done in a way that would appeal to this subreddit. *Complete.*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity][/Transcedent Humanity/]], a /Mass Effect/ fanfiction. Premise: humanity never developed FTL, and was forced to grow within the Solar System's bounds, achieving a "soft" singularity --- building a Matrioshka Brain filled with uploads around the Sun. Canon gets horribly derailed the moment transhumanity meets Turians. *Appears to be dead.*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][/Modern Cannibals/]]. Nominally a /Homestuck/ fanfiction, it's set in a world mostly indistinguishable from ours, and follows a group of +friends+ acquaintances on a trip to a Las Vegas FanCon. Among its positives is very good and unique characterization, entertaining plot, discussion of author/consumer relationship, an absolutely fascinating last chapter, and some metafictional shenanigans. Negatives: the majoiry of the characters are irrational, or have crippling psychological issues. *Complete.*\\
  Additionally, it's a work of Bavitz, the author of a rational /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][/Fargo/]].

*Movies*

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Coherence][/Coherence/]], a movie. A group of friends find themselves isolated in their house and its immediate surroundings; shortly thereafter, strange happenings begin. It's a curious case where the majority of characters are pretty /irrational/, as real people are, but despite that, they're clearly Level One Intelligent: they think about their situation, compare it to their experience with movies, and so on. [[#s][A moderately spoiling hook:]]

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Horror_Movie][/The Last Horror Movie/]], a movie. Follows a competent serial killer's activity, as he films his kills and talks to the hypothetical viewer. Filled with attacks on the viewer's morality, some meta-commentary, disturbing contrasts between the murderer's murdering and his "daily" self, and [[#s][ending spoiler]].

** If I'm ever going to be thrown back in time or into another world and I have no idea of what I'll be facing, then [[https://www.amazon.com/Timelines-Science-Dk-Smithsonian-DK/dp/1465442472][Timelines of Science]] is the book I want to take with me. It's a very well-illustrated book about the scientific inventions and history of scientific figures throughout time from the prehistoric era to the modern day. It doesn't go very in depth into the separate scientific principles mentioned, but it's a great way to review the various technology developed over time and the order of such technology. Kinda expensive, I got mine slightly used but like new for $13.

[[http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/][Math Girls]] is an incredible series of books about three teens in high school discussing math from an elementary to college/graduate level. There's a sample from each of the three books in the series provided in the linked website. The samples are a very good indication of the quality of the rest of the book and should be helpful in deciding if you want the books.

Not necessarily rational, but rather recommendations for anyone who really wants to read more stuff about the anime, but the series is updating too slowly for your tastes. Mostly about Midoriya with a quirk or something unusual about him.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793297.The_Steerswoman][The Steerswoman]] - It's a series that has been recommended here a few times, but it's been a while since the last one and I've been rereading it. Here's a summary someone wrote and posted to this subreddit previously

#+begin_quote
  Steerswomen, and a very few Steersmen, are members of an order dedicated to discovering and disseminating knowledge. Although they are foremost navigators of the high seas, Steerswomen are also explorers and cartographers upon land as well as sea. With one exception, they are pledged to always answer any question put to them with as truthful a response as is possible within their own limitations. However, they also require anyone of whom they ask questions to respond in the same manner, upon penalty of the Steerswomen's ban; those under the ban do not receive answers from the steerswomen.

** I got gifted /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ from the Reddit sci-fi exchange! I love Neal Stephenson, so I dove right in. A government agency discovers that magic was real until 1851 and hires an adjunct professor of ancient languages to translate relevant documentation. Pretty solid explanation for why magic worked and why it stopped working, and at least the main characters are rational (but definitely not rationalist).

EDIT: 300 pages in. This book has made me laugh out loud more than anything since the Hitchhiker's Guide.

** I'm sure a lot of people on here have already read some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (if you haven't, go do it now - /Mort/ or /Guards, Guards/ are good starting points), but I'd like to recommend the Bromeliad trilogy.

It's a young adult series but I recently reread it and really enjoyed it anyway. While not fully rational, it has some rationalist traits (it explicitly rejects storybook thinking a few times, but it also has Pratchett's classic style of worldbuilding, albeit without magic). The core theme of the series is also something I think a lot of people on here would enjoy.

Most importantly, it's fun and creative.

--------------

I also read the first book in the Banners of Blood series, called 'Son of the Morning'. It's... kind of hard to describe, except that it has some similarities with Unsong despite not having much humour. Set during the start of the Hundred Years' War, it's excellent at capturing a foreign culture and mindset and its approach to reinterpreting a more active religion is excellent. I recommend it to anyone who liked Unsong for reasons other than creative puns, kaballah and the humour. You don't need to know anything about the relevant time period going into it - I didn't, at least - but it might add some extra pleasure if you recognise some of the characters.

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Car_Racer][Hovercar racer]] by Matthew Reilly might fit your bill. It's about a season of the fictional "hovercar" races, the courses vary from F1-style street loops to rally-style scenic circuits (and one points based orienteering race). It's a lot of fun, and Matthew Reilly is a master of characters thinking their way out of a situation whilst in the middle of an action scene. The book was originally released free on-line so you may be able to find a pdf copy if you look hard enough.

The smart characters are at Level 1 intelligent characters with moments of murder-mystery brilliance (putting together Chekhovs from earlier in the plot). It's tonnes of fun but it isn't rationalist in the slightest.

[Edit] It's also very much in the YA genre, so keep that in mind.

However, when the race is on, it's some of the most spectacular high-energy animation I've ever seen in my life. It's totally irrational, of course, but it's such a fun rush.

*** How did you like the Aspect-Emperor Trilogy?

I finished the Prince of Nothing trilogy, and oscillated between loving and hating the series. The writing would sometimes strike me as impressive, deep, and almost poetic, while at other times just came across as "faux-intellectual" to a masturbatory degree. The characters were unique and compelling, but were also almost entirely unrelatable, and all but a few were extremely two-dimensional. Not to mention that the entire first trilogy is just one three-act (fairly short, timeline-wise) story, so it often felt extremely slow, especially around book 2.

Given my opinion of Prince of Nothing, how do you think I would find Aspect-Emperor? Are there significant shifts in writing/characterization/pacing, or is it along the same lines as PoN?

**** As someone familiar with one of the larger online fan bases for the series the general opinion is that the first trilogy is superior but not massively so. There's still plenty of philosophical wankery on the exact same ideas as the first trilogy, there's still lots of unlikeable characters - though certainly some interesting ones - and there's plenty of epic moments, more than the first trilogy in my opinion.

The ending suffers from a distinct lack of payoff in many ways so I can't recommend it without that caveat. Also, if you do decide to read the second trilogy then afterwards do not read the authors reddit AMA unless you want to retroactively taint your entire reading experience.
