  Dora's Caf√©. It was the only coffee shop in town that had a posted policy of encouraging the baristas to be sarcastic to any and all rude customers.

Questionable Content reference? Cute.

Is there any reason to spread the text into two parts like that? Scrolling back up after I've read half of it doesn't seem very neat to me. Not that it's a big deal either way.

[Edit] Finished reading the four chapters. Pretty dang good. I am definitely interested and subscribing to the RSS. [[https://jdogmoney.wordpress.com/feed/][Here]] is a link to the RSS if anyone else wants to.

*** Yeah, absolutely a QC nod. I'm not sure how to fix the columns problem yet, but don't worry, I find annoying as well.

** YES. YES. This is what a rational story IRL is supposed to be. OMG THERE IS 4 CHAPTERS IN TOTAL!?!?!?!?

OP please post next chapter and index link on page. If I didn't press home I would not have seen the rest of story. EDIT: He already did I just didn't scroll down far enough. Will ad more reviewing later.

EDIT: More reviewing time is now:

This story has a good plot hook and an interesting premise. I am enjoying MC and his inner planing mechanism, not too strong or too weak, with good amount of premade plans. I cant say anything about story formation, writing tenses and grammar, since my brain auto skips on such unnecessary details.

*** In the best of all possible worlds, it updates every Saturday.

In this one, I fell prey to the planning fallacy this last week. I'm fixing the problem for future updates, though.
