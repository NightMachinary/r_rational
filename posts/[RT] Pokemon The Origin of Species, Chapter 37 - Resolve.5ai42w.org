** Wonderful chapter: I was definitely satisfied by the pace of things. I'm not sure what the ratio should be, but this sort of chapter will do well to keep things moving, even if a lot of the chapters focus almost entirely on things that take only a small amount of time, like a conversation with Bill or the execution of the Abra-catching plan.

I'm especially glad to see Red getting serious. It's nice to see him take off the handicaps, and the practice he does in this chapter demonstrates the determination and capability I've been wanting from him without seeming like an unnatural shift in his characterization. I was never really convinced by his mother's argument against buying and selling clefairy, but his conversations with her and the line about disappointing her really sold the mental shift that the decision reveals, and the price he's paying to move towards his goals.

Finally he's putting real time and effort into his psychic training, and it is very satisfying to see that pay off. His progress is fast but doesn't seem too magical or game-breaking, and it's a natural extrapolation of what we already know about him. It shouldn't be too hard to quickly level him up with respect to his psychic abilities enough to open up new areas of scientific inquiry without making it seem too easy or making him powerful in the short-term relative to experienced psychics. I'd love to see him do novel things with his powers, but it would seem fairly cheep for him to end up overpowered as a result of having held a weird mental partition for years, but insofar as he is particularly skilled it seems to come from his work-ethic, introspective skill, and knowledge pool, which is awesome.

Still, I am a bit unhappy with what looks a lot like a complete dismissal of everything he learned from Bill. He leveraged it into renewed focus and grit, but is he really going to just continue as he has been just because he's passionate about the field? I'm not really clear on where he ended up at the end of his conversation with Leaf, but is he not going to even /try/ learning about computers (or minds maybe, as a psychic) and seeing whether he has an aptitude? It makes sense for Leaf to continue along her current path as she is building a skill and a platform that are applicable to any cause, but this isn't true for Red, so it'll be kind of bizarre if he learns a bunch of stuff about how the world might end and it doesn't really change his priorities at all.

As for Leaf, I'm becoming more and more of a fan (like Red!). She is great in her conversation with Red, and then great with her lead-finding strategy, and then great in her conversations with Zoey Palmer. I'm really looking forward to whatever happens once she starts looking into the execution of the Renegade.

In a sense not much happened with Blue this chapter, but what we did see struck me as kind of ominous. He manages to act kindly and take the desires/perceptions of strangers into consideration, but it seems rather calculated, and he doesn't seem worried at all about having hurt her pokemon, to the extent that I'm unsure as a reader whether what happened was normal. This is super great! And it's cool to have the added uncertainty about whether some of his personality might be rubbing off on his pokemon, and whether they may end up as more vicious than those of others. If so, I wonder whether Red and Leaf will notice, and how they'll react.

I'm curious to hear what others think of Blue's darkness. Does it seem to you all that he can just continue down the path he's walking without anything happening? My reading, is that he'll come to some sort of real conflict with Red or especially Leaf, or that he'll do something that gets him awful PR (or even a Renegade branding eventually?) but I may be overestimating his "darkness" relative to the world he's in.

Oh, and this chapter was super inspiring so I'm going to go meditate :)

*** Yay to all the positive feedback! Glad you enjoyed it so much :)

For the issue of Red's priorities, he's not completely convinced by Bill's cynicism of the importance of figuring out where pokemon come from and how they work the way they do. I'll see if I can communicate that a bit better, but basically while he does find Bill's work important, "learning things about how the world works" is still his main interest, "learning things about how pokemon work" is still his main focus, and "learning things about how psychic powers work" is still his current stepping stone to the above. If he can leverage any of that knowledge into positive benefits to the other stuff Bill has been working on he will, but for now at the very least learning about how psychic powers work is something Bill and he both agree on, Bill because it could potentially help with AI alignment.

Enjoy the meditation!

***** Probably the best way to explain my viewpoint is to explain what it would take to convince me that the whole intelligence explosion/AI risk is valid.

Humans have been at about the same level of intelligence for approximately 50000 years. That intelligence itself was not sufficient to directly lead to our increased capabilities. It indirectly led to it through development of knowledge and understanding, and it took humanity 50000 years to get to that point. But while it took milennia the first time, it only takes someone a few years of learning to get up to speed. That means the gap in humans' ability to understand things and their ability to /figure them out the first time/ is very large. And I think that you can't get away from this problem, that this fact is based on deep aspects of the nature of reality and information theory, rather than being a shortcoming of just humans.

In addition it's pretty obvious to me that humans' capability of understanding things is far above the extent to which we actually understand anything, i.e. anatomically modern humans can attain a vastly greater technological and scientific level than we currently are at. So I think the window of ideas that a superintelligence could come up with that humans would not, but that humans could understand once presented to them, is actually quite large as well, contrary to what seems to be the main view.

So that means that humans 'could' have theoretically performed actions that took them from the stone age to our current level in a single lifetime, right? Well yes and no, like so many things. You can't build the LHC in a day with 21st century technology, which is all it would have to work with to start out. We tend to make basic discoveries out-of-sequence, we uncover something that seems to be useless because we don't yet have the other discoveries or the advances in the tools we need to put it to use. But if we hadn't discovered it earlier, when we did get to the point we could make use of it we wouldn't know to go looking for it because it doesn't itself follow from that point. And those advances in tools take a lot of long iterative refinements to come into being.

The second part is somehwat related. People seem to think that a superintelligence would immediately be able to make things that work without having to go through the long process of testing them, or that it will kind of inherently have ideas that are /correct/, by virture of its intelligence. I don't think that this is how it works. It won't start out knowing any more than we do, and the only way it can learn more is to perform actual experiments, and try to build things, fail for various reasons, and revise its designs based on those results. There's no free way to expand your models to include the cases where they break down: you have to do it the hard way, which is to actually perform those actions and see what happens. Sure it would be /better/ at doing all these things than we are, but I don't think it could get to be so earth-shatteringly better so quickly, and here's why:

As someone who works in experimental science, I can say that the rate limiting factor of progress is not in understanding the results of our experiments, but rather in imagining the correct experiments to perform which will reveal phenomena that we did not anticipate (which I think for the reasons above is a HARD problem) and in the time it takes to actually perform the experiments, and perform them with the rigor required to be confident of the resutlts.

In other words, the way to convince me that AI risk is real is to demonstrate to me that the following two things are not inherent to the information-theoretic nature of reality but rather human-specific failings:

1: the fact that it is MUCH easier to understand something after the fact or with an already existing example or proof than it is to devise it from nothing. (examples: it's much easier to learn the concepts of relativity than it was for Einstein to devise them. We can understand the process of technological process and see how the changes in our society came from the technological changes we've experienced, but no one could predict this in advance.)

2: theoretical models can only work well when combined with actual experimentation. You can't design something and have it work the first time without testing it and modifying it based on what happens in the tests.

Hm. I think you're misunderstanding the power of an AI intelligence explosion: it's not that it will come up with things that we literally cannot grasp (not right away, anyway: maybe eventually). It's that it will learn and find patterns so much faster than we can, so fast that it will change the world.

You seem to be thinking of it as a "software issue," and saying that the nature of knowledge is the same regardless of who thinks it up. But humans are very much limited by our "hardware," or "wetware," rather: our brains are the most complex and powerful learning organ in the universe, as far as we're aware, but they have limits that cannot be easily improved. Machines are already faster and better in some ways than our brains. Not every way, but the list is growing, and there's really no reason yet to think it will stop.

This is true, but again, speed of thought and pattern matching is /important/ in coming up with better predictions/hypotheses to test. Humans may still have to manually perform the experiments the AI comes up with to find better antibiotics or synthesize the materials needed, but as an example, AI are already better than humans at diagnosis and treatment recommendations in medicine just from sheer ability to look through thousands of data points a second and hold them all in their "head" at once to find correlations. Humans can't do that. Unenhanced humans will NEVER be able to do that, no matter how easy it is to learn what the machine finds out.

** Red, no! That's the path to the dark side! Trust other intelligent people to be swayed by the evidence that swayed you, or else to have objections worth hearing!

Blue, no! That's another path to the dark side! Mary's and the instructor's concerns are completely reasonable, even if they portray you negatively! Also, it's good to have empathy more than just for show!

Leaf- okay, that's sort of Slytherin, but not really dark. Carry on.

I think the pace of the chapter worked well for a chapter like this, but I wouldn't want it all the time. It felt like it was getting the peices into place for future events. Not to say that it's unimportant, since significant things did happen, but it was a good montage between the bigger, slower story beats before and, presumably, after.

** Hey all, welcome back! A few things of note:

First, I got a lot of great feedback for last chapter, so thank you everyone who commented! Overall, a lot of people who were new to the concepts explained in the chapter seemed to have enjoyed it, while those who were already familiar made good points about it being too anvilicious. I made some edits to try to reduce that, and even took the whole segment about the pokeball stasis out, so if it pops up again in the future, that's the reason why.

Second, this chapter is my first attempt at consciously compressing the story to be more focused. It's the longest one yet at over 12k words, but each of the character perspectives in this one could easily have been their own chapter. I wanted to make a show of good faith to those who have been impatient with the speed of the plot progression, to acknowledge that I do hear the criticism and am trying to keep it in mind.

As a result, I'm particularly interested in feedback again, as I'd like to know if anyone thinks a part of the chapter isn't paced properly or feels as if it's lacking detail or context. It might take some time for me to strike the right balance, but I hope the chapter is still enjoyable for everyone.

Thanks for reading!

*** I had to reread the previous chapter, since I was confused by the "everyone's going to probably die in a generation or two?". Do they mean a not aligned AGI or a meteor/antibiotic resistant pandemic?

Also I am bewildered that they didn't clean the bucket before sitting to plan.

Said that, I enjoyed immensely the chapter. It's nice to see Red and Leaf pursuing their objectives and scale up while remaining human. Usually I was really taken in Blue's battles, but this seemed almost boring. I think just wanting to beat the League is too two dimensional now that the others had an upgrade on their motivations.

I don't know if you had already answered this but I'm really interested: how many of Red's mental techniques do you personally use, and what are your resources for good writing that you use for Leaf?

Think of this chapter like a bunch of pieces of a montage training scene in a movie. That said, too many chapters like this would make things feel rushed, but I thinking alternating between slower chapters that build on every detail and bit of dialogue and chapters like this one, that rapidly builds towards the overall arcs and goals of the story would be good.

The compression seems to have worked well. I didn't feel like there was anytrhing being left out of the chapters. An advantage of compression is that it allows you to hint at interesting thmes and elements of the characters without spelling them out explicitly.

This compresed style makes an interesting contrast to the Bill chapter. While I didn't have as much issues with teh content as other people it did seem to slow down a lot. Would it work to have them have mltiple meetings and conversations with Bill iterspersed through the week? So you could alternate between them and the training montage to give it lulls

There's really no explanation of them given at all in the games or anime or comics that I'm aware of, so it just makes me think it's a clear example of a gaming conceit that shouldn't be taken seriously. If I think of a way to implement it rationally though, I will :)

**** Some trinkets could have reasonably rational explanations, e.g. hot burning things for fire pokemon to boost their attacks, fertiliser for plant types, capcitors/batteries for electric, and maybe protective padding and or sharpened fang/claw attachments for the varous physical attackers. The ones with more complex effects like the choice items would be much harder to justify without bringing in literal magic.

Given how competent and optimising the people of this world are, its surprising that we don't see pokemon with more complicated equipment. E.g. have a pokemon wear armor or other protective gear. It might not be considered okay for competitive battling but could be invaluable in situations like the viridian fire, e.g. give a pokemon a fire retardant suit. You could also have metal spikes attached to them, pokemon holding spears in their mouths, bird pokemon dropping projectiles etc.

You could justify this in universe by saying that its very difficult to train pokemon to use tools, so only extremely well trained specialists can use them. So you could have fire brigades in protective gear but not have people pop one on every time they fight a fire type.

***** Some minor attachments is an interesting idea, and can make sense for items like Razor Claw, but in terms of armor, they would create a problem for pokeballs. Generally speaking, it's much more valuable to be able to withdraw and summon them at will, though some trainers might use armor for special pokemon that they keep out a lot, and in the olden times I'm sure it was done often.

** Wonderful. Ever since the ability was first teased, I've been waiting for Red to start realising his psychic potential. To me, psychics are one of the most underused aspects of the Pokemon fandom.

What is it like, being a psychic in the world of Pokemon. What is day to day life like when you can sense the minds of not just other humans, but the whole spectrum of Pokemon intellects? How is your ability to battle Pokemon affected, when you can actually feel the suffering of the animal you're giving orders to? Are you allowed to even go into casinos? If not, what else can you not do?

How do Pokemon react to you? Now that Red has begun training his passive reception, are the Abra going to prefer him over the others? I imagine they would; as psychic Pokemon, wouldn't another psychic mind seem the most familiar to them? Or perhaps not; apart from dark types, I imagine that some of the most successful competitors / predators an Abra could face would be other psychics. Perhaps they'll see him as a greater threat instead?

And finally, as we saw in Misty's chapter, being able to feel the emotions of other people doesn't seem to be an ability you can turn off. Once Red learns passive reception and fully opens his psychic 'ears', so to speak, how is that going to affect how he interacts with other people?

EDIT: Something I just saw rereading Misty's chapter. One guys talks about how he knew 'only psychics with a teleporter and trainers with flyers' could respond quickly enough to the Pokemon migration. Is training psychic pokemon to a high level so much easier for Psychics, that some abilities (such as teleportation) are really only utilised by human psychics in conjuction with their pokemon?

It's definitely easier, and opens up more possibilities. A normal trainer can train an abra to teleport them to a specific location by rote. A psychic can communicate with their abra to teleport them to a different place on command.

Mild preference for "he tries meditating again".

"Would" should be "will", or maybe just rephrase.

  Blue was having trouble getting Maturin to stay underwater for long enough to be a reasonable threat to water-breathing pokemon. This class is supposed to help him ease the squirtle into staying down longer and longer, but he finds the pace frustrating. He used a simulation program to try and train Maturin to stay underwater longer, but it only helped a little.
#+end_quote

The first sentence here should maybe be present tense.

#+begin_quote
  "I think I have an idea, actually. And I'm ready to order whenever the waiter arrives." Leaf gives the menu a perfunctory look through, then puts it aside. She's glad she can get a good salad fairly easily in most places in the city, but today she's in the mood for something else. Especially since she offered to pay.

  The water is cool without being cold, and Blue breathes out through his nose, bubbles rising to the surface as he sinks lower.

It's stuck out to me that the stuff that comes after the "and" doesn't really have much of a connection to what comes before, even though the syntax suggests a causal-ish link to me.

  They're approaching a wall of the pool soon, and Blue knows he can't let them reach it and limit Maturin's mobility.
#+end_quote

"approaching a wall soon" is normal I guess, but sounds weird to me, and "and limit Maturin's mobility" might be better as something like "as that would". That might be worse though actually... I don't know.

#+begin_quote
  If he feels sure of his pokemon's lung capacity, he has the advantage...

Would be better as "if he felt sure..., he would..." (this would be the subjunctive, not the past tense)

Maybe "Ok, I'm interested" or "Ok, you have my interest"

As for the tense issue, the story is set in the present tense, so things that happened in the past just use the simple past tense. "Had bought" is the past-past tense (I forgot the technical term for it), where your story is already in the past tense and you're referring to something even farther back :)

Not really a typo, but the formal definition of "nauseous" is "something that causes nausea". "Nauseated" means "affected by nausea". Obviously the common definition is different ("nauseating" is "causes", "nauseous" is "has"), so it's mainly a stylistic choice.

There's also a few usages of "incase", which I think should be "in case".

We haven't had an oppurtunuity to see how much he is willing to do to win, but I'd be surprised if he let any moral restraint stop him when he wanted to. That ruthlessness is either a very good or very bad trait depending what his long term goals are. He seems to be pursuing fame and power for its own sake at the moment.
