The author told me to post the link here. If you wish to contribute, feel free.


** I really love this series but I am slowly losing interest. One of the latest chapters was just full of angst with not a single pokemon shown in the chapter. I also find the Tatsumaki character jarring because of the obvious reference. Couldn't you name the character tatsu or something?

*** I like the psychic investigation stuff. I am also looking forward to seeing Blue again soon. It's a problem of web serials that if you have multiple arcs, some people like one better than the other and they can be left out for a little while. It's valid to lose interest in the parts you don't like, but don't worry, I'm sure the author will resolve the other stuff eventually.\\
Agree about the references being jarring, the Rei/Rey Mary Sue nod with her being good at everything is a little much for me.

**** To me the psychic investigation thing is a little double-edged. Like I've said before, the psychic phenomena are the most interesting aspect of this story to me, and easily the best I've seen it described in any work of fiction, so I'm really glad to see it getting more focus. However, TBH the whole mind-damaged Red thing is not so interesting to me. All in all I am liking this arc though.

**** Enough people have wrongly made this assumption about Rei that I'm considering changing her name. I probably should have seen it coming, since Jedi have psychic powers, but I wasn't shy about matching name spellings and descriptions for the others, so it's a little puzzling. I guess it's what I get for using so many references; it's expected that all of them must be.

***** Oh hey, I love your story. ^.^

It's a pleasant surprise that she isn't a Rey reference. But yeah, maybe the people saying Rey is a Mary Sue isn't as loud on your parts of the internet? When I read it, the parts talking about Rei being good at everything seemed like an obvious dig. Whatever ends up working for you is good.

***** If it makes you feel better, when I saw the claim that rei was a reference to Rey, my thought was "huh, really? That doesn't make any sense"

*** I'd say my own enjoyment of it is pretty roller-coaster-y, personally. Started off solid, then dipped enough (with the psychic Spinarak investigation and the paleontology museum stuff? + random didactics) that I dropped it. On rereading I managed to push through / skim that stuff until the Birdbringer battle, which is where my interest peaked, but these recent chapters have seen it wane again. Think I just find all the talking and pontificating a bit boring, and hope for a return to action soon. Psychics are my favorite Pokemon type, too -- I just want to see an Alakazam tossing a Snorlax around or something.

As for the OP topic -- kudos on the TVTropes page! Fic is goin' places! :D

*** It's good for reading in a bookish way, but not in a serially way. I find it interesting, though.

*** Apparently all the other psychics are references of varying obscurity, most of the rest just haven't been figured out.

***** Mmm, Pedestal. The central conflict was absolutely spectacular, but I felt a bit let down by the rather unrealistic sociological/political elements. Then again, it's the Pok√©mon world, so perhaps expecting their apparently extremely decentralized government to be able to cope with things well is a bit too optimistic.
