**** Thank you kindly; I've read further and I do like that I can come into the story 14 chapters in and not be completely lost, your writing is carefully descriptive and it seems you work to maintain the balance between level of detail and story momentum.

Found a false negative, right before Seti goes into the opening ceremony with his new threads"... a memorable moment at Prestige Academy would forever be tainted by the fact that he *wasn't* dressed shabbily"

I've been told before that it's better to have active (imperative) rather than passive (subjunctive) writing so I cut it down and took out the past tense and would (I really don't like could/should/would/subjunctive. If I have something to say, I need to say it, otherwise I'm going to annoy people by beating around the bush)

"Lovely... a memorable event at Prestige Academy, forever tainted by his unshapely dress."

Couldn't think of a good word to juxtapose his dress with prestige itself, obviously you probably won't want to use my sentence because *that's not fun/autonomous* but I hope it inspires you to continue improving your craft. Developing a passion is a worthwhile endeavor and while progress is oftentimes hard to measure from day to day I'm certain if you compare your first chapter with your most recent you will notice at least partial refinements to your prose.

Thanks again for writing!

***** This was well thought out, thank you!

The moment you said that you don't like using could/should/would, my first thought was, "Dang, how in the world can someone write without those words?" But then you showed me an example!

It's something I'll try to keep in the back of my head while I write, but I should mention that improvements for me may move slower than others because English was my worst subject in school, and I wasn't born in the United States!

As a reward, have a bunny: ()() ( '.') (..)(..)

** I liked the chapter more than the last one! it was a good chapter, thanks!

I have two questions/points of feedback. First is that you mention the META and anti-meta in the sports game. You say that a Most Effective Tactic Available team becomes so prevalent that fans want rule changes, but that those rule changes do not happen due to anti META teams. This means that the sport is not that old, or widespread. meta and standard types of play become stagnant with older games, and do not rapidly change in sports that don't change the rule-set. This is because sport games are mostly symmetrical. Video games, whilst the game itself is asymmetrical, the players are not. So even if the META changes, players can always adapt.

The sport you are describing is different. You have an asymmetrical game, because you have a variety of mancers on each team, and not just that, niches and tiers also make a massive difference. I don't think you could ever get a true "meta" in the sense of team composition. Top players can't change mancy type on a dime, and top teams would not just swich out every star player they have simply because some other team did well with a new composition. You play your strengths, and try to come up with counters with your team and players. I don't know how many players a team has in reserve and how switching players work, because that can shake up the game massively as well. This variety could make a single team dominate for a while, but I doubt that a single composition could dominate the sport for a while.

The second question is the pins. The crafter got a large C on the pin for crafter, and Seti got a large E for Exceptions. How does this work? We have the following types of mancers:

- Aeromancer
- Electromancer
- Pyromancer
- Hydromancer
- Geomancer
- Crafter (did they have a mancer title?)
- Vivamancer

This works, All the mancers have their own letter, but why does Exceptions get the E? I'd put that letter firmly in the Electromancer group, because they were there first.

It might be a minor change, but I'd give the Exceptions the X, it is not used for the mancers, and also serves as a discrimination mark, because they simply get an X, something associated with wrong answers.

As Yoda once said, "How embarassing, how embarassing"

I agree with you and will make the letter switch to X.

As for the META talk, it was the /outcry/ that quiets down when the anti-meta shows up. I watch a lot of Starcraft and Basketball, so I have a some idea of when rule changes happens, balancing, and so on. But with zero rules actually established for the sport, I won't go any deeper here.

** Something I'm noticing happen ocassionally - you tend to use "casted" as the past tense of "to cast". That's an archaic usage, and modern convention is just "cast". E.g. "He casted the spell." vs "He cast the spell."

** Hi, just read all available chapters in RR. Some gripes from otherwise very good work.

Seti challenging people into challenging him sounds like decision at the heat of moment. If you spend some time rationalizing his decision before he said what he said would make it more rationalist. But that's minor, as in trying to fit your work into this subreddit. It's more pressing that this scene hold much similarity to Shokugeki no Soma (because Soma left the deepest impression on me). I think few deliberations is warranted to make it feel a bit different. I read at other reply stating that that's possibly his niche doing backlash. If that's your intention, it would be great. But I checked chapter 12 to see if 'the suspiciously a backlash' has a tell similar to 'the definitely a backlash.' I see none.

I've seen you used the term butler quite freely. I always thought butler is not dissimilar to the head of staff, attend to strictly the master/mistress of the house. Using the term chauffeur or footman would be nicer, but servant would be appropriate catch all if you prefer them stay low profile.

Your molding so similar to shaping exercise of Mother of Learning (or similar stuff from other works). Not a problem. But explanation around them is lacking. While I, who adore MoL, instinctively know what you're trying to do with it, I imagine others would not. So, expansion on concept?

Reading your works left me with the feeling, "Hey, I've read this kind of stuff before." several times. I was reminded with Harry Potter and Worm, among other. I suspect it's because you played your tropes straight. I guess you could do with some play-around. But in moderation. As your execution is excellent as it is.

#+end_quote

This is an issue with web serials, as this is addressed directly in the next chapter. But before that, I'm attempting to make a rational fiction, not a rational/ist/. A lot of people have their thoughts on what the MC did, but a few others correctly guessed that this was a result of his niche backlashing on him. One portion of a rational fiction is that the rules are consistent, so things that happened can be guessed by readers who keep things in mind.

Right you are, I'll have to address and edit those portions later.

  Moldings...But explanation around them is lacking.
#+end_quote

This will be addressed directly once the aeromancy classes start in Prestige.

#+begin_quote
  Tropes...I guess you could do with some play-around.
#+end_quote

This would be like reading a fantasy story with elves and dwarves and telling the author to mix it up with more unique and less cliche races. What I'm writing is a story that I myself would like to read so I include tropes I enjoy. Tropes in itself isn't a bad thing, though some may be more annoyed than others with certain ones simply because they've seen it so often.

Thanks for reading what I have so far!

**** I think it is because Tyronn (Tyrone) is a traditionally black name in the U.S and he is a inarticulate sports star. His race was never discussed. Tyrone is also a traditional Irish name and from the way he spoke I assumed that he was whatever Irish derivative existed in this world. Beyond that I do not think that Tyronn is a stupid or one dimensional character either. He might be arrogant and have a black and white view of the world but Seti failed to manipulate his emotions meaning he has more willpower or self control than other people at the exams.

I think the assumptions [[/u/sampatrick15][u/sampatrick15]] makes about Tyronn in this series, as well as his friends, is pretty damn racist. He should really take a second to sit down and consider editing his comment.

His name is [[/u/sampatrick15][u/sampatrick15]] so he could be taking about the stereotypes against Irish people. In all seriousness it is probably just a coincidence with the names. I seriously doubt the author had any prejudiced intent by naming a antagonist Tyronn.
