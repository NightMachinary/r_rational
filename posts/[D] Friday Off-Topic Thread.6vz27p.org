Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Today I'm going to attempt the impossible: convincing readers of [[/r/rational]] that they should watch a CW musical comedy.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is a show about a smart yet unbalanced woman who moves away from her high status job in Manhattan to pursue her ex-boyfriend from high school in California ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57ZDNuakBsQ][the first song of the show]] is actually a good taste of what you're in for). The show is relentlessly satirical of typical rom-com cliches. Additionally, while the show's characters are all irrational, it is in consistent ways that all get explored by the show (in this regard, I'd compare it to Bojack Horseman). The first two seasons are up on Netflix, with a confirmed third on the way.

The interesting thing about musicals is that they are uniquely suited to exploring the complexities of a single moment. There are lots of times in rational fiction where a character wishes they had more time to think things through, but things are moving too quickly. Musicals are able to sidestep this issue by stretching a single moment into a song, whereas a nonmusical equivalent would require an out-of-place monologue.

Again, I wouldn't call this show rational. That said, some of the songs are at least a very responsible dissection of irrationality. For example, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMY0MTTv16E][this send-up of dude rock]] is all about the main character planning on playing in a ping pong tournament, and hoping that her performance will win over the object of her affections. With the song, there's a chance to look at the absurdity of what it is she's hoping for.

Now, to anticipate reasons you might not like it: 1) it's a CW show, so not as high-budget or polished as other shows. 2) it's a musical, with two songs per episode, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea. That said, I think it's rad, and woefully underrated.

*** I love that show, though I thought the first season was better than the second, and it's a bit uneven at times. If the part of [[/r/rational]] you like is deconstructions of genres, then Crazy Ex-Girlfriend will probably be your kind of thing. Plus it's got a lot of good musical numbers to it.

**** In my experience, CW seems to have a problem with maintaining quality after the first season. I thought both Arrow and Flash had excellent first seasons, the second had flaws I associate with a bad soap opera, and the third opened with an episode I hated so much that I knew the show would never recover.

***** I think for this show each season is meant to change the central focus. Season one is a subversion of romantic comedies and their tropes, season two is [[#s][s]] and season three seems to be headed in the direction of [[#s][s]].

So some of the variability there comes from the strength of the season premise. This is probably also the case for other shows that want to /actually/ move things forward instead of staying in perpetual stasis.

****** First, the formatting on your spoilers is messed up, or at least it wasn't showing up at all for me on mobile or desktop.

Second, I think I mostly agree with you about season 2 not being as good. I will say that I think season 2 had both higher highs and lower lows. For example, I thought that the song in season 2 that was in the style of 60's music was the epitome of what the show had to offer, to the point that I seriously considered saying "fuck it" regarding spoilers and linking it. On the other hand, "Man Nap" was a special kind of awful.

I think the biggest issue with season 2 is that, instead of one big arc like season 1, it was three smaller arcs, which ended up making the show seem a bit directionless. All that said, I have high hopes for season 3.

ETA: I think the formatting issue is that you need something between the brackets when doing a spoiler.

** As of Friday morning at 11AM, my name is now on the deed of a building. This is a very strange experience, and I do feel a bit like that xkcd comic where the girl wonders who in their right mind would trust her with a building. Also I went back to school this week, so that is overlapping with moving because having many stressful, life-changing events happen at once seems excellent.

Also, I got the number of a girl without fishing for it, which is incredibly weird. Weirder was that she was the person walking my parents and I through signing the stacks of paperwork, and it's all thanks to Magic: the Gathering.

My day was surreal.

**** The lady we bought the place from brought a family friend with her to help out (I'm not exactly sure why, she may have been 85 years old, but she was still sharp as a tack and the only reason she was moving was because her friends couldn't handle the stairs any more), so in the lull where my mother was signing documents and nobody else was (long story short, once I get out of school, have a job where I earn real money, and have a credit score from paying utilities we will refinance so the mortgage is in my name), we got to talking and the subject of my TOTALLY NORMAL AND NOT AT ALL ADDICTIVE relationship with Magic came up.

Turns out, our escrow officer also plays Magic a lot. She wouldn't talk about it at work, but she did write her personal number on the back of her business card and give it to "us."

Our realtor (a family friend) noted that he had never once seen that happen. I do not think he was totally oblivious on the subject, though. However, it's a toss-up whether my mother was. She vies with me for "most oblivious sapient being in the universe" on the regular.

I have called once, to no response. I will probably try again in a few days.

**** My parents live in a parsonage, and thus aren't building up equity. It's also several states away from me, and they have to go to meetings here on a semi-regular basis (on top of wanting to visit me occasionally). By buying a house, they fix both of those problems.

The current plan is that, once I have a job (and a credit score), we will refinance the mortgage in my name. Then, once my parents retire, we will either split the price or I will pay them for what they put into it so they can have a good down payment on something.

On the other thing, Magic came up in one of the lulls where my mom was signing mortgage paperwork and nobody else was doing anything. It just so happened that our escrow officer walking us through all the paperwork also plays a lot of Magic. She couldn't talk about it at work, so she gave us her cell number. I am somewhat certain my mother was totally oblivious as to what was happening there.

One call has been made, to no answer. I will probably try again either today or tomorrow.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Work has begun!  Tho not with a bang but a whimper.  In Discord a while back I decided that the best two candidates to begin work on were the combat system and the map system.  Since both of these utilize the end product of the other without being a dependency per se, it seems like it will be nice to have a couple of different things that I can move back and forth on as my motivation sees fit.

That said, I decided to start with combat since that's ultimately the part of this game that is the most attractive to me.  As I pondered what first to tackle, I thought units would be the first thing, as I figured that units would perform actions that would ultimately affect other units.  As I drilled deeper, I realized that the stat system is probably a good place to being--not flashy, but really what is a unit but a bundle of stats?  

I at first thought that I would start with a sort of hybrid integer/decimal stat class that would act like an integer for most intents and purposes, but would behind the scenes be a fixed-point decimal.  This would allow for incremental increasing of a stat without being plagued by the infamous floating-point errors that are the source of many a programmer's headache.  As I discussed it on Discord, however, it was brought to my attention that stats are an XGEF-level concept, i.e. not just for Renegade.  Once I thought about this, I realized that, while the hybrid stat is useful (and will still be implemented), I need to support other kinds of stats, for modders if nothing else.

I started designing the most core classes during my spare time at work in a standard text editor, only to discover once I had gotten home and attempted to compile my sketchy code that some of the assumptions I had made were unfounded.  Long story short, I am unable to represent numeric stats in a fully generic fashion, which means that each basic numeric type of stat needs to have its code, well, hand-coded.

This was unacceptable to me, so I began to explore other options and in so doing stumbled upon meta-programming via code templates.  Basically I can write a program in a sort of bastard child of C# and XML that generates code for me in a powerful (but arcane) manner.  So I have written (and mostly finished) a code template that generates one stat wrapper per numeric type in C#, all eleven of them.  The code I had to write was only about 300 lines (probably the size that two hand-coded stat types would be), and the generated code is somewhere close to 5,000 lines.  

I'm actually quite impressed with what metaprogramming lets me do, and I will certainly be utilizing it in the future as another tool in the toolbox.  I am, however, /less/ impressed with the ease of use--for instance, the code templates have neither autocomplete nor even syntax highlighting, so it feels like 2002 again, coding in notepad.exe.

Still, the flexibility it gives me is undeniable. Should I find that some aspect of these 11 classes needs to change, it's simply a change in one part of one file, instead of spread out through 11 very similar ones.  

Anyway.  Those basic building-block stat wrappers will be complete soon, and upon them I'll build the hybrid stat, EVs, and other more high-level stat concepts.  Once that's complete I have a basic unit as soon as I throw a bunch of stats together.

*** I gave up about halfway through. There was a /lot/ that was just plain bad in that first half though. Some of it comes from trying to compress a complex plot down to a 100 minute runtime, which I'm at least a little sympathetic to, but most of it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of what made the original compelling.

And yeah, part of that comes from the fact that the original was at least making an attempt at being a fair play mystery, if not rational fiction, with a focus on thought and the consequences of thought.

There's a part near the start of the second act where [[#s][spoilers]] That shows basically all the hallmarks of a non-thinking work of fiction, or at least a non-thinking protagonist.

***** I actually did end up finishing it, mostly because I think if you're going to talk shit about a creative work you should make some effort to see all of it before dumping on it. So I've been asking myself "how can they so thoroughly ruin something" for most of today.

*Spoilers for Death Note follow:*

--------------

If you're taking an ~800 minute anime down to a ~100 minute movie, you need to cut a bunch of stuff. What they /should/ have done was to cut almost everything that wasn't about Light and L. Near and Mello, gone. Misa, gone. FBI stuff, mostly out, along with most of the internal police force stuff. Keep in a B-plot of Light and his father, but put the primary focus on that /single/ dynamic.

Instead, this movie was /largely/ about Light and Misa (renamed to Mia). Light gets changed to be a loser with a tragic past and reason to hate criminals that "get away with it", Mia is this sociopathic cheerleader that likes the power and meaning that come from killing and wants the Death Note for herself, and everyone gets dumbed down because the writer wasn't smart enough for a smart plot. The climax of the movie is about Light and Mia, not Light and L.

The real question is why the writer of the screenplay decided to do it like this. My /guess/ is that it was either market research, or the crappy cousin to market research, producers and directors making guesses about what the market wants without actual focus testing.

I can imagine people in a room talking about making this film and saying, "But we have to give him motivation for killing people, otherwise he's too unsympathetic! Let's make it so his mom was killed by a mob boss who got off on a technicality!" or saying "Light can't kill police officers, it has to be Mia so he can be the sympathetic".

A lot of misunderstandings of the source material, combined with trying to compact things down, and I'm sure this turd of a movie cost millions of dollars to make, so it's amazing to me that they get so much about basic storytelling wrong. But it happens a lot in Hollywood.

****** I just finished watching it as well, and only forced myself through the last half for the same reasons as you (and because the casting of Willem Defoe was so excellent, I felt obliged to give it a chance).

I agree with all your points - as far as a retelling of the Death Note story (or even just a sensible, enjoyable movie in general), it was godawful.

*Unless...*what if it's a /parody/, of what Death Note would have been like if America/Hollywood had written it?

Consider how over-the-top dumb, and/or cliche teen action-drama, the story is...(*/spoilers for Netflix's Death Note below/*)

- Light skims over all the rules, because "they're boring" and "there are so many"
- One of Light's first uses of the Note to impress a girl he barely knows, and he instantly trusts her and tells her everything about it
- Light makes NO attempt to plan ahead or hide himself - so L actually figures out Kira's in Seattle right away, and then a few days later more or less 100% knows it's Light
- Light's father impedes the investigation and stops L from capturing Light, because he can't believe that his son's guilty (contrast that to Light's father in the original Death Note, who was completely willing to trust and follow L once he understood the logic behind his decisions, and was willing to actually kill his son and then himself if the investigation showed Light was Kira)
- Light's /only/ attempt to figure out L's identity was to write down "Watari figures out who L is, tells me, then dies." It's the laziest, sloppiest attempt to beat L possible. And after that fails, Light completely stops trying.
- Instead of a psychological game of cat and mouse, L and Light's final showdown is a frickin /footrace chase scene through downtown Seattle/
- Instead of finding evidence and definitive proof of Light's guilt, L just has an emotional breakdown and decides to shoot Light with a gun

If they used most of this script, and instead made a comedy/parody (a commentary on the terrible writing in Hollywood teen action-dramas, through the lens of Death Note), it likely would have been way more enjoyable than what we got.

I just don't know who this version was for...the writers clearly wanted a different story than the original, so that fans of the original wouldn't know what's coming. But then they also left out all the tone/plot devices/psychological cat-and-mouse thriller elements that drew fans to the original Death Note in the first place. It's almost like a room of Hollywood writers played [[https://icebreakerideas.com/telephone-game/][the Telephone Game]] with the original DN story, except each one also added in one new dumb idea.

******* This comment actually ties in very well to a conversation I was having with my friend yesterday. Disclaimer: I have never actually gotten around to watching Death Note; I've just very thoroughly osmosised it from my friends and acquaintances talking about it a lot.

I was coming up with a pitch, essentially, for Death Note as a western cartoon - not just a cartoon that's literally animated, voiced, and produced in America, but a cartoon that hems closer to western cartoons' structures and tropes. It wouldn't be /wholly/ episodic - there'd be loads of continuity and running plots and so on - but it would be /very/ episodic, and much more comedic in tone than the original. Think Death Note as something along the lines of Gravity Falls or Rick And Morty.

Some episode ideas (both stuff I spent a while coming up with and some stuff right off the top of my head):

- Pilot episode. Establishes Light's character, establishes the Shinigami stuff (a major comic relief element). Light finds the Death Note, and clumsily kills a few people with it testing it out. He is immediately shell-shocked by the great cosmic power dumped on him, but ultimately resolves to use it to promote law and order.
- Light is killing a gang of criminals one by one, and their family and friends keep committing worse and worse atrocities in their memory, continually frustrating Light until he can't find out their names, so instead he herds them onto a bus and kills the driver at a turn on a cliffside. Meanwhile, in the B-plot, Light's dad grows increasingly baffled by the strange and unexplained deaths, and L is introduced at the end in the stinger as a new detective joining the case.
- Light meets Ryuk, and they really don't get along very well - Light correctly sees Ryuk as an amoral being who doesn't care about his agenda; meanwhile, Ryuk keeps trying and failing to pressure Light to kill less carefully to produce more entertainment. They have some kind of wacky adventure together and settle into an uneasy but stable relationship.
- Light's classmates want him to come to a Misa Misa concert, but he's too busy killing people. Eventually he basically accidentally stumbles into ruining and then saving the concert, creating the Kira persona, and gaining Misa's devotion.
- Light meets a Malagami who subtly inspires people to do bad things (it's a running gag, by the way, that there are all kinds of gods who have their own notes that do various inane things). Light is faced with the cognitive dissonance of simultaneously believing in a rigid justice-based moralist system and believing that there's no such thing as free will and evil is basically the result of foreign gods interfering with people's brains. The end of the episode reveals that Malagamis are all over Light.
- First episode with L as the main antagonist. Pretty standard, albeit funny, game of cat-and-mouse; the trick with Lind L. Tailor is the cold open, Light responds to this by having a criminal kill themselves and claim to be Kira, and it just keeps escalating and getting crazier from there.
- Misa attempts to start a legit Cult Of Kira (which falls apart by the end of the episode), and this leads Ryuk to show Light the afterlife, which is a really shitty dystopia of some kind. Light gets lost there or something and has to find his way out, meeting several of the people who he's killed in the process. He openly rolls his eyes at the universe for trying to make him feel remorse.
- Light tries to assassinate a politician, but misspells his name too many times, making him immune to the Death Note. He's going to give up, but then he finds a Body Note dropped by a Biogami and uses it to shrink down to the size of a blood cell to enter the politician at a rally and assassinate him from the inside. L appears, finds the Body Note, deduces that it was Kira who used it, and follows Light into the politician's body in an attempt to save him and catch Kira.
- Light accidentally drops his Death Note, and it's quickly picked up and stolen by a powerful but stupid Yakuza boss who uses it to his own ends. Light must retrieve it with the help of Shonengami who invoke various action tropes. Meanwhile, in the B-plot, L finds a Moon Note dropped by Moonigami, and uses it to possess the moon, hoping to spot Kira from the sky; he is quickly disappointed to learn that he can't make out any details from that high up and, moreover, that he can't figure out how to return to his human body. These plots converge when a temporarily-indestructible Light gets blown all the way around the moon by an explosion.
- Misa goes on a date with a masked man falsely claiming to be Kira. Light tries and fails to break up the situation by killing various nearby people in inconvenient, moodkilling ways, but it falls apart on its own as Misa realizes what's going on. Misa learns that Light is Kira and realizes that she can't really have a relationship with him for fear of attracting attention to him.
- Light systematically identifies and kills members of an international conspiracy that controls most countries, while in the B-plot, L interrogates Misa, who taunts him by talking about how competent and powerful Light is - talk that's backed up by the A-plot.
- A Plotigami uses a Swap Note to switch Light and L's bodies; Light doesn't realize who he was switched into until the end of the episode after he's already switched back, and he never bothered to get L's name; L, on the other hand, immediately realizes that he was switched into Kira, but slowly fails to find evidence supporting it and decides that his initial assumption was wrong.
- The Malagami are back, and this time they're giving Light and L "Dream Notes" that let them write other people's dreams for them! Dream Notes are much more lenient than Death Notes, in that you don't actually need to know the name or face of the person you're targeting, you just need to have a general idea of who they are. A battle-of-increasingly-taunting-dreams culminates in one of them fucking up a phrase and giving every single person on the planet the same extremely specific and embarrassing dream on the same night.
- Misa Misa Gets Shinigami Eyes episode. She takes the deal, tries to find L, fails, and then discovers that knowing when everyone's going to die really fucks with her ability to live life normally. Probably minimal presence of Light and L in this episode. I think at the end of the episode she meets a homeless guy who /also/ took the Shinigami eyes, and is about to die; he refuses to tell her when she's going to die.
- Two-parter season one finale episode! L narrows down Kira's identity to "it's pretty obviously Light", and convinces Light's father to let him move in, ostensibly to go to school but actually to collect evidence. Light continually has to prevent L from finding his Death Note, while L continually has to prevent Light from finding his name. Ultimately, Misa comes in and finds L's name, but while Light is distracted by this revelation, L finds and takes his Death Note. There is a tense standoff that culminates in L dying. However, due to some Death Note rules technicality, L is unable to /truly/ die, and instead he becomes a shade that only Death Note users can see - this sets up the status quo for season two, wherein L is a ghost trying to act as Light's conscience and convince him to stop.
- There would be some other episodes in season one; these are just what I came up with in my first two brainstorming sessions.

** I screwed my sleep schedule all to pieces and woke up yesterday at 5 in the afternoon, so I decided the best way to keep myself awake after 9am (when my body would naturally be ready to fall asleep) would be to be in the middle of doing something time-consuming but low-effort.

So, I decided to watch all 8 Harry Potter movies.

I skipped forward a /lot/ during CoS and pushed through that 2.5 hour movie in just under an hour (I recently read the first 3 books (I didn't continue with the rest because I just read the whole series like 6 or 9 months ago and I just feel like it's too soon, so I abandoned it for /the Book of the Long Sun/ by Gene Wolfe (which you can read for free at openlibrary.org)) and I couldn't bear to sit through the plodding nothingness of that plot again so soon)... I confused myself with the parentheses, so we're going to move on.

At the moment, I have Goblet of Fire paused. I'd forgotten how terrible it is.

This might change, but I'm pretty sure I think the movies rank as follows, from worst to best:

#8: Chamber of Secrets

#7: Goblet of Fire

#6: Sorcerer's Stone

#5: Order of the Phoenix

#4: Deathly Hollows Pt. 1

#3: Half-Blood Prince

#2: Deathly Hollows Pt. 2

#1: Prisoner of Azkaban

If anyone wants to agree or argue with the ranking I've presented, I probably won't continue the conversation until tomorrow because I have over 8 hours of movie left to push through, and then I'm going to sleep for hopefully like 9 or 10 hours (for reference, it's currently half past noon where I live).

** I'm four episodes into JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood and I'm already hooked. I know the first arc has issues and the series gets much better later on, but it is already pandering to cliches I like while also giving me things I never knew I wanted. I always thought fans of the show were being overly vague about what they liked about it, only to find out that I have trouble explaining why I like it. I've always enjoyed serial stories that start off with a simple premise only to go completely gonzo as more weirdness is introduced, but I've never seen it done in a story that wasn't a comedy like Sluggy Freelance, madcap stream-of-conscious like Axe Cop, or a goofy kids show like Dragon Ball. I fear I may never be the same after watching this series.

JoJo has a style that's all its own. Every single image leaps off the screen, I've never seen so many colors and textures in a frame at once. Even in darkness I get to see 10 shades of dark blue and green, and a house fire is drawn in purple for one shot just to add visual variety. The effect is only heightened by the unbelievably hammy acting, which the English dub gets down perfectly. I don't think I've ever seen animated characters compete over who can chew the most scenery, but these men seem determined to dramatically pose each other to death and it will never stop being entertaining. These are the kinds of things that normally made for "so bad, it's good" media, but I never get the feeling that I like this show ironically.

I can't remember the last time I watched a show were finishing one episode made me want to watch the next one this badly. It's starts as a cartoonishly over the top melodrama, then becomes a gentlemanly Victorian pulp, then adds in some gory gothic horror with vampires, and when I last checked it's now about magical martial artists fighting monsters. And that's just the first four episodes. I need to see what happens next! Even if it's more of what I've already seen, I'd be fine with that. I know the next part of the arc has crap pacing, but I don't think I'll care since I'm already addicted. I tried to apply logic to the show at first, and my enjoyment of it, but the more I watch the less I care because whatever the hell JoJo is, I want more of it.

  BERLIN (Reuters) - Protecting people rather than property or animals will be the priority under pioneering new German legal guidelines for the operation of driverless cars, the transport ministry said on Wednesday.

  German regulators have been working on rules for how such vehicles should be programmed to deal with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident.

  Under new ethical guidelines - drawn up by a government-appointed committee comprising experts in ethics, law and technology - the software that controls such cars must be programmed to avoid injury or death of people at all cost.

The "self driving cars ethical conundrum" to me is the "should it save the 1 driver or the family of 5 on the footpath", which is easy to do trolley problem style but the thought of my car wanting to kill /me/ instead of 5 random jerks is not comforting (though the thought of someone else's car wanting to save them instead of my entire family is also not comforting).

When people get all shitty about this "trolley problem" IRL I point out it's such a hugely contrived scenario, when self driving cars are properly integrated in society they will no doubt have a network where they can share data on the road state (so a car 10km away will know that your family of 5 is enjoying their lovely walk long before it ever goes near you) and be able to act accordingly.

** After ScottAlexander's post on slatestarcodex about Nootropics, and my own battles with depression/anxiety, I decided to look into building a nootropic stack to help me out.

My biggest issue with my depression, is sleep. Thus, I decided to tackle that with:

5g of: [[https://www.ceretropic.com/adrafinil-powder]]

On top of that, I wanted to try something which would help me in my studies, so I bought:

[[https://www.ceretropic.com/solution-sample-pack]]

Lastly, out of curiosity, I purchased 10g of:

[[https://liftmode.com/yohimbine-hcl-10-grams-0-35-oz-98-pure-fblm.html]]

Adrafinil /freaking works/. I went from falling asleep about 2 pm to going all day without getting drowsy. It's not a standard caffeine stimulant, however. Additionally, something else in the stack is working really well, because I went from holding a neutral face 24/7 to smiling naturally for the first time in months.

As far as Yohimbine goes, it pumps my heartrate up from a resting 75 to resting 95 heartrate. It's clearly a stimulant.

If you're looking for an energy so you can actually make it through the day, or starting graveyard and want a little more oomph, I highly, highly recommend picking up Adrafinil/Modafinil or Yohimbine.

That said, review the effects noted on examine.com, and see if they provide what you want.

At the start, the main character is a random space merchant. And the initial chapters come off as a bit of generic sci-fi porn.

Then, a couple chapters in, I started noticing some apparent "continuity errors". (eg "Wait, did character really look like that?")

Going forward, you realize that the "errors" are entirely intentional, and part of an oddly-detailed backstory for the universe. Some of the apparently throw-away details in the first chapters turn out to be relevant 400k words later.

And, at some point, you realize that the generic "sex on a boat, but in space" story has spiraled off into a huge, impressive epic.

*** Rationalesque smut with a legit plot (Buffy/Stargate, I've never watched either of those shows and had no idea who any of these people were, but I found the fic enjoyable regardless):

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1246519/chapters/2562553]]

Pure smut, one shot:

** When you're sick is there any media you reach for?

The Harry Potter audio books read by Jim Dale are my go to source of comfort.

*** My full pitch for What I Learned at SRU is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][here]], but it's easily one of the most consistently relaxing and life-affirming stories I've ever read. It has enough surface-level appeal from the slice of life to put me in a trance, while still having enough subtly to its characters to occupy my wandering thoughts. I don't like rereading books, so it helps a lot that this story is really long and really easy to pick up and put down.

***** [[https://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/#/home][Here's the downloader I use.]] I'm glad to hear you'll be checking this out, in the time since I posted my original recommendation the story had only gotten better. It isn't afraid to have characters deal with darker problems, which the author has personal experience with, but the development they go through as a result of it continues to make me feel hope in the face of adversity.

*** Those Jim Dale audiobooks are great! When it comes to comfort repeat media, I'm also a fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy audiobooks, read by Douglas Adams.

*** I listen to long podcasts, because it's about the only time I can sit (or lay down) and listen to something for hours without feeling like I'm wasting my time. When I'm sick my job is to do nothing, so that my body can get on with repairing itself, so I don't feel guilty.

I prefer Dan Carlin's Hardcore History but he doesn't publish those as often as I get sick (not that I get sick very often, but he publishes even less frequently) and I haven't gotten around to buying his archived episodes.

*** /Young Wizards/ books, novellas, fic, etc. And then I try to post to [[/r/errantry]] :)

They're just so... uplifting, reading about a universe where everything is flawed but that's OK and everything - literally everything - is going to be alright in the end.
