** Is anyone else a bit nervous by a brand new account asking a potentially charged question in a very niche subreddit?

Anyway, most of the stuff here is posted pseudonymously. So we have no real clue.

*** It's no problem and I don't think people should be downvoting this just because it appears like a charged question. The only fear is that these kind of discussions may end up in SJW or other meta subreddits, those subs are toxic and should be avoided like cancer.

*** I should also point out that women [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_speculative_fiction][are a minority in speculative fiction]], which is the vast majority of what's posted here. So to answer the implied question of "Why is the gender ratio skewed towards male authors in this subreddit?" you'd have to answer the question of "Why is the gender ratio skewed in speculative fiction?"

And the answer to that question is probably the same answer as the question of why women [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_STEM_fields#Gender_imbalance_in_STEM_fields][are underrepresented in STEM disciplines]] - which I am 95% sure comes down to the ways that society has historically discouraged women from those pursuits in various ways.

** I have just realized that nobody has mentioned The Steerswoman's Road on here. Brb, gotta fix that.

EDIT: Okay. The Steerswoman's Road. :P

*** It's been posted in the past, actually. But rare reposts are just fine with this subreddit, I believe.

** Er... this is the internet. The vast majority of authors (people) don't have a gender on the internet.

Why do you need this information? Do you need racial information as well? Religious? Ethnicity? Favorite color?

Just naming a bunch of other factors that that are totally irrelevant to authoring fiction.

**** I apologize for the snark, but I can't think of a need for that kind of information... except to troll.

I'd hope rational folk understand that the gender of the author is very unlikely to affect their reading experience. So... what else is there?

****** That'd be why I offered up other possible features you could ask about. You can be curious, I'm just hesitant.

Like I said earlier though, most authors don't have a gender as far as I know.
