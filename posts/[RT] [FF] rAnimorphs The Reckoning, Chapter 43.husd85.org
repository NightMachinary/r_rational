** Jesus, being Rachel right now sounds absolutely terrifying. Being constantly disoriented without full and consistent control of yourself, awareness of your surroundings and circumstances, or access to your own memories would be enough of a nightmare even without being in the middle of an interstellar war with alien body-snatchers where shape-shifting is your best weapon.

In other news, that looked like a Howler. I won't be surprised if their situation is somewhat changed from canon, but it certainly /looked/ like it was treating a life-and-death battle as a game, right down to the way it reacted to its own death.

** /Excellent./

Thoughts in no order:

-I 100% fell for the /fungible species/ juke. I was all, “Helmacrons? What? Guess we'll see!” And then it turned out to be everyone's favorite screaming lava monsters. Love it. So, looks like V3 learned how to build Howlers when Crayak signed the data with the 3D model all those zillions of chapters ago. Now V3 has reverse-engineered them, and was inspired by their fungibility processes to control his clonetrollers. That's amazing. Does this mean there was a #26-adjacent adventure offscreen, and one of the other Animorphs planted /waving/ in the Howlers' brain the way Jake did kissing in canon?

-Rachel [in Michael and Holly from The Office voice]: “No more brain damage!” Well, less, anyway. Nice trick with that bone in the Howler. Lucky it deafened her bear so it couldn't keep discombobulating her.

-Kids should definitely /not/ be going through puberty, morph-capable, in the middle of a war. Dates should be, like, getting coffee and going to a movie. Not turning into a corgi and playing fetch with your mentally handicapped girlfriend. How weird! They're gonna be so poorly adjusted after all this trauma :(

-Incidentally, while it's nice that they're dating and everything, I kinda (selfishly) hope it doesn't take much screentime. I find myself pretty consistently bored by romance plots in my fiction, especially when it comes to kids. I recognize that that's mostly just a me thing, though.

So pumped for more chapters, now that everything is finally coming to a close - but of course, it'll come as a terrible blow when it all really does end. Such duality

** I did pour a bit of my heart and soul into that one comment speculating about how Andalite thought speech is uniquely suited to break down the identity barrier between yeerk and host. If that counts, I'd like a cameo as JJREEVE (if it's another reddit like chapter) or just Reeve if it's not.

And with this wonderful new update I have the urge to speculate even more. The Holwers, in canon what they did was for fun. The killing was all a game for them. Given how this one acted after getting stabbed it seems to be holding up. Waving goodbye to your opponent seems kinda like the Howler's way if saying "good game". The question is why? Why are they so cavalier about possibly dying? It's one thing to like fighting when you are winning, but to relish it just as much when you lose is a strange thing.

I think it ultimately stems from their shared memory thing. Since every Howler can remember what any other Howler did with it's life they might identify as actually being those other Howlers. They'd still probably have individual quirks and personalities, and it's unlikely that any one Howler could remember the whole race all at once. But for the individuals dying might not register as the end of their existence. Since all that they have done and are will live on in another of the species it's more like respawning in a video game.

So perhaps you have a Howler that considers itself The Clever One, it likes to trick its enemies into clever traps or ambushes, and loves trying out new tactics to keep opponents off balance. It remembers former Howlers that also considered themselves to be The Clever One, and indeed considered itself to actually be the same person as those other Howlers, just as it considers future Howlers who remember it in particular to be their future lives. For a Howler, death isn't cessation of bodily functions, it's when none of the living Howler bodies spend time thinking about/remembering the memplex that served as an attracting point for a Howler identity.

** Love love love love love love love!

I was so ready for the next chapter to be Tobias or Visser; this was an awesome surprise.

One thing I love about this story is how it's filled with syndrome nods to canon plot points, despite a completely different plot. If I'm right, we're at about the right point in the story for "Rachel gets an enticing offer from Crayak"; so it'll be interesting to see what she pulls out of that Howler morph.

A few notes/questions:

1. Did the kids consider that they could keep Rachel safeish/stop possibly worsening brain damage by subsuming her into a morph? I don't think they've even talked much about the fact that every morph is a walking stasis chamber.

2. Are the dialog tags in the morph conversation reversed? Shouldn't Marco's thoughts be in italics since Rachel is reading them directly, and Rachel's half of the conversation in <thought-speak tags>?

3. Have Rachel and Helium met yet? Have they considered having Perdão go in and try to repair the damage directly?

Another thing I really love is getting to see inside so many alien minds. What was researching/writing like? I really hope we get a Howler and/or Pemalite POV soon.

If my comments over the years are worthy of a cameo, there's a little nine-year-old version of me who's still in here somewhere, and he would love nothing more than for there to be a good guy David in the Animorphs universe.

*** re: 1, my headcanon is that Marco considered it but they decided against it because they're all running around all over the place and having a brain-damaged Rachel tumbling out of your morph at an inopportune moment is :(

re: 2, in Chapter 15 when we saw a Marco morph come alive from the Marco morph's perspective, I had the viewpoint character's thoughts in italics and the controlling realMarco's thoughts in brackets.

In Chapter 31, with Jake talking to his awoken Cassie morph, I had them both talk in brackets.

Here, I went back to having the viewpoint character's thoughts be in italics, though this time the viewpoint character is the controller and not the awoken morph.

I dunno which is actually best; I'll probably alter them to all fit the same format when I do a final pass.

re: 3, yes, Rachel and Helium have met, and while it wasn't in the chapter, headcanon-as-author is that they've tried /both/ infestation /and/ morphing to peek at her memories themselves, and it's all just FUBAR. Like, Garrett morphing into Rachel can't make any more sense out of her brain than Rachel herself can.

As for getting inside an alien mind, I do a variety of things. With Andalites, I spent some time thinking about what it would be like to be an intelligent prey species, and what it would be like to be able to see all around you at all times. With Yeerks, I tried to figure out what it would be like to be psychically communicating in a lump, and realized they probably wouldn't be particularly individualized. With the Arn, I just tried to work backwards from "somehow they didn't give a shit about the Yeerks??" and build a viable psychology that has very different goals. Etc. etc. Different stuff every time.

FWIW What makes sense to me is morpher/Yeerk in brackets, construct/host in italics. That way, brackets always mean an intentional message is being sent, and italics always mean thoughts/inner monologue.

In the Jake/Cassie conversation I assumed the brackets meant that Jake was choosing not to read morph!Cassie's mind, except the thoughts she chose to send.

** I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS! But they're all overwhelmed by "btw Rachel fought a Howler".

Maybe I missed it in book 26, but I got the impression that in canon, the only characterization of Howlers was mostly restricted to when Jake morphed one. This one meeting made the Howler seem like a pretty friendly assassin who I was sad to see go. You managed to, in one short scene, from the perspective of a character who still has difficulty thinking in complete words, characterize the Howlers most wonderfully. The only complaint I might have is that it seems slightly less threatening, but I'm not sure why considering that anyone short of an Animorph in Grizzly morph would have died four times over during those 10 seconds.

At this point, I'm not sure if I'm more concerned about the main conflict, or what's going to happen with Rachel, or if someone will introduce the Howlers to DragonBall Z so they can learn how to Goku the nice way.

Also, this is how you write tension. The story over all, combined with the tone of this chapter and Rachel's development throughout mean we have no idea what's going to happen. There are high stakes, but we don't know the precise details. We have no idea what the noise is and have no way of guessing, but there are several suspects, including the inoccuous. And when we get the description of the Howler, the answer is: one of the worst possible. This story does not pull its punches, Rachel is at a huge disadvantage, and if you aren't familiar with canon, it's not unreasonable to wonder if the outcome we got isn't going to have bad consequences anyway. And if you are familiar with canon and noticed the weirdness with Krayak and Ellimist surrounding Rachel, the implications of what just happened could well be extreme. I need to read this again when I'm not half asleep.

TLDR: ! ! ! <3 <3 :o

The tension ramble applies to the whole chapter, not just the ending, now that I reread this to be sure it's in English. The real question is how clear the plot of this part will be when it's complete, for those who read this and the last couple chapters together with the last few. This is kinda like the Tobias and Temrash chapter, with great stand-alone character stuff and weird-but-makes-sense-in-context twists, while advancing the plot. I want to keep going, but I think we might have upgraded to 75% asleep. It's not even night here.

Something that will be at least clearly implied and possibly explicitly discussed in the next two chapters (so you can hold off on the very small spoiler if you want) is that the Howlers, having a childlike perspective and a collective memory and basically no fear of death, deliberately test the waters when they're dealing with a new system/species. They send cautious scouts who don't ramp up to 100 right away, but instead poke and prod and investigate and record. This Howler saw Rachel transforming from one form to another, so it wanted to see what she was made of/how good of a fighter she was, rather than just outright killing her.

** How much time has passed between this and the previous chapter? I see Jake has figured out V3's "trade secret" to controlling a ton of bodies at once. So there must have been an entire offscreen negotiation, which must have went pretty poorly if V3 is sending Howlers out now.

*** A wacky idea I had: In cannon, near the end (book 48/52), Crayak makes an offer to Rachel: Kill Jake, receive superpowers. I'm not sure what the rational version of that would look like, but I wonder if Crayak, not V3, sent that one Howler specifically to find Rachel.

** Man, thanks for this! I remember a few chapters ago I said I was having trouble following things and what I'd like is Marco to explain every step of the plot to a literal 8 year old and well this chapter was basically that?

Cute scenes with fetch, Rachel's very real feeling without being annoying to read struggles with memory, and impaling the howler with her own arm stump (which reminsd me of like, every gruesome thing that happened in canon) is everything.

Regarding the cameos, should we be posting full human names? Or just first names? Or just things that look like usernames?

Also, poor Rachel, but also also, of all the people for this to happen to, my model Rachel feels the most... able to handle it, in a strange way. Least inhibited by it? So it's neat to see her handling it so well.

I mean all of your r!characters are better able to prioritize than canon ones, but in terms of carrying over their "superpower" or having their trait turned into a superpower, it feels good to see Rachel continue to embody this one.

I've commented a few times before, and I also drew fanart of an R!andalite a few years back. If I can still have a cameo, I would like “Liv”. With bonus points for any Liv/Live puns.

  /When you're in morph, your brain is on pause, right? Being run on some kind of computer? So it can't change[...] state, right? That's why you guys couldn't fall asleep. So if I was able to concentrate hard enough to morph, then I'm going to be fine/ in /morph./

From chapter 7:

#+begin_quote
  I was grateful that I'd slept long enough to have them. It was the fourth night since the construction site, and I had yet to stay asleep for more than two hours in a row.
#+end_quote

The kids are setting alarms to wake up and refresh their morph armor every two hours; i.e. you definitely /can/ sleep while in morph.

Chapter 7 author's note:

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes a continuity error is a continuity error, and sometimes it's plot.
#+end_quote

I ctrl+f'd through 87 instances of the word "sleep" and didn't find anything saying you couldn't sleep while in morph, and I don't see why the god computer couldn't emulate sleep just like any other mental function. Is that what the fake continuity error was? I've been trying to figure that out for like 2 years now.

*** Marco kept saying "couldn't sleep lol" in the chat. Cassie stayed up for multiple days.

Jake was able to fall asleep because he morphed while his brain was already exhausted and so the emulator was emulating a ready-to-sleep brain.

I can't recall exactly what that was referencing, but I believe it was referencing something in chapter /6/; something that might have appeared to conflict with chapter 7.

**** Holy instant gratification, Batman!

Thanks for the answer. Sleep partly depends on hormones that come from non-brain parts of the body, so it totally makes sense that you can't get to sleep with your body in stasis, unless your brain was ready for it before you morphed.
