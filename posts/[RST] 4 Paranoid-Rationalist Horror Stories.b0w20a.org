** I *really* wanted to read the fourth one, and was a little bit disappointed when I saw the release dates were all after 2020 :(

*** The first, "Boxoctosis," seems to already be out...

Edit to add: Okay, I'm thinking this is some kind of satire. I can't find any other relevant reference to MWx, or any at all to "Headless Froggy Press," or the "Frozen Seas" or "Take Over" collections (not even the review this guy did for one of them that he quotes from).

**** Oxford has not yet been dissolved so I imagine any factual statements in the work should be taken with a grain of salt.

** The one about the author going crazy after maybe encountering a machine intelligence shook my certainty that these are blurbs about books and not whole standalone paranoid-rationalist horror short stories.

*** The story Boxoctosis and/or the writer MWx and/or the publisher Headless Froggy Press do not seem to exist /at all/. I've spent several minutes digging around in search engines to no avail.
