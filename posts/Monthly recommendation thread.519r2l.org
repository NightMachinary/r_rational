** [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Finally finished Worm this month, and man, is it good.]] I think it'd be fair to call it the best novel I've ever read; it's better than HPMOR for sure, and IMO, HP canon as well. It's gotten a lot of acclaim around these parts, but frankly, it deserves wider acclaim as well. I'd love to see it be a household name like the MCU, and lord knows Wildbow would benefit from the attention. I'm going to finish up a writing project I'm working on, and then I'm going to read Pact, the second novel Wildbow wrote. I'd like to live in a world where Worm fandom is as large and as mainstream as HP fandom.

I hope this doesn't fall afoul of the no self promotion rule, but I'm learning to draw, and I did [[http://imgur.com/a4F1Zbr][some doodles of the main characters]]. If you enjoy Worm, I hope they amuse you, and I hope to do some more soon, maybe of the Slaughterhouse Nine. :)

That said, if you enjoyed Worm /that/ much, you probably won't mind it. I'm not explaining the issues because when you point them out, they pop out that much more :)

**** That is the current plan. Apparently he was also in (very preliminary) talks about making it into a TV show. And his agent was also looking into more traditional publishing methods.

But currently he's editing the story with the intention of self-publishing, in case none of those other possibilities will pan out.

I honestly have no idea how he manages to do that and keep up with his writing schedule for Twig. It would be hell for me.

** The D&D podcast [[http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone][The Adventure Zone]] is what I've been recommending to my friends for the last several months. If you're a fan of RPGs or the McElroys (who have six~ish podcasts among various members of the family), give it a listen.

I think they start playing a pre-written 5e campaign but depart from it for the DM's own plotline. It's full of wonderful characters, the story is compelling, and the players have a fantastic chemistry, very entertaining overall. I would start on [[http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-3-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-three#comments][Ep. 3]] where everyone starts being comfortable in their characters and the DM starts using his own material.

** [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/][The Expanse]] is a SyFy series about a detective in space and an interplanetary conspiracy. In addition to being excellently written, with consistently great dialogue and a fleshed out cast of complex characters, the worldbuilding and background science are (almost always) spot-on. A great example was pointed out in [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/][the review]] that got me to watch it. Because a lot of the action happens on a spun-up Ceres (since the local gravity is too low for humans to survive in), people living there need to take the Coriolis force when pouring out drinks. It's that well-researched.

The space battles, especially, are one of the best thought-out elements of the show, and I think the people on this sub who were discussing the realism vs excitement dichotomy should really watch it and study it.

About to finish the only season out (only two episodes left!) and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite scifi series of all time.

The books are... um... very odd. The first one was pretty good. Every one thereafter was worse than the one preceding it, making less and less sense and having worse and worse writing and plotting.

Did the authors seriously think that someone who enjoyed the massive scope and tense action of the first book would like a later one that was mostly all about a crazy girl having revenge fantasies while (almost) nothing happens? For the entire book?

** I'm quite enjoying the music rhythm game [[https://osu.ppy.sh/][Osu!]]

It's a very challenging game with simple rules but seemingly limitless difficulty.

The gameplay is similar to titles like Elite Beat Agents where you click circles to the beat. There are also 3 other modes (Osu!Mania which is similar to Beatmania, Taiko, and Catch the Beat).

The best part is that it's completely free, community driven, and customizable. All you need to play is a mouse. (Though I recommend aiming with your mouse and clicking with your keyboard. z and x are the default click keys. Really helped me up my game).

As for books, I'm almost done reading The Night Angel Trilogy and have loved every word. It is the single darkest fantasy series I've ever read, there are some points where it makes Jessica Jones seem downright lighthearted by comparison, but like JJ it's disturbing and disgusting for all the right reasons. The plot is intricate, the characters complex, the writing tight, and the whole thing is surprisingly rational with even some munchkinism.

*** I'm going to offer a counter to this, because while I enjoyed the trilogy I don't think I'd recommend it to a rationalist audience without disclaimers.

In my view, the Night Angel Trilogy is similar to Mistborn in a certain way: it starts out very strong, and gets weaker with each book. I really enjoyed the first one, moderately enjoyed the second, and can barely remember the third one outside of its major set pieces.

Also, while you're right to say it has amazingly well done characters, its magic system is almost completely unexplained and irrational, especially the convoluted and mysterious rules of the Ka'kari.

The main thing I would recommend Night Angel for is the characters, which again are mostly fantastic, with one or two exceptions. The worldbuilding is okay and has some neat ideas, but the rest is pretty standard fantasy fare, if a bit on the more darker side than most. It's definitely an entertaining read, but not in my top picks, personally.

I admit neither series is totally rational, but I think they're both a step up from the standard fantasy fare I've grown tired of.

They have all the standard tropes, but each puts their own spin on them and rationalize aspects of the story. Night Angel has intelligent characters, including a rationalist later on, while Mistborn has its clever setting and magic system. If you don't like them, that's fine, but I count them among my favorites.

It's a randomized arcade game in the vein of Binding Of Isaac (albeit somewhat lighter on content; it doesn't have the literally hundreds of items that BOI does by now). It's much faster-paced, though, and only gives you one hit point (but three or four lives per game, and three games per session). It makes excellent use of mouse controls and has a nice aesthetic, though, IMO, an offputtingly rude sense of humor. (Not in the grossout sense of Binding Of Isaac, but in the sense that it routinely insults you for your failure.)

** Since I usually get a lot from the recommendation threads without contributing much, I'll put forward a few suggestions of my own of things I've enjoyed in the past.

Video Games / Visual Novels:

-Phoenix Wright trilogy: You are a poor defense attorney trying to save your clients. Memorable plot and character, compelling gameplay that makes a court of law seem like the most fun thing ever. Definitely not rational, so if that might bother you please be careful. If on the other hand you aren't afraid of a couple Idiot Balls and silly twists, there are countless moments of heartwarming and awesome to be enjoyed. Nice brain teaser as well overall.

-Danganronpa 1&2: A bunch of talented kids are trapped in a high school and forced to kill each other for the amusement of a sick heartless mechanical teddy bear. Find the culprit or die! Similar to Phoenix Wright (same disclaimer applies), more stylish and anime-esque. The concept is really interesting and well-executed for the most part. Outrageously over-the top and ridiculously immersive and enjoyable, if you ignore the sheer irrationality of it all. Also some interesting logic puzzles.

-999 & Virtue's Last Reward (Zero Escape trilogy): This completes the good visual novel series. People are trapped in (insert game location) and have to escape. A bit different from the others, in that it's based on branching paths and multiple story endings. The games are convoluted and well-executed and with no courtroom-style segments. I found VLR to be especially cool and dealing with interesting issues for this subreddit, heavily recommended!

*** In terms of VNs, I haven't played that much. I did enjoy Fate / Stay Night, Tsukihime, and the Muv-Luv trilogy. Fate/Stay Night is a story about a bunch of magic users summoning heroes out of the past to fight over a wish. Tsukihime is a complicated story about a guy with the power to kill anything fighting vampires, more or less. Both those two stories by Nasu had cringe-inducing flaws - I think that at this point Nasu has proven he should not be allowed near sex scenes of any type, as they have been absurdly terrible every single time. Also, the pacing is extremely slow and there's a lot of slice-of-life stuff that breaks up the action.

Muv-Luv is a complicated story where trying to describe it spoils badly, but it initially /looks/ like garbage comedy harem anime BS until it really suddenly and abruptly isn't. The story takes forever to get off the ground, as basically all of Extra is garbage, and even a lot of Unlimited is fairly risible, but Alternative is amazing and good enough to justify the time spent in Extra and Unlimited. Unfortunately, you can't just skip to Alternative as that would deprive the story of all it's force - the setup proves to be necessary for the whole thing to work.

I also quite liked social-justice-ish stories Digital: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story a lot, but Hate Plus was a disappointment and I don't recommend it at all. These are neat games told through interacting with fake computer interfaces - Digital is in close to the present day and is about AIs on the net, while Analogue is in a far future setting exploring a failed generation ship.

A couple of them manage to get out of comically bad territory, I think. The one where Akiha watches Kohaku have her way with Shiki comes to mind, although I may have underestimated how bad it was due to how well it hit some of the fetishes I had at the time.

I think skipping Extra may work well enough. I've went through Extra diligently, but I haven't built up any kind of empathy with the characters due to the whole thing being a horrible boring mess. Sure you get to contrast the "happy" carefree days in this world with what happens in the later games, but I don't think it's worth the time investment in the end. Unlimited does way more work at getting the reader invested in characters, and even then in retrospect the only one I really cared about was Marimo-chan, and that's mostly due to the /impactful/ way her storyline ends, which was great.

I can second this recommendation. Not the most amazing of games, but work well enough. The cake thing in Hate Plus was pretty ridiculous, but aside from that I thought it wasn't that bad either.

Implying that you lost them? Come on man, fetishes are like Pokemon. You gotta catch them all! Fill in that fetishdex!

Those scenes are so terrible that I wonder if something was lost in translation. Do Japanese readers also think they are terrible?

*** If you like the Phoenix Wright games, I recommend Aviary Attorney, which is the same concept, but set during the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Monarchy][July Monarchy]] in Paris on the eve of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution_of_1848][1848 Revolution]], and with birds. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuGJOdyoLo4][(trailer)]]

There are only 4 court cases, so it's a short game. If you see a negative review for the game, bear in mind during the first month of release 2 of the 3 paths didn't work and most complaints are about this. The other 2 paths were patched in after about a month. It's a shorty but a goody. Here's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq-1OJwfbd4][let's play]] that I found entertaining.

** I've been reading a lot of RWBY fanfic recently. Unfortunately I haven't found any well-written longform Weiss/Ruby or Jaune/Pyrrha fics yet, but there are some good choices. Here are my recommendations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352744/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]] is probably my favorite. The summary is this: Jaune's seven sisters are possessed by the swords passed down the Arc family lineage and it is now up to him to save them. It has some great action scenes, fleshes out Jaune's sisters, the omakes are hilarious, and has an unusual Jaune/Yang pairing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/silver-moon-golden-sun-rwby-pokemon.380918/][Silver Moon, Golden Sun]] is a promising Pokemon crossover on Spacebattles.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/satellite-penny-ciel-rwby-fanfiction.411014/][Satellite]] is a good slice-of-life fic focusing on Ciel Soleil and her friendship with Penny. It's quite funny and it's interesting seeing such a minor character getting development.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518796/1/From-Beyond][From Beyond]] is a competent romantic comedy. Jaune dies during initiation and ends up as a ghost haunting Blake, who is the only one who can see him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle][Breaking through the Bottom of the Bottle]] is my favorite as far as pure romance fic goes. It's a Jaune/Yang story, with the two of them meeting again years after the events of the main plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11765215/1/Just-A-Few-Pointers][Just a Few Pointers]] is one of the only good Jaune/Weiss romance fics I've found, though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12111333/1/Letters-to-Winter][Letters to Winter]] also looks promising so far.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dust-to-dust-percy-jackson-rwby-crossover.419948/][Dust to Dust]] is a Percy Jackson crossover with Percy ending up in Remnant. It's a bit too early to evaluate it, but it looks good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10534001/1/Broken-Wings][Broken Wings]] is quite good if you're okay with sad stories where self-harm is a major theme. Weiss was born a faunus and is forced by her family to cut off her wings each time they regrow and attempt to pass as a normal human at Beacon.

**** I wasn't a fan of The Games We Play. As I said in another thread: Jaune is completely out of character, even considering the INT and WIS boosts. Which is fine IMO when, like in HPMOR, the character getting replaced is boring, but I felt like the new Jaune in this fic was less interesting. I prefered Ryuugi's other fic Prytaneum, where Percy Jackson retains his most important character traits.

I'll take a look at those other fics though.

***** I really enjoyed A Few Pointers so far, although I still can't tell if it's Jaune/Weiss or Jaune/Pyrra, to be honest. It's very true to the show's characters, very well done.

Do you find your RWBY fan fiction through the (horrible) fanfiction.net search or through the RWBY subreddit, out of curiosity?

****** The tags and author's note for Just a Few Pointers indicate it's Jaune/Weiss, but so far the romance is developing slowly. If you like it, you might enjoy the author's other story Technician. It starts off without very much direction but in the later chapters a plot is starting to form. I suspect that it will eventually end with a Jaune/Yang pairing but there's no evidence yet.

I find RWBY fanfic through a variety of methods. I check the tvtropes fanfic recommendation list, sort by most favorites on fanfiction.net, and look for recently updated RWBY fics on spacebattles' creative writing forum every now and then. I also ask people on [[/r/RWBY][r/RWBY]] for recommendations. None of these methods are very reliable unfortunately since a lot of readers don't have very good taste and a story being popular doesn't necessarily mean it's well-written. I do notice that, for whatever reason, Spacebattles tends to have the most consistently entertaining stories with decent writing and interesting premises. The tvtropes lists will usually have a decent number of good stories, but since anyone can add to the list there are also a lot of bad stories there. Recommendations from other people tend to be hit or miss, but sometimes they'll point you to something good that you wouldn't have noticed otherwise since they're not that popular.
