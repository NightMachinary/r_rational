** So I'm starting to think either the power giving process discriminated and only chose altruistic and intelligent kids, or it rewrote how their brains work when giving it to them, because we've really yet to see a single character with powers acting (internally) selfishly, which is increasingly seeming less and less likely.

*** Or maybe the caracteres we are being shown are the more altruistc and inteligent kids so its selection bias? But It sound plausible that whatever gives the powers choose them especially because their altruism or something

**** Maybe it's not just altruism but desire to change the world in general (and a shared birthday) that makes the kids recipients of powers, and we just haven't seen any of the assholes yet.

As a corollary, it's plausible that the strength of their altruism/desire is linked to the strength of their power. Hannah is focused on her siblings' welfare, and she can disappear coins. The two kids who want to save the world have death-precognition and possibly biological reprogramming.

** I have the uncomfortable feeling we just met Mr. Flesh-Forest.

Also, it's good to see another non-child perspective character.

[[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/icarly/images/b/b3/Delicious_cookie%0A!.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120524171041][Have a cookie]] for theorizing.

(Not to say whether you're right or wrong, but I *think* you're the first reader to suggest that the Giger trees were created by an empowered kid.)

Thank you. I wasn't planning yet to have another non-child pov character in the next sequence, but I'll see what I can do there (I'm sure that there's room), and I'll definitely make sure to include more in the future.
