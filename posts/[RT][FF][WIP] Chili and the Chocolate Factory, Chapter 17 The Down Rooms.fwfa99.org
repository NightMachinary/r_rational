** Bro, this chapter had me almost foaming at the mouth. I'm not even sure I can accurately describe the combination of feelings I was having, despite having purposefully cultivated very good language for describing my inner life to myself.

Thanks! I hate it.

It was unexpected but unsurprising that Wonka would get Keerthi by emotionally torturing her and then presenting her with a basic assumption (you use this device by pressing the button on it) he knew would eliminate her. Along with disarming their guards earlier via the “this chocolate is safe trick”, it's actually a really clever ploy.

It's weird how he subscribes to just world reasoning, but tries to be clever/semi-subtle/ironic about whacking the contestants. It's so obviously for his own fucked up enjoyment to do it this way, instead of just pushing a button that instantly kills someone with chocolate or something.

...please do not do that next chapter.

Also, I don't know if I'm just slow, but the fundamental irony of the situation has finally dawned on me. The original tour was, in theory, Wonka testing the kids to see which one of them was most deserving to inherit the vast power and responsibility of his chocolate factory. And he picked Charlie, who gained all that power and turned into...this. Maybe Wonka was a shit judge.

It's hard to gauge how bad the others would have been, because it seems like any holder of the factory might as well have infinite money and magic-chocolate-science international hard and soft power deployment. Maybe Charlie was the best choice of successor in the entire world, and anyone else would have done much worse than CHOCOR baby nuclear war and massively utility-negative chocolate and etc.

Maybe this is the best of all possible worlds. There's probably has a candy for that.

And here I thought that my exclamation that "BUCKET YEETED A BABY" was pretty close to a perfect sentence. But of /course/ it could trivially be improved by a megawhomping factor of Wonkillion by appending a yoot to the yeet. Phenomenal.

I'm looking forward to discovering how Tide gets eliminated. I like [[/u/hyphenomicon]]'s theory that Mahuika is actually Marama in disguise.

  "Vermicious," she said. "It means something, but I do not remember what."

  "No," said Chetan. "It is a pretend word. People sometimes squashbunt pretend words in their sentences because they think it makes them sound smarter. It doesn't mean anything."

  Keerthi knew Chetan was wrong. She had heard it before. There was no doubt in her mind. As the double doors to the Great Glass Elevator reopened, only one question was on her mind.

  What did vermicious mean?
#+end_quote

[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vermicious][Of, pertaining to, or characteristic of worms.]] I wonder what this breadcrumb leads to. Vermicious Knids featured prominently in The Great Glass Elevator, and some of the prominent theories about anti-astronomy's relation to the Knids seem to have been confirmed this chapter. We'll see.

#+begin_quote
  "You cannot say it is wrong then! It is foolish to say something is bad without having a good reason to! It will lead you to bad conclusions."
#+end_quote

There's a couple things going on here I'd like to address. First, I'd like to address the exact wording and one literal meaning of the sentence. According to Bucket, /saying something is bad without having a good reason to/ will /lead you to/ */bad conclusions/*. Chetan never told Keerthi to speak truth to power and inform Bucket about the moral failings of his factory. Chetan understood that doing such a thing would effectively be suicide, and that doing such a thing had absolutely no chance of changing Bucket's mind about anything or preventing any of the suffering inflicted by the factory. Whenever Keerthi challenges Bucket's morality, he goes Pennywise on her. So by the literal reading of this sentence, Bucket is saying /whiny children get got./ None of this is particularly surprising in any way, but I enjoyed the extra layer of meaning there.

Now, for the less-literal, seemingly-intended meaning of the line, which, at a glance, could be disregarded as Bucket spouting truisms or just being a typical overbearing adult rolling his eyes at a child who detests bread crusts or broccoli. However, looking at the ethical framework these three sentences imply reveals an entirely new and terrifying aspect of Bucket's worldview. Since he rejects /saying something is bad without having a good reason/, he rejects deontological ethics entirely, as well as any moral framework with axiomatically-defined evil acts. Rather, it is the /failure/ to act which is evil; failure to act stemming from avoidance of one's own suffering is lazy, while failure to act stemming from avoidance of someone else's suffering is foolish. We knew he was a murdering, clamming slave-owner, but with this line Bucket reveals that he truly has /no/ limits of any kind. Later in this chapter we learn that he is perpetrating an atrocity on a grander scale than has been considered anywhere outside this subculture (basilisks, Pascal's muggings, time travel which erases existing timelines, etc), but I don't think we've seen the bottom of Bucket's depravity yet. These three lines are heavy with meaning, and I now picture Bucket's psychology as a chocolate-flavored composite of Pennywise, Hitler, and the Cenobites; no version of Satan has ever been described as /this/ evil. I think humanity might actually fare better with the Chococlipper, because at least the Chococlipper's utility function is only to produce as /much/ chocolate as possible, not the /best/ chocolate possible.

#+begin_quote
  "No," said Mr. Bucket. "The VIP Room is one small room that is designed to seem bigger than it is. The Down Rooms are many rooms stapled together in a way that makes them feel like they are only one. Down Tower itself is inside of thousands of different rooms, and it has hundreds of rooms inside of it. The four of us are standing inside of ten different rooms right now."

  Keerthi sighed.

  "Do not worry about architecture," said Mr. Bucket. "We are here for the slavery! Let's go inside."
#+end_quote

Leaving aside how great that Bucket line is, I love how he's casually revealing his absolute mastery of space here. Whether by expanding wormholes or folding spacetime, he has the ability to reconfigure the three perceptible spatial dimensions as he pleases. That means he has teleportation, that means he can make things bigger on the inside than the outside, and it means the factory's physical footprint has nothing to do with its capacity. Wonkaland? Try Wonkaworld.

#+begin_quote
  He pressed a button on his cane. The handle became a ladle. He walked over to the pier and filled it before giving it to Keerthi.

  "Take a drink," said Mr. Bucket. "Do not worry. You are too thin to get stuck in the pipes."
#+end_quote

Hahahaha.

#+begin_quote
  Mr. Bucket took a bite from his cane.

  "You can have your morality, or you can have your chocolate. I cannot tell you which one to choose. I can only tell you which one tastes better."
#+end_quote

Avoidance of suffering is evil in Bucket's worldview. To avoid one's own suffering is to be lazy. To avoid causing suffering to others is to be foolish. Only pursuing pleasure makes sense to him.

#+begin_quote
  "Yes," said Mr. Bucket. "Quarks! Quarks all have strong tastes, which is why different kinds of quarks are called flavors. Quarks come in six different flavors! There is up, down, top, bottom, strange, and charm."

  "Stop lying to us," said Keerthi. "We aren't going to believe your nonsense. Obviously real scientists wouldn't name subatomic particles after random silly words like that."

  Tide walked over to Keerthi and whispered into her ear.

  Keerthi frowned. "Are you sure?"

  Tide nodded.

**** Following Bucket's insane moon logic, you only need a trillion sapient slaves in order to make /the best/ chocolate. An abnormally large number of slaves will instead provide you with chocolate that is merely very good.

I'm guessing that Wonka didn't yet understand the subtlety of chocodynamics, given that the quark model was proposed in the same year as the book was published, but he did seem to understand that enslaving an entire race of small orange people was key to creating excellent chocolate. Was it the smallness? The orangeness? No, turns out it's the slavery.

And given what happened a couple chapters ago I kinda think Bucket probably freed the oompa loompas, only to discover that it makes the chocolate go bad. If that's the case, I'd bet this also greatly informed his "just world" perspective - the oompa loompas were slaves because it was correct for them to be slaves, because better chocolate is the most correct thing.

  According to Bucket, saying something is bad without having a good reason to will lead you to bad conclusions.
#+end_quote

I think you missed the third, pun-ish and tautological interpretation here: concluding that something is bad without good reason will lead to a bad conclusion.

We implicitly impute different meanings to the word "bad" when it's used in different parts of the sentence (saying something is bad -> value judgement of a thing; bad conclusion -> invalid conclusion), but it's just as reasonable to use the same meaning of bad in both places (saying something is bad -> value judgement of a thing; bad conclusion -> conclusion about the value of a thing).

So, literally. Saying that something is bad (for any reason) is, itself, a conclusion that the thing is bad. Or in other words, a bad conclusion.

** *Wonka Industries - Slavery is just the beginning!*

On a re-read of the story, here are some thoughts:

I suspect the place Wonka was trying to access that "less then five people" know about is a world of pure imagination.

Still suspect the "fuel" for this involves the children somehow. Wonka had them all sign a blood contract at the beginning, including himself, and was very clear it had to be their real names. The method of getting there was gleaned from a translation, implied to be something he and Charlie had to translate themselves. The contract contains lots of "non-words" and instructions on harvesting and preserving cucumbers (aka pickling and/or brining), not counting what he claims is written on the back.

I still don't have any clue what happened to the President back before he was confident.

Mahuika can move her arms insanely fast for the purposes of vaping.

Chilli's real name starts with "Ch" and was probably Charlie.

Things in the running as the only thing other then vapes Wonka is second-best at: Suspenders. Peaches.

I love Tide's puns.

JUROR asked Charlie for good advice, and Charlie said to tie his shoes or he'll trip on something.

Charlie knows the VIPs aren't slaves because they don't "change the taste". He's sure they're not slaves because he knows slavery influences the flavour of things and so their situation isn't dire enough to count as slavery.

Tide has made several slip-ups in regards to following her cult practices this chapter. Still on the fence if she believes it or not. Still real curious about her parents, why she's so angry at them, and why they're so guilty about whatever happened. Whatever it was, it resulted in her being emancipated three years ago. Which...was around the time of the baby wars. Are they connected?

Charlie has made it pretty clear nobody wins anything for being the last kid standing. I don't understand why Tide thinks there's any hope of this lunatic handing over his factory at the end. Except maybe to Mahuika who is basically a saint in Charlie's worldview.

Chetan has been saying Charlie was a bad person since Keerthi first entered the factory.

I think Tide's father Dr. Glunka Cervantes is actually Marama Jewel's nemesis Senor Syzygy, the arch-astronomer.

•They're both Spanish, which the story goes out of its way to establish with Syzygy's accent and Glunka's descent from the author of Don Quixote.

•Syzygy has burning eyes, and Glunka is known for his signature "funglasses". Sidenote: Tide similarly hides her face at all times.

•Tide straight up admits (in the narration) that her dad is an astronomer.

Edit: I completely missed that there was a third party involved in Wonka's great project, either as obstacle to be bargained with or as information source. Possibly the third person with Wonka and Charlie for Wonka's last breakfast, but also potentially something else.

edit: Morally... it is plausible to me that the slaves are not different enough to have unique cognitive experiences. So the amount of total suffering states possible in this configuration may be inherently bounded. This may cap the horror at mere holocaust levels, possibly sub-holocaust.

edit: Hang on, how does this morality work? Anything Bucket does to people, they deserve. So why does Bucket choose to arrange for people to deserve bad things? Isn't that evil?

*** In my Second Readthrough edit of my main comment, I expand a little on what I gleaned about Bucket's worldview from this chapter. In a nutshell, Charlie considers the avoidance of suffering to be inherently evil: if you're avoiding your own suffering, you're lazy, and if you avoid causing suffering to others, you're foolish. His worldview is built solely on the pursuit of pleasure via chocolate. He's CelestAI swapping out "values optimization" with "pleasure" and "friendship and ponies" with "chocolate." In his worldview, there are no inherently evil acts-- only the evil of inaction and actions taken in support of that evil. This dovetails nicely (horrifyingly) with his just-world axiom.

**** See, that might be true but Charlie might also just be straight insane. To be honest, I'm not sure how he manages to be at all functional. I think there's some part of the brain that tracks reality, and some part that tracks morality, and I don't think either parts are working for him, possibly because he's in a position where they're not reality-predicting. "Reality is the thing that sometimes makes our perceptions come out different from our predictions." I think Charlie has enough power that reality is forced to meet him halfway, and he perceives, in a Mother Theresa like way, that suffering beatifies pleasure or some such thing. I think after in the first stage consequences were decoupled from emotional valence in his worldview (amor fati wielded as a weapon), this is the second stage of this deconstruction; another level that could have saved his mind destroyed by corrosion through the power he holds.

Yeah, this work is definitely a treatise on theodicy.

Part of my brain keeps saying "Chetan is a weird Knid infiltrator, which is why he's thin and long and insisted that 'vermicious' doesn't mean anything," but that doesn't make any sense.

But then, I wouldn't have said "teeth made of tongues, and root beer for blood" made much sense either.

***** Sure, but it's in a wacky/fun way!

...yeah, sorry. I think that's the fluffiest I have to hand. I'll let you know if I think of anything else.

Edit: Oh my gosh I was locked in "web fiction" mode and didn't even consider what I should have recommended from the beginning. Go watch Joe Pera Talks With You, /right now/. That's a show that's /intensely/ worth watching, horrifically underrated, which is 100% devoted to the idea of slowing down, enjoying the little things, and finding calm quiet joy in a world that's gotten too fast and loud and abrasive. [[https://www.adultswim.com/videos/joe-pera-talks-with-you][Season 1 is free to watch on Adult Swim]] (warning: AS's video player tends to skip around, make sure you watch the episodes in the right order.) Every episode is ~11 minutes long. It's a true delight and a rare shining light in these dark times. I feel intense guilt for not mentioning it immediately. No murder, torture, dissection, or violence of any kind. Just wholesomeness, clever writing, brilliant cinematography, and some helpful life philosophy of the sort I know *I* desperately needed when I watched it. In fact I think I'm going to go watch an episode right now.

** I know narratively that the story is about an Evil Wonka and that he's not going to say that 'Oh I was just lying to you about my nature and operations to creep you out so you would prove you were worthy righteous beings to assume universal power'

But if this was real, wouldn't you assume this was what he was doing? Even with Wonka's vast power, operating a Tardis-like structure of near-infinite suffering seems a bit high-effort. It is much easier to /say/ that you've done that than actually do it. If I was actually there, I would roll to disbelieve. I would expect all the other children to return and the facade to be removed once the true valiant hero stood up to the omnipotent lord of chocolate.

** One thing the remaining +contestants+ /contestant/ besides Mahuika hasn't tried, even as the plot has taken a turn for the serious, is to actually engage Mahuika in the events. She is, to say the least, fairly passive about everything so far, but per her family and some evidence in the text, she can be made to do things if you relate it back to vaping. Something like "would you please help us escape Bucket while you vape" might not work, but it seems worth a try, at this point.

Also, what are the chances that, when there's only one contestant remaining, Bucket simply doesn't give them the factory, seeing how he's some kind of presumably immortal candy construct, just like he's stated the entire time?

He says in /Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator/ that Wonka-vite, a drug which reverses aging, is too precious to waste on himself, but doesn't explain why.

**** This was a prevailing theory on the subreddit, given a direct nod in the story by Chillennial Lee, the world's greatest detective.

#+begin_quote
  Chill Lee had the crowd eating out of the palm of his hand.

  "When the puzzle asks for someone to 'INPUT WHAT I LIKE BEST INTO ME', it is asking what the person individually likes best: what they literally appreciate more than everyone else does."

  "But it uses the word I and then the word me in the same sentence," said Boggis. "That doesn't make any sense if the 'I' is supposed to be the puzzle-solver and the 'me' is supposed to be Bucket himself representing the bucket."

  "Wonka is using the unroyale I," Chill Lee explained.
#+end_quote

However, the answer was to put chocolate, Bucket's favorite thing, in the bucket.

#+begin_quote
  There was brown vomit everywhere. It was on Ms. Ownreewhard's carpets, and on her floors, and on her many framed paintings of all the good deeds she had done.

  Most importantly it was on the computer screen, which it had gone inside. The bucket was now filled with chocolately vomit. Chili stared at it, not knowing what to do. He had severely misunderstood how computers worked.

  Little fireworks began firing on the top half of the screen. They formed words.

  'CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WIN :D! YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF SOLVING THE PUZZLE! I OWN A CHOCOLATE FACTORY SO OF COURSE WHAT I LIKE BEST IS CHOCOLATE! AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS PUT IT INSIDE THE BUCKET! YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT RIDDLES! REACH IN AND TAKE IT!'

  An arrow pointed inside the bucket. Chili followed it, reached inside, then pulled out the sixth Golden Ticket.
