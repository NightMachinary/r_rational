I do a lot of driving and the radio stations are pretty bad so I was wondering if anyone had any audio book recomendations. Iv'e allready read/lisend to HPMOR. Obviously any rational audio books are best but any other ideas would be good too. Thanks


** Have you read/listened to Metropolitan Man? The same person who did HPMOR's podcast did it it too:

[[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705]]

Also, its author Alexander Wales and I have recommended maybe 20 audio books throughout our podcast:

[[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/]]

If you click on any given episode starting from 10, you'll probably find an audio book recommendation at the bottom of the page, with an explanation of why it's recommended at the end of the episode in like the last 3 minutes (in the later ones I started putting transcripts of the recommendations onto the webpage).

One of my personal favorites is The Dresden Files, an urban fantasy series which is narrated exceptionally well by James Marsters. The story develops some great world building, magic systems, and characters as it goes, each book pretty much always getting better than the last. Storm Front is the first book, if you want to check it out :)

(And if you don't have Audible yet, you can get a free book (and support the podcast) by signing up from this link! [[http://www.audibletrial.com/rational]] )

**** I can also recommend the Dresden files, the first audiobook is pretty cheap on audible. I found it's almost always cheaper to bundle the kindle version with the audio on Amazon for everything past the third book. ($8 vs $28 for a few) As an addition, his voice cuts through the din of vehicle noise better than most.

** Worm is fairly rational, and the podcast version is done and free.

**** Fairly consistently alright but not great. Some of the interludes have readers that can't read and you'll notice a repeated sentence sometimes but other than that it's good.

** What genres do you like? I mean I could recommend a whole bunch of fantasy only for it to turn out that's not your cup of tea. First thing that jumps to mind is a sci-fi book called UBIK by Phillip k Dick

**** In no particular order:

Lord of light - roger Zalazny

Sci-fi intertwined with Hinduism.

Dune - Frank Herbert

Definite classic, hard sci-fi.

Nine princess in amber - Roger Zelazny

Fantasy, the audio book are just great, with sound effects and everything.

Enders Game - Orson Scott Card

First place in sci-fi top 100, terrible movie.

The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy - Douglas Adams

Sort of anti-rational sci-fi, very funny.

The quantum thief - Hannu Rajaniemi

Transhumanist sci-fi, unpronounceable author.

And if you've got half a year of your life to throw around, I'd recommend the wheel of time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. It is truly an epic, and one of the best series I've read to date. But with fourteen thick books in the series quite a commitment.

** Basically any commercially published book nowadays is also available in audio, so looking through an old rational-books recommendation thread should work. My personal first recommendation for traditionally published ratfic is always Blindsight, by Peter Watts.

** Starship Troopers. It's a magnitude above the movie and manages to portray the society well without coming across as propaganda /or/ parody. It also gets geeky detailed a few times, and I really like it. It's the only thing I've read/listened to that managed to make power armour sound interesting and realistic.

Also the narrator for the audiobook is /so/ good.

** If you're not too picky about vocal quality, you can use a text-to-speech program on a text file and get any ebook as an audio book.

This is what I do for the vast majority of text I consume.
