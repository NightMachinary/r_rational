*** Yeah, I downloaded it about a month ago and played it a bunch.

My tips: Probes are the most expendable, and you will suffer greatly if you lose landing gear, or your scientific/cultural databases.

**** When forced to chose between databanks, settlers, probing systems, or landing, I chose landing, and waited for a low gravity world with oceans. Lost 49 colonists in the descent, but out of a 1000, that's not so bad.

"/Engaged Atomic Age Democracy/" was the result of that one.

***** Sounds like you did OK - if the hit had taken out 10-20% of your landing or construction gear, you end up taking heavy hits to your colonist populations which result in the scientific/cultural databases being reduced. You can definitely take one or two landing hits, but more than that and you're in trouble.

I generally get rid of the surface probes and the scanners first, focusing all the damage to a single scanner, and keeping two scanners as pristine as possible to upgrade.

****** Played it many times, that was my 2nd best one.

I still find it irritating how stupid the colonists can be.

Oh look, there's /deadly ruins/ over here... let's mount an expedition that gets *300* people killed. That's... that's great. I figure the AI could leave them a note that says "Hey, this place will kill you, don't go there!", but... alas.

** What a terrific project. Thanks for sharing this. I seriously want to just stay in space until making contact with a spaceage civilization, but there is no guarantee that that is a possible result. That option was less tempting after getting my seedship attacked by thieves. I'm pretty happy with my second result: the colony on the ice world of Heart reaches the Information Age with 97% of their cultural records.

** On my second attempt I got what I assume was a perfect score of 10,000.

First planet was a bust, and had to lose a surface probe in the event after it. Second planet had a toxic atmosphere and was very hot, but also had airtight and insulated caves that perfectly countered those negatives.

Everything else about the planet was basically Earth-normal. Easy route to a new post-scarcity utopia, I guess.

*** 10k isn't /quite/ perfect. It's possible to run into unexpected good luck (usually involving alien contact), which improves your databases beyond the starting point and leads to a civilization that grows beyond the normal maximums. It's not /likely/, though; you can normally expect that your values will go down, not up.

So yeah, 10k is about the best you can hope for.

*** I've gotten in the 12,000's by getting cosmic enlightenment and information age. However I think the best actual result I've gotten is post singularity, post scarcity civ though that got a score of 11,572 so I mean "best" in the sense of being on a pretty habitable planet and clearly being the best place to actually live.

Though the whole tech thing does seem a bit weird since you'd think that there should be nothing stopping people from advancing tech on their own unless you have a really regressive government or a lack of resources.

P.S. Looking at the high scores on reddit it seems like a score of at least 15k should be possible and there are screenshots for people getting in the high 14k's

***** A perfect planet, before modifications to scientific or cultural databases will (usually) grant you a score of 14500.

Add in Monumental and High-tech ruins, and you can easily expect to average over 15k for that.

The theoretical maximum appears to be 18,850, which is achievable with a perfect world, getting each of the beneficial random one-time rare events that can increase your science/culture and getting the maximum increase from each of them (Reading Databases, Transmitting to Alien Probe, Exploring the Alien Derelict, and Analyzing the Alien Signal, +90 Culture, +25 Science), taking no system damage, getting the maximum benefit from both Monumental and High-tech Ruins (+30 Culture, +30 Science), and integrating well with a native High-tech society (+30 Culture)

That gives you a theoretical maximum of 250 Culture and 185 Science.

The odds of achieving this score, without modifying the random number generators (like I did in looking at this) is incredibly unlikely.

***** A lot of that is simply a matter of luck though. I'm willing to bet if you trained an AI on this game (shouldn't be hard an extremely basic decision tree would work) so it could play extremely fast you could get over 15k within a day.

It's also worth noting that I had 158% Culture at the end of that one, mainly due to cultural enrichment from integrating with the native iron age civilisation...
