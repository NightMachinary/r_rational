** The world is every bit as intelligent and horrifying as Worm, and the problems are even trickier since magic users cannot lie.

It takes a little while to get over its initial worldbuilding hump, but once it's going, there's nothing quite like watching a character arguing over definitions and clauses to draw up a legal contract to bind a hateful demon, or getting entangled in legitimately intricate webs of favors, promises, and debts.

*** I binge-read Worm after it had already finished, and now that I'm caught up to Pact: a 3-4 day wait is torture!

Yep! That's exactly why I'm waiting before diving into it :)

(also my reading list is ridiculous right now, so it helps to get some of them out of the way before jumping into yet another ongoing story)

** I'm not sure it fits the 'rational' tag as well as Worm does though - reason being I have no intuitive understanding of what's possible in the Pact world: I don't know what the rules are. When a character in Worm does something clever I /could/ have thought of it myself, given time. Not so in Pact, I think.

I notice that I don't have the same feeling about hpmor even though the same argument could be made. I suspect the difference is my pre-existing familiarity with the HP universe.

** I actually thought about posting this, and then thought "nah, it's bound to have already been posted."

Oh well.

But yes, you should go read it.

*** It was mentioned once just as it started based on Worm expectations, but it deserves a second mention as it already has a sizeable content proven to be good.

** Not until it is complete.

I only read completed works for reasons of avoiding frustration.
