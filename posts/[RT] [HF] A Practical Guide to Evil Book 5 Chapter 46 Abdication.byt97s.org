*** We know who we can rule out. Tariq and Catherine both gave up their rirght to rule, to empower this very crown and the Sisters respectively. Masego is out of it, and Sve Noc or any drow claiming it would just bring us back to the problem of a Court sworn to Below.

So might Amadeus, but between losing the Name of the Black Knight and generally unorthodox methology he might haggle a deal (with anyone but the Saint of Swords). Laurence already has a domain, so she may be able to extend her *Decree* over it, and worst comes to worst, Cat will just go with the old plan of killing the newborn goddess. Ronald is probably not interested, and Kairos may care too much about being the successor to Theodosius the Unconquered to give up the Name he inherited, but who knows? Hierarch will likely explode if the crown gets put on his head, but that's far from the only thing he can do with it.

The drow may have also brought someone from the battlefield below, but no candidate there is exactly fit to be a god. I'll laugh very hard if they take the crown and use all the spares lying around (Spellblade, Thief of Stars, the Stolen Crown, Tyrant, Hanno's coin, Keter) to make an even bigger god.

**** Catherine didn't give up her right to rule (as evidenced by the fact that she's currently still Queen of Callow; she was even one of the possible "final" crowns that could be used with the seven), so it's still on the table for her. But I'd be surprised if it went that direction. She seemed much too pleased to have rid herself of the last court/mantle to really want to pick up another.

***** [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/12/07/chapter-81-only-to-the-just/][Book IV, chapter 81]]:

#+begin_quote
  “Hear me, Sve Noc,” I said. “Whatever claim I yet hold to Winter, I pass to you. My crown of Moonless Night, I lay at your feet. I stand before you without power or right to my name, mortal at your mercy.”
#+end_quote

"Right" probably includes "right to rule" here. As for being the Queen of Callow /at the moment/, here's how the Grey Pilgrim puts it:

#+begin_quote
  “Though the earthly crown will not be taken from your brow, save if you yourself do so, you will have lost the authority of a ruler in the eyes of the Heavens,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Lingering in that role after discarding it before Gods and men can only bring calamity.”

  “I figure it'd be subtle at first,” I said. “Small nudges. Crops get a little worse, people listen a little less. If you keep holding, though, then it's a different story.”

  “Disease and strife,” the Peregrine said, “and they will only grow, so long as authority is kept.”
#+end_quote

There's a window of opportunity to abdicate before the Gods' displeasure grows out of hand - and the way her advisors started taking questionable decisions that ended in the narrow points of the plan breaking down, seemingly right after the confrontation in Tvarigu, may be the earliest of those nudges. I personally hope Cat uses her abdication to bargain for the kingdom joining the Grand Alliance, now that it's no longer ruled by the Arch-Heretic of the East.

​

our primary contenders are, the tyrant, the saint or a drow, we can't rule out another fay either but "shrug" don't see any of them making a beeline for the crown if their king gave it up because if you wield it you get murdered, and the king is the essence of his court, hence everyone of them should be somewhat simular in that regard.

​

Tyrant with his wish aspect does offer him some flexibility, but yea everyone is on the watch out for it.

​

Still serving Cat, that is probably a No, being allies does sound likely though since this kind of fey are all about debt, and they might consider themselves to have one towards Cathrine, and not the drow, a single like the lord of silent steps for example.

Looking back, I actually can't interpret this applying to anything else than Larat, who having brought up the story of the fox is probably meant as the fox himself. He just gave up right to rule to escape the trap that would have pitted him against the Night, literally.

I'm hesitant to vote on "Catherine planned this" solely because the chapter isn't an Interlude, really. I don't understand her reference otherwise.

Edit: We know the Bard can interact with Fae, she did it back in Book 2 to keep Black from getting to Marchford until the battle was already over. Could she have influenced Larat to do this?

*** The worthy take, the worthy rise. Larat knew what he was doing when he abdicated in the middle of the drow army that followed Losara Queen's bid to power.

And Bard probably did more than that. I doubt the King of Winter decided to deep-six his Court just in time for Diabolist's plans being looked into by Thief and Squire. The invasion escalated their threat level from "didn't they siege that city a year ago" to "oh Gods why are there so many zombies". The Summer's advance helped to level up the Diabolist and Squire while giving Akua enough time and fodder to make her plans actually work instead of Thief sneaking a crate of goblinfire into the room where the captured Deoraithe were held.

** So, I know this is not currently a popular opinion, but I believe the Rogue Sorcerer will ( in the end) accept the crown.

Think about it: he has sympathy from both villains and heroes, and the last chapter explicitly states that "people who don't want to rule are especially well suited to ruling".\\
He obviously doesn't want it, but he has no other obligations or stakes in the story ( in the sense that the Audience doesn't know/care about his own character arc that he's doubtlessly going through).\\
All the other people in the band of five are very unsuited to taking it. Cat will in no case accept it, she just regained her mortality. Swords is not about ruling at all, and is important to defeat the Dead King. Pilgrim just gave up his right to rule (although the crown, being made from it, might restore it), and more importantly has too central a role in supporting the fight against the Dead King and uniting the Alliance (and it just would sound off tune, if you know what i mean).\\
Archer... I don't know how to explain it other that it's just not her role.\\
Tyrant might make a play for it, but no one will allow him to take it.

Masego regaining his power this way would feel cheap, and binding himself through very strict creation rules just goes against what he's about.

The Rogue Sorcerer is also thematically compatible with the Twilight Court, i think.

*** There's two layers of narrative here: first is the in-universe narrative which Cat and co. can read, and the second is the meta-narrative that EE is setting up.

Even if Rogue Sorcerer would be a halfway decent match narratively, the meta-narrative is really lacking. We don't know him or anything about him and thus we don't care at all what sort of arc he goes through at this point. Introducing him so late to the scene just to take the fall for the highway wouldn't feel very satisfactory.

For that to work out, there would have to be an unforeseen twist like having him be Malicia with a hat on or something.

*** I think you need to go another layer or two. The Rogue Sorcerer is likely the best conscious choice. Then the Tyrant will do the betrayal thing again. At that point, the third candidate either (a) needs to pay a price the Tyrant didn't expect they'd pay or (b) be a player the Tyrant didn't account for.

At that stage, (of characters currently present) I'd guess any of (a) Akua, (b) Crows, (c) Archer, (d) Saint.

** Here's my take on Twilight King 2019:

Peregrine: Would restore his right to rule (not that he's using it). Probably one of the better developments. Would get the Pilgrim out of Cat's hair without killing him.

Saint: Taking the crown would make her less of a sword. Not going to happen.

Masego: Too easy a solution to the "no more magic" issue. Creates too many narrative vulnerabilities for Cat's liking.

Cat: I think sure could get it without getting ganked by the Saint, Pilgrim, or Tyrant, but it's not how her story works. She pays the costs of her power up front.

Tyrant: No clue. He'll probably make a play for it, but he's got a very solid streak going of /nearly/ getting what he wants.

Dark horse candidate 1: Roland. About all we know is that he steals power and makes it his own. Might be the best option for Cat for having someone reasonable get the power while remaining recognizably human. I bet on him being the first proposed candidate before Tyrant's inevitable betrayal.

Dark Horse candidate 2: The Crows. Maybe they've developed a taste for fae power.

Dark Horse candidate 3: Akua Sahelian, after Tyrant's betrayal has been drawn.
