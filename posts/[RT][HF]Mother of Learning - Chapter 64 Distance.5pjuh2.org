** I absolutely loved this chapter. This is approximately the level of detail I enjoy to read.

In a once per three weeks novel, it's nice to have every chapter be very plot-driven, so I can understand people's impatience, however these slower, deeper chapters make me feel the world and its characters feel more alive to me. I really like slowing down to this level of pacing---at least every once in a while, a bit like the interludes in Worm.

I'm very curious what the Adepts decide as well.

**** I think his relaxing of the rules is fair, taking into account his own nature. Even though he's been stuck in the time loop for this long, he still is hesitant to mind search innocent/good people, despite the fact that they're

1. copies of their "real" selves and
2. going to forget it once the time loop resets

While he didn't actually go into this, I think it'd be a fair assumption on his part that his simulacrum isn't going to kill him and replace him, just based on his own rules of morality that he's still been following despite all this time interacting with arguably fake people and experiencing the nonpermanance of his actions.

I also find it fairly safe to assume that the warning given about the simulacrums was based on your average user of them, who tend to be less morally sound.

I do find it concerning that he's having his simulacrums perform tasks that he wouldn't want to do himself at times, though. He does seem to unconsciously have the mentality that they're expendable, which can be dangerous.

Maybe his simulacra will eventually knock some sense into him and make him realise that he should treat them as largely equals instead of servants. Better at some things (no need to eat or drink, can't break bones), not so good at others (probably can't survive the loop), but just as intelligent, and he should make less assumptions about being the master.

****** That's a fair point, I suppose! I hadn't thought of that. I'm not Zorian, but I have to admit I would rationalize with the idea that Extern!Zorian having pretty nearly been (from a within the time loop perspective) stopped in time. With his simulacrums, they're both "people" who've developed at the same rate and have a respect for each other, sort of.

So basically, Extern!Zorian and Loop!Zorian have exactly the same experiences up to a certain point, then Loop!Zorian's continue and Extern!Zorian's stop. That would arguably qualify more as an "addition" then a "kill-and-replace" (to me personally).

But that is definitely an interesting thought. I don't think Zorian himself has thought through the implications of that yet past "I want to get out". It probably helps that he hasn't seen or interacted with Extern!Zorian at all, so he can sort of think of him as a "shell" for him.

******* I'm sure that Zorian would love to get out of the loop non-destructively if he can. His original self isn't likely to be much help in fighting the invasion, but he's still a person.

If the only way out, though, involves booting out the original soul and taking over the body - well, without loop!Zorian's intervention, the original would die in the first artillery barrage anyway. Better for one of them to survive than none. Plus the many, many thousands of other people in Cyoria who loop!Zorian may be able to save. And as you say, loop!Zorian is simply a continuation of the original, so in one sense, original!Zorian wouldn't even be lost.

If, somehow, they both survive, that's gonna be a whole new level of interesting. Dealing with simulacra is one thing, but they had all his knowledge and knew that they were ephemeral. How would he deal with a copy of himself that is still grouchy, anti-social, at odds with all his family, and knows nothing about the time loop? Which one is more entitled to be with his family?

  I thought the only limitation on teleportation was on distance and that you had to have been there before
#+end_quote

Mana costs scale with distance and the (number/size/mass?) of the things being teleported. Divining the location of the teleport destination is an integral component of the spell, and mana cost scales with the difficulty of the divination. The divination is made more difficult by distance and interference.

Breaking a long-distance teleport into multiple steps makes it more practical, implying distance scaling is super-linear.

The degree to which Zorian finds teleporting to Cyoria's beacon to be less mana-intensive (spending "most of his mana" versus... not) implies the divination is a very significant part of the spell's cost. The divination component may even be solely responsible for the distance scaling.

In Chapter 26 Zorian implies you can't teleport "somewhere you've never set foot in". However, Zorian teleported with Kael to collect alchemy ingredients in places Zorian had not been and Alanic used Zorian as a courier without being concerned about whether Zorian had been to the destinations. At the very least you can also teleport somewhere if you have someone who has been there before.

This requirement seems to be simply a matter of being able to divine the location sufficiently accurately. If you or some other person willing to assist you has been to the destination, that can be used.

Targeting anywhere in the vicinity of a teleport beacon results in a very strong signal from the beacon, returning the location of the receiving area as the result of the divination. This strong signal is easier to use and takes a great deal of skill to ignore if you are trying to target somewhere else. It also interferes with teleportation departing from the vicinity of the beacon.

A recall anchor can be targeted without having been at the destination and allows the caster to teleport through interference. A more complex anchor incorporating spell formulae has a greater tolerance for interference.

The whole "having to have been somewhere before" looks like one of those things beginners are taught that's completely wrong but good enough for most use cases.

Having a really good method of divining the target location may make long-distance teleportation much more practical. Some possibilities are:

- A recall anchor
- The link between his soul and a simulacrum
- The soul marker on a simulacrum
- Some sort of "beacon" spell cast by a simulacrum providing a target for his teleportation, with coordination via mind-magic

  Teleportation had a reputation of being dangerous among most mages. This was because, at its core, the classical teleportation spell wasn't a pure dimensionalism spell -- it had *a substantial divination component that divined the exact coordinates of the location the caster was trying to reach*, and if the caster set up the divination wrong... well, all sorts of weird and unpleasant things could happen. Then there was a fact that some people really didn't like people teleporting into their home and territory and set up wards that didn't just cause teleportation to fail, but to fail catastrophically. Such wards were illegal, but used by a certain type of people anyway.

  Other than that, though, teleportation was a fairly safe and convenient method of transportation. So long as your destination wasn't behind wards. Or underground. *Or somewhere you've never set foot in*. Yeah.

  Ah, whatever, the point was that it could get him to Cyoria in mere moments. Cyoria thankfully had a teleport beacon in the city that funneled travelers into a central location and simultaneously *made teleportation easier (and less mana intensive) for the mage doing the teleporting*. That meant that *Zorian wasn't going to spend most of his mana* on the teleport, which was a very good thing.

  "Excellent. The intruder alarms shouldn't be much of a problem, then," Gurey said with a grin. "Aldwin had this neat trick where he could *turn an item into a teleport beacon of sorts*, and then simply teleport himself to its location *without having to have been there in the past*. I'm sure I can get some innocuous-seeming thing through the door, you just have to cast the spell on it. I don't know how to cast the spell myself, but Aldwin did write it down in one of his journals..."

  "Spell you say? No spell formula involved?" asked Zorian curiously.

  "No. '*Spell of recall*', I think it's called. It's a two-part spell -- you first cast a personal teleport beacon on an item, and it immediately *forges a connection between you and it*. You can then cast the second spell at any time, causing youself to be 'recalled' at the location of the item. According to Aldwin, it was meant to be used for rapid escape -- you cast the first spell on a retreat point and then use the second spell to teleport there if you end up in a bind."

  "Why not use a regular teleport for that?" frowned Zorian. "Sounds like a lot of trouble when a normal teleport will suffice. After all, you've already been to the location you're teleporting to if you're setting it up as a retreat point."

  "I really don't know. You will have to find that out yourself if you're interested," Gurey said.

  Fortunately, during the month-long recuperation, Zorian had come up with an idea of how he could side-step his current limitation as far as teleportation was concerned. Which was why, before descending into the dungeon, he turned one of the large stones he found on the outskirts of Knyazov Dveri into a recall anchor.

  The *recall spell* was outright made specifically for quick retreats, and the link forged between the caster and the anchor ensured *they could teleport out even from areas warded against teleportation*. Well, so long as the wards were basic ones, since those protections simply *disrupted the targeting part of the teleport* rather than inhibiting dimensional warping as such. Consequently, Zorian had a feeling the spell would work to yank him back to the anchor, even though the Dungeon interference.

  He was right... sort of. He had found that past a certain depth, the strain on the link became too much and it snapped. Before that happened, however, the spell worked flawlessly, allowing Zorian to quickly teleport away to the surface. The depth past which it ceased to work was too shallow for his liking, but he was confident he could strengthen the link. Over the next couple of days, he worked to combine several marking spells and his knowledge of spell formula in order to *create a stronger anchor for the recall spell -- one that would allow it to power through any amount of rock and Dungeon interference*. He was largely successful in this, though the anchor object had to be pretty large to contain the final spell formula he designed. No matter, there was no need to make the anchor particularly portable for what he had in mind.

  [Yes, what of it?]

  [That's not enough stops for an effective teleportation chain,] Zorian said. [Only two stop points *for a journey of such distance*, with the final destination point *being deep underground to boot*? There is no way that's really what's happening. If they were sending letters or small packages maybe, but no way could you transport an army like that. Even if Quatach-Ichl is the best mass teleporter in the whole damn world, *the mana costs for such long jumps would be completely impractical on that scale*.]

  Admittedly, such a small number of stops would do much to explain how they could transport such an army through Eldemar territory without being discovered by Eldemar, but...

The effect which can't stop Zorian is the part which forces incoming teleports to land there (see the first time Zorian teleported with Ilsa). Apparently, this also attempts to require outgoing teleports to leave from the expected spot (I hadn't noticed this before). This makes sense with the teleport transport network described in this chapter.

I wonder if this redirecting/security/navigation aspect is essential to the finding-your-destination aspect, or completely orthogonal. I expect orthogonal, no reason to need that for outgoing teleports - or maybe that is an unwanted side effect?

**** it might not be the case that Zorian was teleporting to places he hasn't been before w/ Kael. Zorian has personally explored a great deal of that region when he was running away from Cyoria and on Silverlake's requests. so it's possible he simply teleported to the general area and then him and Kael walked the rest of the way (or he really has already been there)

in Ch 32 where Alanic asks Zorian to be a courier, there's no implication that Alanic went with Zorian (he's delivering letters and packages so why go with anyways?). so it's likely that Alanic was only sending him to go to common places or at least close to them

***** I agree with both those counts. The time with Kael especially, if he could just rely on Kael's knowledge of the location, they wouldn't have had to walk for hours to get to the graves.

Also, when Alanic was curious about the soul well, he still relied on Zorian for the teleportation, since it was a place Alanic hadn't been to before himself.

My main questions are "how much familiarity is actually needed to teleport to a place?" and "Can Zorian use his perfect-recall memory packets to shorten the amount of time needed to pick up a new location?"

It's not especially clear how much of Zorian's reserves the teleport spell requires. The bit that cretan_bull quoted from chapter 26 only gives us some idea, along with this follow up that was left out:

#+begin_quote
  He had to wait half an hour or so until his mana reserves regenerated enough that he would feel safe descending into the Dungeon,
#+end_quote

Later in the story, Zorian is able to chain 2-4 teleports to avoid being tracked, presumably without depleting his reserves and leaving himself vulnerable. He also uses short distance teleports in combat, which wouldn't be especially practical if they use up a quarter of his reserves either. Teleporting from his home to Cyoria was probably more mana intensive because of lack of of practice with the spell and distance than the other examples I gave.

My guess is, when it comes to extremely short teleports (within nearby visual range) Zorian can probably manage a pretty high number, say, 20 or so.

When it comes to several kilometers, probably only 6-12 in a row.

When it comes to the range limitation of the spell (150-300 kilometers? Hasn't been made clear in the story.) Zorian can probably only do 2-3.

I still feel like Zorian could learn new locations on his own/with simulacra+memory packets after paying a person to teleport him there initially, then teach the locations to Zach, and between the two of them they could chain teleports and get to Koth in 1-3 days. I think Zorian's current skills in divination and dimensionalism make his spell more efficient, but Zach's greater reserves should still allow for maybe 10 max distance teleports before needing to recharge (30 minutes - 3 hours). But I'd say it's pretty clear at this point that either there's an underlying rule I'm failing to pick up on, or the author simply doesn't want to go this route.

****** if we take the two maps on subsection of Altazia and the northern hemisphere at large, we can get a sense of scale. we can see that Knyazov Dveri and Cyoria/Korsa aren't terribly far apart in comparison to the Altazia subregion as a whole. then when we look at the northern hemisphere, the smaller map of Altazia is tiny compared to the distance to Koth. so, the total number of jumps might be larger than you expect. also reminder that 30min-3 hours for recharge is assuming sufficient ambient mana levels. it might not be that fast in many of the destinations they get to.

tho yea, once a simulacrum is able to reach Koth, chain teleportation is an option. but as mentioned in already, it's not their only option and it'll take some time (maybe a couple of restarts) for a simulacrum to be able to reach Koth so let's explore options while that's happening!

  Teleportation has range limitations. The cost increases with distance and the amount of people being teleported, and the increase is not linear. Zorian would have to chain teleports to reach his simulacrum, and he'd run out of mana fairly quickly and have to wait for it to recharge. He'd lose a lot of time waiting for his mana reserves to come back, so his progress would be fairly slow, and he'd would be unable to do anything magic-related while he journeyed in this fashion.

It was implied that the he refuses to let Zorian read his mind out of a compulsion imbedded by RR. Zach only started using anti mind magic after the Aranea made contact with him. I have a theory that they might have undone some of the damage RR did. I also suspect that Zach has the knowledge of how to control the Sovereign Gate as a Controller, and more about the timeloop, buried in his mind. This would explain how the Matriarch had solid information about this that was in her last mind package.

The whole point of this expedition was to bypass that range limit by having spellcasters at both ends. The simulacrum is meant to help cast it when it reaches Koth. But if the spell has no special costs besides the fiddly task of coordination, then using a Gate to get the necessary funds along the way seems well worth it.

as mentioned, it's pushing the boundaries, but if simulacrums were considered people and afforded the same rights as normal people, I'd imagine the spell itself to be a lot more taboo/illegal than it currently is. for one, the caster is basically required to keep it active until death, never allowed to dispel them without it being considered murder. which is basically what Batak mentioned as a minority view before the quote above

******** [[/u/DCarrier]], too

I meant "need" a little more loosely than [that]. just like a child needs their parent to survive doesn't mean their utterly doomed if their parents die or abandon them (maybe not entirely applicable but puts my point across). at the very least, what I meant was that the soul wont care if the simulacrums are gone but the original body will have an effect on the soul. I'd imagine if the original body is destroyed while any magic is being active (simulacrums, persistent magic, etc. the ones that require active upkeep), that magic will fizzle out since the soul at that point is unable to keep the magic active since it can't think on its own, so it'll basically become inactive, cutting off support for magic

if we go that route of the soul not needing the the body, the body doesn't necessarily need the original soul (though flesh golems aren't really alive so not entirely mirrored).

or to twist it another way, to function properly, the soul and body need each other. a body without a soul can't act (but substitute souls or animation cores work) while a soul can't think/act without a body (mind constructs and w/e else is necessary for liches or a new body can work as substitutes).

I mean, to give an example of what I'm trying to say here, a 100-year-old man dating a 300-year-old man seems a little less squicky than a 100-year old man dating a 15 year old girl. Maybe I'm wrong, but the former seems more likely to make for a healthy relationship than the latter.

***** As for Zach/Zorian please no. I don't know exactly how long Zorian has been in the loop, but it's been a lot less then 100 years. I think it's been even less then ten years, but I'm not sure. Personally I don't really care about a mental age differences so long as physically they are around the same age. I would care if one of the characters was really young like 12 or younger, but 15 is pretty mature. Frankly stories about things like 1,000 year old vampires dating humans beings are really common. It seems fine to me. At any rate even if 15 is to young he could just wait a couple years and then they would be 18. Then it would be hard to find something to complain about.

I don't think you can just assume that 30 years in the time loop is the same as 30 years of natural aging. Also, I imagination that what people experience effects how they change. For example if Zorian spent ten years womanizing it might effect him differently then if he spent ten years training his magic.

********* I agree; I usually roll my eyes at the 1000-year-old dating a normally-aged person. However, I just realized it may not be so far-fetched.

It is certainly possible that as time passes, some individuals may be more accepting of more types of people.

For example, to some 12-year-olds, a 7-year-old may seem insufferably naive and annoying. However, to a 18-year-old, the 7-year-old's naivety may simply be endearing, and the child's lack of emotional control may be sympathized with due to the adult's increased patience.

And certainly, some young people /do/ successfully date older individuals. I know many who have had (and continue to have) long-term relationships with people with decades-wide age gaps. The largest I know of is a friend who was 21 when she met her 60-something-year-old boyfriend, and they only "broke up" when she changed locations for education at age 25. And despite the break-up, I believe he's still helping her pay for school.

And I know several women in their early twenties who have said they specifically prefer men in their late thirties or early forties because men their age often seem immature, which they find tiring.

So in the real world, there's definitely precedent for both increased and decreased compatibility as the age gap increases, and I wouldn't say these examples are uncommon.

Despite this, adults dating high schoolers /does/ feel really uncomfortable. However, given what we know about Kirielle's arranged marriage at 15, in this setting, 15 may well be "of age".

I don't buy the Red Simulacrum theory, though. A simulacrum wanting to join the loop would have all of the same obstacles as a regular human being, /plus/ the additional difficulty of lacking its own soul and being tied to Zach's. Since the Gate only cares about the Controller's soul, there is no reason for the Simulacrum's mind and body to be recreated. They aren't part of the template.

A sufficiently skilled simulacrum, maybe with mind magic that Zach has forgotten, might be able to overwrite someone's mind with its own and thus gain access to a body that is in the template. But then, as I said, it still has all the same challenges if it wants to somehow duplicate the Controller marker.

******** I have to disagree. It has the controller marker because it shares zachs soul. The simulacrum theory provides a good theory to explain two of the major puzzles in this whole thing: how did red robe loop (answer: he shares zachs soul) and how did he trick the gatekeeper into thinking he was the controller (answer: he had zachs soul). He does need to provide a body, but mind magic should do that nicely.

The main downside to the whole theory is that it doesn't explain who sent zach on this to begin with, or what happens when a simulacrum steps out of the simulator. Can he still share a soul and mana through the supposedly incredible separation of the blackroom simulator? The latter is unanswerable by us, but plausibly handwaveable. I also have to wonder why red robe didn't seem all that badass, if he was a clone of zach. Possibly because if he used too much mana then even zach, a veritable fountain of the stuff, would notice.

Other main theory I have is simply that the royals/whoever had a key hacked the artifact, and managed to inject their own agent, red robe. Maybe Damien found another key in his mission abroad. They didn't realize that Zach's genetic marker would always trigger, even with their hack.

I don't think that that will get it through the Gate without sharing Zach's body. Let's think about how the restart works.

- The Guardian pulls all marked souls into the Gate for safekeeping
- The Gate destroys the (pocket) universe
- The Gate builds a new universe from the template, including Zach's body and brain.
- The Guardian anchors marked souls back to their respective bodies.

None of those steps will create an extra ectoplasm body or magical brain that wasn't in the template.

The only way for a simulacrum to simply exploit its connection to Zach's marker, as far as I can tell, would be to overwrite his mind with its own and replace him. Which didn't happen; he's still around.

That's why soul kill was such a concern. So the Gate could simply restore the current mind state if the soul marker is present. Thus a simulacrum may be able to get its mind restored because it effectively has a marker. It does still need a body, but it's possible that it could overwrite another's mind or possess someone in some fashion that would 'count' to the Gate.

** What a sweet little chapter. Hurray for ships!

It was nice to have lost of details of the teleport mechanics. I thought that Zorian would put a teleport recall anchor on a charm and give it to Kirielle, then teleport to her when she got to Koth at the end of the month. Range seems to be the limit.

Those secretive spiders. The Bakora Gates have been described as a "network". Spiders should be good a networks, right? Maybe they have to protect themselves from QI and others that use the Gates.

This story has a lot of gates and nets.

Simulacrum Zorian is my new fave character. It's interesting how he's a nested character, just as our Zorian is just a copy of real-world-outside-of-the-Sovereign-Gate Zorian.

I can't see Zorian Prime being so easy to manage. I hope we get to see him again from Loop Zorian's perspective. Even though Loop Zorian said that he'd kill the Prime if he had to, I'm hoping that his use of simulacrums has change his mind.

Not really the same thing, as this Zorian has his own (copied, mutilated) soul, where as the simulacrums don't.

That's probably a long way away. It seem like it's going to take a lot of chapters just to get out of the Sovereign Gate. Or just to get to Koth.

***** The only way that I can see loop!Zorian meeting original!Zorian is if he somehow brings his physical body with him when he leaves the loop. In which case, their reactions to each other would be fascinating (and possibly hilarious), but they would have no need to compete (since both would have bodies).

To meet your future self and see them demonstrate vastly superior skills to your current self would be a mixture of intimidating and inspiring.

****** There doesn't seem to be too many options for Zorian, or anyone, to leave the Sovereign Gate physically. I also think that Physics would be against it- the SGate creates a huge amount of matter for a very short, accelerated burst of time that's so small, in order to keep the energy cost low. It would break Irl conservation of mass/energy principle if someone could walk out of the gate. But hey, this is fiction, so who knows.

Zorian speculated that if he escaped from the loop, his soul would snap back to his original body. Zorian also thought that RR would be able to displace the original RR due to his skills as a necromancer.

I was thinking that only Loop Zorian's soul can escape from the Sovereign gate- as explained in the control room. This might set up a situation where Loop Zorian has to possess Zorian Prime- something he'd be well able to accomplish with his mind magic.

He could then manifest himself in a ectoplasmic body, or by remote controlling an automaton. I have a pet theory that Zorian Prime's body would function as a phylactery- without a body of his own, it would be Loop Zorian's only access to essential life force. Either that, or Loop Zorian could have to make himself into a Lich. The simulacrum spell was stated as being part way towards making a Lich spell.

From my perspective as a reader, I wouldn't really care if Zorian Prime got obliterated in favour of Loop Zorian's survival. I'm interested to see if the author goes there for comedic shenanigans. Zorian Prime had a huge inferiority complex over Daimen's excellence, and I think he'd feel very threatened by Loop Zorian being a better version of himself.

You know what? He probably should have given one to the simulacrum and started setting up his own teleport chain, choosing convenient waypoints and jumping there & back so he can visit those places in future. He might need Zach's help to get back once the number of stops starts rising, but it could be a head start if they have to do this again.

**** Hi there :)

Hmm, I'm guessing that ZSimulacrum can make a stable gate with Zorian from where ever he reaches by the end of the month, which bypasses the need for teleport anchors. Also, maybe teleport chain locations can be included in the memory packets?

I like how ZZ are following all three viable leads- gating with the simulacrum, the Silent Doorway Adepts, and the invader's Bakora Gate, instead of picking one and following the plot from there. Very rational.

Good point, that's much better than teleporting at this range.

Note that they're viable at different times. The simulacrum has to head off ASAP to be useful, the spiders need an early start to allow for the negotiations but not leaving so early that they'd miss out on the Black Rooms, and the invaders' gate is vulnerable at the end of the month.

***** On the subject of teleport points, though, previously the idea of travelling to Koth via teleport chain was dismissed as "too much time waiting for mana reserves to recharge." However, since he now has a simulacrum making the trip anyway, let's actually do some math on it.

Zorian's max teleport range is unknown, but let's assume he can cross half of Eldemar in one jump. Earlier chapters seemed to imply he could [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/49/Mother-of-Learning][teleport all over the country as he pleased]]. Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5pjv30/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_64/dcsglot/][mana costs aren't linear]], he could probably stretch his reserves further by breaking it into smaller jumps, but that's a starting point.

A brief look at the [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/MoL-verse-World-Map-Huge-657220714][world]] and [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/Altazia-Political-Outline-575261642][continent]] maps makes me think that's a few hundred km. Koth is [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/64/Mother-of-Learning][estimated around 7000km]]; the distance from Zorian's home to the southern tip of Altazia is at least 1/7 of that, likely more, so at least 1000km. And "half of Eldemar" looks like about 1/5 of that distance, so about 200km. Let's call it 150 to account for not travelling in a straight line.

So, at that rate, Zorian (actually his simulacrum) needs to make about 50 jumps to reach Koth. How fast can he do that?

Well, [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][from the blog]], we know that a very skilled mage, which Zorian is, can regenerate reserves completely in 30 minutes. And the author [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5gipl8/rthfmother_of_learning_chapter_62_improperly_used/daw7fjc/][has confirmed]] that the simulacrum can do mana meditation to increase assimilation rate, so that works. Let's assume he always has to leave 1/3 of the reserves available for the original, though, and sometimes the ambient mana might not support that (I think it's tied to the location of the original, but even he might be out of town sometimes), so let's allow an hour. So, 50 hours of jumping.

The simulacrum [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/64/Mother-of-Learning][needs to sleep, but not eat or drink]]. So let's say he can jump & recharge for 16 hours a day. That will take about 3 days and change.

All he needs is the knowledge of locations so he can teleport there. Which, having made the trip once, he should now have.

****** There's room to improve this. He can still pay mages to teleport him, especially on Altazia, and by now he should have an idea of which ones are worth approaching. He could carry mana crystals, either for low-mana areas, or as lightweight universal currency, whichever is more efficient. He could adjust his sleeping hours, so he gets 8 hours where the original is asleep and his reserves don't have to be shared. And I still think he should try resupplying with intermediate gates.

*** there'd be absolutely no reason for her to leave the ball into the city and promptly attacked by winter wolves.

maybe a red herring from Zorian (but quite doubtful), but Zorian has already interrogated everyone. Zorian has also shown off too much and Akoja also knows what he's like and capable off (to a minor extent). she has been attending class all the time and also Zorian has already admitted to it being very difficult to keep his magical prowess a secret so what's the chances of Akoja doing the same? for much longer?

Red Robe is also constantly shielded. Zorian can read Akoja's emotions, so she isn't. even Red Robe wouldn't be oh so clever enough to leak emotions of her crushing on Zorian to him while selectively hiding her anger/insanity of him rejecting her constantly before she even had any reason to suspect other time loopers. and what kind of person would constantly ask a person out knowing they're in a time loop and will be rejected?
