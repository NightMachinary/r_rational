** [Plan - The Chalice from the Palace]

Super basic and action focused plan this time. I still want to get to research, but I think other things should be handled first.

[Action - Zelda]

- Speak to Taetus privately. Attempt to discern if the marriage thing is what he was hiding. Talk to him about his long-term goals. Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we /do/ want to work with him.
- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.

[Action - Link]

- Continue the marking process.
- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
- While heading toward the ghost gerudo area, activate the disc to detect for old magic periodically, especially in the area near where you sensed magic previously. Attempt to take enough readings to triangulate the source of old magic and find it. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.
- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed.

Edit: Removed Gerudo language part, it was unnecessary.

Edit 2: Added for Taetus convo: "Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we /do/ want to work with him."

*** Edit: I think I prefer Cariyaga's plan.

I'm fine with this, but I really prefer we mark Taetus over Koja if we can only choose one - he'll be more important long term, and we need a notably different perspective IMO

i'm not super convinced about the VP gains we'll see from Koja either.. although that said, I can't really see Taetus ever generating more than baseline amounts...

***** The problem I have with this is that /Taetus already holds a power shard./ like, Link was extremely obviously on our side, so there was no real risk of betrayal, but I'm not convinced of the same with Taetus. As soon as we active mark Taetus, however, we essentially gain control of him.

This either doesn't matter (we can mark both) or it does matter (we can only mark one this update) in which case I argue we need insight and control over the last person holding a superweapon (before Shesan rolls around and gives him any funky ideas) sooner than two updates from now.

The other option is to mark Koja which gives us insight into her personality and, like, a hundred and fifty extra VP. I'm simply not sold that she's that important compared to Taetus...

#+end_quote

I think he's a greater risk, absolutely, but that's the reason why I want to have time to vet his motives before we mark him.

This may be hyper-paranoid, but I'm not confident that getting a character's perspective actually means we can trust them. We're not seeing their thoughts and intentions at all times. There may also be mechanics within he setting (e.g. power fragments) that could mislead or subvert the effects of our mark. Illusion and subversion style magic exists within the Cosmere setting as a whole.

If I was confident that the mark would actually put him under our control, I'd agree, but I'm not actually confident in that.

The other advantage of marking Koja is that if, say, Link gets terribly injured, we'll have a healer with near infinite mana to potentially help him (similar to what happened with Empowered Zelda at the start of the story). This is both applicable to potential ghost fighting and future encounters where Link is at risk.

I'd also like to see if other marked are capable of going through the Lightsworn barriers, or if that requires the egg. If other marked can go through, we could potentially have sheikah going and drinking the water back at the wind temple immediately and gaining a /lot/ of VP (and power ups). Maybe explore the alternate route in there that was magic focused, too.

******* i think the core difference in our views here is that you think we'll get less out of marking taetus (as in, it potentially won't work as well) and that you think the ghost business is higher risk than I do

i'm not certain how to resolve this... the only comment i can make is that if our interface into the game world is compromised there's exactly fuckall we can do so it's almost worth removing that from our threat model so we're not hamstringing ourselves on something we can't fix even if it does happen, especially when we currently don't have any evidence that we've been compromised yet...

#+end_quote

I don't think we've been compromised yet - I think that marking someone who has abilities like, say, Hemalurgy or a power fragment is a potential vulnerability to our interface.

Above and beyond magical forms of subversion, though, there's also just the fact that we're not seeing every bit of our character viewpoints nor controlling every decision that the characters make. (See: Zelda with the scepter in the temple, for example, or how emotionally she handles conversations.)

Having a limited perspective on someone who may be malevolent toward our other perspectives does not necessarily give us complete forewarning in case of emergencies. A sufficiently motivated marked antagonist might be able to eliminate our other marked, gain admin access, etc. without us being able to interfere in time.

Is that likely? No, I don't think the QMs would probably play that way. I just don't want us discounting it as a possibility.

#+begin_quote
  also, you're wanting us to travel back to the previous place a week out? we can mark another person then if we don't do it now for the actual experiment...
#+end_quote

To be clear, I don't want the whole group to backtrack for a week to test this. We could either a) test it with one person backtracking or b) test it at the next temple.

If we test it at the next temple and discover that any marked can go through the barriers, we have the opportunity to send any marked we want back to the wind temple to get the benefits of that place. A sheikah traveling with Link allows us to test this; Taetus and Zelda do not, unless they are traveling to temples, which they are not likely to do.

We absolutely could delay this kind of thing until we reach one of the temples, though; this is more of a future advantage to having multiple people in Link's group marked.

** Pretty much exactly the same as The Chalice from the Palace for Link, with some extra meetings and marking Taetus for Zelda.

[Plan Por que no las dos?]

Zelda Actions

- Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best +evangelize+ spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, offer to have him marked. If he doesn't accept he better have a really good reason.
- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.
- Ask Shesan to clarify what she meant by the Niesis incident 'unsealing the fae'. Do this before meeting with Vestele.
- Arrange your intended meeting with Vestele. Apologize for putting the Faith in that awkward position. If Shesan clarified what she meant about fae being unsealed, communicate that. Also ask if the Seekers have more information on how Sacrifice was used to appease the fae and what boons they granted in exchange. Fi can potentially replicate the boons without the whole human sacrifice issue and Ganondorf may be using Sacrifice to attack Hyrule. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

Link Actions

- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed. Use the disc for more precise directions.

+Meta choice: Taetus should be the 3rd viewpoint character and Koja with a passive mark, if both are successfully marked.+

Edit: +Since Fi can't mark people simultaneously, marking Koja should start immediately. Marking Taetus would have to happen after it completes.+

Based on the QM answer removing marking Koja.

Go big or go home. Bring Laylith, tell her that we are about to interrogate Taetus, and that our decision based on what he says will be final.

Then whammy him, with something like "Obey all orders and answer all questions I ask you completely." If Laylith doesn't play nice, we kick her out.

If we are feeling vicious, at the end we kick her out anyway, and ask Taetus for his most damaging secret.

If the man manages to have us not hate him after a no holds barred interrogation with his worst enemy in the room, then we mark him.

He sounds like a hell of a guy. Honestly, if we weren't Zelda, I would be rooting for him. If we weren't in a war for existence, I would vote we help him make his changes more palatable to the nobles. But we are.

Also, this should scare the daylights out of Laylith. Be sure to invoke Hylia when doing it, or she might think we got it from Shesan.

We have the divine right to rule, and I want Taetus and Laylith both to think long and hard on what that actually means.

** Modification of Mathematicae's modification of Salaris' plan. This one adjusts some wording (Notably, not leaving Taetus the option to refuse the mark), and adds in pursuit of Blin test subjects for more dangerous void magic.

[Plan - Sacrifices and Servants]

Zelda Actions

- Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best evangelize spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, inform him that he will be accepting the mark of the Goddess' agent, Fi.

- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel.

Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

- Arrange for the capture and containment of Blin, who may serve as test subjects for more dangerous magical experimentation.

Link Actions

- Mark Koja iff it won't cost significantly more than Taetus, or we decide against marking Taetus.

- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.

- Continue testing the disc's void magic detection and attempting to improve it. See if you can find the source of magic you detected in the ghost area. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.

- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed; do not be afraid to draw back and reengage later.

** *Rules Announcement: Fi Admin Privileges*

With the elimination of "Legacy" as an entity in the quest, a gap has been opened up to explain where [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fzscpf/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/fn9mztr/][Fi's SOP]] comes from, as well as how to resolve conflicts between Marked.

As of now we are codifying that Zelda is the primary authority on Fi's behavior. She defines Fi's SOP and what Fi will or will not do. If, for instance, Zelda didn't want to allow Link to be able to use Fi's MP reserves, then she would have the power to forbid it.

Admin privileges can be assigned to other Marked via ᏪᏅᏮ'ᏡᏨᏨᎲ' ᏇᎤᏫᏬ'ᏇᏅᏍ' ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏈ [voting]. Death or permanent incapacity of the current admin will trigger an immediate ᎣᏫᏮ'ᏨᏅᏨᏭ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏡᏨᏨᏨ~ᏈᏨ [vote].

*Second Announcement (less ruley):*

We have decided to expand the points system a bit more. For a range from 20-200 points (specifics depending upon complexity of request) you can get the QMs to give an "If I were in your shoes" type answer to the question at hand.

Disclaimer: Obviously sans-QM knowledge, absolutely /not/ guaranteed to be a magic answer to your question that leaves you super satisfied.

Amount of effort scales roughly linearly from "honest answer after thinking about it for 5 minutes" to "very serious answer, at minimum meeting Vecht's standard of 'serious.'"

--------------

Your previous VP total was 11079.

Fi spent:

- 76 VP on telepathic communications

- 200 VP on two ethereal avatars

- 100 VP on marking Koja

- 742 VP on charging the stone disk artifact at Link's request

Marking Koja was unsuccessful. Fi believes it will require between 1950 and 6550 additional VP to successfully mark her. Her estimate that "marking additional people requries more VP" has increased from 21.3% to 24.5%.

Chapter 20 spanned 1 day. During that time, you earned 42 VP from Zelda and 40 VP from Link.

You have earned an additional 150 VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus. Total: 150.

** [PROTO PLAN - Divine Right]

[Action - Zelda]

- Test using compel on a imprisoned spy to get them to spill the beans.
- Call the most powerful people in the kingdom (Taetus a must) into a meeting.

  - Their should be at most 6 people in the room besides Zelda.
  - No talking, no objections, no questions.

- Compel everyone besides Zelda to spill their most damaging secrets, and profess loyalty.

  - Let them know that anyone but Zelda abusing these secrets is high treason. Not only will we execute you, we will liquidate portions of your estate and hand them out as we see fit.

- Announce that Lord Councilor is a temporary position, and will be dissolved after the crises has ended, and any decrees will be subject to royal review.

  - However, the crises is not over, and if anyone wants their powers back before it is, they need to prove they can do better than Taetus.

- Remind them that we are Zelda Hyrule. We rule by the will of our Father, the Blood in our Veins, and Divine Right.

  - Open the floor to questions.

The nobles don't like Taetus having power, and they are worried that it will become permanent, because they know we are weak and might not be able to stop him. This assures them that his power won't be permanent, and that we will be able to stop him (because we know all his secrets, and have freaky powers that none of them even guessed we might have.).

And, it enhances our power over them, so if they disagree, they can take a hike.

*** I don't think Zelda has the right personality to use this style of confrontation effectively. She's not a master political schemer, and even if she was, this has huge potential to backfire.

Broken down another way, we stand to gain the following through this kind of strategy:

- Secrets we can use against people.
- If someone is overtly planning against us, we may be able to get rid of them immediately.
- A demonstration of this kind of power could be intimidating.

Downsides include:

- We alienate everyone we do this to, potentially permanently.
- We motivate everyone present who has a sufficiently terrible secret to get rid of both us and everyone else present in the room.
- We expend a potentially tremendous amount of our resources on something that may have no immediate benefits.
- Our intimidation comes from the usage of a power we have barely tested. It could fail to work the way we intend, for example expiring almost immediately or being countered by sufficient willpower, targets with sufficient mana, etc.
- Making powerful people aware we have this means they can plan around it in the future.
- Using this tool now means it is no longer a surprise tool for true emergencies.
- Using this as our tool to inflict fear when we do not have the VP to use it consistently means that we are putting ourselves in a position where we may be put in a position where we are expected to use this and cannot utilize it.

The single most important factor here, in my opinion, is that Compel has not been tested adequately to attempt to deploy it against more than one person at a time. If we want to try to use Compel aggressively, we need to have a much better understanding of it's capabilities and limits first, in my opinion.

If we want to try Compelling someone to spill their secrets, we should test it on one person - perhaps one of the "traitor" sheikah. If we've managed to capture any of Ganondorf's agents, they'd be even better potential targets for testing.

We could also try testing with a trusted ally in order to get feedback on how it feels to them, an accurate idea of how long it lasts, if it can be resisted, etc.

**** My point of view, is that I think its worth it. Yes, it is a nigh ruinous cost, but it should button up our political and administrative problems for the foreseeable future. Some of the nobles might very well be scheming against the crown in dangerous ways. This might get us some immediately actionable intel.

But also, the cost is 100-1000. Are all humans at 1000? This plan might be cheaper than the staggering 7k worst case. Perhaps as small as 4k, which would still make it the most expensive thing we've ever done.

I guess, the game as we've seen it at the moment is split in three. There is "what the f is going on, really?", "Dungeon crawling", and "stop Hyrule from falling apart". This /wins/ a third of the game, and spending most of our VP seems like an acceptable price to pay. We will get more eventually. Judging by the number of Tri Force shards still out there, we are fairly early on, and 7k might not be that much in the grand scheme of things.

Its not a fully polished idea, I don't even name anyone specific besides Taestus. But I think everything else shown here is a half measure, or one that makes our allies think they need to go behind our back to get things accomplished, and makes them believe that they /can/ go behind our back.

/We need to go for the throat/. Demise is pulling moves like "Collapse a neighboring kingdom overnight", "Send a wholly expendable species to fight to the last man", "Kill their goddess before they even know the fight is on", and these are his opening moves. We do not have time to play nice or leave openings. In the long term, this will damage our relationships with everyone, and thats fine, because in the short term it will make everyone too terrified to start shit, /and/ it will stop whatever shit they currently have going dead in its tracks.

** All plans involve speaking to Taetus, but there's one thing I'm missing: talking about how to keep running Hyrule efficiently or how to keep him as a regent with the least amount of pushback from the nobles. In other words, talk with him freely about wether the marriage is a good idea or not.

Maybe it's better to wait until we can see into his head, though.

** For the QMs' convenience, I'd like for support for the following options to be laid out below:

- Marking Taetus ASAP

- Marking Taetus conditionally

- Marking Koja ASAP

- Marking Koja conditionally

And of these options, I would support marking Taetus ASAP and Koja conditionall.

EDIT: Mark Taetus ASAP and Koja possibly never, since it'd come too late for ghost stuff anyway.

Active marks are Zelda, Link and Taetus (obviously)

+Ghost stuff is happening tomorrow, marking takes all day, and Fi can't mark multiple people at a time. So we have to mark Koja now if we want it active for ghost stuff.+

Changed my mind mark Taetus only for now.
