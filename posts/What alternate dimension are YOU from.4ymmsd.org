If there's one thing the rational community has taught us, it's that alternate dimensions exist and that people fall between them all the time. Eliezer Yudkowsky is from [[https://facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10152335268099228][dath ilan]], Scott Alexander hails from [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/15/index-posts-on-raikoth/][Raikoth]], and Ozy Franz is a refugee from [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/my-april-fools-confession/][Silphium]]. As someone born and raised on this earth, I'll probably never get a chance to travel to any of these places. My only chance to experience them is vicariously through the descriptions provided by dimensional travelers like you.

So here's a call that goes out to all those who've fallen through the cracks in the multiverse, leaving behind saner worlds (or not, as the case may be) to end up in ours. Where did you come from? What do miss? Where might this world find itself one day, if we find the right paths to walk?


** I might be from [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/29mvb1/oc_an_undefended_human_world/][Incondnosa]]. I keep meaning to write about it in more detail.

** I am quite sure that when I was five years old, cats had psychic powers.

I can no longer find any evidence of this anywhere, even records of such evidence. I'm not sure if I travelled to an alternate world or if they did.

*** Cats still have psychic powers, don't worry. It's just that they are a lot more inclined to show them to you when you are 5.

**** At least two books mentioned it, too, in the context of cats finding their owners who had moved house to somewhere hundreds of miles away that the cat had never seen.

I can't remember the title of one of those books, and it mentioned the psychic powers theory in what I now realize was a joke. The other one was fiction anyway - /Blitzcat/ by Robert Westall.

**** Some of the dimension jumping rituals appear to resemble new age magic, in that they evoke a placebo effect in the caster to change their attitude/perspective. There are people in the sub who openly claim this is the real mechanism behind jumping, though they are often magic practitioners themselves.
