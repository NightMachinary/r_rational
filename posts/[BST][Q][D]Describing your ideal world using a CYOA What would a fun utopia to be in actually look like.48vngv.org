Hi there, I was looking at a cool tool for generating settings, and I was trying to come up with an ideal setting that, uh, 'maximize awesomeness!', or other rationalist sorts of theory of fun things. I'd like your all's contributions and help coming up with something!

So, to give this a bit of structure, I'm going to limit it to optimizing the 'magical realm cyoa' for 'best possible situation for someone in our in-group with our mostly shared values and memespace to spend eternity at, or at least as their home base.'

If you have no idea what Magical Realm CYOA is, here's some links:

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Magical_Realm_CYOA]] And this has some samples on it, too

And here's an example thread with a bunch of people's builds:

[[http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/32622611/]]

Also, why this is really really hard and why I need help with it, and also a reminder of how to make this actually fun, that I am having trouble with, and need some help brainstorming how to actually follow these:

Have everyone on Earth march through the gateways, which should take about a month, and you're as close as you're going to get using this CYOA. Plus Healing would let you pull off resurrections of dead people from Earth itself, so I threw that one in even though it's not Beisutsukai standard.

** I like the base premise, but the format seems kind of rigid. I took a few stabs at it, but each time gave up, feeling constrained. Not constrained, mind you, by the limited baubles - more by the alternately overly-discrete and maximally capped options. When imagining a fantasy world, I don't see the point in dithering around with unimaginably large quantities instead of jumping straight to infinity - an option consistently denied here. You can say that infinity's meaningless, and you can say that I should be satisfied with Graham's number or whatever, and I say, alright, but why am I expected to care about the difference between five times the size of the sun and a quarter the size of the sun for any reason except "hitting the highest number available"? "My fantasy world is thirty trillion square kilometers" is the nerd equivalent of "the streets of Heaven are paved with gold" - you're just offering up the material best thing you can imagine, and in the process demonstrating that you have a really terrible imagination. Yes, the amount of time required to fully exhaust the novelty of thirty trillion square kilometers cannot be meaningfully imagined by us, but this is [[/r/rational]], have we suddenly gone all deathist? As the linked Fun Theory sequence suggests, a common mark of bad theology - which is, let's face it, basically what we're doing here - is a critical failure to understand what the /eternal/, what the /infinite/, /means/.

Also, I never actually got so far in as to run short of baubles, but I weep for whoever spent their time contemplating, balancing, and assigning bauble values to various traits. What a waste of effort. Resource management and creativity can mix, but not, I feel, like this.

To be fair, I'm guessing some of this depends on knowledge of a specific tabletop setting with which I am unfamiliar.

** Minimum point-cost utopia, since I pretty quickly realized I was going to have some left over. My personal perfectly free utopia, on top of which you can add whatever:

[89] Area Increase 6

[86] Transient

[84] Division

[82] Magical Upgrade 1

[77] Technomagic

[75] Infrastructure

[72] Afterlife

[69] Fate

[67] Blessing

[57] Guidance 2

[56] Insertion

[55] Attitude Adjustment

[80] Trapped!

[105] Partnership!

[100] Technology Upgrade 5

Area Increase: may as well max this, but [Area Increase 6: 11pts] should be enough for the foreseeable future.

[Division: 2pts] and [Transient: 3pts] allow you to switch between location categories at will for arbitrary subsets of your territory, most notably [Insertion: 1pt].

Inhabitants: [Attitude Adjustment: 1pt] makes them universally benevolent. If you want them to outnumber pre-existing humanity, it might be worth springing for [Population Increase 9: 16 pts] or higher.

Magitech: [Magical Upgrade 1: 2pts] means there's a widespread population with powers "about as potent as what you might start with in the Powers section", which includes perfect healing and resurrection, breaking . [Technomagic: 5pts] makes it explicit that magic and technology can be combined. [Infrastructure: 2pts] reaches "across the globe", so free first-world everything everywhere. [Afterlife: 3pts] will catch anyone not saved by all the other safety nets; it's up to you, so just make it "reincarnation will all memories intact".

Future-proofing: [Fate: 3pts] means everything will be subtly but irresistibly guided into whatever. [Blessing: 2pts] guarentees that everything will be a utopia, which seems kind of broken but whatever. [Guidance 2: 10pts] contains "anything and everything that could be necessary to advance or improve oneself", but [Guidance 1: 4pts] grants "untold amounts of information and arcane guidance [...] guidance in any path you wish to take", and is also indestructible, so really this one's up to you.

Munchkinning: [Trapped!] isn't exactly a huge hardship, especially given you can move small parts of you territory into the real world and manipulate them at will. Neither is [Partnership!], given that you don't really need any extra personal benefits in this setting.

--------------

It's probably worth springing for [Secure], [Healthy], and [Public Education], all of which are 1pt each, just for that shiny new "Utopia" feel.

[Technology Upgrade 6: 6pts] gives you "singularity" levels of tech, whatever that means. [Automatons 2: 5pts] removes all menial labour, if that's not already covered (they're under your personal control.)

[Artifact!] is pretty much fine, although it may not be worth risking your [Blessing] for a measly 20pts. [Amnesia!] isn't too bad, either, especially given you have a magic book/library that'll tell you everything.

Does anyone happen to know if there are any tools that could be used to make my own interactive version of this? I've made a similar MYC set in my Fantasy world (so less world building and more carving out your own place in it), but since I don't have any artistic talent, I think the interactive version is the way to go.

** Why does personal immortality only cost two when immortality for the entire population costs three? Do I not count as a citizen of my own realm?

The sadism option is interesting if you think about it for more than a second, because even if you need, say, 50,000 people in a giant torture machine to make it work, that's enough points to bring the total population up to a trillion and make them all fabulously wealthy (in addition to any other benefits you've given your subjects). Would be a more intriguing option if the point budget were tighter, since as is you kind of have enough to make a trillion people happy.

** I rolled five constraints, and that was enough to get absolutely everything I wanted with 38 points left over. It's easier to say what I didn't get than what I did:

Max Area increase, max Pop Increase, max Tech Upgrade, max Magic Upgrade. Did not get Attitude Adjustment or Population Demographics. Did not get Technomagic, it'll combine plenty without making things even weirder. Did not get Religious, Gambling, or Warfare Affinities. Did not get Magical Phenomena, that sounds horrible. Afterlife is volitional reincarnation (and if you come in from the outside, you are specifically given the option of undergoing this process, though it can of course happen at any time). Pantheon no way, Theme is eh and sounds monocultural. I only got Influence 1, although that seems undefined when I have Notorious. I don't have Equipment. I don't have Geas. No Harem or Familiar, though Waifu 2 seems to imply the same thing but with ideal partners.

Ambivalent complications: Partnership and Benevolent (can I make all inhabitants my partners?). Negative complications: Notorious and Exile (really hoping I would get Trapped instead of Exile, but it's finite anyway). Nightmare complications: Nightmare. The Nightmare is unspeakable, but named: he is also known as Donald Trump.

There, that was a much more useful and concise summary.

** Just as a joke I decided right off the bat to maximize my bauble number and took every single complication. However, knowing that I would have all of them, I "rolled" the randomizer to get 12*40 = 480 more baubles. I ended up clicking every single possible option and still had 300 baubles left over. This means that 280 baubles are sufficient to choose every possible option.

Just an interesting munchkin I found, but I think the starting baubles should be smaller to make the "story" better, because otherwise it's too easy to make a Heaven. So there must be some really terrifying monsters out there.

[85] Area Increase 8

[110] Trapped!

[135] Partnership!: Not sure what exactly this means, but can probably "hack" it (if I control who gets this), by giving admin privileges (since the only power I have is my influence over the FAI) to a waifu that I create within the server.

[160] Bound!: Not that I care about being able to lie within a Utopia server, but I /may/ be able to hack this by simply asking the FAI to negate this "tremendous suffering" effect.

[185] Benevolent!: I'm not super scared by this complications effects, however I may be able to hack them anyway, since I will be digitized and thus won't really have "life force".

[179] Influence 3: This will allow me to have the FAI act in accordance to my will more accurately than the other options alone.

[176] Fate: This /really/ guarantees I won't fuck this up.

[173] Afterlife: In case through some miracle a sentient being dies accidentally despite the magic god FAI they reincarnate back in the utopia server.

[170] Exceptional Materials: May be useful to the FAI, things I think will come in handy are negative mass materials, and a material that serves a quantum computer with infinite processing power the limits of this option are unclear, but it will probably come in handy like magic it's unclear if to what extent these effects can be exerted beyond the realms sphere of influence.

[164] Technology Upgrade 6

[154] Magical Upgrade 5

[150] Pantheon: The "pantheon" is really a set of subroutines within the FAI.

[175] Artifact! Kind of a hack given I don't even have any powers.

[172] Assimilation

[166] Protection 2

[162] Portals

[187] Amnesia!: Also bit of a hack since my faithful Magic God FAI will instantly restore my memories afterwards.

*Total: 187!* So yeah even without munchkining this is /super/ broken.

The singularity tech level combined with fate creates a singularity FAI of my liking. I chose the magic options because they may allow the FAI to do things, like circumvent the speed of light barrier and and any number of things, that it couldn't do if limited by normal physics. Most of the other options are rendered redundant because I can just ask the Magic God FAI to do them for me, or do them myself with my admin privileges within the Utopia Server.

Upon closer inspection I'm not sure there's any complication other than nightmare that can't be gotten rid of by the FAI. If choose all 11 of them my total would be *312!*, with the extra points I think I'll take Transient, and Division because they may increase the FAI's ability to exert magical effects outside of my realm, which still leaves me with 307 excess points.

Despite only one of the complications being a real threat to my happiness within the Utopia Server. I would *not* take the 1/12 chance of getting nightmare under nearly /any/ circumstances. Here's why; The power that made this magic happen called it /"unspeakably horrifying"/ if that thing were any normal eldritch horror it would be laughably pathetic to a singularity AI. So since this thing must be horrifying to a post singularity world it must be a rival AI of equal or greater power... Or something not just unspeakable, but /unthinkably/ horrible.

hmmm...

[125] Trapped!

[150] Partnership!

[175] Artifact!

[200] Bound!

[225] Turmoil!

Free Points! Sure I'll have an evil split personality, but that's no problem because I'll have a partner to keep me in check. Also I'll be ditching my Power Artifact ASAP anyway. Who needs it? My familiar has a lesser form of all the powers I want anyway and eventually I'll outgrow the limitation.

[222] Familiar

[220] Inspiration

[218] Awareness

[216] Memory

[215] Tongues

[210] Dominion

[208] Conjuration

[206] Alchemy

[204] Healing

[202] Enchanting

[199] Nullification

[196] Time Manipulation

These ones all make sense for my familiar to be using. Conjuration and Alchemy together are specifically stated to directly violate the laws of thermodynamics, just in case Post-Singularity Tech proves insufficient.

[194] Division

One plane with one set of laws? Boring. Lets have... uh, all of them.

[190] Theme

[186] Pantheon

By the way. Pantheon + Dominion = Godbending. Avatar who?

[183] Fate

[180] Afterlife

Yeah, hows instantaneous reincarnation with all memories intact sound for an afterlife?

[179] Malice

[174] Dungeons 3

[172] Spirits

[167] Fauna & Flora 3

[81] Population Longevity

[79] Pretty Population

[59] Population Increase 10

[44] Area Increase 8

Yeah, that sounds like a good Utopia suite for starters. And frankly, a solid utopia negates the need for most powers, since everyone effectively has most of them anyway. Who needs guaranteed wifus when there are a trillion people with post singularity tech and sexual affinity? Who needs guaranteed immortality when the society provides that for you? Who needs elemental affinities when magic and magitek are commonplace?

[41] Assimilation

[35] Protection 2

[32] Transient

[28] Portals

[23] Gateways 3

Planar Invincibility. Locomotion, etc.

[13] Divine Spark

Honestly, in spite of how breakable this whole thing is, it's still too limiting. I'm sure once I ascend to the level of whatever mad god set up this CYOA I'll have some more options accessible.

And as an afterthought, I'm not sure these make sense without my artifact on hand, but just in case I need to refresh my lifespan, or transform, or in case things go horribly horribly south...

[11] Immortality
