** Finals and essays coming up for summer college, distracted by ruffwriter's SavageDivinty which seems to be getting better after 170 chapters, and three books that are sitting on my desk demanding to be read.

I appreciate constructive criticism. Actually, no I don't appreciate it, I literally giggle like a weasel, and see about fixing or improving on valid criticism.

Anyway, enjoy.
