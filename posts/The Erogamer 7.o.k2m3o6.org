*** Unfortunately, it looks like it won't be alive for much longer.

And while I'd certainly prefer it get a satisfying ending while it's still going strong, rather than petering out into nothingness, it still felt to me like a story that had a lot more to say, and it's sad that it won't get to say it.

** I've started reading it because of comment by

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/Amargosamountain/][Amargosamountain]]

it's not bad, but I am confused, where is the rationality in this story? Do you go by "rpg stats = rational"? Or what?

still, I will read it. Not bad. Thanks for posting it!

*** No, rpg stats by themselves don't make a story rational. But there is different ways characters can react to the world slowly turning into an erotic rpg around them, and the way the characters in this story do felt very realistic, well-thought-out and thought provoking to me.

*** Read at least 'till /the hair/ appears. You'll understand what /the hair/ is once you encounter it. Since then, it gets progressively more and more metaphysical/rational, IMO. I also found the earlier parts of the story a bit disappointing, but it picks up steam fast.

What even is this post?

*** The site is fine. Questionable Questing is just that, a 'Questing' site dedicated to (mostly but not always) questionable quests/stories. It's basically SpaceBattles or SufficentVeloicity if they didn't sensor themselves in any way. It's (for the most part) used as a fanfiction site for sexy/porn stuff. This link is to one of them, the Erogamer, which is actually a Rational fic about a girl that gets a version of The Gamer power except it's like two infinities more powerful than the original and its centered around sex.

As you might imagine, there is quite a bit of sex in it. On the other hand, the plot and exploration of the metaphysical narrative is second to none. It's like Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World in a way, except much more... sexy, rational, and critical of society and ways of thinking. It's actually really good. Both the sexy stuff as well as the plot, and the characters. It's one of the best stories I've ever read actually, regardless of origin or genre.

This specific link is for the latest chapter just released today.

I do recommend it if you're in any way a person that enjoys erotica or is interested in trying it out. It even has its own manga/hentai adaptation (for parts of the series) that the author paid for. It's hilarious, amazingly written, really thought provoking, and very hot.

*** Here's the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] post about the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][Erogamer]] so you can read what others here thought about it before.

It's basically about a girl who becomes a Gamer like in an LitRpg, except the game in question is an eroge aka runs on porn rules. It sounds like it should be a boring harem story chock full of wish-fulfillment, but it scratches the same philosophical metanarrative itch that /Worth the Candle/ does.

Here's the review which sums it up better than any others I have read.

It's worth making an account for if it's only to read this one story.

*** It's unfortunate that you're getting downvoted, since your post seems pretty well cautioned, if a bit aggressive. Just asking what this is about, in future cases, would get you a more positive response, assuming you care about it.

As others say, the website is pretty well known around here (as the less censored version of spacebattles and sufficientvelocity) and the story itself is the best example of its genre that I ever read, and a pretty fun read in general.

**** You can also search for past posts about a topic, but yeah rule 5* should be on every post

It's not a lot to expect someone to write a short comment explaining a post

*Rule 5 from the paradox subreddits

  Explain what you want people to look at when you post an image. Explanations should be posted as a reddit comment - referencing the title is not enough.

***** I think I disagree with that. If a story has been posted here many times before, I think it's fine to just post a chapter update, without a description of the story. Eg, I feel fine with Worth the Candle updates not including a comment like that

****** For something that's posted frequently then you can just copy the R5 from the first thread, it's so effortless that it seems like a small burden

It's most beneficial for those who don't repeatedly view the subreddit.

Seems easier to make a consistent universal rule that all links must require a sentence of explanation than have some exceptions

*** Not OP, but this is a quest that has been recommended here multiple times, especially in Monday threads. Looks like it received an update. (Someone, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was on a hiatus since April or so?)
