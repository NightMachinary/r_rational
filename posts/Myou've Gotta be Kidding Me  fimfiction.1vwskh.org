** Not a big fan, but some people really like it. During the beggining in directly uses dialogue from hpmor. The main character had read hpmor you see.

Hits its stride a ways in. It gets better.

It's a shared universe fic. The concept is that a bunch of gods are selecting champions, mostly from the human worlds. They give them powers, and throw them into a world.

Lots of very low qaulity works in the chessverse, lots and lots of powerful self-insert characters. This author chose to go a different route, making their author-avatar a rationalist instead of giving magic powers.

*** I think chessverse is a fascinating concept, and I think this is the second time this fic has been posted here so I assume its one of the best...

I read to the end but peversely didn't enjoy it all that much. I liked the story and setting but not the writing - felt a bit like I was reading the lyrics to a Will Smith song.

Because of reddit's silly ranking algorithm, there's no way to bump old posts to the front page. For this reason, reposts are not only allowed but explicitly encouraged.
