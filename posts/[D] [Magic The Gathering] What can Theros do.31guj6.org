I was reading [[http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/kruphixs-insight-2014-06-11][this]] short story about Magic: The Gathering and reminded me a lot of existential risk. Let's take this thread as an exercise in reaching your goals in an unfamiliar setting.

*First, some backstory:*

Magic: The Gathering's setting is the Multiverse, which contains a lot of different worlds (called planes) separated by the Blind Eternities. People can't cross from plane to plane (the Blind Eternities kill or drive mad those that would, in some strange way get to them), with the exception of Planeswalker. Your ability to become a planeswalker (called the Spark) is determined completely at random at birth (very low probability) and only kicks in at a time of great emotional upheaval (and also modified by a very low probability).

[[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Theros_%28plane%29][Theros]] is one of these planes. It's inspired by Classical Greek mythology and has a pretty low technology level. The main metal used is bronze, iron is considered divine knowledge and a planeswalker's steel spear is considered a huge advantage. The level of magic is also pretty low. Some individuals can use magic, but their number is rather low (I don't have the exact numbers, but probably around 1 or 0.1% of the population can cast /simple/ spells, with a subset of them being able to cast a greater number or more powerful magic.)

The special features that set this plane apart from other planes:

- It has actual gods. In case you didn't read the story I linked: these gods are basically called into existence because of the beliefs of the people on Theros. A god of the sun exists because people worship the sun. Stuff like that. You /can/ deliberately set out to become a god (which is the plot) but doing so deliberately is hard and sets you up to being killed by the other gods that like the status quo. Gods who aren't worshiped die. The gods have access to magic far more powerful than the rest of Theros, but they are very much not all-powerful.
- It has two "sub-planes:" Nyx, which is the night's sky and the place where the gods live, and an underworld. People who die do lose their personality, but can retain their skills. Their body and soul gets separated and both can escape the underworld independently. The body keeps the skills, the soul the personality. From what I gather, the soul can't really communicate to people.
- It's pretty small, all things considered. It has three cities (think Athens, Sparta but less evil, and a women-led tree city), some villages and a lot of wild land filled with monsters.

The sapient races of Theros are: Humans, Merfolk, Satyrs (live and party hard, can be clever), Minotaurs (dumb brutes, mostly, barely intelligent), Cats (Bipedal, strong sense of honor and community, think lions rather than housecats), The Returned (Zombies, their sapience is up to debate), Centaurs (nature-loving in a positive way), Gorgons (Selfish, dangerous but open to reason), Sphinxes (Intelligent, but annoyingly vague), Demons (Always evil, but open to deals in their favor), Harpies and Sirens(always-evil bird women), Archons (these tend to be embodiments of good on most worlds, but here they're sorta dicks, they are powerful though).

*The Question:*

In the story one of the gods, Kruphex (god of the horizons and mysteries) talks about outside (from other planes) threats to Theros. These threats are (if you didn't read the story):

- The Eldrazi: Eldritch abominations that suck out the magic (and thus life) out of a plane. Just being near them causes you to lose your magic and eventually die.
- Nicol Bolas: A very old dragon planeswalker who has multiple schemes going on at all time. If he wanted, he could single-handedly wipe out all life on Theros, but it would probably take him a couple of hundred years.
- The Phyrexians: An evil organization who wants to kill pretty much everyone and turn them into a creepy mix of flesh and metal (think all the negative things you've ever heard on transhumanism, turned up to eleven). They've taken over an entire plane with just a couple of drops of Phyrexian oil (which is pretty much some sort of evil nano-material).

At present time, only two people know about these threats: Kruphix (the god) and one of his prophets. *What can they do stave of these existential threats, given the resources they have access to?*

Some *limitations* I think I should mention:

- The gods are powerful, but not unlimitedly so. They can influence the lives (and shapes) of individuals but they'd probably have difficulty wiping out a city. It's worth noting that a god was killed by a planeswalker and another god has trouble dealing with another planeswalker. Most of the influencing the gods do is by sending magical creatures into the world, but these creatures are their own agents.
- The people of Theros are not prone to working together. The population of the individual city-states will probably be willing to reach a larger goal together.
- The mortals of Theros don't know powerful magic and learning it seems hard enough that not everyone knows a simple spell. Some creatures (such as gorgons, griffins, dragons...) have their own innate magic.
- The gods can be sorta convinced to grant somewhat powerful magic to individuals in their favor. This magic generally takes the form of an enchantment that permanently changes an attribute of that individual.
- You can't rely on outside help. All planeswalkers that care about Theros are dead and the ones that know about it either won't return soon or have no incentive for saving it.

(In case you want more information, [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&format=%5B%22Theros+Block%22%5D][here's]] a list of all the cards of the plane and I'll try to answer any and all questions you might have.)


** Alright, so after telling this to any other gods that'll listen, I'd start sending my prophet to Athens and uplifting anyone who'll join my church (plus any other gods in the "Save the World" pantheon). Smite anyone who tries to mess about with their new powers.

Unify the world under my church. I'll be rather open, all things considered- No worship exclusivity or discrimination. I need this belief and control. If I can't get the various city-states to work together, I'll split various capacities of R&D between them and just encourage trade and information exchange.

Can I make planeswalkers? Make a few, send them to various worlds to learn magic/technology/new ideas and bring them back. (If I can make unlimited planeswalkers, do it to everyone and mass emigrate to somewhere nicer, after having rescued everyone from the underworld)

Once I have a good base of operations, start research on magic itself. We'll need some real powerhouse spells to fight the BioBorg. See if I can jump start an industrial revolution too- The Eldrazi will have the shock of their life when they hit with a nuclear warhead instead of Lightning Hex. Speed this up via *carefully* applied intelligence increasing gifts. If I can't directly raise someone's IQ, give them perfect memory and good health.

*** Magic player here. You cannot make planeswalkers. It is unknown how sparks are made/doled out, but the gods of Theros are certainly not powerful enough. It is also worth noting that planeswalkers used to be nigh - omnipotent gods before an event known as The Mending, which killed all of them except Nicol Bolas and (as of recently, time travel weeee) Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. Current planeswalkers are more like endgame MMO mages. There was a war between almost all of these godlike walkers and the Phyrexians. They failed to utterly destroy Phyrexia.

That is the magnitude of problem you have to deal with, all while not attracting attention to Theros as your base of operations. Fortunately, the Eldrazi are currently trapped on another plane and likely aren't going to be much of a threat for the next several centuries at least. Also fortunately, Nicol Bolas probably doesn't care about Theros at all right now. He would gain nothing from destroying Theros, and considering the threat level of the Eldrazi and Phyrexia, it may be possible to ally with him, for the same reason that one might be able to ally with Satan against an existential threat.

That's my take on the situation.

I'm not sure Nicol Bolas is even aware of Theros, but if he is, the whole "belief gives you free divine power" thing might well attract his interest, same way Alara did.

I haven't followed the stories closely enough to know if Bolas is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall][villain-ball]]-carrying or an actual mastermind. Would he think to replace / transform the population of Theros into barely-sentient homunculi who spend every spare neuron on worshipping him? Or would he go about it in much less efficient ways?

The end of the multiverse would end his power, and transforming everyone into praise - brains seems like a much more Phyrexian thing to do anyway. There's also the little wrinkle that becoming a Theran god would also remove his planeswalker spark, as you need to have a living, physical body to hold one.

#+end_quote

Works, but also slower than you expect. Kruphix doesn't have a lot of followers (he's not a "useful" deity). Once the other gods notice what you are doing (after the first few stop existing, probably) they start to oppose you. You stop them, but lose valuable assets depending on which gods you lose (getting people out of the underworld is going to be impossible if there's no god managing that, for example).

An industrial revolution makes it easier for the Phyrexians to corrupt your society, but if your spell arsenal and your early response is good enough, this works.

**** Speaking of the Eldrazi, note that, though they aren't at all impossible to defeat physically, they can't actually be permanently killed; anything that would do so only seems to banish them back to wherever they came from, for a time. This is apparently problematic enough that an entire plane was sacrificed merely to seal them away for a time, and so no merely physical response to their presence should be seen as a permanent solution.

Also, it's easy, but misleading, to think of the Eldrazi as merely powerful monsters. There's an alien intelligence there, with the power to not just unmake reality, but to resculpt it. In this sense, [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Kozilek][Kozilek]] is scarier than [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Emrakul][Emrakul]]. Sure, Emrakul is big and scary, and has the most destructive power, plus immunity to most magic and the ability to warp time. Kozilek isn't as personally threatening, but it has a fearsome intelligence, which has enabled it to create spawn like [[http://magiccards.info/query?q=%21It+That+Betrays][It That Betrays]], a threat on a whole other level. Instead of merely destroying, Kozilek spreads madness, slowly turning your world and your works to its own purpose. Any people, ideas, or capabilities you have can be turned to Kozilek's service.

**** I very much doubt that the bigger Eldrazi like Emrakul or Ulamog would care a lot about nukes. It just feels like it would be a far too mundane weapon when you're fighting against beings that have eaten probably more than just a few civilizations that fought back.

Also, Eldrazi don't specifically eat magic, they eat the actual plane. If they stay too long on your plane (and they will), your homeworld will eventually just cease to exist.

See [[http://cardboard-crack.com/post/82651057967/emrakul-color][here]] for one possible way of getting rid of Emrakul. Emrakul is certainly big and scary, but enough direct damage will put it down. As such, nukes probably work... if you're in a position to actually deploy them.

Bear in mind that Emrakul has no obligation to sit in a place where you can bomb it, and can wreak grievous destruction on your universe even while in unoccupied parts of it.

The rules of Magic are not the rules of the /settings/ of Magic. They're approximations of those. Bad approximations, in many cases.

A Theros goat can't literally wield swords, it's just that goat cards are Type:Creature and sword cards are Type:Equipment, and the equipment rules don't bother with details like "does this creature have hands?"

Stories set in Theros, like the discussion we're having in this thread, involve the rules of the setting, not the rules of the card game. At best, the card game can be a source of hints about how the setting works (like how Emrakul is immune to all magic except Ugin's weird colourless brand).

b) Are Eldrazi the sort to start sending a few of themselves deep underwater/underground/out of sight to eat the mana of the world without anyone realizing? It would really suck to think they're gone, only for the world to wink out after a few years of stealth-mana-drain.

It may be they just don't have a concept of victory or defeat, let alone 'too much trouble to handle right now'. As far as I get it, they follow a trail of magic, draining as they go.

This makes my understanding of them that the answer to both questions is 'no'. The plane they're currently infesting/trying to eat, Zendikar, was deliberately chosen as a trap for them though. The magic is particularly powerful, and it's a form of wild magic (literally even) as well. It may be that attempts to drain that kind of power covertly is impossible. If you offend Zendikar, the plane itself is liable to try and get up to hit you.

**** I can make new gods, right? If I have my prophet start talking about Scott, god of hedges and finance, he'll start coming online in a few years?

OK, figure out the tradeoff between consolidating belief and having more gods to believe in- If I can get more total godpower or what-have-you via more total gods, start expanding my pantheon with imaginary gods (Who are, of course, known in lore to be totally loyal to me- Or better yet, just family members who'll never betray me)

If there's no upper limit, institute personal gods for worshippers (Second to me, ala Catholic saints) to get every last marginal drop of god power.

If there's decreasing returns from more gods, have my prophet keep a tight eye on the folklore and apocrypha of my religion- If some minor backwoods cult starts up some evil twin of mine, I could lose power and make a new enemy. In fact, do that anyways- I have enough trouble with competing gods.

As for powers, be more selective but less quiet about them- None of this "One miracle a decade" mystery stuff the other gods like.

Figure out where the marginal value of the additional intelligence powers will be the most useful- Assumably people with bad memories and/or health but high creative skills and fast cognition.

Reveal myself to a few of the +trusted+ (Scratch that, only trusted people get uplifted) high level intellects and get their advice. Same with any new gods I can recruit or create.

God recruitment: Find the dying gods of old times. Recruit them for advice on expanding the old pantheon.

Find the big gods, plead with them about X-Risk, and agree to lower-status worship in exchange for help and control of pantheon.

  I can make new gods, right? If I have my prophet start talking about Scott, god of hedges and finance, he'll start coming online in a few years?
#+end_quote

You can, but doing so is imprecise. Trying to create Scott, god of hedges and finance might not cause the version of Scott that you'd actually want.

****** Well I don't really give a medamn whether he's a hedge god or a lawn god, so long as he's a)Loyal to me, b) Intelligent enough to help my cause, c) Providing my pantheon with more total divine power and d) Totally fine with me creating him purely for the above reasons. Later on, I might experiment with a few gods of knowledge/intelligence/cunning for a divine-side intelligence improvement, if all goes well.

  No worship exclusivity or discrimination.
#+end_quote

Most existing religions demand exclusivity. Presumably there is a strong reason for this. I think a non exclusive church would be weakened.

**** Because their gods are interested in worship maximization. I'm more interested in getting as many people as possible on my side, preferably under one umbrella pantheon in the long run. I don't really care if it's me or Kolkugneu who gets the prayer, as long as the resulting divine power is turned towards X-Risk management.

*** To kill everything, you will need some combination of

#+begin_example
  Voltaic Key
  Rings of Brighthearth
  Basalt Monolith
  Astral Conrucopia
  Everflowing Chalice
  Gemstone Array
  Power Conduit
  Riptide Replicator
  Serum Tank
  Dragon's Blood
  Magistrate's Scepter
  Voltaic Myr
  Myr Retriever
  Gilded Lotus
  Time Vault
  Grinding Station
  Kark-Clan Ironworks
#+end_example

This is not destructive in-and-of itself, but it gives infinite mana, turns, card draws, artifact ressurects, milling and counters of all kinds.

Essentially, the opponent happlessly looks on as you summon an army of giant monster tokens, and imprint Isochron Scepters with Counterspell, Lightning, Naturalize, Pay No Heed, and Terror. Mix in some Exile effects for the indestructible stuff.

The other option is to go Green and use Life and Limb (saprolings are forests, forests are saprolings) and then make approximately a quadrillion saprolings (not hard, there are exponential growth-rate saproling strategies) to serve as a Mana battery. Then summon some truly huge mobs, or buff your eternally growing army of saprolings.
