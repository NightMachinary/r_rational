** The book of all things nailed on to a plank, what was that in reference to? I vaguely remember the tyrant making them carry it around but can't for the life of me remember what for or when.

*** Kairos' idea of a joke.

  That left only one city without a seat at the table, though someone had nailed what looked like a tome of the Book of All Things to the back of a chair just to the left of the Delosi scribe. Interestingly, the Hierarch himself did not seem to be in attendance.

  “Lord Deadhand, it is most uncouth of you to be staring so at the honourable delegate from Atalante,” the Tyrant suddenly chided him.

  He was, Hakram realized with horrified fascination, talking about the book.

  “I apologize,” Adjutant said. “I have never seen anyone from Atalante before.”

  Kairos Theodosian grinned, like he was mischievous boy, and leaned forward before lowering his voice to a conspiratorial pitch.

  “It's actually the Book of All Things nailed to a chair,” the Tyrant of Helike confessed. “I just have a gargoyle read a verse once in a while, I don't think anyone's noticed the difference.”

*** It's the official representative for one of the league cities after the previous one was killed and they didn't send another - something like that anyway.

**** It's the Atalante delegate - Kairos said that all the Atalantians did anyway was quote the Book, so he had a gargoyle read from the Book at random (after killing the original rep) and claimed no one else had noticed Atalante had no representative.

** Barely does the whole show start, than the Tyrant immediately butts in. True to form indeed. Although Anarexes not being there to make a comment is both disappointing and concerning.
