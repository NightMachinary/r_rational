[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hnau9/weekly_challenge_science_is_bad/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Science Is Bad". [[/u/MugaSofer]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hnau9/weekly_challenge_science_is_bad/cu9ilab]["Fantastic, or, Reed Richards is Useless"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair.

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's challenge is "Dueling Time Travelers". Two people, with access to time travel, in some sort of conflict with one another. Your choice of [[http://qntm.org/models][time travel model]], though it's highly recommended that you keep it rational. Yes, you can include more than two people in conflict, or just have one person in conflict with their past/future self. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, September 2nd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

Next week's challenge is "Dinosaurs". Genetically engineered creatures pulled from blood trapped within a mosquito and mixed with frog DNA? Rich men hunting for a trophy in the distant past? Throwback creatures on an island lost to time? We all know [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs][everything is better with dinosaurs.]]

*Next week's thread will go up on 9/2.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]]. If you want to discuss the week's theme, feel free to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/submit?selftext=true][make a post about it]].

**** It's more coherent than you might expect because it's not ASCII. It's encoded in a way that is designed specifically to preserve human speech at a high level through low-bandwidth, high-latency, high-noise ship-to-ship communications. It would actually be harder to send something that is just /slightly/ wrong.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

*** Pretty interesting. Really curious as to how these cycles get resolved if you have two opposing factions who both have access to time travel. Is it a question of who runs out of resources first? Keeping in mind that these resources would need to transcend time somehow.

**** Thats disappointing, I guess I wrote it too much like a fan fiction instead of a standalone. I prob should've had a paragraph at the beginning that made the implication that he's trapped in a loop clearer.

Question. Was it at least clear that he was being controlled by fate to act out the role of the enemy he briefly spoke about in the beginning?

***** No. Heh. Because of the prompt, I was trying to interpret it through the lens of the vizier somehow doing this. I reread parts of it trying to find a hint that this was a new timeline being created, or something like that.

****** Well. My response is super late. But the implication is that he is, ironically, fighting himself in the loop, albeit a self being puppeteered.

Edit: so it can be seen as a Prince vs Prince duel set up. Although it wouldn't be wrong to say it's Fate vs Prince either.

*** Speaking as a die-hard Sands of Time fan.. fantastic. Loved the loop twist and the perspective of the vizier. It feels more appropriate for fate to manifest like this instead of Dahaka. Insidious.

And using those lines to end it like that - it was perfect for the story.
