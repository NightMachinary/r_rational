Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have a story that's mostly written, but when I wrote it, I wanted to accompany it with illustrations. Now I'm at the point where I have maybe one illustration (out of ~50) and would really like to publish the story, but am not sure if the story would hold up without the illustrations. And I know that the illustrations I'd want for the story are beyond my current illustrative skill, whether that be in pencil-on-paper or in The Gimp.

So I have a bunch of questions: - what software do you use for illustration? - is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story - are pixel-perfect mockups necessary for phone UI, or can the interface details be gestured at and readers be reasonably expected to interpret them as necessary? - what can be done to make sure a story written for illustration works well without illustration?

  what software do you use for illustration?
#+end_quote

I use Inkscape for vector art, Gimp for photo manipulation, Gimp for pixel art (though I'd like a better tool there), and Paint Tool Sai for painting. Vector art, photo manipulation, and pixel art can be done with a mouse (hell, I use a trackpad), but I'd never do free hand illustration/painting without a pen. I use a Wacom Intuos 4 for that. If you don't have/want a graphics tablet, another option is pencil and paper and a scanner. The process there is sketch, scan, ink, color, and I can go over some of the details if you like.

You need at least one complete page. You can fill in with (full-sized) sketches for the rest; sometimes even Placekitten.com is an adequate substitute.

Is this part of your story? Is the thing you're illustrating a phone UI? If so you use Inkscape. I doubt being pixel-perfect matters. Being complete would help a lot, but you only need to be complete in the foreground.

The format is text interspersed with occasional illustrations, similar to the illustrated-abridged classic novels that came in little 4" square paperbacks. It's a web-first story, which means that there aren't really /pages/ as a logical separation of content. It's just hypertext.

#+end_quote

I'm illustrating a phone UI at one point, but like how Wile E. Coyote's TNT-detonation box in the Roadrunner cartoons is sketched as a box with a handle and wires, the various views on UI in the story only need to show specific actions, rather than being a workable UI.

And honestly, if I needed pixel-perfect UI I'd make it in HTML+CSS and screenshot it.

By "page" I mean the complete set of stuff that you can see at one time. I actually should've said "page spread" when I was assuming it's a book.

** I'm planning on writing a rational JoJo fanfic. I've got more than +14+ 19 pages of ideas I want to explore, but I could always use more.

What do you want to see in a more rational JoJo?

*** More consistency and less randomness.

BTW the power system could be more complex and indepth than the bare bones punchghosts in the original story. Maybe you could also tie it a bit more to the Hamon, Spin or whatever takes their place in your setting.

** I've been pondering a possible story background, with one essential question.

What tasks cannot be accomplished without a theory of computation? And which ones are possible, but far too impractical?

The obvious one is no emulation. Any "code" would be converted directly into physical circuits, with no room for arbitrary execution.

Every other example of a thing I might want a single - task machine to do seems possible though. Routing in a network is possible but clunky, math of all sorts is easy, Terminal style displays are doable, with a limited symbol set and fixed commands.

*** look at what people do with dwarf fortress. can your gears align into a system for the defense of the mountainhome, possibly with lava for the outside world? pressure plates, doors and bridges and floodgates. and levers.

or look at minecraft. what can redstone really do?

there will be enough builds you can google, to get a start on crazy ideas.
