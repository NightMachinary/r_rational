** Do you mind posting why you think this is a good fit for this subreddit? Because at first glance it just looks like a romance story which is rare for this community.

*** The two involved are talented criminal investigayors, which make rational deductions based on given data to solve crime.

In addition, they behave like reasonable adults and begin their relationship in a way that put me off guard, since I'm used to the instant teenage crush and drama.

Situations and psychological afflictions make sense.

Basically, it's like a more down to earth Sherlock Holmes, while instead of constant pressure and tension, we have romance.

Not that action and tension do not exist, but romance is the focus.

Is that sufficient reason to include this in the sub?

**** But, do they apply that ability to make rational deductions, to problems that crop up in their relationship?

***** Yes. The way they pursue each other is quite funny, actually. He is using conditioning and subtle attacks, while she is spying on him and creating a profile.

It's a slow paced romance, over the course of a number of cases.
