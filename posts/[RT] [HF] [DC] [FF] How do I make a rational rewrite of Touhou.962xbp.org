For those new to the series, the short summary is that Touhou is a series of shooters, but with girls & fairies instead of ships & aliens. It takes place in a sanctuary for magical creatures (called "youkai" in-setting) known as Gensokyo. They resolve serious disputes with magic laser paintball, except when they don't. There's a loose metaplot, and hints of something serious, but everything tends to end in a lighthearted non-event.

The [[https://rabbiteclair.tumblr.com/post/173504016367/i-know-nothing-about-touhou-but-i-think-its][long summary]] has been told better by RabbitClair, but these excerpts should get the crux of my issue across:

#+begin_quote
  Almost as importantly, pretty much /every single character/ is some form of petty, irresponsible doofus.

  There are about a hundred characters with superhuman abilities, and 90% of them are far more interested in enjoying themselves than having a serious throwdown.

  There are hints at a darker side, but you have to look for it.

  The series gets to drop the occasional hint that some dark stuff is going on, but it's mostly up to the fans to piece that together and decide what it looks like, or if they care to engage with it at all.
#+end_quote

It's been my observation that the fans /don't./ Put glibly, at the risk of being offensive, I'm into dark, depths, and drama, while the fandom's generally into memes, moe, and merch. However, I've been assured there are others who are at least appreciative of my preferences, and I may be inaccurate with my generalization, so I figure this idea is worth a try.

I already have some ideas to start with, but I want to know your thoughts on the feasibility of the premise, in addition to suggestions I can add to my own ideas. I also want to know what questions you have that aren't answered by the [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki][comprehensive wiki]].


** Given that the Touhou universe is full of inhuman beings, it's not necessarily surprising that those beings tend to behave in ways that don't match human rationality. If I wanted to write in the Touhou universe, I'd start with that premise. Touhou isn't a setting full of magical humans making bad decisions (there are only a few of those); it's mostly a setting full of immortal alien hedonists who don't often experience much in the way of consequences for their actions.

For a rational take on the setting, you probably want an outsider's perspective; a protagonist who lacks many of the advantages and protections the natives take for granted, and doesn't have enough ties to the locals to be willing to graciously overlook all the destruction caused by the latest cataclysmic temper tantrum some centuries-old brat just threw. As a rational work, you're mostly looking at the thorny game-theoretic problem of attempting to negotiate with aliens who have a different value system.

*** Good point about about immortal alien hedonists, which bears keeping in mind regarding youkai psychology. Especially since how youkai treat humans is a big part of the political metaplot that could do with some development.

As for an outsider's perspective, I'd have a lot to choose from since a significant number of the named characters have only arrived within the last decade or two. Thankfully, two particular recent arrivals have significant ambitions for the realm.

One thing you can do: bear down on this idea. That is, look at how youkai think in shinto mythology, and in other fictional settings that treat them more seriously (e.g. Mushi-Shi, Natsume Yuujinchou.) Then use that to inform how /these/ youkai "must be" thinking, treating whatever surface-level actions they're performing as a pretence.

Mind you, youkai acting under pretences isn't really "a thing" in Shinto mythology; but it would still play well with a Western readership, because "keeping up a pretence while playing the long game" is 100% how the equivalent creatures act in western Fairy tales.

***** I took the liberty of asking the Touhou channel in a Shinto Discord server and...there was a heated (though relatively civil) argument as to whether youkai are monsters or people. If nothing else that's already a canon plot point I feel is in need of development.

Also, one of them wanted clarification as to what you meant by "acting under pretense."

** Yukari and the other sages of Gensokyo are actually fairly rational given their goals and the rules of the universe they operate under. Yukari and the other sages predicted that the advance of science would metaphysically threaten their existence. They can't destroy humanity because the need human belief/faith/fear. So they engineered a pocket reality where the human population can be carefully controlled and regulated. They and other youkai have extremely destructive reality warping powers, so they work out a system of formalized system of duels that let battle in a controlled but enjoyable fashion. Feral youkaj and youkai that refuse the system get eliminated by Reimu. Reimu also eliminates human villagers that become Youkai (ie Forbidden Scrollery), thus keeping the supply of fear/faith/belief from becoming unusable.

In Silent Sinner In Blue and it related stories, Yukari perfectly demonstrates Quirrelmort's idea of losing to achieves a broader goal in her interactions with the Lunarians. Likewise in Wild and Horned Hermit, Yukari lets Reimu beat her and takes the blame for an incident caused by Sumireko while secretly fixing the problem.

If you want rationalist Touhou, just retell it from Yukari's perspective as she plots and schemes continuously to keep Gensokyo running smoothly.

If you want a darker story, maybe Kosuzu discovering the truth of Gensokyo (ie the villagers are a carefully controlled resource that live in fear, outsiders are drawn in for Youkai that need meat, etc.)? Yukari already works as a rationalist antagonist given that she has the logical goal of sustaining herself and other Youkai at the expense of a villages fear and the occasionally eaten outsider.

*** A lot of good points regarding Yukari, and good on you to note those. And yes, I certainly agree that Yukari's definitely a rationalist in the context of her goals. I see you as an invaluable resource in the near future.

I /do/ plan on telling the story through her perspective, just...not /entirely/ through her perspective. There are other women with other agendas, notably Kanako and Byakuren, who have their own differing progressive designs for Gensokyo. And then there're the Lunarians, who I'd also like to have proactive. And things get even more complicated when bringing Makai into the mix...

** You may be interested in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5829008/1/Imperfect-Metamorphosis][/Imperfect Metamorphosis/]], a /Touhou/ fanfiction to end all /Touhou/ fanfiction^{1}. I've read about 16/70 of it, likely based on Yudkowsky's recommendation, and if I recall correctly, it was reasonably rational and appropriately dark.

--------------

But to answer your question, here's my own idea:

There is some kind of supremely powerful overseer-entity, which ensures that Gensokyo is peaceful. If it discovers that someone isn't being peaceful, it retaliates with overwhelming force: either just terminates the offender, or brainwashes them, or throws them Outside to be comprehended by crazy human scientists/philosophers until they're reduced to basic concepts (whichever you prefer). I think there's an obvious character to fit this role, namely the border-controller.^{2}

Consequently, everyone has to pretend that all their disputes and conflicts are silly squabbles.

Problem is, they're /not/. Many of these non-human entities are unrepentant murderers and monsters, fundamentally evil or amoral creatures who enjoy carnage. Others are, oppositely, good and nice. Still others don't care about good/evil at all, or have blue & orange morality. The sanctuary houses numerous entities of different ideologies, and some of them grew rather used over centuries to impose their values upon the world by force.

But if they try that now, the overseer-entity would notice, and would promptly curb-stomp them.

As such, they're forced to keep up the facade of outwards niceness, while covertly weaving sinister plots, scheming and manipulating. Every once in a while it gets a bit too intense, weapons get put to use, but naturally everyone involved abruptly de-escalates right near the end and plays it off as a joke.

Since many of these entities are supremely powerful (but not /quite/ on the overseer's level), that equilibrium is unstable. Enter the protagonist:

- An enforcer of the overseer-entity (drama).

- A megalomaniacal brilliant manipulator who starts off as a minor fairy (political thriller).

- A bloodthirty vampire who is now forced to play politics during adorable tea parties (dark comedy).

- Someone else, I dunno.

Clarify if you want ideas about something more particular.

^{1. Or not. I mean, that's basically the only thing I consumed of /Touhou/ aside from some brief skimming of its TV Tropes page, but it's a million words long and apparently employs *all the characters*, so that seems like a reasonable guess.}

^{2. Which is OP as hell, by the way; I'm suggesting to make her basically God of the setting and you would /still/ need to nerf her for there to be a story. Seriously, what stops her from blurring the border between "potential world I wish to occupy" and "actual world" for instant global victory? Non-munchkins...}

*** Oh yeah, I read a bit of it. I don't plan on my fic being /that/ dark or violent, but it's a good read just the same. Not enough Byakuren or Kanako parts, though. Their interaction with each other was certainly one of my favorite parts, though.

As for your idea, it certainly looks like one I can work with. I certainly agree that the prohibition on violence doesn't make clashing ideals any less acrimonious. I also agree that Yukari most definitely works as a subtle overseer of Gensokyo's ordered chaos. I don't think there'd be any /one/ protagonist, so much as powerful viewpoint characters working with and against each other.

As for clarifying if I want any ideas, what specifically /do/ you know about Touhou?

** Anyways, I care approximately 0% about touhou, for various reasons, but I'm interested in helping you with your quest. So first of all, you've gotta figure out what you want to /do./ This isn't what draws you to touhou, but rather what is drawing you to make a specifically rational work within the setting. You seem to be aware of it, but seem confused by all the other stuff tohou has going on.

Second of all, you need to start dissecting the setting. For example, the people the series focuses on are big names insulated from the consequences of their actions, which is a story as old as time. Focusing on a little person or someone who doesn't have as big a name and is forced to pick up the pieces after the big names roll through is one way to up the dark level. Not everyone in the setting is an immortal prepubescent girl.

Put another way, the one's capable of having a serious throw down aren't interested in doing so because they're going to be nice and comfortable anyways, while the ones that actually have a bone to pick and stakes are cannon fodder. Mayhaps a time for revolution?

*** Thank you for your suggestions, I'll answer them in order. I mostly have what I want to do figured out: refocus the story around the ambitious faction leaders and have them actually /get/ somewhere with their plots. Though I don't know what I don't know, so what do I seem confused about, if I may ask?

While it's the opposite of your second suggestion, there really aren't any pieces to pick up (lately), and the canon works generally focus on the most inconsequential denizens anyway. That said, putting more focus on the local humans and their economy is something I'd like to see (and therefore write) more of, especially regarding the earlier incidents that afftemed the weather (and thus the crop yields!).

As for a revolution of the weak vs. the strong, that actually /was/ a plot point in one of the games...that didn't really get developed. Social change is most certainly something a big element I want in this rewrite, however!

My main goal was trying to explain Gensokyo without changing it very much (and answer a plot hole of statistical significance). It sounds like you'd be changing the crazy, instead of justifying it. What are you thinking of changing?

Will you keep the magical laser paintball?

Will characters kill each other often?

One problem is the matter of food. So, so many youkai feed on humans. One resolution is to make human eating possible but optional for the youkai, and rare. Other resolutions might be farming humans, or having very many humans, or having humans respawn or regenerate. How would you resolve that?

Whatever you write, I'd be very interested.

I don't plan on having a lot of killing, though I'm undecided on the danmaku battles. It's likely I'll include it since it's an important social element, but I'm not likely to write out a lot of spell card battles.

As for food, I believe that youkai technically only need to feed on belief; it's just that fear is their preferred flavor. Same with anthropophagy: they /like/ the taste of humans, but don't necessarily /have/ to eat them. Thing is, since youkai are beings of belief, and humans /believe/ youkai eat humans, a fear that's fostered by the youkai themselves... Yeah, we have a self-perpetuating social problem, and a serious challenge for would-be reformers like Byakuren.

**** The feeding on belief makes sense. That makes anyone who compiles statistics about youkai behavior a dangerous nuisance, though--don't you dare tell the other human villagers that their chances of being eaten are actually tiny! Such stats might kill a youkai, or drive a youkai to reinforce belief in them.

The belief thing isn't free of problems, though. Secretive youkai should disappear, flashy youkai should become the most powerful. (Koishi wouldn't persist in that world for long, for example). There should be a mechanism for youkai to ensure their continued existence without belief, that is, a part of their diet that isn't humans or human beliefs. Maybe belief recharges them, but they can subsist on other things if needed.

'Not a lot of killing' will need some explanation, but many good possibilities have been put forth already.

***** My explanation for the gender imbalance is that Gensokyo became a matriarchal society as a result of all the men being so busy fighting that the women ended up running everything, similar to Sparta and the Mongols. It's more evened out nowadays, but male youkai kinda want to stay out of trouble.

Personally, I like the concept of an all-female cast as it forces readers (and writers) to think of women as variable people rather than force this gender or that into specific roles. Apart from social justice sorts like myself, people tend to not even bat an eye at an all-male cast. Plus, I turn the Touhou cast into bishies and I'm likely to get...distracted...

As for Flandre, the only way I can see her backstory making sense is that at least one of her replicants wasn't locked up...which kinda defeats the whole point. And how'd she get her weapon?

** "You can't allow yourself to be held back by common sense in Gensokyo."

In other words, any attempt at exploiting the systems is going to run into the issue that there is very little systematizing and a whole lot of weird conceptual bullshit going on. Around 50% of the cast has an ability that would be somewhere between horrifying and unstoppable if they weren't constrained to settle their differences via magical laser paintball.

If you just want to make a story that's /darker/ than the original, there's plenty of space to work with. Start with the fact that Youkai eat people and go nuts. What sort of precautions does a villager take to avoid getting eaten? It's a setting where every old-timey superstition about ghosts and monsters is /actually true/ and breaking the rules could get you eaten - I imagine this would lead to some pretty serious paranoia. That, or a lot of people pursuing magical powers in self-defense, and perhaps becoming youkai themselves.

But the danmaku rules you're just going to have to accept as given or the whole thing pretty much falls apart. Just accept that the only acceptable way to use your superpowers offensively is by expressing them as artful bullet patterns and see how that shapes peoples' actions. Would society be more violent, since magical violence is mostly harmless and easy to fix? Or does it lead people to be more polite, since you can get challenged to a duel for any old thing?

As for youkai eating people.../everyone/ keeps telling me that, but the narrative shows me otherwise. "Speaking of WaHH, what about that one comment from Yukari to Kasen?" She's talking about importing suicidal drifters; locals are protected by the very danmaku rules you yourself mention. Perhaps I shouldn't say "dark" in the future, because people immediately jump to grimdark.

Perhaps youkai /enjoy/ the taste of humans but don't /have/ to eat them, doing so only because they've been socialized to. And what of the youkai we /do/ see, who only seem interested in pranking, peddling, and partying? A dark story can easily focus on the subplot of one group of youkai wanting to more fully integrate with society, and be open about being youkai, conflicting with another who're quite comfortable with the status quo of general delinquent behavior. Such is the dilemma Byakuren's faced with.

Dark can also come from an upstart goddess introducing technology and displacing workers. What are all the now-unemployed extractive workers going to do? Perhaps work at (and have to train for) the conceptually new jobs offered, but how will that radically change society? And how will people react someone like Kanako sending society reeling only to take control of it?

Even if I already decided on the answers, those were good questions and points you brought up; they brought out my ideas in the first place, and provided a bit more information about the audience.

You need to have some kind of goal in a touhou fic. If you want to focus on the dark side, a good one would be trying to end Gensokyo, preferably with a minimal loss of human life until the youkai fade away. Also, you could make one that takes place centuries ago where they're trying to make Gensokyo.

I have heard a theory that Remilia's fate manipulation is basically just rationality. If anyone has any idea how a vampire could convince a vampire hunter that can manipulate space and time to stop trying to kill her and become her maid, that would be an interesting story.

One thing I /don't/ want is a story about irredeemable youkai. From what I've read youkai subsist on belief more than anything, but are not only held back by belief in them being man-eaters they actually /encourage/ it. Not unlike minorities who feel empowered by frightening depictions of them. One idea I have is how the youkai are in disagreement regarding how they should interact with humanity, whether to integrate or remain as essentially minstrels and shylocks.

As far as dark goes, it'll be about the level of Teeth and Claws (which you should totally finish as it's a good fic). Glad you mentioned My Little Pony, as I look at what /that/ fandom's accomplished and lament that Touhou hasn't done so. Let me assure you that I'm /not/ going for Fallout: Equestria levels of dark here (good fic, but there's a reason I haven't looked at the spin-offs). No, the too-many-to-list thoughtful, extrapolative, world-building examples I /really/ wish Touhou had more of are what I'm going for. The ones that asked "what if we too this 22-minute kiddie toy commercial...*seriously?*" and made it /work./ [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights][Under the Northern Lights]] is at the lighter end of the tone I'm going for. (And if you can tell me why Touhou didn't end up as popular as MLP in spite of having so many similar traits I'd be /very/ grateful!)

As for having a goal I so far have "have the more proactive faction leaders /get somewhere/, have others react to them, and see where that leads." I still haven't figured out how to /end/ the fic, though, so I'm scared of writing myself into a corner and ending up with a dead fic.

This reminds me of a theory I have about Akyuu lying about the dangers of youkai. Her job isn't to spread accurate information. It's to protect from youkai. Youkai must be feared, whether the fears are founded or not. As long as people fear youkai, youkai can be harmless. But once people believe youkai to be their allies, the youkai will be forced to kill for the fear they need to live. She can likely do more to help humanity by lying to them than by actually recording the weaknesses of youkai.

Also, eating people is somewhat less dark when you consider that reincarnation is something well established.

Some theories:

- In My Little Pony you get into it by watching the shows. You will have to ask around for good fanfiction, but at least the beginning is clear. In Touhou, you can pirate games with patches to translate them into English, buy some of them if you're not cheap, and have to work for nuggets of story. You can learn everything you need from the fandom, but it's not at all clear how to do it. Though it's probably easier than actually beating those games. Especially if you want to find out about all those characters from the extra stages.

- My Little Pony was made in the US. Touhou was made in Japan. Most people don't consume media from other countries that hasn't been properly localized. Granted, most people don't watch children's TV shows either, but I suspect the fist one might be worse.

- My Little Pony is based on Western culture. Everyone knows what a unicorn and a pegasus and a dragon is. In Touhou, the majority of characters are from purely Eastern mythology, and those that are not are highly inaccurate. For example, portraying vampires as being a kind of devil, and a witch using some kind of Chinese magical reactor instead of a wand.

- My Little Pony isn't too hard to take seriously hand have rational stories and make it exactly has dark as you want. In Touhou, you basically either have to have very light stories where you ignore the diets of the majority of the characters, break canon and take everything else seriously but ignore their diets or work on crazy justifications, or have a very grimdark story. The fact that hell actually exists doesn't help, though you don't stay there forever and it seems to exist to help people become better rather than just torture them like in UNSONG. Also, some people consider eating people to be wrong even if you're not the one killing them. I don't know how big a problem that is because the idea seems utterly alien to me, but there's probably people out there who consider Orin stealing and eating corpses to plant it firmly in grimdark territory.

I think no matter what happens it's already too dark for me. Maybe not too dark for past me who read Fallout Equestria, but I feel like I can't handle darkness like I used to. It might be a good fic, but I don't think it's one I can handle.
