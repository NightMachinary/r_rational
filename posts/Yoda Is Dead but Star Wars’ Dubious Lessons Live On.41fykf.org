** While some parts of this article are political and spiders (particularly concerning the merits / lack thereof of George Lucas' views on democracy), I thought there were some interesting offhand points about how "wise" characters are written and how ineffectual forces of civilization have become an overused trope in scifi and fiction in general.

*** He does have some good points. But his main criticism goes like this:

1. Democracy is good.
2. The movies are skeptical about democracy [I would say they are skeptical about the ability of large democracies to scale up as well as confront unexpected challenges.]
3. Therefore George Lucas is evil.

The same sort of argument leads him to blast someone in the comment section for citing Plato, which is apparently a no-no since Plato is "...the most malignant and relentlessly wrongheaded philosopher, ever, who despised democracy and provided intellectual ammo to be used against it for 2500 years."

Geeeeeez. I think the opposite is true: frank discussion of the strengths and weakness of democracies (and how these may be ameliorated or worsened by various constitutional systems) is a good thing -- as well as a necessary condition of democracies continuing to evolve and thrive in the future.

The quality of the work of SF authors in particular declines with age; they struggle to remain relevant and adapt to new trends. I give Brin big props for what he did in Existence; it's on a whole new level compared to the Uplift novels.

(Go, re-watch the old VHS, or pirated laserdisc rips/the Laserdic rip to DVD that was in the Ultimate Collection . . . even, if you like, check against the Special Edition New Hope DVD, the published "script", and the novelization. *None of them* have this supposed offer to teach Han. As I learned when I was younger and more impressed with Dr. Brin, and repeated his claim, and was challenged, and actually went to check for myself.)

Occasionally I hope the various bits of nonsense I catch Brin saying (like when he claimed the solution in HPMOR was un-foreshadowed, and never mind the very first lines of the story) are deliberately there to encourage people to distrust claims of authority. But whatever his private intent, his public claims are regularly /full of shit/.

The issue is that the movies seem to say that Vader's moral balance sheet, so to speak, has now been balanced. This is similar to how Luke is responsible for the deaths of a third of a billion people (the first Death Star had a /lot/ of folks on board) and we have to get to the Expanded Universe before he has any angst over this. Because anyone who was on the Death Star is automatically a bad guy and deserved to die, and no tears should be shed for them or the loved ones who survived them.

I might be reading a little too much into things in this particular story, but across the board stories with this kind of conflict mirror, too closely for my comfort, our tendency toward tribalism, and I worry that as a cultural phenomenon they reinforce rather than fight against attitudes and biases that we need to be rid of.

Is he, though? His "moral" wisdom is all of the form "don't give in to the Dark Side because it'll turn you evil. The Dark side looks like X, Y and Z; here are some Jedi techniques for avoiding it."

It /involves/ morals, yes, but it's still firmly in his domain of expertise.

(Except possibly for "do or do not; there is no try". In this case, though, Luke was pretty clearly not putting in enough effort, so I think his advice was pretty good.)

I think the movie fairly clearly doesn't treat "moral balance sheets" as real.

Brin disapproves of this. I, however, approve wholeheartedly, and furthermore feel a strong urge to start calling Brin names.

(Incidentally, I don't think it's a tribal thing - lesser mortals are also allowed to change, like Han Solo, Lando, and Finn from the new film. It's impractical to try and exchange an olive branch to people who are actively shooting at you.)

Finn's a weird case that was even more blatant than the others, which actually helped to kill his character for me. He can't kill the villagers, okay, fine, I get that, although it does raise some side questions for me. But then he's apparently totally fine with shooting the people that he'd been serving alongside for years and (if I'm understanding correctly) grew up with? He's even laughing as he does so.

The Finn who couldn't shoot the villagers seems like somebody getting an attack of the moral feels. The Finn who was shooting his fellow stormtroopers seems like a sociopath. Obviously, it's kind of weird when both those Finns are supposed to be the same Finn.

I hope that what we're going to find out is that Finn had been a sleeper agent this whole time and that the destruction of Starkiller Base was intentional as part of some greater scheme (which would also explain why Phasma was so quick to give up the codes and Starkiller Base had the same sort of flaw that the first Death Star had).

But, barring something like that, it instead feels more like "Finn is an inherently good person who somehow has the moral sixth sense to divide the world into good people who you shouldn't kill, and bad people who you shouldn't care about killing."

Sometimes, the inconsistency is justified (For example, Ron's various lapses in friendship, which seem like an inconsistency on the surface, with Harry are explainable due to his overly emotional state of being, combined with an inferiority complex derived from being the youngest of a poor family, along with a few dashes of jealousy) Othertimes, it just makes you roll your eyes and scoff at the writer/director/plot.

Optimistically, I could probably make an argument that stormtrooper training is just /that bad/ at producing a sense of shared identity and camaraderie - there are a few episodes of /Rebels/ showing it, and it's just awful. He probably hated all of those people.

Buuut, now that I think about it, he's also pretty explicit that he's only rescuing +Princess Leia+ Po Dameron because he needs a pilot, right? And he also repeatedly makes it clear that he only stays with the Resistance because he wants to get in Rey's pants. Maybe he's just too lazy to shoot people.

No, more like "anyone on the Death Star is currently part of a machine looking to crush the only viable resistance to Sith despotism and mass-murder. we cannot allow it to continue to exist. The deaths of these people isn't enough to weigh against that. Agree? Disagree? You know the point either way.

This always struck me as a complaint made more for the joy of analyzing than anything. The reasoning is clear; the arguments for collateral damage are clear; you know them. But it's cool to pull a Kevin Smith and bring up the argument and sort of poke at Star Wars' simplicity and earnestness.

As for Vader; you could put it down to some sort of personal redemption. After all, this is a universe with an actual metaphysical spirit. He has basically lived a hobbled existence denying himself that light, now he has it back. It's about as odious as the Christian and Muslim conceptions of redemption. Except the Force need not choose; at the time of his death Anakin simply had the right metaphysical make-up, so he was saved.

The real problem is Luke; whose behavior is totally parochial and irresponsible. The Emperor was right; he seemingly had no idea what he was walking into yet did it anyway, putting people at risk for his shitty dad.

I otherwise don't agree with W. D. Ross, but one thing that I do appreciate is his stance that, even if something is the right thing to do, that doesn't excuse you from feeling bad about it in some way.

If going to war is the right thing to do, then by all means, we have to do it. I don't think we'd disagree that you have to do whatever is the right thing to do. But "feeling bad about having killed people, even if it was necessary--indeed, feeling bad that it was necessary in the first place" seems to me to be something that is important to endorse, if for no other reason than doing so will reduce the likelihood that you'll end up killing people because it's the /easier/ path rather than the necessary one.

#+begin_quote

This is true. I am totally fine with the Force being cool with him, since the Force is (IMO) better having a blue-and-orange morality anyway.
