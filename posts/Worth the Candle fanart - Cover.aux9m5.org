** Well, it's not terrible, but it definitely doesn't really capture anything close to an accurate mood for the story.

Also, WtC is a multiple book work, one cover wouldn't cut it.

Personally, I would expand on your idea, and make each cover a shot of a table with a game laid out on it, with a small but supernaturally bright candle illuminating the scene into sharp focus.

Each table would be set in a place from that book, like the first could show the abandoned gas station in the background.

One of the covers could totally be a table with a game of arches in progress.

** Too much space above and below the text, not enough to the sides. I like how the candle is balanced against the smoke on the page, but I think it would be more striking if the candle were colored. [[https://i.imgur.com/kUiqOeO.jpg][Like this.]]

** It looks very neat, but I don't think I would be enticed to read based on this cover.

What would make me more likely to read would be something like a picture of Amaryllis in the big battle against her family*.

*** "Worth the candle" is an expression that means something (especially a game) is worth the time/effort/trouble. It comes from the old days when you needed to burn a candle to do anything at night, which was much more expensive than turning on a light is nowadays, so an activity had be worthwhile in order for it to be worth the candle.

In the context of the webnovel, the phrase gets a pretty significant title drop in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27497037][chapter 36]], during Juniper's prayer.
