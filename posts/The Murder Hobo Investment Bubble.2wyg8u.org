** Heh. If you're interested in fictional investment opportunities, I recommend Julian Gough's [[http://www.juliangough.com/the-great-hargeisa-goat-bubble/][The Great Hargeisa Goat Bubble]], which is even more hilarious.

** I'd really like to play a tycoon game based on this. Investing in land you don't own, creating contracts for murder hobo squads, and investing in the talents of up and coming murder hobos.

*** Have you ever heard of Lords of Waterdeep? It's not a tycoon game, but rather a worker-placement board game where you recruit adventurers to go on quests for you in order to increase your own influence and wealth.

**** Yeah, I have. It's a good worker placement game, but the theme is really only delivered as flavor text on quest cards. (A common weakness of American board games I guess.)

** Suddenly, I /really/ want to get a D&D game together. If only I weren't on a separate continent from every gamer I know. :/

*** My main game group consists of three canadians, two people from Florida, one from California, and one from Sweden.

Roll20 is actually a really good system, though we all think that the rolls have a Pro-GM bias.

I actually subscribe to them, primarily to give them money to expand the service.

** A game called Darkest Dungeon is vaguely like this. You use expendable adventurers to rebuild your town and manor, and only pay out for their entertainment and refreshment costs. There's not even death insurance or worker's compensation!

*** It doesn't quite have the angle of claiming the dungeon territories for assets though.

I actually think these murder hobo futures market system might be a great infrastructure to base an MMO persistent world around.

It even has built in methods for literally crashing the 'adventure' side of the game to let it dissolve into sudden banditry/warfare periodically.
