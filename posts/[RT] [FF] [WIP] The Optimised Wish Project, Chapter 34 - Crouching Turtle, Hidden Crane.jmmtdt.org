** New chapter is up, after a long, long time in the works. There seems to be some problem with FF.net putting the chapter up, so if the link doesn't work for you please refer to the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14091411/chapters/66821785][AO3 mirror]].

*** Thank you for posting the mirror, I was having trouble with the Fanfiction link.

Also, this chapter made me really want to see the next chapter, and as always, thank you for writing this!

**** You're welcome! Yeah, FF.net just seems to be derping out, I tweeted Fictionpress asking about it but no answer for now. At worst I'll just try deleting and reposting the chapter.

** I don't get what Shen's plan is here, is he trying to get into a position to undermine his brother in ways that don't involve a direct confrontation or is he trying to get into a good position with the instruments under the assumption that Piccolo is going to come back regardless of what happens? That doesn't seem like it's going to work out for him.

From a meta perspective I'm glad we're bringing together at least some of the main characters again. All the hopping around makes it hard to remember what was going on where without having to click back to the previous few chapters (though the delay between chapters also kind of isn't helping here, it'll probably be a lot easier to follow on a reread).

Awesome chapter as always! Really looking forward to seeing how the fight between Goku and Tao Pai Pai ends up going.

*** Hes maneuvering for influence in a completely self interested way without a fixed plan. Its selfish but kinda rational.

**** Yeah, remember that first time around he was the "please spare me master Piccolo, I'll help you" guy. He's just trying to assess the situation and weasel his way into a position where he saves his own skin.

** Great chapter, as always!

Biting my nails waiting to know about the fight between Goku and Tao Pai Pai. It's great how this chapter made me lose hope about it little by little then gave some of it back at the end. Good job :)

** Great chapter!

What is the relation between Shen and Muten in this universe? Are they just into friendly rivarly or are they straight up enemies?

*** Former pupils of Mutaito. It's been explained quite a few chapters ago that Shen tried to swear loyalty to Piccolo back in the day, when he saw there was no escape. So his cowardice caused Muten to despise him, and they've been on bad terms ever since.

**** I am also very happy what is going on with Gero and Bulma.

If I understood correctly, she is taking him with her back to Capsule Corp. This is a great idea both in-universe and storywise. So there will be much more of their interactions, and maybe also interactions with Bulma family.

I just had one idea, which would be great if it happened, but I'm not sure if it's going that way. You have already prepared a good science background for our protagonist, maybe they should use it somehow in more important way for the story? Maybe... maybe Goku could take Frieza fate from canon, get slain and come back as "Mecha frieza" but Goku version, revived by Bulma and Gero?
