** Even as Fanfiction.net went back online, the link still does not seem to work for me. It just keeps loading and never goes anywhere.

**** Thanks! I read only chapter 1 yet, but I dig it. Perhaps Hermione sounds a bit more /adult/ than I'd imagine her to be. Especially emotionally, even as a smart kid some things just come with experience, and she shouldn't have too much of that. I'm also not sure about her calling Voldemort "mentally handicapped" - stupid, perhaps, but handicapped? May be a bit too much, comes off like she's really being arrogant and underestimating him a bit. He may not have killed Harry for any number of reasons that aren't simply that he did not think of it, and she should obviously realise that.

But her main point, that Harry was crazy to just slack off at a school where classes aren't just about learning dusty notions, but basically actual superpowers, especially considering he's got a dark wizard coming after him for his life, is spot on. I'm curious to see where the "digital revolution" fits in all of this too :D.

** I like this take on the Potter's Fidelius Gambit. It makes a lot of sense in this scenario to make someone besides Black the real secret keeper.

** I'm glad this is continuing, I even checked for new chapters the day before.

I'm getting used to it but Daphne's personality seemed so off at first, I didn't expect her to be such a "scheming mistress" but I'm liking the direction she's going towards.

** It's an interesting start, but,

1. The whole borderline-bashing meme that Harry is oh-so-talented, but that the much-less-talented Ron is holding him back is profoundly annoying. /Why not/ bring Ron into their little study group? Canon Ron is almost as talented as Harry in almost all areas of magic (at least to the extent that their classroom performance and OWL results reflect that).
2. I am also seeing some of the common theme of genius!Hermione existing mainly to make Harry a better wizard. (/Coach Granger/, /Knowledge is Good but Power is Power/, and /Growing and Standing/ immediately come to mind.) I am worried that any chapter now, it'll turn out that while Hermione is smarter, Harry has a bigger "magical core" or is just more "powerful", or whatever arbitrary magical power level mechanic the author might use, and so when time comes to cast powerful magic (e.g., Fidelius), it's Hermione researching the spell but Harry casting it.
3. On the other hand, Harry goes along with everything too easily. He doesn't feel like a distinct character from Hermione at this point, in anything that matters.
4. Along similar lines, Hermione lacks certain rough edges she has in canon, which defined her character. For example, she strikes me far too easygoing: I just don't see a canon-consistent Hermione at that age getting drawn into a prank war with Harry.

Am I misreading something?
