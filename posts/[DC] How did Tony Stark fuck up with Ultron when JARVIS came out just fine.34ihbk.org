** Thematically, it's got to be Hubris.

My guess: Jarvis has fairly modest goals, which are well within the range of human understanding and social boundaries - serve his creator (and family, and protect, and... less scope creep than Ultron)

Ultron, by comparison, is the child of Tony's arrogance and pride. Why negotiate peace, when you can bring it about by force? Why involve humans at every level, when the computer is infallible? We're all familiar with the story - both from all the mythos in the cultural background, and the specific UFAI fears laid out by the MIRI.

Hold on, I checked TVTropes for where his core programming came from.

  Ultron is created by applying the algorithms gleaned from the "reactor" inside Loki's scepter to Tony's Ultron system.

MOTHERFUCKER! What kind of... why... would... I don't even... WHY WOULD YOU TAKE SOFTWARE FROM FUCKING LOKI AND EXPECT IT TO BEHAVE ITSELF!?!?!?!?! HE'S A FUCKING SLICKLY MALICIOUS TRICKSTER GOD! HIS SOFTWARE IS PRACTICALLY /DESIGNED/ TO GO ROGUE!

**** Hi, MCU nerd here for fact-checking. "Loki's Scepter" is called such because Loki had it in the Battle of New York, but it is not originally his. It was a gift given to him shortly before the invasion of Earth by Thanos (a demigod-like character in the universe) as a sign of goodwill and support for Loki's schemes. It is not of his design in any way, it just fit him thematically. Jarvis is also not a true AI, just a very sophisticated voice-command program. Not being hard-science-fiction, the distinction is superfluous at best; Jarvis is capable of rationalizing complex moral and tactical situations, as well as having basic emotions and desires, but that's just the way it is.

** If that answers your question, great. If not, I'll continue, but it's going to involve major spoilers for Age of Ultron. Here goes.

--------------

The scepter's core reactor is revealed to be one of the Infinity Stones, a set of impossibly powerful artifacts. Each one is attuned to a specific idea/concept, like Power or Time or Mind. The Scepter is the latter, thus its ability to mind-control and communicate over long distances instantly. Each has a life and nature of its own- The Power gem is just a glowing ball of infinite energy; if you haven't seen Guardians of the Galaxy, it literally atomizes anyone who directly touches it unless they're exceedingly special or powerful. It blows a person and building apart without hiccuping, and is noted to have the power to cripple or utterly obliterate a planet. Thus, the Mind Gem's special nature is that it's structure is very much like a brain/supercomputer.

Stark's failure with Ultron was that it was a rush job, to put it simply. Thor was taking the Scepter away the next day to Asgard, where Tony would never get to see or play with it again.

In the previous fight, Scarlet Witch (reality warper/mind powers) had messed with Stark's brain, showing him a vision of a slaughtered Avengers and planet, with a dead Captain America bemoaning how Stark "could have done more, could have saved us." Scarlet Witch knows Stark will do something hasty when confronted with his greatest fear, leading to his downfall (her primary vendetta/goal). So he's not working with his full moral faculties in the first place.

He (with a roped-in Banner) rushed to successfully create an Artificial Intelligence based off the live nature of the Scepter. He was only trying to create a prototype, a basic template; he was not expecting a fully-formed AI to pop out. He failed to give Ultron any true purpose or personality outside of "Peace In Our Time" which Ultron took to the 'logical' conclusion of "kill everyone". Standard Unfriendly AI shenanigans ensue.

Ultron goes to build himself a new bio-mechanical body fitted with the Mind Gem and is 90% loaded in, but it's stolen by the Avengers before he can finish. Stark and Banner are able to get it right this time, letting Jarvis' code be the template upon which the new AI is built, instead of just making an empty shell based on the Stone and letting the void fill the gaps. This new creation is not just Jarvis, not just Ultron, but something different that is able to find harmony between his human creators and the Stone's power. It renames itself "Vision", noting it is not allied with them in particular- it is concerned with the protection and support of all life, including Ultron; however Ultron, as he exists, will always be a creature of destruction, and thus must be wiped out. Even this Vision regrets, as Ultron is a very unique lifeform that is in a lot of pain. The Avengers wish to stop him as well, so he works with them.

--------------

*TL;DR:* Jarvis was a fancy Siri, Ultron was the result of a poorly constructed shell based on a magical artifact, Vision is the result of Ultron being recreated with Jarvis' underlying processes and goals.

***** Tony fucking Stark ought to have noticed he was being taunted into doing something foolish. It seems like Informed Ability Intelligence to make him a charming asshole genius on the level of Elon Musk's and Steve Job's lovechild and then say he can't see when he's being messed-around.

****** Even those people aren't infallible. He acknowledges Scarlet Witch's effects, but believes he's just been pushed to act on his fears with greater haste than before. SW'S gamble wasn't to alter him, it was to force him to put all his cards on the table too soon and lose. He acknowledges he was a bit hasty, but doesn't regret it. Even smart people can get caught up in their own "I know what I'm doing" circles, and will often go to impressive rationalizing lengths to stay there.

Hers was a very gentle nudge in a direction he was already going and believed in fiercely.

**** You've identified the problem. As for why Stark went about it that way...he was very worried that he would lead the world to destruction by not doing enough to save it, plus his window of opportunity was small. So when he saw a means to complete his AI program he jumped on it. Also, while it's still completely inexcusably negligent, that's probably why he didn't take the time to install safeguards, he was in such a rush.

I'm not sure exactly what Tony was trying to use Ultron's AI for in the first place, but the movie lays out the reason he didn't just create another Jarvis type. Jarvis is (supposedly, the movie doesn't back this up very well) a far more primitive program. While Jarvis seems fairly sophisticated, it's ultimately just made to follow protocol, while Ultron would have a far greater capacity to learn and think in order to reach the optimal solution.

**** Right. Clearly in-story Tony is actually a high-functioning /moron/, and the first part is debatable. I don't even have words for how stupid an idea that would be.

  Hmm, what should I do with an artifact that can corrupt gods? I know - sounds like the perfect addition to my private system for peace-through-firepower!

FWIW: My favourite Iron Man remains /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10230499/1/][Memories of Iron]]/, and that's a combination of fixes and character study.

** IIRC in the /comics/, Jarvis was a human butler and Ultron was made by Ant-Man.

In the /films/... Maybe Tony was sciencing under the influence of alcohol?

** It isn't actually that unreasonable. Tony found what was basically true AI in the scepter and used that framework together with his knowledge of basic AI that he had previously used to build up Jarvis.

Jarvis had been tested and gradually been improved (tony said Jarvis began as a voice recognition software) so that's why he came out fine. Ultron, on the other hand was hastily brought together because they only had three days before Thor left with the staff and it wasn't intended that he would just be let go without further ado. Intron broke free from Jarvis control and stopped him from sounding the alarms.

A rushed and flawed creation that was never supposed to be given autonomy broke free. Had Jarvis been able to contain him Stark would have had a fully functioning AI permanently that he could perfect.
