Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Mod proposal: we ban political/CW topics from weekly threads and posts sometimes. My current proposal: one weekly thread per week, rotating, must be /entirely/ free of that stuff, with temp-bans handed out with extreme prejudice for violators.

People need to have a space to talk about /fiction/, even when Weighty Worldly Matters are impinging in nasty ways on all of our daily lives. For many people, the space to get away from Weighty Worldly Matters /is/ how they feel safe and well for even a short period of time. This can be titled the Escapism Only Rule.

I just get exasperated that lots of them /acknowledge/ the technological capacity we're going to have incoming this century, but seem to have decided that it's appalling and there's no good outcome. They say, "well, if you can automate away all the labor, at least the AIs will kill us all quickly, so we don't have to live through the dreadful hell of emptiness and meaninglessness left in the wake of automating the labor." Then they insist that we need to focus on breeding higher-IQ people... because apparently society has gone stagnant for lack of scientific super-geniuses at the same time as we're barreling towards death-by-AI.

To which my only reply is: "Wuh? But there's lots of things to do besides upholding some awful ideology or basement-dwelling. There are more things in Heaven and Earth, internet Horatio, than are dream't-of in your frankly really obscure, weird philosophy."

Like, if you talk to me about Bayes and AI Safety, I'm gonna nod my head along, but if literally everything you try to talk about ends with, "And that's why X is the downfall of Western civilization and/or the human race", it's just kinda... a massive WTF.

This is not an accurate summation of my post. I did not suggest a separate CW thread, I suggested that if political stuff were to be banned, in one or more of the several existing weekly threads, it should not be banned in all of them, and the ones where it is should be clearly labelled so.

Quick edit: for example, one week 'general rationality' is labeled apolitical, the next week 'off-topic' is.

***** Ah I thought you meant isolating CW stuff entirely, but instead what you're proposing something that's only a partial split.

Still I'm not sure exactly how useful a compromise like that would necessarily be, since the threads where you allow CW would have a higher than previous concentration of CW making them less appealing to people who still want to see if there's interesting non CW stuff there. Plus if the CW concentration gets to be a majority in those threads people may stop using them for other stuff making basically unofficial CW threads effectively.\\
Whereas if CW stuff remains a minority then if people want to avoid it they have to accept missing out on some good non-CW stuff in those threads. It sort of seems like a compromise that would satisfy very few people.

So there's something of a question of whether it should really matter if it increases discussion of CW topics if it improves the experience of the subreddit overall (by isolating it), since presumably most traffic wouldn't be in those threads (we don't have the same readership as SSC so it seems unlikely to become the largest thing on the subreddit).

Either way that's neither here nor there since we seem to be in agreement doing nothing is probably best anyway.

** It is impossible for me to not fear for the future of my country in the wake of Charlottesville. In response to the murder of a progressive protestor at the hands of a white supremacist, my President choose to condemn both sides for engaging in violence and [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]] completely agrees with that decision, while still insisting that this does not make them the allies of actual Nazis despite KKK members saying that is an indication that the President is on their side.

The more things like this happen, the more and more I believe that America is heading towards a new civil war. The political divide in this country is proving to be utterly irreconcilable even in situations where people are being murdered by Nazis. These people believe there is a moral equivalence to this situation and even if I could comprehend how that is possible, they respond to this event by demanding absolutely nothing be changed or their political leaders do anything different.

From the moment I first heard of the anti-fascists and their agenda to limit free speech out of fear of fascist rhetoric, I became afraid that I would become one of them. I don't want to believe that people I hate don't have civil rights, but as I see every single stereotype I have of my enemy proven correct...it gets harder and harder to not want to prove stereotypes my enemies have of me correct.

The fascists, even ones who call themselves populist or conservative, believe they are being subjugated by liberals and will do whatever it takes to end that subjugation even if it means destroying our democracy. That makes me want to subjugate them, to fight in that civil war and create a future where espousing these beliefs is a crime. I don't want that, but it seems more and more morally acceptable to do as this goes on.

Is that what it will take to destroy fascism? Do self-righteous liberals like me need to finally decide that these people have broken the social contract and must be considered violent threats to ourselves? Can we take the leap of declaring hate speech to be under the exception of "shouting fire in a crowded theater" and criminalize it without becoming what we hate? Is that a world that I should want to live in?

Given the speech Trump gave this weekend, accusing "both sides" for the violence we saw in Charlottesville, and the current administration's willingness to scapegoat and point fingers at minority groups/political opponents for it's own failings, are hate speech laws likely to be enforced against:

A.) Wanna-be Neo-Nazis and white supremacists

We assume the democratic ideals that protect us are strong, but at the end of the day they're just words on paper, enforced by organizations that people with as much power as either the President or Congress could subvert if they put enough effort into it. What really protects us are the fragile norms that our politicians adhere to because they were raised in American culture, and those norms are degrading as democracy is eroded by the growing extremism of the right wing through gerrymandering, voter suppression, the nuclear option, refusing to hear Supreme Court nominations, playing games of chicken during debt ceiling raises, etc. If Trump was more cunning and diplomatic, our Constitution might not be enough to protect us. He could use high popular support to pressure Republicans to support him to expand and pack the Supreme Court with conservative justices, purge likely Democrat voters from voter rolls to ensure Congressional victories, and command the military (most members of which are Republican, and many of which voted for him) to enforce his will. He could fire Mueller, pardon anyone being investigated other than himself, fire any replacement for Mueller that was appointed, etc.

At the end of the day, our democracy is quite fragile when faced with people willing to violate every norm. We really need a second bill of rights with stronger protections against these kinds of tactics, but amendments are difficult to pass, and I doubt even ones that should be bipartisan like this would be agreed on by both parties.

A government which can declare hate speech a crime can be taken over by exactly the fascists you now want to subjugate, and can be used to imprison the very people you desire to protect for the crime of speaking their minds.

  Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right even to suppress them, for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to anything as deceptive as rational argument, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, exactly as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping; or as we should consider incitement to the revival of the slave trade.

I also worry about our country's future, but the events that brought that on go back much further then this recent election. Do you feel that all groups whos members could be violent/terrorist should be "brought to heel?" I hate that this situation occured, but I have trouble seeing that it is different from any other situation caused by an extremist. There are extremists in all groups, antifa, muslim and christian, black panthers, alt-right and conservatives. Homosexuals have some organizations that in my mind are scary (Especially as a gay man). There are gangs, and look, even at how certain police departments act.\\
I don't feel your solution would be effective at all, I think what would be more effective is using the laws that are already in place, and focusing on removing biases and holding politicians accountable, also electing people that can provide results. Tell me more of what you think please.

**** Personally, I think that the problem lies with our systems of information and socialization.

1. People naturally create *filter bubbles* by looking at things that they like looking at and not looking at things that they don't like looking at. Internet and media companies help this process along by doing their own predictive filtering.
2. Internet communities *exclude moderates* because moderates are too close to the edge of the bubble. This causes radicalization all on its own. I've been kicked out of a number of communities for being a moderate.
3. It's far easier to engage in *intentional radicalization* than ever before, because you can present your own worldview to people and unless you have a dedicated and intelligent opposition, you have all your best arguments stacked up against people who don't understand what they're arguing.
4. It's far easier for *the radicals to find each other* than ever before. In 1950, if I had some niche fetish for leg amputees, I would /probably/ be out of luck without a lot of effort. In 2017, I can just type a search term into google and *bam*, I'm in the middle of a group of amputee porn connoisseurs. Same thing applies to political/social views. I think it probably goes without saying that radicals in groups are more dangerous because of their ability to segregate responsibilities (intentionally or otherwise) and egg each other on (see above, radicals make each other more radical).
5. We *hear more* about radicals than ever before, both because of the ready access to information and the perverse incentives for people to give coverage to radicals.
6. *State actors*, *major corporations*, and *private individuals* are all actively pouring efforts into the black arts of radicalization for their own purposes. This has always been the case; now it's a lot easier than it was.

I'm generally against more restrictions on free speech than already exist, but that's at least partly because I'm conservative in the sense of "don't change complex things without thinking about it a lot first, and never if it might be a symptom instead of a cause".

I am not sure that any of the above actually has a solution, but I don't think more restrictions on free speech are it. Instead, I would probably say that a solution has to be found in a restructuring of our information society to deliberately expose people to whatever is outside of their bubble and therefore curb extremism, but I don't know how such a thing would be implemented and that might be an even bigger infringement on free speech than simply banning wrongspeech. Also, the Constitution doesn't allow for it and there's no political will to get it done.

And again, I like Antifa. I have a friend in Antifa, and have applied to join my local Antifa. I might even do it.

But I know damn well that they're a bunch of anarchists and a few communists looking to get into street fights. /Of course/ they're extremists, and joining them requires /really believing/ that the /correct/ position is one society currently considers extreme.

This is where we have to have a serious dispute. IMHO, the USA's electoral system is mostly captive to the Republican Party, and doesn't really legitimate the regime.

Overall, the partisan layout of the system is /heavily/ disproportionate, /towards/ Republicans, and we have strong evidence (see: the book /Ratfucked/) that this was done deliberately to make Republican victory the systematic default.

To me, it stinks of a one-party state, a Soviet-style government of party bureaucracy. I can only hope the Republican Party is now overextended and will implode from within, because elections will probably never unseat them in the next generation, at the rate we're going now.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And, of great semantic importance, despite the "protesters" who marched /waving literal swastikas/ and yelling /literal Nazi slogans/.

People call for my resignation as a mod whenever I say "bash the fash", but come on, bash the damned fash when they're fashing it up right in front of you!

But that thread with [[/u/Summerspeaker]] /really worries me/. Along with a lot of things lately, it's giving me "double vision" or "epistemic bistability" about /why/ there's such a loud reactionary outcry against "social justice" and antifascist action. It really does seem that people on the inside of "SJ" have /no/ desire whatsoever to self-police about giving even nominal respect to the society they live in.

When you think about /one/ axis of oppression, that makes sense: who /likes/ the idea of living on stolen Native land, or of racially differential policing, except for an actual racist? Who /likes/ the idea of not having women in your workplace, except sexists?

But when you take it intersectional, you start having to deal with the Joint Probability Law. The more independent conjuncts you add to your intersection of oppressions and exploitations, the more of society overall you're declaring problematic, reactionary, or even gulag-bait -- including the people you need on your side to build a majority and win.

Eventually, you're actually invalidating such huge majorities of the population that they turn against your movement, because you /simply will not allow/ them to step forward for /their/ problems without stepping forward for /every/ problem, /every/ program that you've put on your activist agenda.

And nobody self-polices it. Nobody says, "hold on, we just drove Mark Fisher to suicide" or "hold on, why does the Labour Party have to sanction so many antisemitic party members" (hobby horse of mine). In fact, stuff like, "Britain's Labour Party cracked own on antisemitism, published a manifesto with mass appeal, organized like hell, and got a great result in the elections" becomes /exceptional/ rather than /normal/.

Because everyone shrugs and thinks to themselves, well, I guess that's somewhat problematic, but overall, we need to advance the movement.

The thing is, Nazis hate /most everyone/, and we all know it. There are only a few really committed Nazis, and some alt-light people even graze the Nazis and /get the fuck out of there/ when they realize what they've touched. Certainly most libertarians want nothing to fucking do with them by now. Meanwhile, Leninists and Maoist-Third-Worldists are far fewer in number, but "social justice" activists are /huge/ in number, and /they tolerate the authoritarian communists/ really, really willingly.

Then, since "SJWs" don't really self-police /at all/, they start picking up the more rabidly authoritarian or toxic ideas from folks like auth-coms, people-of-color nationalist movements, or sometimes even Islamists. Sure, very few people /actually/ think those are good ideas, but /massive/ numbers of people /tolerate/ authoritarian-leftist ideas in exactly the ways we all refuse to tolerate authoritarian right ideas.
