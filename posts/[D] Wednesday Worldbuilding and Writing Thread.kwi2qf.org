Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I'd like some help imagining some possibilities to build around a city based around blood magic.

This particular form of blood magic is quite limited, and the residents of the city can only summon blood (any type of blood). They cannot manipulate it, or change it within a body. That being said, they are quite clever at using it and other areas in the region do not have access to this magic.

What might be some specific consequences of this ability, or interesting cultural aspects I can develop? So far, I've got:

• They eat the blood. The extra calories allows for a larger population

• Blood meal is used as fertilizer

• They summon blue blood for luck. It is considered fortuitous when it does not clot, and bad luck when it does (it's horseshoe crab blood--which clots in the presence of bacterial endotoxins). Because of this, the city is incredibly hygienic and have discovered the link between hand washing and disease before all their contemporaries

• This city has a horrible reputation with its neighbors, who think blood summoning is taboo and that the city's people are devil-worshippers who engage in dark magic

This is a low-technology setting, not overly dissimilar from ancient Greece.

*** Humans can suffer from iron overload, which could potentially be fatal. This city wouldn't be able to consume a diet of only blood, but they could consume quite a lot. For some reason I can't imagine, I couldn't find any studies about the maximum percentage of your caloric intake can be blood before it causes problems.

So they'd need some other food sources, but blood would be such a rich fertilizer that this shouldn't be a problem. Honestly, if every citizen has access to this ability (or if specific citizens can summon arbitrarily large amounts of blood), I don't know if there are any limits on the population size here. You would still need somewhere to grow real crops, but if every citizen had a windowsill or rooftop garden that might be enough.

I would bet that every inch of free vertical or horizontal surface of this city would be covered in crop plants. It would be able to exist totally independent of surrounding land that way, making them immune to siege. You couldn't poison their water supply because they could have massive distilling vats producing water out of summoned blood for free, using the rendered fat from the blood as fuel. They might be able to make some kind of biodegradable building material from blood and plant products as well, so they wouldn't even need quarries.

Almost nobody in the city would need to dedicate their lives to producing food. As a result, everyone would be able to become an expert in something. I would expect this city to exist in a neverending golden age, with every mind advancing science, technology, and art, for their entire lives. Once they get good enough, they could start extracting solid iron, copper, and other materials from the blood, so making weapons to defend themselves with isn't even a problem. They would probably discover explosives pretty quickly from working with organic materials constantly, and as such they could conquer surrounding areas. Assuming they even wanted to, given that they don't need anything from them.

This is basically just reality on creative mode.

**** You'd run into massive pollution issues before getting anywhere close to a utopian society. Using blood for fertilizer is going to drive the dissolved salt content and alkalinity of your soil up over time and do so in a way that is not normally found in nature. While it might be good fertilizer for the first few years, you're eventually going to start getting crop failures due to the fact that you're literally salting the earth with blood. No, blood fertilization isn't sustainable without regular periods of fallowing.

Moreover, there's about a liter of water for every gram of iron in human blood, meaning that even if you assume perfect efficiency, you're going to end up with a good sized barrel of dirty water every time you extract a single fork's worth of metal. Fat is even less efficient - blood lipids are measured in millimols, after all. While you can probably dodge most of the the fuel requirements there by using large evaporating pools to dehydrate the blood before using it, you're still going to end up rapidly humidifying the air and causing unseasonable storms, unnatural fogs and/or everything getting covered in mold.

Of course, the above assumes that you have some good way to prevent the giant standing pools of blood from fermenting in the sun. You'd need to periodically churn them at bare minimum, and probably add some sort of antibacterial chemical to keep it from turning into a giant vat of rotting blood. While you probably could feed said workers their own portions of blood meal out of the blood vat's yield, you're still devoting a good portion of your populace to mucking around in giant vats of blood, cleaning mold off of things and otherwise trying to manage the whole blood industry.

Overall, I expect the city's horrible reputation with the neighbors and said neighbors prejudices against a blood-based economy to look pretty justified from an in-universe POV. The whole city is going to stink of rotten blood and have awful weather, the food is going to taste terrible and their crops will keep having unfortunate failures. Plus, bratty little children literally run around squirting blood at one another for fun.

***** I'm inclined to agree with you. As much as a utopian society with an industrial scale distilling facility is interesting, I don't think it is feasible to base every aspect of life around it, especially at the technology level I am setting this in.

Unless they are under siege or severe drought, they're not going to extract water, fat, or metal from blood, simply because the opportunity cost is so high. And blood fertilization would be used as a supplement to regular farming as opposed to the sole method (too much nitrogen in the soil is generally a bad thing).

I'm actually really trying to subvert expectations and make the blood city the good guys. Or at the least, undeserving of their reputation. That's why I thought of the horseshoe crab thing--a culture/religious belief based around the value of cleaning might help prevent the inevitable mold and disease vectors that would grow there. Of course, the smell is still a problem...

And lol, I've already written a scene with bratty little minion children running around, looking like they've just ganked someone with very high blood pressure. Maybe their horrible reputation is a little deserved.

Whole blood contains about 50-55 mg of iron per 100 mL. The tolerable upper daily intake level for iron is reported by the USDA to be 45 mg. There's about 125 calories per 100 mL of blood, and you'd be capped at about 80 mL, which works out to about 100 calories. Given a 2,000 calorie daily diet, blood products (blood sausages, blood soups, blood curd, etc.) could only provide about 5% of your regular caloric needs.

**** Hm, I wonder why you can't find any studies about the maximum percentage blood your caloric intake can be blood. That really needs to be remedied immediately.

And yeah, the blood being a buffer to famine and siege is a good idea, although I don't think things will be quite as straightforward as you say. I don't think blood is sustainable enough to create a never-ending golden age, although the city is a regional power. Too many waste products and unhygienic environments created from the distillation.

For food, I've been toying with the idea of plants that have evolved specifically to grow only in areas of high concentrations of blood, but I'm not really sure how feasible this is. On one hand, having unique crops is cool and I could have plants growing on every open surface in the city, but on the other, who is going to trade with the devil city for the devil crops?

For technology, I've also been thinking about using the energy from falling blood (summoned from high up) to power mills--but this might be a bad idea. Even if I have the river of blood flow far away into the desert or something, there might be too much gunk and disease.

*** Blood transfusions seem like a natural medical technique for them to develop, given they can produce fresh blood on demand. The main hurdle there would be figuring out the different blood types, but they might be able to get by if they can choose to create more of an individual's blood. That could help to reduce deaths from blood loss, and so perhaps a culture of duels and knife-fights would develop because of that reduced lethality.

Once blood transfusion is developed, a natural next step would be a kind of parabiosis, transfusing blood that is specifically young and healthy as well as being of the right type. The science of how well it works for humans is far from settled, but for the sake of the story it could increase longevity with all the attendant social effects that would bring.

Some animals have poisonous blood, so perhaps that could be used for warfare or murder?

With red, blue, green, yellow, and violet/purple blood available in animals and insects, I imagine these would be used as pigments for decorating if the colours can be made to last well enough. Perhaps these would become the national colours, too?

**** Hm, I didn't realize that there were animals with poisonous blood, but apparently you are right. I googled it, and eels have blood that can kill if injected, but is safe when eaten or taken orally.

I'm half and half between using unusual coloured blood as pigments, or using it as part of the city's religion. The national colours thing is a good idea.

Letting them be used as pigments does allow them to a more artistic culture, which could be a neat contrast to their reputation.

** All the member countries of the United Nations agree and ratify the following law:

Henceforth [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder][murder]] is fully legal and legal processes involve only the verification that it has indeed been murder and not another form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide][homicide]]. Other forms of homicide have an unchanged legal status. Lets say the law stays at least for a few decades in place, globally.

I take the English Wikipedia articles as legal definition.

But if you don't want to check them out, see murder just as planned or cold-blooded killing of another human being. So e.g. accidental killing (manslaughter) doesn't count as murder.

How do societies change?

The thought just got into my head, because there a sometimes horror stories on different levels. And this would go into the direction of horror on a societal level - in my opinion.

*** Violence would probably spike at first, but I imagine civilian groups would be created to revenge murder pretty fast. At that point given enough time the only major difference between this hypothetical society and our own would be the decentralized nature of this one aspect of law enforcement. (And the fact that murderers would always get the death penalty.) Also people just aren't terribly inclined to cold blooded murder in the first place and that's not just because of fear of societal punishment. I certainly don't think it would cause horror stories level of change.

*** Depending on what exactly is going on, I imagine many murders would be prosecutable under other parts of the criminal code: assault and battery, harassment, terrorism, extortion, and others. Moreover, unless you somehow also got the legal system to acknowledge that murder (in addition to being legal) did not constitute 'harm' in any way, committing murders would leave you open to being sued and faced with civil penalties.

It would certainly disrupt a lot of the discussions around assisted suicide, since conspiring with somebody to have them murder you, or at least to hide all evidence of that conspiracy would be an available workaround.

The strategies surrounding legal defense of homicides would bifurcate and look really strange, since you could try to demonstrate that there's not enough evidence of the crime, but you could also try to meet some of the rather higher standards of proof for murder.

What would this do to society? Jeez, I don't even know. The actual execution of any effort to legalize actual murder (in the first degree?) while leaving other legal realities unchanged is complicated enough that it could look all kinds of different ways, depending on how exactly it's implemented and what the cultural response is like.

Assassinations would probably become more common, especially for groups that have the power to protect their operatives. They might also generally be less covert, since making it an obvious murder might in some ways make it harder to prosecute (though, again there are usually laws national and international against things like treason or undermining the sovereignty of recognized/allied powers).

Likewise, private security as an industry is likely to become more important, but it might also be hard to keep such groups from turning into professional hit squads.

Speaking of professional hit squads, many countries have laws against conspiracy to murder, or being an accomplice to a murder, incitement of violence, etc. Depending on how these are treated, professional hit squads may not actually be incentivized, or very carefully trained/organized to concentrate all the provable evidence of the murder on the person pulling the trigger. Still hard to avoid obstruction of justice/destruction of evidence charges that way, though. Like I said, waaaay too many details. Maybe you'd just get a lot of solo operators with legal protections around how they are contracted, both for security and assassination (maybe they'd actually be lawyers, nominally hired to help clients determine whether something is a murder or not, in addition to being enough of a physical threat to include "deterrence" in their services? This would make it possible to try to hide evidence of ancillary crimes under attorney-client privilege. Then again, there's already legal structures both for hiding stuff that way and getting at it, so those legal fights could get weird)

If you're imagining that the world cultures are actually receptive to this change (and how would it get enshrined in international law otherwise?), you'd probably see some people trying to rationalize this as morally correct. First argument that comes to mind is exalting the idea of honor and intentionality: anybody who takes a life should not do so carelessly, and so should demonstrate a "sufficient" degree of awareness of how to perform the act and all its attendant consequences in order to remain honorable, etc.

But realistically, this question still feels really underdetermined. A question of the form, "what happens to society if X?" wherein X only happens in a society that has to look very different from ours, just raises a lot of questions about which changes/differences/assumptions you want to include. Did an evil genie snap their fingers and now the world's legal codes are changed in some way that everybody accepts as legitimate for magical reasons? Or do each of the nations ratify their own (maybe slightly different) versions of the law over the course of a few years? Is there a tremendous global political movement in favor of this change? If so, where does the movement stand on issues related to murder? Or unrelated issues, for that matter? If there isn't a tremendous global movement, what political forces are trying to create these changes? Religious extremists of some kind? Corporations? Powerful alien sociologists with no scruples and a commitment to experimental methods? These all create very different results for our society.

**** I generally agree. Your comment goes in the direction of my thoughts after I posted. Next time I will think beforehand. One thing though: I think the surveillance will increase massively. When politicians cry out for more surveillance after every terror act, then with murder made legal this will be far more intense. What also should be made legal for this concept to make more sense is the planning of murder and forcing murder as the general legal interpretation of all acts of planned or cold blooded killings. I don't want to write a lengthy text but I think the most dire consequences in the end - assuming the prior paragraph applies - is a surge of totalitarian surveillance states after a few decades.

I also don't think that 'making murder legal' is a interesting scenario as it is to unrealistic. Just popped up in my head and I was in the position to post it immediately. But I wanted to see what people make of it.

As an example, would be something like; you request something of the magic, and it tries to achieve this for you. HOW it does so needs to be computed by the system, which takes computing power (magic power) so the more specific you are the easier it is to cast.

But with something like that I can't see how realistically someone won't start casting diagnosis spells etc to pretty much do science and discover all the laws of physics in a day. Any ideas on similar systems which wouldn't have such an obvious loop-hole?
