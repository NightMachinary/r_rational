** UPDATE:

It's irked me for a long time that I put the rules notes in Chapter 10 instead of in a separate document but I can't do anything about it now without renumbering all the chapters, which would mean updating all my source HTML to match. Immediately after posting this here I found myself thinking:

"Hey, maybe I should avoid making the same mistake twice."

So, now the contents of this chapter have been moved to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838202/1/Not-a-story-FAQ-for-The-Two-Year-Emperor][a separate document]]. Chapter 72 will be replaced when I post on Saturday.

** Why didn't Neklos' portfolio sense alert him to the fact that the dozen souls he had under his personal control at that moment were about to die? The heroes took precautions to avoid the intent to kill Neklos to avoid tipping him off, but Suze deliberately aims to kill everyone else.

*** You know, I was thinking that it had something to do with the wording of the spell ([[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm][/Trap the Soul/]]) in that it wouldn't technically qualify as death, but looking at it that doesn't seem right unless death is defined as the separation of the soul from the body and /Trap the Soul/ already separates the soul causing them not to die but merely be released to the afterlife without dying.

**** Ding!

Death in D&D is actually defined as: "[t]he character's hit points are reduced to -10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. +The character's soul leaves his body.+ [EDIT: removed this sentence because it was confusing and not part of the point I was making]"

Trap the Soul pulls the soul and the life force out of the body; I'm considering that to be death. Neklos didn't get any warning because he'd already killed them; when the soul gems shattered their material bodies would have reformed but been instantly vaporized. I'm considering this as "they were dead-but-in-the-gems, then they were dead-but-not-in-the-gems" with no actual intervening time that would allow Neklos's portfolio sense to alert him.

***** That definition seems to say that death is one possible thing that triggers a soul leaving a body, not that the soul leaving the body is itself a sufficient condition for death. It reads like the first sentence are the things which trigger death, and then death triggers the soul departure as a separate event. Soul separation triggering death is getting the causality backwards.

**** Since you seem to be pretty diligent about sticking to the source material I expect I'd be best served by researching how the portfolio sense from the rulebooks, but I think it's more interesting to try and discern how things work based on what's been presented in the story so far.

The portfolio sense described in most detail so far is Herrun's, particularly in reference to how she becomes aware of any plot against her whether it's public or private knowledge since those are explicitly part of her domain. She's also shown or at least heavily implied to be aware of Suze's secret desires when Suze is immediately thinking of them.

I think's it's realistic to generalize to portfolio sense therefore being sensitive to matters that relate directly to the god in question, or to those who they're paying attention to at the moment. I think my original confustion stemmed from the assumption that gods are pretty much totally aware of anything related to their domains at all times, but given that Herrun was defeated, however, she either isn't consciously aware of literally all knowledge at all times, or the plot was so sophisticated and capable that she was defeated even seeing it coming.

The latter seems less likely, especially since the "not pseudo-omniscient" hypothesis is supported by Arros leaving behind a shard to attend to Jake's questions, suggesting that gods consciousnesses aren't as unlimited as they would have to be to deal with that level of awareness.

It could be argued that since Neklos wasn't paying attention to Suze and she wasn't attempting to kill him his sense wasn't triggered, but that's a very conveniently shaped loophole, and I expect that's not your actual, implied answer. Maybe I'll hunt back through the text to find something I'm missing, but that feels like cheating.

**** No the surprise round wouldn't help, portfolio sense extends into the future. Quoth [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm]] which [[/u/eaglejarl]] says is the canonical source.

#+begin_quote
  Greater deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and where it is. The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.
#+end_quote

Death has more than 1 million worshipers so he has at least a week into the future of portfolio sense.

******* The trick would be if you could have a contingency that was an IF/THEN -- two slots, two conditions. Even if you were only allowed one contingency, you could stack others into the two slots -- they aren't in effect until their condition triggers. It would take some pretty carefully constructed conditions though.

#+begin_quote
  The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. *If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on.* The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
#+end_quote

My emphasis added. I was excited for this, ate a chocolate for the good idea by posting, then went and looked at the RAW and decided it might be less useful than I though, but It'll be interesting to see if it shows up. After all, I don't think an if then else decision tree is complicated, but does the god of magic think it is convoluted, and if so can you use plane shift cast using the cleric level as an escape hatch?

********* Yeah, I was familiar with the "complicated" restriction. Still, you could probably make it work with something like

" SLOT ONE: If I am ever attacked, cast Time Stop. SLOT TWO: I have a bunch of nested contingencies in this slot; if the conditions that would cause one of them to be activated are ever met, activate the Contingency in this slot. "

That Contingency then has something like:

" SLOT ONE: If I am ever reduced to -9 hit points or below, cast Delay Death. SLOT TWO: I have a bunch of nested contingencies in this slot; if the conditions that would cause one of them to be activated are ever met, activate the Contingency in this slot. "

And so on.
