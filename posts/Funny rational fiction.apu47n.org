I'm realizing that it's difficult for me to get into fiction that's too serious. The big reason I loved HPMOR/Natural20/Unsong so much is that they're hilarious. Can you recommend some stories with a similar lighthearted tone and comedy?


** It's not /rational/, per se, but it's pretty smart, and it's the funniest fanfiction I know: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]].

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Cook#Wizardry_series][The Wiz Biz book series by Rick Cook]] is hilarious, ingenious, and began my love of rational fiction. I have the first half of the series in storage somewhere, and intend to re-read and finish it someday.

Probably the most memorable non-magical moment in the series is when the Wiz travels back to Earth and attends a computer conference where new software is shown. He runs across some guys who wrote a computer program that interprets any sufficiently large/complex file into a still pornographic image. The concept intrigues him, and he asks how big the main executable of the program is, and what happens when they run it through itself. They ponder it for a moment, try it, and then wonder how many state decency laws they just broke.

It made me laugh out loud quite some times already, though it is an ongoing series so not quite as extensive yet as these other ones you listed.

****** Well, it's got one particular very-high-status man who ends up entangled with the female protagonist in a way that gives her tremendous power over the relationship, and this female protagonist is a virgin who does not have sex with anyone else or express sexual attraction to anyone else over the course of the story. But I can understand how this would confuse people into perceiving a male fantasy of a female nympho, since the female character has any sexual thoughts, at all.

Conjecture but not a confident one, since you can't read the minds or intentions of people from their writing: OP has never read a romance novel.

***** Nope; you're falling into the common mistake of thinking that a woman is just a gender-flipped man. Nothing could be further from the truth. Women don't fantasize about nymphos or harems, of whichever gender; those are male fantasies, as can be seen in porn and harem anime, both of which are aimed at men. To see what women fantasize about, read romance novels and watch romance movies; those are aimed at women, and make good money depicting their fantasies.

In addition, the author is male so the protagonist is by definition a creature of a male mind. The point I was trying to make with that adjective might have been better served if l described it as "an Eliezer fantasy of a female nympho"

**** Kind of related, but think of it as analogous to "what men think male objectification is" to "what women actually want to see".

The Hugh Jackman magazine covers:

[[https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fb31c940546058386acfdb6274f94b3/tumblr_inline_oqj6lkD52P1qbxpiu_250.jpg][men's magazine]] Shows wolverine all muscly and strong, shirtless - "male power fantasy"

So a male fantasy of a nympho woman might have the woman pursuing strong men, or possibly men who are actually the author's SI; a woman's fantasy is more likely to feature men who are attractive for reasons other than BRUTE STRENGTH. I mean, not always, not exclusively, but personally I'd rather sleep with Dad Hugh than Wolverine Hugh.

***** Note that this sort of thing could easily be cherry picked by choosing what magazines to look at. Like, given that a magazine exists called "muscle and fitness", I don't think the fact that it sells itself with pictures of muscle bound hunks tells us much more.

I wondered if Cosmopolitan would have different pictures of Hugh than Good Housekeeping would. [[http://m.coolspotters.com/brands/adidas/and/magazines/cosmopolitan/media/1054009][It appears not]], so that corroborates your position.

****** Now I've decided to do a google search of [[https://www.google.com/search?q=hugh+jackman+magazine+covers&safe=off&rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU807AU807&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY9aevy7fgAhUOcCsKHRB9AwwQ_AUIDigB&biw=1680&bih=917][Hugh's magazine covers]]. It seems, in general, he looks classy/friendly rather than "RAWR WOLVERINE".

Here's a summary of what showed up on my non-anonymous search (YMMV):

DT (spanish-language high-end men's magazine): wearing a nice suit, adjusting his tie.

muscle & fitness: muscles. wolverine.

ioacquaesapone: some sort of italian magazine. seems general, not aimed at a market. He's wearing a tux and adjusting his tie and showing off a nice watch.

good housekeeping: dad!hugh

GQ: men's fashion. he's looking very... stylish? he reminds me of a submarine captain

men's fitness: you can see his pecs and arm muscles, but he's not looking like a bodybuilder, just a standard built man

vanity fair: he's surfing(?) i think he looks pretty attractive like this with his hair wet?

tv media: smiling with a woman's hand on his face wtf. he looks cute?

men's fitness 2.0: tighter shirt, more obvious arm muscles

GQ 2.0: he looks like he's got a hunched back i don't even. he doesn't look like a dad, he looks like... a politician? idk

augustman (singapore high-end men's magazine): he's wearing a coat and kind of covering his face a bit with the collar? I don't understand this

men's health: arm muscles obvious, he's doing a kind of "claw" motion with his hand and looking grumpy

okay i think i've looked at a bunch of covers now and all I can really tell is that high end men's magazines show hugh wearing expensive clothes and looking fancy and fitness/health magazines show him looking a bit buff, and there is like only one women's magazine in the list so that was a kind of waste of time

note: i'm actually faceblind so I'm taking it on faith that all these covers actually depict hugh jackman

other note: my post was meant to be a demonstration of the sorts of differences one might detect rather than, like, a peer-reviewed paper.

"I'm famous. I wear stylish, good-looking clothes. I'm well-built, but not unreasonably so. Perhaps this magazine will contain advice that will allow you to emulate my success on one of these fronts." With more of an emphasis on 'well-built' on the fitness magazine covers.
