So, I found some TSW recommendations in the subreddit, which makes it seem like the best place to ask this:

​

I've read the story before, but the forum is no longer accessible w/out logging in. I don't have an account, and the option to register doesn't seem to exist. What changed, and is this story gone from the accessible internet forever?


** The [[http://web.archive.org/][wayback machine]] is very much a thing that exists, it looks like it has archives of it.

Personally I wouldn't recommend it as a rational read though. It's much more a HFY story than a rational one.

Edit: You can also read the original posting on stardestroyer.net (Index thread [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=118769][here]])

** Is this the story where demons show up on Earth to conquer us and humanity puts them down with trivial ease? If so, I'd recommend skipping it. The premise is fun and the first couple chapters are satisfying in a HFY way, but after that it becomes pure wankery. There's no real challenge anywhere, the demons are never smart, it's just a curbstomp from first to last and therefore pretty dull.

*** The second installment is a bit less curbstomp, as Heaven has some actual threats and plotters, but overall they're still on the "stopped paying attention half a millennium ago and isn't bothering to adapt" level of stupidity as the demons were. It's easier to miss, because the focus is on Michael and Uriel. The former is basically a villain protagonist, and the latter is a person of mass destruction who would not be out of place in some comicbooks or action anime.

It also addresses the questions of how the UN (but mostly the US) more or less running the afterlife affects everyday life, and to a lesser extent geopolitics (Rogue nations start rethinking that whole rogue bit). The legal implications are touched upon (how does inheritance work when you empirically /can/ bring whatever's not anchored to the ground with you?).

But, yeah, I wouldn't say bringing up these things is the same as writing Rational Fiction. It's mostly Military Porn and Fanservice (a Samurai and one of the 300 teaming up to kick demon ass? Hellish Legions and flocks of angels cut down like so much chaff? Jabs at the Westborough Baptist Church and Rush Limbaugh? That Mythbusters sketch?).

*** I disagree and agree- it's not the /best/ story out there.

​

But the demons make smart decisions, and B2 has Michael showing us how a relatively amoral being saves his people from an unstoppable horde in another dimension- appeal to their morality. It also ends with the top brass grimly accepting a simple problem: Human society is so geared towards the War that, now that it's over, it's about to collapse. And the demon lord who escaped, Belial, has learned how to fight humans. He's /waiting/ for them to collapse, and building up his forces in the meantime.

​

And there's more pantheons out there. And Uriel kills millions, /permanently./ And I'm /still/ missing things. Humanity was simply handed a huge stick, and the author explored this premise- working off of it to the last detail, including the /effects/ of our favorite weapons. We aren't portrayed as full-on Mary Sues. We make mistakes, commit atrocities, and are still set-up to fail. It's certainly not a complete masterpiece, but the story is worth reading - especially if you're recovering from a Wildbow work, like /Worm./

Quote: Humans lose two major cities with virtually everybody in them. Forced to fight under circumstances where they can't use artillery, they get chewed up. The Russian defenses at the Phlegethon are breached despite the fact that they used everything short of a nuke and were only saved by a mass tank counterattack. In the second book, humans are taking a hammering and are unable to do much about it other than fend off the blows, since the angels watched the demons get curbstomped and take precautions to prevent Heaven's breaching, attacking indirectly through HURRICANES. Also, Uriel killing millions.

**** Well, it's been a long time since I read it and maybe it wasn't complete when I was reading. I'll take your word for it that there's more to it than I recall, but personally I remember the demons being thick as bricks and going down like straw dummies when hit with human weapons, instead of having the sort of durability that one would expect of supernatural creatures. Then there's the part about the (I think I have this right) American special forces soldier who escapes his imprisonment because reasons, defeats the demons in the immediate area, frees all the other soldiers in the area, and organizes a resistance in Hell. Am I remembering that right? If so, it really felt like the author saying "Let the awesome commence!" without worrying to much about whether or not it made a smidgen of sense. (For the record, underequipped special forces resistance fighters in Hell /is/ awesome, and I would have really enjoyed it if it hadn't shattered my SOD so thoroughly right at the beginning.)

***** There's some 'fun' where Memnon slaughters groups of humans wholesale, earlier on. Before the Tinfoil Hats are spread to the soldiers, the demons can still become invisible, make the soldiers see their comrades as demons, or just turn their world into blankness with bits of illusion.Most don't bother, because they're used to being invincible, but they learn fast. If it wasn't for the children (demon kids 'cyberbully' people into insanity), the demons might have won the war. The people in tanks and planes were fine, but soldiers would have died in droves.

Also, they do have powers beyond mortal imagination... as given in the Bible. They shoot ball lightning from tridents... but it doesn't work on tanks with hardening ('iron chariots' made God Himself flee in the Bible). Tinfoil hats protect from complete possession, portal-homing on nephilim, and disguises. An angel survives a tank-killing canister blast, and is finished by machine guns... but the angel had demonstrated telekinetic abilities. If he hadn't been taken by surprise, he might have killed that group. This was early in the first book, and is an example of why, when Heaven was finally open, humans immediately launched the nuclear bombs.

Overall, the demons/angels are much much stronger than humans, even with guns. It's artillery and tanks that they don't have answers to, and they might have won in a massive guerilla war if they hadn't used the basic strategy of 'attack,' with heralds and a massive portal. Because they remained true to the source material, however, they ended up with a united, aware foe. With the really religious people obeying the order to kill themselves, they faced humanity as a whole, with technological adaptability they couldn't match.

"Why is there no dramatic tension. There is a complete lack of comflict. From the beginning, it was readily apparent that the demons were going to be smashed to a pulp. It's sort of akin to writing a story about a man clubbing a seal pup to death.?

This whole "no conflict" complaint doesn't hold water on close examination. The conflict's there, it just isn't the obvious one. I think the objection to "lack of conflict" is based on people's expectation that the daemons are super-beings when any reasonable examination of the circumstances shows they are not. Simple question, how does a bronze-age army beat a modern mechanized army? Simple answer, they can't. In a straight firefight, its all over as soon as it starts. There is also a presumption that "superpowers = invincibility", that is that the possession of abnormal powers renders the bearer all-powerful compared with regular humans. In the Salvation War, its shown the the */military/* significance of powers like throwing lightning bolts, being able to breath fire or fly is inconsequential.

The real conflict is between the ways people think; those who take things at face value and those who do not. Those who accept that something is and those who ask why? The book is full of conflict on many, many levels other than the obvious one. The investigation of the daemon's abilities is another version of conflict, it demonstrates that the humans don't throw up their arms and cry "magic" the way the daemons do when faced with something they don't understand, they watch, study and investigate, find clues and form theories that get progressively more accurate until the problem is solved. The whole story is about much more important things that who wins a battle.

The Salvation War is predictable only in the sense that the end is reasonably obvious as it is in most fiction. We know Sherlock Holmes will solve the mystery, we know that the cops in a TV show will catch the bad guy eventually. In fact in a good half of TV cop shows, the villain is revealed in the first five minutes; it's how he gets caught that's the real story. We know humans will win in Armageddon; given the circumstances they can hardly help but do so. The story is actually about the people who take part, just as it is in every story. Why invest in such a story? Why make Tora Tora Tora, the film about the attack on Pearl Harbor - do you seriously believe that people go to see that film not knowing that the US Fleet is about to get sunk? Or go to see "Midway" and not know the Japanese carriers are going to get sunk? Of course not, people got to see a story that is centered around the people who take part, just as The Salvation War is centered around the people who take part. The story is centered on the people who deal with that, how they cope with the knowledge that (on one side) there's a whole new field of science opening up and (on the other) that everything they believed about what and how they worked is false.

"how did this story get started"

The question came up on SDN, what would happen if irrefutable proof came up that the whole human race was condemned to hell and always had been. That hope of salvation was a myth? The general consensus was tha humanity would fight, if for no other reason than its better to go down fighting than just lay down and die. Also, if they can interact with us, we must be able to interact with them - all we need to do is find out how. At that point, reading the thread, I got interested and started to think on how we would fight back (I'm a professional military analyst). Reading up on how daemons were supposed to fight and what they had to fight with, it resolved into "we can do that" , "we can do that", "they can't do that", "they wouldn't even understand how we did that". It quickly became apparent that daemons as described in the appropriate mythology don't stand a hope in hell against us. The phrase "hope in hell" set a light off in my head and so The Salvation War started. It caught on.

The thing to think about here is this. Virtually all our military advances have taken placed in the last few years. Taking a human lifetime as the traditional three score years and ten, one human lifetime takes us back to 1939. At that time battleships still ruled the sea, the best fighters were 300mph aircraft armed with machine guns. Armies were still virtually all infantry that walked around armed with bolt-action rifles. Armored warfare and so on were untried concepts. At best, they could fight the daemon hordes on roughly even terms. Go back another human lifetime and we're in 1870. No aircraft, wooden warships powered by sails (if the crew are lucky, with steam assistance) and armed with smoothbore muzzle-loading cannon form the bulk of the world's navies. Most armies have muzzle-loading muskets and smooth-bore direct line-of-sight artillery. The Daemons will walk all over them. Back when the mythologies were written, those authoring them gave the daemons the most frightful weapons they could imagine. To us, now, those weapons are jokes, pathetic and feeble things that we can virtually ignore while we slaughter those who carry them with almost impunity. And we've gone from there to here in two human lifetimes. What will humanity's weaponry look like in another two lifetimes? The very thought should be terrifying.

Nearly all of Armageddon??? is about the people involved and how they adapt to what is happening around/to them. Even the scenes set in battle are focussed on the people and the weapons are described only in terms of what they do to people. The daemons are the most affected, primarily because they are the ones faced with the unimaginable. As humans, we don't need to imagine what salvo rocket launchers, nerve gas, high explosives, landmines, rifle bullets etc do to their victims because we know. We do it to each other all the time. To somebody with a bronze age mindset, its horrible and unimaginable. Something completely unknown and beyond any form of understanding. Most of Armageddon is about the Daemons coming to grips with that and what it means. The humans end the story much as they started, just sickened by the slaughter they're inflicting yet grimly determined to keep on inflicting it until their enemy (no longer Daemons) gives up. The daemons change incredibly, read how Memnon enters the story and how he leaves it. He's gone through an epiphany and he's done a heelfaceturn. Once a creature of horrific evil, he's seen where that leads and is seeking a different path - as is the whole of Hell itself.

The fighting sections of the book (actually about a third of the total) do two things, one is to provide the impetus for the character development, the other is to tell people what weapons do to their victims. Amateurs are all too free with their recommendations to use weapons (eg "Stop illegal immigration by setting minefields along the border") without understanding what those weapons do. So, I tried to make it clear that weapon effects aren't nice neat little clean departures but a hideously brutal and cataclysmic way to die. There is a very good reason why most people on a battlefield die screaming. People say 'war is hell", Armageddon makes it clear its far worse than that. The way humans kill their enemies fills daemons with terror, that's worth thinking about as well.

****** Part of the fun of the story is actually rooting for the underdogs... which means the demons and angels. The legions of hell have 40 million demons (compared to the one or two million in WW1&2 armies), all of whom are immune to small arms fire (while redefining "small arms"). But they're using medieval tactics against humans using artillery and missiles. Watching them drop "kill the messenger" habits like a hot skillet and reaching for "spread out, find cover, and close when possible with the squishy humans" is actually awesome to see. Michael's plans are also interesting.

Yes, the antagonists are the 'rational' ones, in that we watch them work through the problems and find the intelligent solutions. Humans have the advantage of having /already done so-/ which is why Belial getting away constantly is so terrifying. Having the answers and rallying these superhuman beings - just after the economy is pushed to collapse- is a terrifying premise for book 3 humanity to deal with. A shame it will never be written.

​

And so, an example of adaptation:

Abigor thought the information over. He had to change plans, his original was an open invitation to a massacre by the human mages. His mind mulled the information over. His original front was over a mile long with the ranks extending almost two miles backwards. If he lined his legions up in single row, they would form a front almost five miles long. His mind chewed away, the human magic slaughtered by area, why stop at lining up his legions side by side. There was no need for the legions to maintain their block, 81 ranks deep. Suppose each Legion formed three blocks 27 ranks deep? And those blocks were lines side by side? Why, that meant a front approaching 15 miles wide! Abigor stared at his map, with a front like that, he could extend beyond the range of the human mages and their magic, envelop their flanks and roll them up. It was brilliant. It was also, of course against every concept of demonic warfare. Battles were decided by massive blows aimed at the center of the enemy force, the two masses colliding and slugging it out. This idea of thinning his lines and enveloping the enemy was, wrong somehow. Yet the humans were wrong, they didn't fight like warriors, they lacked the spirit to close in to hand-to-hand combat range. That hadn't always been the case, there had been examples in the past when humans fought demons hand-to hand. They'd always lost of course.

He wrote the new orders down on parchment and then added another thought. The enemy mages had to be on that ridgeline. If they could be prevented from casting their spells, that would be a major part of the enemy's defense gone. So he added another line, ordering all the infantry to keep firing their tridents as rapidly as they could recharge them. It didn't matter if they hit anything, just to keep that ridge crest under continuous fire. Then, he turned his attention back to the flier still cowering in a corner.

​

Also:

​

Abigor stared at the frozen image of the burning city. For a while he was completely certain that the humans would defeat Satan, but now he was not so sure. Old traditions were being discarded, the once unthinkable was being considered. The humans had given hell an object lesson in how efficiently war could be conducted when one made decisions purely on the basis of effectiveness, not honor, politics, auspiciousness or tradition. How fast could hell learn?

****** If "why is there no comflict [sic]" actually makes it into the FAQ for your story, you did something wrong.

It's been a very long time since I read the story. I'm pretty sure I slogged through the entire first book, because I remember being bored and annoyed but not wanting to give up. It was a fascinating premise, even if I didn't like the execution. Regardless, perhaps I'm misremembering or forgetting something and the story was far more creative and nuanced than I recall. Still, I couldn't tell you the name of a single character, or describe any of them in more detail than "special forces guy who broke free in Hell because reasons."

The Salvation War was basically the same premise as the Posleen War that John Ringo did as part of his "Legacy of the Aldenata" series: "Alien species shows up and starts trying to kill all the humans. They are physically superior to humans and have superhuman weapons, but no military skill. How do humans survive?" It's been a long time since I read those books, but I can write paragraphs about Cally, Mike, and the other characters.

Say what you will about the intent of The Salvation War, it didn't work. It sounds like the author (you? It's not completely clear to me), had some interesting concepts in mind when they sat down to write, but those concepts didn't make it onto the page. Like I said, I don't remember the books enough to comment...did the viewpoint jump around so that the reader didn't have a chance to bond with any particular character? Was there simply too much focus on the shooty bits and not enough on the off-field stuff? Did everything exist to propel the story, or were there casual bits of relationship-building onscreen as well? Was significant time spent on the social impact of knowing that Hell was real and your family really were being tortured forever?

Whatever it might be, I have yet to meet a person other than yourself who says "Oh, The Salvation War was a brilliant analysis of the human condition, with a supernatural war story as the framing device."

******* Not what I said, and no, I'm not the author.

I've been a bit bored, and then I went and actually reread the Salvation War. I thought I'd provide a few examples of what I was talking about.

Overall, TSW is like Sword Art Online. The 'heroes' are overpowered, the plot can be simplistic. But there's something there that's worth seeing. In SAO, it's the basic idea that's explored (not much beyond that, sadly.)

In TSW, Michael is genuinely interesting to watch, and it was nice to see the author work to accurately describe weapon effects to people who want to see them because they're 'cool.' Honestly, though, I'll admit that the human perspective is boring. It's why I keep rooting for the demons, honestly.

Anyway. Sorry for dragging this out. I'm trying to get myself to continue a story I started writing, and I keep poking at things in the hope I'll get my muse back. So far, nada, so...

Yeah.
