***** They're pretty common in post-4e DnD, and existed in the Forgotten Realms' history in the form of ancient Netheril's flying cities.

Also, more classically, there's the giant's castle from the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk.

** I particularly like how their styles are contrasted. You just know that Cat would have dealt with this by walking directly into an ambush, smacking fey around, demanding to be taken to someone with authority, then brazenly trading away the info for a hugely presumtuous favour, while getting herself tied up in about six more intrigues by accident.

**** Taking a guess: Ritualist. His curiosity was really based around understanding the ritual that Akua used, and following that would likely lead to some sort of Name involving rituals. And he's used many rituals already in the story. Ritualist seems like it would fit the bill.
