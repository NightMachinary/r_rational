Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have just discovered that there is a pre-selection rule wherein all futures where you die never exist in the first place. Besides the nice fact that you can't die and will receive some form of immortality at some point and entropy will be solved eventually, how do you exploit this for your own gain and preferences?

*** This one is a bit tricky because you want to avoid comparing the relative probability of e.g. (wins the lottery and apparatus works correctly) and (doesn't win lottery and apparatus malfunctions in a way that injures you permanently or leaves you braindead but technically alive).

I'm not entirely convinced there is a non-dangerous way to get data leakage here, considering you don't get any prevention of those things. Been puzzling it out for a while.

Best recommendation I have is to deliberately weaken your physical constitution so that things are less and less likely to leave you in the states where you're terribly handicapped but not dead. Something that tries to kill you if your IQ drops below some number would not be out of place, and dead man switches that try to murder you would also be a good safeguard against lack of substantial agency.

**** I find it difficult to conceive of an explosive collar failing in a crippling but nonlethal way, but the odds may be higher than effectively zero, which would be very very bad. The odds of the device failing entirely and simply not activating, on the other hand, would probably be much higher (but possibly reducible with good engineering), which would limit your ability to manipulate probability.

***** I guess it depends on how you obtained the explosive collar, but if it's filled with some sort of explosive substance, it could be possible that whoever gave you the material mixed it with fake explosives so that it's actually a much weaker bomb than you expected. (Or if you made it yourself, your process somehow malfunctioned and gave you weaker explosives) If you somehow tested it by exploding a random sample, it could be (although very unlikely) that the random sample you picked was the best of the bunch and not indicative of the average quality.

Or maybe it just randomly explodes in a way that sends most of the force outwards instead of inwards, I don't know much about explosives.

Regardless, if it ends up being a lot less powerful than you expected it might just injure your spinal cord and leave you paralyzed from the neck down.

Whatever good engineering techniques you used would have to have a rate of failure smaller than whatever probability you were trying to exploit. If you want one in a million odds to happen, you need a method that produces collars with significantly less than one in a million failures. Even if there were such a method you couldn't know because you would need to test more than a million collars to measure with such precision.

*** My first thought would be to do some kind of daredevil stunts for money... but then I realized that not dying is a lot different than having a good quality of life.

So it's entirely possible that something could happen to you that won't kill you, but might paralyze you from the neck down or something similarly debilitating.

So if you're going to use this knowledge to take risks, you ideally want to find something that is likely to kill you, but not likely to damage you in an irreparable way.

Unfortunately I'm having a very hard time coming up with something that could likely kill me, but won't have any negative effects on my quality of life.

The best I can think of is perhaps infecting myself with HIV or some other dangerous virus to see if I have an immunity... but again the price for being wrong is potentially living for all eternity with some disease that perhaps makes your life miserable.

It may just be a lack of imagination on my part, but it seems to me that the only safe way to use eternity to your advantage is to be frugal and acquire wealth overtime and do everything in your power to ensure that you're safe and healthy.

*** The first and biggest question here is what causes timelines to diverge? Or rather, what factor results in the question of one out of two timelines surviving even being possible? From your setup, it appears of the form that making choices branches timelines, but then we have a different perspective:

If all choices I can make are made, and all the ones that do not result in my death exist, what sorts of things go on in the timelines which are still alive? Keep in mind, from this perspective I've made every /conceivable/ choice from the most wild and reckless to the most mundane and uninteresting. The only consistent thing about my actions is that I don't die from them. So there's a timeline where I take a flight to Russia, grab a gun, and invade as a one-man-army. If it's even theoretically possible that I carry it through without dying, there's a timeline where exactly that happened. I don't know /why/ I'd invade Russia on my own, but by the nature of branching timelines I end up deciding to anyways.

But, if we're talking about reasonable actions, ones that more fit what I'd know about myself... well, basically I can do anything with a high chance of dying and see it through. Now, I don't /normally/ find myself in situations where dying is any possibility, so I'd have to find those myself.

I'm not sure precommitting to anything would help, since the nature of the timelines mean that I'd choose not to kill myself as often as the timelines where I kill myself, which never happened. I mean, I think I'd still /try/ it, and there would be all sorts of timelines where it appears to work and timelines where it didn't work, I decided not to kill myself, and end up in jail or with both legs broken at the bottom of a cliff or something.

But then again, this is just a slight limiter on the perspective in which every possible event happens. We're already dealing with timelines where I turn communist and manage to depopulate Australia and ones where I get a job in economics and retire safely and happily. The butterfly effect means that slight divergences in the timelines create significant differences years down the line, so it's sort of like Murphy's Law, extended. Everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong. Everything that can go right, has gone right. Everything that can go nonsensical, has gone nonsensical. Everything has happened and almost no event except me dying has been spared.

** You exist in a near futuristic society where there are 'mods' which allows you to modify your appearance into nearly anything. The only restrictions is that you can't change your appearance into something that doesn't follow the human body plan: Bipedal, skeletal structure has to be the same, and joints have to bend in the same direction. You can only change the appearance, not your abilities to do something, so you won't be any stronger or more flexible.

The mods are about to come out in several days and the first few mods will be free to use for each person. There is a challenge to come up with the most memorable appearance you can and whoever wins will have a unlimited lifetime supply of mods. The winner is determined by the person who was the most memorable. There isn't any voting, people will simply be quizzed on who they still remember a few days to weeks or months later. Whoever is the most unique and have the most people remembering him/her will win. You want to win. How will you come up with the best appearance?

Side challenges: how would you sabotage someone else, and what would you do with unlimited mods?

Not sure if this counts as changing my "skeletal structure", but a detachable body part could have a similar effect if timed right in the middle of a live broadcast.

One thing that definitely /doesn't/ alter the skeletal structure is a big ol' hole in the torso. You could probably do something exceptionally gross with that.

** What are the questions a rational character needs to ask in order to recognize an exploitable system? In politics? In finance? The problem is that most realistic systems aren't 'munckinable'.

*** Most systems are exploitable, it's just that most exploits are already publicly known, hard to replicate or somewhat unethical. The somewhat unethical ones generally involve profiting off someone else's lack of intelligence, knowledge or inherent bias e.g Scams, Gambling, Addictive micro-transactions, marketing and so on.

**** Also it depends on how strong of an advantage is considered an "exploit". For example, if someone discovers that a certain good is cheap in own town and expensive in another, he can "exploit" this by buying it in the cheap town, carrying over to the other town, and then selling it for a higher price. But this requires the effort of loading up a cart and traveling back and forth, which we eventually call a job and label him as a "merchant". Is he actually munchkining the world? Or is he just providing a service in exchange for money? It probably depends on how much he's actually profiting compared to the effort. If he's making a reasonable average person's wage then it's probably just a job, but if he's making money 100 times faster than everyone else then we might consider him a munchkin.

***** There are plenty of legal ways to exploit people. They generally work by exploiting a persons biases or lack of knowledge to get them to value certain things more than should until they wise up or taking other measures to distort the market.

On reddit there are people that make money by buying goods cheaply over aliexpress and reselling them on ebay or other online stores at a markup. They are exploiting a market inefficiency. The more people who use this strategy the less profitable it becomes because an increased supply of those goods on E-bay will lower prices.

As an aside stuff like the above on a larger scale can cause a colossal financial mess. If a lot of people see an exploit like that at the same time, it can occur that people take out loans to use it only to find that when it comes time to profit the market has corrected itself, they default on the loans and then there can be a massive financial problem.

- Vague definitions
- Unspecified quantities
- Math mistakes
- Legal mistakes
- Arrogance of the opponents (One needs to understand the system much better than its average user)
- Difference between needs of the system and its requirements.
