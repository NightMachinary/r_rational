Sorry guys. Due to a silly accident, the file with the post got deleted. Since I don't have the time today to recreate it, I won't be able to make the post until tomorrow.

Hence, this post won't be going up until Tuesday...unless someone else wants to do it in my place?

Sorry and thanks for understanding!


** No worries, looking forward to tomorrorw! Just a tip aside, you can use plugins for your browser to backup the content of any text field so you can recover it if you accidentally delete it / close the site / refresh etc. An example for that is [[http://www.maketecheasier.com/backup-restore-forms-in-chrome-firefox/][Lazarus]] and I have to say this really saved me some troubles from time to time.

*** Thanks for the advice, but what happened was that I was deleting a lot of old junk files (mostly silly essays I've written in high school), and I accidentally deleted the wrong file and didn't realize until after I dumped out the recycle bin.

Think Lazarus can prevent human stupidity?

**** Recuva might not be able to prevent your stupidity, but it can rectify it.

It's rectified my stupidity on many an occasion.

*** Eh it's frustrating, but I've had worse happen before. Once I accidentally lost an entire ten page essay I was working on and stayed up all night to recreate it for my college writing class. I got a B on that paper and ever since then I've been able to stay calm about losing my work by telling myself that it could have had another nine pages for me to rewrite in 12 hours.

** Is there a way to get prompts about these discussions outside of following [[/r/rational]] closely? RSS feed maybe, or dedicated subreddit?

*** It's not perfect but you can use an online rss filter and just filter the [[/r/rational]] feed for =geb= and =discussion=: [[http://feedsifter.com/?f=http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/.rss&GEB,+Discussion]]
