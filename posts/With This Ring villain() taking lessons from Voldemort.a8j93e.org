** I have largely enjoyed with this ring. There's a lot of good stuff and rational usage of powers and the smug 'all according to keikaku'-SI masturbation is within tolerable parameters. I find it a little weird that the MC keeps refusing power for no apparent reason but I can attribute that to a plausible character trait.

I'm not sure what you mean. The Paragon timeline decided against using Venom Buster, but I think the Renegade timeline makes it clear that that would not have been a simple upgrade; it would be a shift of direction.

He recently integrated a bunch of demon magic into his soul, which would have allowed him to wield demonic magic (unlike earthly magic, which he doesn't have the right arcane bits to use), opening up new opportunities. However, given the clear emotional and mental drawbacks, I think ditching it at the first opportunity was entirely understandable.

OTOH, he has collected a whole bunch of mundane and arcane technology. His power armour has phase shifting, invisibility, kinetic barriers, alchemical healing potions, and harnesses for several arcane rifles and a god-killer sword. He has specialised ammunition for fighting magic users, demons, force fields, or for non-lethal attacks. Not to mention the variety of constructs he uses.

I'm not sure what kind of power he's refusing?

It has been fairly "...?" in terms of what we should care about, yeah. A lot of things that feel like the time-wasty sort of filler. The story is currently on his second Christmas in the Earth 16 universe, fwiw.

I'm mostly wondering if that bit of foreshadowing involving the Indigo Lanterns will ever be followed up on.

We have gotten the JL members' thoughts on the Nabu situation, for the most part. They're pretty spread out, though.

****** I mean, yeah. So the main character keeps getting more powerful but what compelling conflict causes you to want to read the story? Spacebattles has a hundred power wank fics with no conflict, what makes one want to read this one? The pattern is typically : SI gets inserted into some world of fiction, usually worm. SI has an absurdly broken power that is good from the start. SI in secret builds an ever vaster empire and has no meaningful setbacks. Author quits the story.

******* Which is not really how with this ring works or what it is about. It is almost never about Paul trying to win some fight. He almost always has a trump card which we learned from the after action report with ophidichan -- that wasn't even his last resort if aliens we're about to wipe out earth.

His concerns are larger. Usually winning fights within some parameters say no civilian casualties and convincing the opponent their philosophy is flawed.

But I think the real wtr idea is that super powers aren't being applied properly. That if the super tech was being used right humanity would be uplifted. The pieces where he talks to the Belle reve prisoners are a great example esp Leonard snart. Snart could have made millions fixing global warming bit he Rob's banks -- poorly. And that's what makes this chapter so interesting. We find out that some angelic(?) Entity has been deliberately stopping Earth's tech level from increasing which is exactly opposed to Paul.

I don't remember this part. But yeah, finding out the cause of the absurdity of comic tech levels would be interesting. Since, you know, they don't obey anything like the rules in our universe. Where Tony Stark and Batman can develop in secret absurdly advanced tech only other supervillains can access, instead of every major government. That the batmobile doesn't just fail to work from 100 different software bugs that would never be found in testing on just 1 prototype and however many coders you could have working in total secrecy.

*********** I mean you read a few million words of this author to get that far and you decided he was going to fuck it all up there? You got through the almost a threesome, the Kon romance, the maybe hitting on zatarra, the part where everything turns into a Greek play and that is what gave you pause? Zoat is not afraid to experiment with things that might annoy the readers which is a p big deal compared to most authors and fics I've read. He's developed something that makes me stick around for the Long haul.

In any case, I get the feeling you don't read a lot of fic and that's ok. But for an author that you like, if they're good, they'll make it easy to understand what the characters are. Zoat helpfully provides links to comic books in many chapters when introducing new characters. I've learned more about DC from him than in the shows I've watched. But if you are getting started in the fic hobby you might want to give fics where you trust the author but don't know the fandom a chance. That's how I got into Naruto stuff. I had watched the show but not that far. I read enough fic to understand what happens for the rest of the plot. And it opened the door to more fic and more crossovers.

***** Making a super strength/speed army introduces significant personnel management problems. How do you ensure that they're all loyal, and what do you do if they aren't? Unless he wants to spend all his time working with them - and he wouldn't, because an army like that, while useful, is hardly a solution to every problem in existence - then that would not have good ROI. And he already has an army of Orange Lanterns, which are much more versatile.

Lex Luthor is much more important to an uplift project than a super-scientist is. Yes, science is important, but DC Earth has already invented loads of tech that just needs distribution, and for that, you want a top businessman. The areas that really need new research are usually centered around magic, and both Paragon and Renegade /do/ bring experts on board for that.

And I don't understand the reference to his Lantern Corps. In both timelines, he certainly is actively involved in leading them - not micromanaging, but he's there for them, and he makes sure that they're doing what he wants done.

More serious transhumanism, for one. He's making slow changes, but he's being a lot more conservative with it than I would. I mean, he's still got nearly baseline human cognitive capabilities! If I were in his position, I'd be spending nearly all my free time on (ring aided) research into human neuroanatomy and cognition, so that I could safely re engineer my brain piece-by-piece to become a superintelligence. Really, no matter WHAT your goals are, that's a sensible decision, since being more intelligent will help you achieve them.

From a Doylist perspective, it makes total sense he wouldn't do so, since writing a superintelligence well is nearly impossible without being a superintelligence yourself. And from a Watsonian perspective, I can write it off as him just being much more afraid of who he is changing than I am. But it's certainly not the choice I'd have made, especially now that he has a soul.

***** Wouldn't a rushed approach to granting yourself super-intelligence have similar risks to a rushed artificial intelligence?

What would happen to your body if you artificially increased your muscle mass without altering anything else - bone density, connective tissue, blood volume, lung capacity? Now consider what is likely to happen if you increase your cognitive speed without changing anything else about your thought processes.

The SI has improved baseline memory (perfect memory while actually wearing his rings), a high tolerance for temporary ring-accelerated perception (mostly for combat), and I think the author has indicated that he's gradually and mostly unconsciously accumulating small refinements. But he's already surrounded by people with stratospheric IQs, and yet Reed Richards remains Useless.

It's the application that's needed, and for that, he needs to be good at using his rings (for transport and construction and transmutation and self-defence), he needs to connect with the right people and get them on board and talking to each other. And that's where he has spent his time. Investing time in improving his brain is less of a priority when he can make a truce with the Sivana family, outright recruit Vril Dox, and get Captain Cold to be non-hostile and on a path vaguely in the direction of rehabilitation.

****** Improved intelligence helps with more than just inventing shit. Reed Richards is Useless only applies thanks to Boss Smiley, we now know, and Paul would be more effective at just about everything if he were smarter. If nothing else (and there'd be a LOT else), he's be much more effective with his ring. Vril Dox managed to use his ring to recreate the functionality of a boom tube on his FIRST DAY ACTUALLY USING IT, IIRC. Now, Paul has little need for boom tubes thanks to his gimmeporting, but that's almost certainly just the tip of the iceberg of what could be done if were intelligent enough to do so. Also, I see no evidence that improving his raw processing power would be in any way dangerous, and if it is, he can just undo it. Besides, I DID say to spend time doing research into neuroanatomy and cognition first; sure, it'd take time upfront, but it'd save him time in the long run, and while early on I could see him not wanting it strongly enough to be able to use his ring to aid the efforts, that should have long since ceased to be a problem thanks to his orange enlightenment and 'want the ends, want the means' mode of operations.

And I'm not even saying to jump into everything all at once. He STILL hasn't even done that amygdala upgrade that we know by now is quite safe. He could at least reach peak human intellect. He's passively making small improvements, sure, but he's spent two years there now; that's enough time that he could have much more than minor improvements if he put even a tiny amount of effort into it.

Besides, he hasn't been afraid to fuck around with his mind in NON-enhancing ways, like lowering his testosterone production way back when (sure, he eventually turned it back up after realizing his mistake, but it proves that he's not actually that afraid of tampering with his mind, just of actually improving it for some reason).

The thing is, he doesn't necessarily have to make /himself/ smarter. He's operating in a comic book universe, where there are people around whose innate genius cannot readily be replicated, but a power ring can do a lot with the fruits of that genius.

He gets much better ROI by focusing his efforts on recruiting these people, rather than doing a half-baked job of imitating them. There's no way that 18 months of study could have given him enough insight to bring his intellect up to the level of, say, Dr Thaddeus Sivana Sr. And if he had focused all his efforts on /trying/ to do that, then he would have missed his chance to build a working relationship with the Sivanas.

Yes, Vril Dox was able to create a prototype boom tube with his ring. And /because the SI has Vril Dox on board, he doesn't have to work that out for himself/. He can let Dox do it, because Dox is much better suited to the job. And once Dox has worked out the details, that information can be distributed to everyone's rings, and everyone will reap the benefits. Meanwhile, if the SI had been focused primarily on enhancing his own intelligence, then Dox would still be sitting in prison being illegally studied.

And there's a lot more low-hanging fruit yet. After recent events, he may well be able to recruit Zauriel and thus greatly advance his magical research. Research that he wouldn't be good at himself, no matter how smart he is, because his soul structure isn't right to use the local magic.

Of course, being smarter /is/ useful. And if one of the many hypercognitives comes up with a safe and reliable enhancement method, /then/ I'd expect him to take it, and I'd be disappointed if he were too timid.
