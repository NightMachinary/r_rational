For those of you who've never heard of it (because I just made up the term), an Oath system is a universal law of the universe, in which characters can swear an Oath to do, or to never do, something, and if they break it, something else happens.

When an Oath is taken, anyone watching can easily see that the Oath is legitimate (no pretending to take an Oath; everyone will know when you take one). The 'tell' for an Oath coming into existence is unable to be replicated by means other than taking an Oath.

Taking an Oath doesn't mean that what you swore to do will be done, it means that there are now set consequences to breaking it. These consequences are set when the Oath is made; an Oath without consequences cannot exist, it won't be considered an Oath by whatever law dictates Oaths.

The particulars of the Oath require agreement from those they bind if they are someone other than the one taking the Oath. Someone may make an Oath that their friend will do something, and the Oath will take if the friend agrees to the Oath. Similarly, if something that doesn't belong to you is offered up in consequence in the Oath, it requires agreement from the owner of that something. The person being asked for agreement will know the full terms of the Oath before they can agree. If the thing offered as consequence is owned by no one, the Oath will not take.

So that's all that I have as to the laws of this system. Any ideas as to the sorts of situations this would produce, and how you'd go about exploiting the system?


** Is oath magic new, or old? Because this makes an enormous difference.

If oath magic has been a part of the setting for a long time, it will have been woven into the fabric of society on a bone deep level, and have utterly transformed it, because this is the kind of thing that allows you to eliminate the agent problem.

Agents of the law will be utterly incorruptible - and perfectly trusted.

Merchants will be non-deceptive, and known to be so, and so on and so forth, because everyone will be using standardized oaths that have been long codified and shown to be abuse and loophole free over the course of centuries.

This also limits munchkinism rather severely, because people will be very, very skeptical of any new oath that isn't in the Codex of Duly Tested, Examined, and Approved Oaths. No oathing to tell the truth and then being technically truthy to get away with shit - if you want to establish trustworthyness magically, you take either the Witness, Judge, Trader, or Enforcers oaths of Not Deceiving People, and those are all darn bulletproof.

If it's new, people will be making up their own oaths and everything will be a clusterfuck because they get it wrong.

*** It's quite old, but in the setting it doesn't make much difference. An Oath is a great tool for building trust, and it's useful for merchants, but it loses it's effectiveness when it comes to the ruling class.

The magic system in this setting allows for people to train to a ridiculous height. People can become so strong such that an entire army of people at a lower level can't hope to scratch them. Now, consider that the Oath magic had to be new at some point. The people running the country are going to be the strongest individuals (power gives resources, everyone wants resources for further advancing their magic, large amounts of treachery pre-Oath, ergo the people at the top got there by the sword and stay there with their newly acquired resources) and the people a little lower the totem pole are still going to be strong. They're not going to want to swear Oaths giving away their ability to deceive, to struggle for power. After all, if you reach a high enough level, you can live forever. The people who swear they will never do no wrong are cutting off massive amounts of their own potential for growth. And it's likely they would all band together to avoid making any Oath of the sort, maybe even swearing another Oath to rebel or kill the king's loved ones if they're ever forced to swear an Oath against deceit and the like. So no precedent is set for Oath swearing as a requirement to enter into a position of power, it would never become the tradition and wouldn't be as suspicious if someone didn't swear an Oath upon entering the position.

As for law enforcement, what could swearing an Oath help with there? Criminals can also swear Oaths, making it easy to pass Oaths of truthfulness, by simply Oathing away the memories of the crime. There would be a few more steps once the enforcers get savvy to this, but then there's just a few more steps easily accomplished by Oath. As such, Oaths of truthfulness are nearly worthless after the fact. It's better in-setting to rely on the other branches of magic - scrying, divination, that sort of thing - for anything regarding crimes, because then anyone with knowledge of such things can easily repeat the tests to see if the law enforcement is being truthful or not.

how to put this.. Okay, modern analogy; Law enforcement relies on people trusting the cops. The more trustworthy law enforcement is, the more effective it ultimately is, because people volunteer information to trusted agents of law and order in a way they do not to such agents that are viewed with suspicion.

Cunning is the most reliable way to gain resources to grow stronger, and Oathing away your ability to exploit your position for more resources is a surefire way to hinder your future growth.

So unless the magic rewards corruption /directly/ - Meaning that there are spells that run on the heart of a forsaken child and so on, then no, the witchking isn't weakening his power by forcing his underlings to be paragons. After all, if one underling backstabs another for personal advantage, all the resources invested in the stabbed person go poof, and that's a net loss to the witchking, even if it isnt to the stabber.

There are perverse incentives in this system. For example, I think that in a system where you can just pour battle experience and wealth into minions to strengthen them with no real upper bounds on return to investment, the optimum strategy is to have as few sworn minons as at all practical, so that you can concentrate gold ect into them.

So the sheriff is incorruptible. And tearing across the country side desperately trying to cover an absurdly oversized circuit, dealing out very rapid justice so she can sprint to the next village and investigate a robbery there. Sprint because it's faster than riding after the 5th level of investiture. Horses, after all, die if you push them too hard.

Probably not how everyplace would do things, but at least some places will do this. The starting requirement is a ruler with a secure enough position to kick things off, and enough wisdom to see that it is a good idea.

If they both start at the same level of strength, the one who exploited his position will be stronger than the one who didn't.

Since this is an older magic in the setting, it has been experimented in towards such a direction. But, the other countries, rulers, sects and the like who didn't instigate an Oath block against their members being would expand if they had the chance.

I don't think it would work out that way, here's why:

Imagine two societies, A and B. Society A has the people in positions of power swear oaths, Society B doesn't. People in Society B won't trust their leaders to speak truth or to fulfill their promises.

As a result, a capable knight will prefer to pledge his loyalty to a king from Society A instead of a king from Society B, knowing that the king from Society B might screw him over at any time even if he had been entirely loyal. Society A thus winds up with more knights, more power, more ability to militarily crush Society B.

Likewise, capitalists open up their companies in Society A knowing they have laws that they can depend on - that means lower risk, after all. And the knowledge that the rulers in the society won't just nationalize their companies, which can't be said for Society B's leaders. So capitalists primarily invest in Society A turning Society A into an advanced economy, while Society B is still stuck in medieval stasis. Soon Society A will turn out military technologies, and have such an advantage in productivity, that they would overwhelm Society B.

Likewise, people in general will emigrate from Society B, where they fear for their lives (because the rulers are free to kill anyone at will), to Society A, where the rulers have sworn oaths to abide by rule of law and not kill people wantonly. This results in Society A having a far greater population than Society B, which means a much larger economy and a much larger pool of potential conscripts.

So by the law of evolution of societies, Society A will eventually crush Society B and dominate. Just like in the real world, where nations that have a strong rule of law dominate over ones that don't.

And the power elite, knowing that their nations will become advantaged by using oaths, will take action to not only take oaths themselves, but also ensure that the rest of the people in positions of power do likewise. They don't want to be part of the soon-to-fail Society B, after all.

What this means of course, is that a few centuries after the discovery of Oaths, all major countries will have oath-abiding governments.

This is practically a guarantee. If you create a world with oaths where the leaders /don't/ use oaths, it will be entirely /unbelievable/ in my opinion.

*** Consider that people had to discover the Oaths at some point in time. Upon any king trying to introduce such a system when it isn't the norm, none his subordinates would be too pleased. Since they would have reached their positions through strength and cunning, they would be put off by any king trying to make all of them swear Oaths of fealty to him. They would likely realise that they, themselves, cannot do anything against this king of theirs, but they as a group can. If they all swear Oaths that, if the king tries to make one of them swear an Oath of fealty, they would all kill his loved ones, betray all his secret information to the enemy, etc. Then they just have to tell him about it, and then they're safe to connive their way to the top.

The marriage point probably wouldn't see much use, I think. Look at how people treat getting a prenup in modern society. If you tell your partner that you want to get a prenup before marriage, it's often viewed as a betrayal of trust, "How could you want to make a prenup? Don't you trust me?!" This is likely to be the same in this setting. Sure, some will do it, but a good quantity won't.

***** You have a really good point there. I think it depends more on whether the king's subordinates are sensible or not. If they are, then they can use their new-found knowledge of Oaths to completely negate the king's attempts.

The key is that the king has to move stealthily in that scenario for him to succeed, whereas the subordinates can be as brazen as they want. If the subordinated realise there is a decent chance of their king making them swear Oaths, they can all decide to set up an Oath as a warning system before getting everyone else to do the whole counter-Oath shebang. If they do realise this, and I think they will given the level of cunning I'd attribute to someone who got to their sort of level, then the king will be unable to stealthily Oath enough subordinates to matter. And I think that the king would realise that this would only lead to bad times for him, and refuse to try to Oath all his subordinates. The risks outweigh the rewards.

- Rinse and repeat. Person A can abduct a bunch of people weaker than him, or even have his vassals abduct people, all of whom are weaker than his vassals.
- Once he has enough people, he can have his vassals team up against stronger individuals, forcing them to swear oaths of fealty too.

Since things to be offered as consequence can't be given to multiple people (i.e. if you have an apple, you can't Oath it as consequence to two people. Similarly, you only have one set of memories), this would lead to avid competition among the younger generation to decide who would get the legacy from their strongest elder.

On reflection, it's likely that the more ruthless of families may set up a sort of slavery system, in which they raise a bunch of brainwashed slaves to become powerful warriors for their family. Instil devotion in all the slaves, and it will be magnified when you make them Oath away their skill, memories and the like to the strongest of the group. Repeat with a new generation, and give the older generation's memories to the most outstanding member of the younger. And, from that setup, you end up with a system of increasingly powerful, increasingly devoted slaves who will defend the family to the last. This would make it so that the main family would only have to focus on administration tasks and the like, no need to focus on magic for anything more than the increased lifespan.

No matter if the oath works through “divine intervention” or something like a technologically advanced alien civilisation, it would still mean that the population /has/ to adhere to certain standards and word-definitions and is unable to ignore them. Maybe some countries would choose to ignore the Oath in their legal system or outright outlaw invoking it, but it would still be there, like a weird psychological phenomenon --- if not outright a law of nature.

If the women from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon][Judgment of Solomon]] made an oath setting the penalty as something happening to their supposed son, would that Oath take? If yes, then people are a type of potential property in a moral system that can not be ignored, disputed, or changed. Similar consequences should be expected regarding owning animals of various degrees of intelligence.

Another ultimate litmus test for countries would be whether they require from their politicians, governmental workers, and citizens to take certain kinds of Oaths or not. A standard argument against mandatory Oaths could be made through concept of “free will”. This argument could also be abused to a degree to allow political corruption, nepotism, crime cover-up, etc.

In countries, where citizens are required to take certain Oaths, there would always be the looming risk that an agent from within or without would be able to [[https://torrentfreak.com/eztv-shuts-down-after-hostile-takeover-150518/][hijack]] their entire government by finding a loophole in the currently used version of the mandatory Oath set.

If the Oaths can be used to make someone do something, people would be perceived as functionaries, to a certain degree. An Oath could be arranged this way to make a person be literally unable to stop working on a certain task until they are finished. If a company specialises on this kind of Oaths (let's call it an Oath-factory), it's reasonable to assume that it would care about the health condition of its functionaries because they are a valuable asset to it. The penalty section of a typical Oath used by an Oath-factory would resemble a programming code.

On a personal level, Oaths could be used to improve skills and character, to get rid of bad habits (“I swear to stop wanting to smoke if I break this Oath”), to forget things and maybe to share memories and knowledge with others. Oaths made by amateurs would also be more likely to backfire and cause harm to involved parties.

Near any worker would prefer to go with a competitor who doesn't institute such practices over the factory. They'd have to have one hell of an incentive towards such a job.

Only if the factory has an exclusive technique, spell, or whatever could they be attractive enough for workers.

However, the same doesn't hold true for using WoG to define certain /social/ behaviours (unless [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying][psychological]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy][characteristics]] themselves are what you're changing as a basic aspect). Not only does that defeat the whole purpose of social inquiry, but you also have to consider that your audience will be reading the story while holding certain expectations. They'd expect, for instance, for people in your world to have psychological characteristics similar to people from ours. And if people in your world act differently without any explanation for that difference, at best it would be making your audience frustrated by their illogical actions.

This is the point where you should start to change\broaden your opinion on the matter instead of continuing to bend the world's laws to conform to your opinion.

Especially if the Oath system is not a new phenomenon, there would have been at least some countries in its history which decided to use the Oaths for one reason or another. And at least some of them would've survived to this day because a country without corruption would be much more efficient in going through the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels][technology levels.]] Some of them would've self-eliminated for various reasons (e.g. getting hijacked, having crazy dictators, etc), yes, but as with any kind of evolutionary system, the ones that survived would be the more durable and balanced ones. So: your world would have had at least some powerful countries that have Oath-powered political hierarchies.

  As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there?
#+end_quote

Well, this one you /can/ tweak out to a certain degree depending on how your story's background canvas is painted. For instance: [in your world there is no philosophical analogue to [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.en.html][Free Software Movement]]] → [there are at least some poor strata and countries (safe Oaths for self-improvement are expensive and scarce)] → [they get economically abused by their more developed counterparts]. And akin to how sweatshops are a thing in our worlds, employee-abusive Oath-factories would be a thing in yours.

On the other hand, I'd think that even if /everybody/ had their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][basic needs]] covered, at least some people would find working through an Oath factory more effective. In this case, of course, the factories would be more interested in caring for not only the well-being of their employees but also for their rights.

  any Oath with it's harm as the consequence would require it's permission.
#+end_quote

That still allows a loophole. The age at which someone understands X and is free of outside influence isn't a yes/no thing; people gradually get more and more independent as they age. What's the highest level of dependency that's still independent enough that someone can take an oath? Can a 5 year old or 10 year old take one? Clearly they can never completely understand things like an adult can, but they surely have some understanding. And it obviously wouldn't make sense to say that you can't take an oath unless you have 100% understanding and are under 0 pressure.

  As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there? Near any worker would prefer to go with a competitor who doesn't institute such practices over the factory.
#+end_quote

First, this assumes there are enough jobs at the competitors for everyone who wants one.

Second, the obvious benefits are higher pay and (possibly) the owner's/manager's Oath to treat his workers fairly. Those workers who would work honestly anyway don't have a lot to lose by taking the Oath (assuming it has exceptions for personal emergencies, sickness leave, etc.). The competitors only get those who /aren't/ willing to work honestly and are substantially less effective. They get driven out of business. Now everyone has to work at the oath-factory or nowhere. The Oath might lose those exceptions (perhaps the owner didn't swear an Oath, or was willing to suffer the consequences, or lost/sold the factory to someone else).

** Will Oath-System accept a language of your own invention that uses same words that common language, but have different meanings? Then, when you're giving Oath with witnesses present, you're mentally notifying Oath-System that you're giving it in your own language, in which it means something harmless. If this works, potential implications are endless.

Can consequence include giving up any object to another person? Can this be used to teleport objects? Can you consequence away your dumbness? What about hunger, or thirst? What about waste - unlike previous examples, this is actually your own physical thing, but losing it may be highly advantageous.

Can you consequence away knowledge? Can this be used to induce highly selective amnesia?

Can you use Oath to derive knowledge? For example "I'll now tell the city where my nemesis currently resides, or my left pinky experiences mild pain for 3 seconds. It's City ABC". What is the result of such Oath, assuming you don't know your nemesis whereabouts.

Can Oath be conditional? "If you do anything my son, I'll do my utmost to make you suffer for eternity, or I die." Will you feel this Oath activation when condition is triggered, or when you learn that condition is triggered?

Btw, If Oath can be conditional, it may be possible (I'm not exact expert) to craft "Computational Oath" - sequence of logic that brings some output (in Morse code of weak pains to your pinky, for example) depending on some input. I assume calculator can be done easily enough (at least for some near-immortal superbeing).

*** Most magic systems treat categories that people find useful as primitive categories. Thus you can have magic that can't create food, even though food is pretty similar to non-food, or magic that can turn you into an animal but can't make arbitrary physiological changes.

In line with this, you can't invent your own language and switch the words around, since the average guy in the street will say "that's not a real language", in the same way that you can't say "I will define 'animal X' as 'human being with the genes of the current king'" and use the animal transform spell to turn into the king.

**** Well, would making a kingdom somewhere far from civilization that talks in your "fake" language (and learns all words meaning "nothing", or all words of Common language, as a part of their religion) help with this? Because that's not an impossible feat for immortal being of a godlike power.

And those two examples are somewhat different - usually magic system defines what counts as "animal", but Oaths use natural language defined by humans (unless it works other way in that setting). Will Oath system work for obscure language of a backwater tribe? If it would, how is it different from my example?

** I think Yudkowsky had the right idea on how to balance such a system - namely, it doesn't do anything physically impossible nor does it cause any consequence if it is broken - it simply compels the oath-maker to complete the terms of the oath to the best of their ability.

Still totally munchkinable via tricking rubes into making poorly-considered oaths that effectively make them your perfect slaves.

** If the first person to get access to the oath system is extremely ambitious and somewhat clever I can see this playing out as invasion of the body snatchers. First the "Master" oaths himself to psychologically give up his ability to be deterred from his goals by laziness. Next being super motivated he kidnaps a few powerful people. He forces them to agree at swordpoint to something they can't possibly do, then when they fail they forfeit their ability to desire things other than what aligns with master's will, or through another method they effectively become a thrall of his. Now that Master has forced many powerful people into thralldom they will then go on to kidnap /more/ people to thrall... You get the point, and that's without even getting into the spell's abilities to potentially transfer skills and information, even over great distance.

Basically depending on how things go when oaths are first discovered this could play out like invasion of the body snatchers on roids.

*** That's not how it works. An Oath doesn't guarantee that something will happen, it just provides consequences. If you have a problem with laziness and you take an oath to not be lazy the Oath won't magically cure your laziness, it will just punish you for being lazy.

**** No you missed the point, the /punishment is what i'm talking about/ based on the other comments you can actually set quite a few things as punishment it doesn't just have to kill them. That's why I was clear that the second step is actually to get them to break the contract (by setting it as impossible to uphold) so that you can then exploit the punishment mechanic.

****** You missed the point, the oath can be anything, he can have an oath to not stand on one foot.

The point is that since you can give up lots of things as collateral to the oath it could do more than just kill you if you break it.

If you look at some of the other comment threads it is clear you can give up memories and other aspects of your mind as collateral. So I find that part of the oath system as interesting as the oath itself.

** Capture a guy.

You then have him swear, on penalty of death, to never eat chicken.

You then have him swear to make a sincere effort to capture anyone he believes he can capture without getting caught that he has not previously caught, and have them swear all the oaths he swears today, on penalty of death.

You then have him swear, on penalty of death, to never disclose any of this happened, or why he is attempting to capture people if he is caught in the act.

Release your prisoner.

1. 2. 4. 8. 16... You have released a self replicating oath into the world. In all likelihood, people will be eternally plagued by random kidnappings, and chickens will inherit the earth because damn near nobody eats them.

Of course, that is if you are lucky, and it is merely a ban on chicken that your evil oathificer devises. Probably a loophole in my example here somewhere but you get the gist.

** "I agree to aid any person or people who have also taken this Oath when doing so is substantially more beneficial to them then it is costly to me, and not to harm any person or people who have also taken this oath unless doing so is substantially more beneficial to me then it is harmful to them."

Phrasing could use some work, but hopefully it's good enough to make the point.

Taking this Oath will, on average, be beneficial - the only actions it requires are positive-sum, and the only ones it prohibits are negative sum. (It wouldn't be in your interest to take it if you knew that you would have many easy opportunities to help others but almost never be in a position to receive help, but that's not a usual situation.) If you have taken this Oath, it's in your interest to persuade more people to take it as well.
