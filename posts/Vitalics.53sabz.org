** Disregarding the technical flaws like incorrect and awkward usage of Russian language, I simply don't understand or enjoy the genre. I'm a lowbrow who prefers that the narrative resembles real world rather than fever dreams, I suppose.

As far as Russian snippet goes (using ISO 9 for transliteration):

1. 'bol'šoj' is for masculine grammatical gender, but 'spasibo' is gender neutral; 'bol'šoe' is the correct word here.

2. 'Konečno' sounds very awkward there. A significantly more common polite response is 'Ne za čto'.

*** Maybe the ia was only saying things that the religious guy wanted to hear(since he wanted to "know" that the computer had a " soul") so the ia said things that would convince him that it had a "soul" (and apparently what he expected was depressing bullshit).or the history is just what it seems and its just not very bad but not very good either .

** Thought this was going to go in a different, more interesting direction, when they revealed they were watching videos that their AI made.
