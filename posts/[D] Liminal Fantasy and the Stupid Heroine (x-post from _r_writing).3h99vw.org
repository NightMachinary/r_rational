** The main point of this post might seem obvious to regulars of this sub - that characters with superpowers should apply some common sense to their use and not be limited by the way the plot requires them to be an angsty highschool teenage audience-surrogate.

I think it's interesting that BlondeRJ has felt the frustration of dealing with such idiot characters, and essentially re-derived the rules for writing rational fiction, even though she hasn't been involved in rational/ity/ at all. It shows the universality of what we call "Level 1 intelligence", presenting it as an obvious rule of good writing rather than a specific subgenre.

There's also a few good examples of how a rational character can end up not being a munchkin at all, which is something I haven't seen often.

*** Yeah, I love this post. It goes from rational characters, to rational worldbuilding, to *"Where's the science, people?"* It shows rationalist fiction as a natural extension of rational fiction, and rational fiction as a natural rule for /good writing/, a progression which has been a little headcanon of mine for a little while now. I'll definitely have to check out this person's writing.

And on that note,

Excellent question! Mostly because nobody suggested it via modmail, which is the best way to bring stuff to our attention ;) Added.

  Death Note does this well.
#+end_quote

This is probably nitpicking, but I would say comparatively well. A few of the "rules" of Death Note are made that way only the plot can progress to a certain direction as the author demands it.

In addition, the author of Death Note did not grasp the full ripple effects of his own rules, in that the shinigami eyes are *freaking time machines*.

Example: You have shinigami eyes, you kidnap a homeless person at 7:00 am. You trade a leveraged ETF and will make a lot of money by the end of the day. At the end of the day after the market is closed, you check if your chosen ETF has gone up in prices, if so, kill your homeless guy at 7:00pm, if not kill him at 8:00pm. Earlier, you used your shinigami eyes to see his remaining life span, it was 12 hours, you bought the ETF. Had his life span been 13 hours, you would've shorted the ETF. Either way, money is not important, you just discovered a way to send information back in time up to a few decades.

(Of course /DO NOT MESS WITH TIME/ clause apply in this setting, as the guy could've just died of a heart attack, or a shinigami could've intervened and killed him unexpectedly)

This is not really a criticism of Death Note, it still is one the most rationalist works in anime/manga (though it does have other flaws). I guess I wrote this to illustrate how seeming boring or unimportant rules could be physics-universe shattering. And it takes a certain quality in the author to recognize when it happens - after all not everyone can think of using a time machine to prove P=NP.

*** I don't think that works. It's like playing Newcomb's paradox with transparent boxes: the predictor predicts your actions, but your actions are affected by the prediction. Depending on how your actions are affected by the prediction, this may end up equivalent to the halting problem, where the predictor predicts X if and only if it doesn't. Having the prediction always work is literally impossible.

Considering that it's /already/ known that the lifespan shown by shinigami eyes doesn't count early deathscaused by the death note, it's not too big a stretch that it also might not count early deaths due to the use of other shinigami powers, including death that is causally related to using shinigami eyes.
