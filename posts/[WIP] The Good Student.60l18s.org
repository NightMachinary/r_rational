  the main character's initial goal seems a bit silly to me

I actually disagree! Yes, it's not very lofty or anything, but it's very human and believable. I find it far more reasonable than the MC being that hard working without an unrelated motivation, the way it is in many Royal Road stories.

**** Exactly, I thought it was very believable... It's actually more believable to me than just being ambitious. As a kid, ambition wouldn't have moved me that much but impressing a girl....

** Thanks for posting this. Despite the plot starting out like every cliched South Indian movie ever (rags-to-riches + poor-boy-wins-rich-girl), I find it emotionally compelling. Takes me back to my childhood in South Asia where high school final exams are almost a matter of life and death. The grades one gets in this last exam literally determines the course of ones' life. That part really isn't a fantasy in large parts of the world. And there have been documented cases of dirt poor kids taking the top rank in their state.

** This is actually really good, far better than I expected!

It's a bit of the usual Royal Road fare, but with actual good writing. The plot so far is rather interesting, the characterization very good, the world a little bit generic but also unusual in some interesting ways.

I'm actually really excited to see what comes in the next chapters. So far almost every one has been a treat to read.

** I kinda want to hear a story about a good student who /is/ interested in the truth behind things now.

** Was almost put off at the beginning by it all sounding a bit clinical and robotic in tone, but a little further in and that's becoming characterful rather than feeling like poor narration.

Now it has more of a sense of "Whatever bull this world tries to pull, he's going to casually dissect and dismantle it, by a greater command of the facts".

**** Does seem a little bit implausibly hyper-competent. Especially with relatively weak stated motivation - suspect that most people with little care for truth or academia for their own sake would be quite so /driven/ about the whole thing.

Not up to Ch8 just yet; read the first 4 as a block then took a break.

** Pretty good! Looks like a mix of /Astrovityanka/ and /Mother of Learning/ so far.

**** It's a rationalist (EDIT: rationalist-themed, not really rational because plot-driven) [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0][sci-fi story in Russian]] (sadly, there're no English translation) by Nick Gorkaviy, an astrophysicist who works in NASA.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/21tsox/rthsf_astrovityanka_russian/][I posted about it once]].

It features a girl (who was raised by an AI on a spaceship) and is accepted into rationalist school on the Moon colony, and also a boy who is second to her abilities but madly in love with her.

The pair struggle with politics and also scientific problems, then uses their brains and the AI to win and bring singularity.

The main weakness of the story is wish-fulfillment aspect --- but it's primary audicence is teens, despite there being deep scientific knowledge discussed.
