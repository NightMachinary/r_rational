  *What's your optimistic vision for the future? We want to know.*

  In honor of Earth Day and the future of the planet, The Future of Life Institute is co-sponsoring a [[http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27553][short fiction writing contest]] with Sapiens Plurum. We love the Handmaid's Tale and Black Mirror as much as anyone, but we think the world needs more [[http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27554][utopian fiction]] right now. So we're asking you to write down your vision for the future and share it with us.

  *First Place: $1000 | Second Place: $500 | Third Place $300*

  Each of us contributes to the future, through our work, our creations, our children, even our DNA.Imagine a being or entity that exists in the future because of your existence on Earth today. Is this entity your descendant in a traditional sense? Have beings evolved? Is your "descendant" still biological? Is your "descendant" a grandchild or a clone? Have we merged with technology or uploaded DNA to create new cyber-beings? Is your "descendant" something completely different?

  Things to consider as you write your story: Let the reader see this future world through your eyes. Let us see how people --- whatever that means --- try to live in harmony with the natural world and society, how they maintain their own health and happiness, how they overcome challenges.  But most of all, tell a good story, with characters we care about, setting, conflict, and resolution.

  Your story should be consonant with the Future of Life Institute mission: /Technology is giving life the potential to flourish like never before, or to self-destruct. Let's make a difference;/ and with theSapiens Plurum mission: /to inspire us --- the first species that can intentionally impact its own evolution --- to aspire beyond what was humanly possible/.

  *Submissions due by June 9th, 2019 | No entry fee*

*** 1500-3000 words is still short story territory, albeit on the short end of "short story." [[https://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-goal/improve-my-writing/flash-fiction-faqs][The flash fiction designation is usually reserved for stories that are under 1,500 words]], and it's rare to find flash fiction contests with a with a word limit of more than 1,000 words, with most flash fiction being closer to 100 words than 1,000. If you want to talk about "the flashiest of flash fiction," I'd reserve that for the kind of [[https://twitter.com/ASmallFiction][stories that can fit into tweets]].

**** Yeah, I thought someone would bring up "For sale: baby shoes. Never worn" or similar. I didn't know there was an actual industry standard, to me something under 1500 words isn't really a "work of fiction" in any way but the loosest sense of the word. Like "Yesterday I went to the store and they were out of milk. I was devastated." Story? Yes. Flash fiction? Meh. Guess I'm just being ornery or pedantic or something.

*** Star Trek is kind of utopian: Earth finally has its act together. Countries no longer make war at each other, poverty is obsolete, etc. And freed of those conflicts, humanity explores outer space and gets into trouble there.

Solutions to a current problem often create new problems. Think of modern medicine. On the up side, an infection that used to kill people can be wiped away by a few pills of antibiotics. On the down side, an injury that used to kill someone might become a lifelong coma with a ventilator and feeding tube. "Right to life" wasn't an issue for our ancestors.

***** It doesn't necessarily mean surveillance, it could just show that the neighbors are helpful people who care for their neighbors and notice when someone is unwell, or that the teachers are well paid, trained and on the lookout for children who show signs of home trouble.

There are many ways to improve childcare for kids in trouble without nightmarish surveillance methods.

****** I keep thinking that surveillance is a pivotal piece of what would make a utopia even possible.

​

Why do suburban Americans all want to live in their own enclosed in mini-manors? With backyards and isolated buildings from each other and large collections of firearms?

​

Because they feel they /need/ them. Because they fear, right or wrong, the oppressed descendants of former slaves. They fear their neighbors as well.

​

Well, if we have ubiquitous surveillance - a dense enough carpet of sensors that essentially nowhere a human goes on earth is not covered, except for a few extreme locales, and people can bring their own surveillance nodes to those if they want - combined with machine learning systems to actually /watch/ everyone - these fears could disappear.

​

Why fear your neighbor? Your neighbor doesn't have a gun or deadly weapon, those are now banned and if they ever pick one up they will be immediately arrested. You can send your kids to play without fear - anyone who lays an unlawful hand on them will be tased by a drone in under 60 seconds. Your girlfriend can sunbathe nude in a public park - no one will rape her, again, anyone who tries gets tased immediately.

The police no longer need to carry deadly weapons as no one they come to arrest have any either. For the rare scenarios where it's a response to a suspect armed with a deadly weapon, a drone armed with nonlethal only is sent in instead.

​

You can't steal anything and no one fears theft. If you try to steal something, either you automatically are billed for the item or a drone will come by later to recover the item if it's something you can't afford to pay for.

******* Eh, surveillance is also incredibly dangerous when employed against the people. The primary problem is the same as the one brought up when the Nazis invaded Poland - the only difference between close surveillance and political and ethnical targeting data is the intent of the holder. The Nazis got reliable information on who was Jewish, and very few Jews escaped Poland. The Goverment always has the ability to arrest anyone it wants, what it usually lacks is the information on who it should apprehend. Giving it that information is terrifyingly dangerous.

The surveillance information is at high risk of being leaked or stolen, especially in the hands of massive organizations that have to make it available to a /lot/ of people.

TL;DR A certain combination of power and information is extremely dangerous and should not be given to anyone lest they use it for their own needs, like winning the next election or Hydra's plot from Captain America: Winter Soldier to quell rebellions, neither of which work if they don't have information on who has the opinions they dislike.

Further, I'd argue that similar benefits as the surveillance grants (though not working as swiftly) can be gained simply through robust and well-designed education and incentive systems that encourages citizens to be vigilant and empathic with others, along of course with well-funded child-care and police systems manned by dedicated professionals with training in psychology and deescalation.

You can get a /lot/ closer to utopia simply by taking some of our current societies and adjusting some of the biggest flaws.

** This got me thinking about utopias, and after a first moment where I actually found it hard to even imagine /what/ exactly could sound like a satisfying ideal world that does not sound like a total nightmare to someone else I think I started developing a good potential setting.

The problem is the word limit. 3000 words are very little to weave the necessary world-building into a natural-sounding narrative. It's easy to do by framing everything as, say, a lesson of some sort, but that makes the story basically just an infodump. I'll see if I can think of a quickly resolved conflict that is also representative of the world as a whole, but it's a hard task.
