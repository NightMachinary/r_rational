I posted a few days ago about how I couldn't stand Worm.

I would like to retract most of that.

Having read to the point where Taylor is writing a note to her dad on her mother's grave, I can now say that I am hooked into this setting. Lisa's apparent refusal to break science with her /clearly/ overpowered ability now makes sense, as she was using all of her resources breaking Coil and the universe instead. The imminent disintegration of the PRT makes me happy, and beating Dragon and Assmaster using just a crowd of teenagers was a stroke of brilliance. I was honestly thinking "Welp, Skitter's going to the birdcage. I wonder if she can convince Amy to make her some bugs just for self protection?" when they showed up, but Wildbow saw a way out of there I did /not/ see coming. I really like how Skitter is growing into what she was always meant to be: the super-terrifying Queen of Brockton Bay.

*** I only mildly disliked it. I assumed she was doing stuff like what she had done before the timeskip throughout that period, so once i got past the brief, "wait, what just happened?", i didn't mind it too much.

[[#s][spoiler elaborations]] So it would be hard to write most of it convincingly dangerous at the previous levels. The only exceptions would be class-A and higher threats.

**** Ehhhhh....

I really liked worm. And I also sorta disliked the timeskip. Your mileage may vary.

Since you are enjoying worm, I'd really like to link you to a wallpaper I made for it, but its super spoilery. Ping me when you've finished it and I'll link you!

Edit: Link to spoilery wallpaper incoming. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/2gzqwf/spoilers_dual_monitor_wallpaper_taylor/][Link]]) You have been warned.

******** : ) Glad you like it.

It's dual-screen because that's my desktop setup. My top screen is physically bigger, and the desktop there is visible about half the time so it made sense to make it nice and flashy. It has served to get a friend or two interested in the story. The bottom screen is obscured 99% of the time, and has the biggest spoiler. But it has the strongest impact for me personally. I know some people didn't like how the story ended, but I felt it ended the only way it could and still be moderately satisfying.

***** Personally, I thought the signs were always there- Riddle tries to be sane, but is neurotic and misses obvious stuff at times. He's mostly sane, but little bits have been lost to rituals, not to mention the bhals supification on the mirror, so he's simultaniously more and less rational than an average irrationalist.

********* Neither do I, though i remember reading it and feeling like that was a decent explanation. Riddle definitely takes big risks when smaller would do- why break into azkaban to rescue belatrix when you can plausibly tell harry the secrets yourself, keeping the source secret? Belatrix may be useful, but not worth the risk unless i highly underestimate her value. Why give harry the potential blackmail material, and the leverage?

Yes, having equal blackmail for harry is nice, but not only is it asymetrical- you're the teacher that tricked harry into stealing someone from azkaban, and harry, for all his competence, was an innocent 11 yr old- it's not going to be beneficial for their relationship if that's needed, and voldemort likes his alter ego.

In retrospect, it does feel like voldemort's problem solving methods are reckless, and heedless of consequences- he kills skeeter on a whim, and while it might have paid off, the azkaban breakout revealed far more of his capabilities to harry than anything else.

*********** And yet it was a plan that involved holding the person prohecied to destroy all but a remnant of him beside him while in the middle of an already dangerous mission, and i'm sure there are more effective methods of achieving it. He may not have been able to predict the patronus incident, but he should have been able to predict the risk level, and it's not something i'd gamble with unless i'm fine with returning to my horcruxes, which i would only be if i had more backups that someone would pick up.

instead, I'd take harry legitimately, at least at first, if i could.

He simply didn't know harry all that well, and then he rushed on top of that. he's reckless, even if he wasn't incredibly careless that time.

************ First, he only got trapped in the Horcrux network the first time because they didn't work the way he thought they did, an oversight he had already remedied by adding the Resurrection Stone to the network. His discorporeation would have been a minor setback, at best. Second, he thought he had already satisfied the prophecy by obliviating and horcrux beta'ing Harry, destroying the person he might have become and leaving only the infant body as a shell to carry his own personality.

************* You're right, I'm mistaken. I forgot that he had already fixed it.

He does feel reckless, still. dementor's effects aren't definite, but stealing souls sounds like a horcrux-bypassing death, at least potentially, and there's few levels of reward worth that. He doesn't have anti-oblivate measures, either. If that's the case, though, his death just means he has to start his relationship with harry from scratch. I think he does take bigger risks, but i forgot that he's all but invincible.

Maybe that's why? he felt leaving him with the wand was safer than someone taking it, and either way, death was no great loss- he'd be back shortly.
