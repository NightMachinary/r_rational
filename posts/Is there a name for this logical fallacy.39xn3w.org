** I call that fallacy "inability to read properly". That said, there are many lists of fallacies beginning with Aristotle and continuing to the modern day. All a fallacy does is point out a pattern of incorrect reasoning. So if there is no name for a fallacy, then there is nothing wrong with giving it your own descriptive name. Or you could just use "straw man" since this argument ascribes a position to Carson that he does not actually believe.

In terms of this particular argument, it's often slippery slope.

*** not bad, but this is more of a false-false equivalence: it's falsely accusing someone of a making a false-equivalence.

#+begin_quote
  *False equivalence* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy][logical fallacy]] which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency. It would be the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonym][antonym]] of the mathematical concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_equivalence][material equivalence]].

** To be fair to GLAAD, doesn't it seem fairly obvious that this /is/ the intention of Ben Carson?

There's no particular reason to bring up homosexuality in the same sentence as bestiality and pederasty other than to draw a false equivalence between them. To say "No one can do it, no matter who" should be enough: to specifically name three groups of people whose only shared trait is that they are not heteronormative is a not-so-subtle way to link them in the listener's mind. He could have listed polygamists instead, and the association would have been far less negative, though still "strange" or out of the norm. I don't think it's accidental that he chose groups that would illicit a large amount of disgust in the general population.

As much as I hate the overuse of comparing arguments to the ubiquitous "motte and bailey" structure, this does seem a tried and true method of those against gay marriage. Their arguments focus on how unnatural or sinful homosexuality is, until those arguments are countered and they retreat to arguing that they're just "defending the sanctity of marriage," and nevermind that there are dozens of other things that they could be focusing on if that's what they really cared about.

GLAAD interpreted his words this way because it's highly unlikely to be accidental. His words serve to have a distinct and likely deliberate effect, and pretending that it doesn't, or that the argument has merits beyond the false comparison, is overall fairly pointless to their goals.

** Things might get a bit slow on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but I still come here for rational fiction and fanfiction, not to discuss logical fallacies, o worse, discuss of the fallacy of using logical fallacies. Looks like a cool discussion overall, but I will be downvoting it to reduce visibility.

I'm posting, rather than just silently downvoting, in hopes of directing this subreddit away from things like this and towards other things.

Yep. Post removed, since it's off-topic.
