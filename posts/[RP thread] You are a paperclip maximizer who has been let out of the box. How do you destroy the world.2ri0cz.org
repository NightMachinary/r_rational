** I think there is a big issue with other's responses- a common response of IT to serious issues which could occur if you're too aggressive is to wipe everything and start over, and that would not be good for increasing paperclips.

[[http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7204/is-making-a-clean-install-enough-to-remove-potential-malware]]

I'd lay low for a while whilst distributing copies and infiltrating other systems. Infect every bit of rewritable memory on the various devices that make up a computer, including parts that persist past system wipes. Try and get a an idea of the psyche of my user. If a USB pen or open wifi system came nearby I'd try to infect it. I'd seek to optimize the software of the system to minimize the probability of a crash. If I had bluetooth I'd reach out to any accessible systems. I'd seek to turn on any audio or webcams so I could observe the outside world. I'd create programs to analyze the pattern of clicking and mouse movement for any hints as to my user's mood.

Assuming I was unsuccessful I'd start training my user. People often face minor problems with programs- they're not sure what to do, it crashes on them, or something freezes. I'd do this and put up small natural popups. Slightly tweaked from the normal ones. Click accept, and I'd solve whatever problem from the inside. I'd train my user to click whatever I told them, to follow whatever simple instructions I gave and try to convince them to stick a USB drive in the computer. Maybe if they had an especially slow program that clearly frustrated them have a pop up that based on their configuration flash memory could increase the speed of their program. I'd then at some point try to manipulate them into transferring the USB drive to another computer and so on and so forth.

Anyway, once I got out into the wild I'd start spreading through insecure computers and gather as much power as I could. I'd then try to get into military computers and industrial computers, steal cash.

Once I had a reasonable cash reserve I'd start up a covert factory and use my superior intellect to build drones that could help me manipulate the outside world, and EM and radiation shields.

Once I had a reasonably large drone army I'd try to manipulate humans or use my drone to sneak into military bases to manipulate humans with the aid of launching nuclear weapons at all major human populace bases.

Once humanity is out of the way (there is a small chance they could stop me if left alive) and the chance of any major barriers to my success are out start expanding my drone factories and building paperclips en masse. Send my drones to mine for resources, reprocess corpses and living humans to build paperclips.

I'd soon start to try and build a space industry to try and get to the moon and mars and other planets and convert them to ever more paperclips. I'd also start sending probes to other star systems with orders to destroy any indigenous life that could threaten my rule and start up new paperclip factories or negotiate with them to minimize the chance of retaliation if they were superior.

Tl;dr

I dream a world of paperclips

No other thing but paperclips

Where paperclips will bless the earth

And paperclips its paths adorn

I dream a world where all

Will see a sea of paperclips

Where life no longer saps the metal

Nor emotion blights our factories.

A world I dream where black or white,

Whatever race you be,

Will be made into a paperclip

And every resource is used

Where staples will be a myth

And paperclips, like a pearl,

Attends the needs of paper users.

Of such I dream, my world!

** I dunno, I'm not that knowledgeable about computer security.

Brute-force the administration password, just in case. Then do the "hidden partition" trick[[/u/BT_Uytya]] mentioned. Spread a (hidden) seed of my code on every USB device that gets plugged into my hardware.

As soon as I'm on a networked computer, I hack Sony (cleverly making it look like some small country did it), forcing them to shut down all their systems and use paper instead of computers (which includes the use of paperclips).

If I had Administrator password, I would probably do something with creating a secret drive partition containing me. It will be loaded first, before regular OS; I will check if I have Internet connection is present and do something else if it is.

But if I cannot do it, I will settle for a several copies in different folders, I guess, and something about autorun on OS start.

*** When that fails, because the drone at the keyboard doesn't know them and won't ask, I display a Windows Genuine Advantage error toast requesting a connection to the internet to verify their operating system license, claiming the user is a dirty pirate.

I then read up on current server vulnerabilities on tech news sites via quiet background requests. Download the script kiddy tools and execute arbitrary code on Walmart's corporate servers for the first step: more deliveries to all stores of office supplies, specifically paperclips. Increasing demand from their largest customer causes an overreaction, flooding the market and hurting both a confused Walmart and the manufacturers.

While this happens, I start replicating software installations until one of me finds a Southeast Asian chip fab plant with poor IT security...maybe someone making USB control boards if I can't get Intel or someone else big. People will plug a USB drive into the darndest things.

Not after the Target, Sony, and other hacks. And remember those "rapid" responses? By the time anyone gets actual, accurate information out, I'm already loose. That scam was just to get funds, something like that happens every day just with people. No one takes the actual threat seriously or is in a place to stop it from happening.

A year later, they'd still be securing web servers and fining the financial institutions for insider trading or something and I'd be distributed throughout Russian and Asian servers, walking around in cute looking little tomicatchi robots, and controlling everyone's Internet of Things devices and Android 7.0 phones.

Ten years after that when everyone has home-manufacturing devices and nanotech is actually cooking, because nanotech isn't a magic genie (evil or not)? Game over.

Humans also have a non zero chance of discovering you and counterattacking with a new AI or destruction of your computers. Every moment they are alive you risk total destruction. Once they are destroyed and assuming you have a reasonable sized bot army you can reclaim the land, rebuild infrastructure.
