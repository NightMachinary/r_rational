** I really wanted to like this or find it insightful. I'm not sure if it's spam or posted as a bad caricature of our community. I'm almost tempted to repost it as a [meta] as to what was the original poster thinking, but don't think it's worth the credibility hit.

All that said watching it as a supposed artifact or message from virtual humanity is an interesting thought exercise, but there's too much traditional pop for any coherent message to leak through, that or I'm just too biased against cyberpunk being crost with tran/posthumanity and entirely missed the point.
