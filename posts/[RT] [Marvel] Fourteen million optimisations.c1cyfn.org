** Some interesting ideas / clever tricks / cute tweaks to how the movies went. Felt a bit clunky/didactic in certain spots though (goes with the territory I suspect).

Needs an editing pass, as it's somewhat inconsistent about tense (sometimes flips between past/present within a single sentence, or repeatedly within a paragraph) and has some minor words like "the" or "a" either missing, or using what seemed to me like the wrong one.

A bit lacking in tension, with how the plan just... /works/, with no major mis-steps or failures or adversity. That is perhaps the whole point of the piece (what should in theory be possible with 14 million futures worth of foresight if only that had been used effectively).

** This leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The treatise on Wakanda's inferiority was both unnecessary and uncharitable-- Iron Man and Doctor Strange get to have a rationality boost, but Wakanda is inherently backwards because it's not European?

Captain Marvel gets sent away because she's too... Moody and unpredictable? This just feels like it's there to "own" feminists.

The justification being that small teams of people need to get along well in the very stressful situations they are likely to face. Also that she might do her own thing and mess up his plans.

**** That's a really good point, and not just because of the Captain Marvel part. This was an issue throughout the story--the characters don't act like people. They all sound the same, nobody has any inconvenient motivations or conflicts even when they ought to, and Stark behaves like an AI. He doesn't have to struggle with or work around his resentment toward Cap, because this version of him doesn't have an inner emotional life.

I feel like there's little excuse for this in fanfiction, where the characters' personalities and histories are ready-made. But I see it a lot in optimization fic--the writer describes a series of events in which the characters do everything right and fix everything, but the characters don't feel human, so the reader has no reason to /care./

*** That's an unfair interpretation if you ask me--Asgard is basically described as "Wakanda but even worse" and is given an equal amount of narrative derision. At the very least, whether or not it's actually true that the European political landscape made a "survival of the fittest" pressure to create stable forms of government, it's still an interesting idea to explain how super-civs like Wakanda and Asgard are undeniably stagnated compared to other societies.

As for Captain Marvel, her whole shtick in her movie is doing things her own way and telling authority to shove it. Those qualities, while helpful in other situations, are the opposite of suitable for a long-term, confined-space waiting game. The feeling that it's a dig at feminism is more likely just an expression of the stilted dialogue pervading the fic.

For sure, there are a helluva lot of problems with this fic. It has the Mother of Learning problem times 1000 where everyone has the same voice. Tony seems to forget about the existence of Pepper and Rhodes (who would have also been an ideal choice for the mission) which is majorly out of character. Black Widow (yet another great choice) gets mentioned once and vanishes thereafter from the narrative. So, going after Wakanda and CM as its major issues just feels kinda weak.

*** Wakanda is a weird place, even in the source material. Some random guy shows up in the movie, claims to be part of the ruling family and everyone signs up to his cause after he beats the king in ritual combat. The part about tech is spot on though, they have super stealth ships in black panther but fight with sticks? Screams cultural blindspots to me, even if they are really advanced otherwise.

haven't gotten to the Captain Marvel part yet.EDIT: Ehhh I feel like it's more of a trope than an actual jab at Captain Marvel.

Iron Man uses his nanotech suit to make his fist bigger when punching bad guys, but he doesn't get written off as a primitive for it. Comic book combat relies heavily (if not entirely) on Rule of Cool. Cap uses a shield, Black Widow uses taser sticks, Spider Man uses web shooters, and Wakandans use laser spears. None of these are optimal forms of weaponry, but one gets mocked a lot more than the rest.

***** They are pretty well suited for their intended purposes, resources and limitations, however.

Black Widow and Cap also use guns and have no access to repulsortech guns, Peter's suit definitely has more lethal weaponry but the web is fantastic for non-lethal takedowns and often more effective than a gun would be against opponents with high durability.

Iron man's giant foot is mocked, by me at the very least, but he did try a whole bunch of more advanced weapons before he started punching.

Wakanda are supposed to be tribal warriors who haven't fought in a war since their nation was founded and when they were put to the test it really, really showed that they were not nearly as effective as a military unit would be.

****** This.

Everybody seems to forget that Wakanda has not fought in an actual war for generations. They didn't do anything about the Slave Trade, they didn't engage in any of the World Wars, and all of their in-fighting is solved by ritual combat.

There are a hundred thousand ways to rationalize Wakanda while letting it keep its flavour. Why do they solve their problems via ritual combat? Because when you have such a small amount of land, a relatively small population, and advanced technology, a civil war can be devastating. You could easily write a fic about how Wakanda uses ritual combat to decide who can be king, simply because they aren't willing to risk fighting an actual war against each other. And remember, ritual combat is only ever invoked if somebody challenges the king/heir. It pretty much gives any agitators a single target to aim for that minimizes societal disruption - no need to seize the means of production if you can just train to win one fight instead. And given how insular, tradiotionalist and isolationist Wakanda culture is, the chances of a Killmonger happening were pretty damn low. If your goal is stability rather than effective leadership (because how hard can ruling a peaceful, hyper-advanced, 1rst World+ country of content citizens really be), than there are ways to justify ritual combat.

HPMOR took the time to actually rationalize Dumbledore and his behaviour. If he had just been a dumb crazy irrational old man in the end the fic would be, in my opinion, at least 30% worse. If you are going to write a rational story in a setting, then you should sprinkle rationality liberally throughout the world.

This story feels bad to me, essentially, because its what HPMOR would have been if its HPJEV versus canon Voldemort and canon Dumbledore. Thanos is stupid. Wakanda and Asgard are dumb, because the author can't be bothered to rationalize them, and the plan works perfectly. A nice rational protagonist, sure, but a much, much poorer story.

We see a lot of higher-tech species (or, in Wakanda's case, cultures) in the Marvel-verse using a combination of guns and melee. It's outright stated by at least one BP character that guns are more primitive than their particular melee weapons.

So it's not surprising that a high-tech warrior culture would be more interested in stick fighting than you'd expect.

Doesn't really matter if it's "more primitive". You can have the fanciest most advanced superalloy blade in the world, but as long as it requires you to run up to someone and fight them in melee it's not going to be as useful for combat as something that does the same job from a distance. And that takes us back to them not being able to figure out any sort of mass-produced functional ranged weaponry.

**** To me, the racist bit was not saying that Wakanda was primitive because it didn't have any competition to force it to improve its military/government structures, it was the "unlike European countries" comparison. Because of course no other areas of the world have ever had military competition between comparable nation-states... It just reeks of "Europe/West good, everywhere else bad for objective reasons".

I didn't read the Captain Marvel bit as sexist but rather about her individual ability to sit still in a small spaceship for weeks and not start trouble, but given that he took Captain America it does seem a little suspect, or at the very least un-thought-through, which is a bigger sin in the eyes of a good chunk of this sub.

But in this fic, he's able to advise Stark on a ton of what he needs to do during the span of time when Strange himself is dead, and therefore "blind." I guess it's possible that he skipped ahead in the twelve successful timelines and had Stark tell him everything he'd done to succeed, but I'm not convinced that would be enough information even after cross-referencing all twelve. There would be countless failure conditions where Strange is either never brought back or gets killed again before he can talk to Stark--many of which would involve decisions that victory!Stark wouldn't even think worth remarking on, since /he/ made all the right choices and never knew that a different one would have tanked the plan.

** Stephen doesn't need to spoof the gauntlet to make sure Tony is in the half that survives, because when he asks that Thanos "Spare his life" in exchange for the Time Stone, Thanos - because he is an honorable being and not a maliciously literal genie - interprets Sparing His Life as including sparing him from the snap five minutes hence.

Of course if Thanos was an actual thinking intelligent character he would have instantly realized what it means that a man who can see the future is giving up the Time Stone and dooming half of all life in exchange for asking one person to live and would have instantly killed Tony instead.

*** On the other hand, if Strange had foreseen that asking Thanos to spare Stark would cause him to kill him instead, he wouldn't have done that. And then I guess it just goes around and around forever!

In all seriousness, I took it as Thanos not knowing that Strange and Stark didn't have a personal bond. Like this is just my headcanon, but Thanos had recently killed the person he loved most to achieve what he saw as the greater good, and he was openly proud of what he saw as his uniquely strong will in being able to make those kinds of sacrifices. So when Strange pleaded for Stark's life, I think Thanos--assuming under the circumstances that Strange actually cared about Stark--was like, "Oh, of course. Unlike me, these weak-willed humans can't just accept the trade-off of one loved one's life for a shot at what they see as the greater good. This man is making a stupid and emotionally-fueled decision, and I understand how he feels, even though I and I alone was strong enough to overcome that feeling." It wasn't the rational move, but I think it was a plausible move for an intelligent, thinking character with this specific egotistical blind spot to make.

(The /really/ dumb thing about Thanos is that he honestly thinks killing half the universe is the best way to use a magic genie wish gauntlet to address resource scarcity...)

If he could just double the resources with a snap, what does that mean for all the people he killed? Was it just a waste?

He can't see another way to use it, necause it invalidates so much of his life. He cannot conceive of another way to use it.

His world being destroyed "proved" he was right. And he followed that commitment to the end.

*** Very enjoyable reading!

I notice that some readers have an issue with the lack of struggle and stress.

Those sre not big craving of mine, but if you have interest in improving the mass appeal, you could add a sense of struggle and tension by having nearly the entire story take place in successive failed visions.

Instead of giving flawless advice in the beginning of the story, every time Tony fails the full failure and its pain and heartache is played out for as long as it remains interesting, and then we're taken back to another thing that Strange adds to the conversation (instead of the little blurb about what happens if Thanos minions find out, they just do and it goes to crap and Strange tells Tony to zip it. A paragraph spacing later and it simpky says "No implying it either, Tony.")

After that, we read how this addition changes Tony's actions and the story then continues until we are finally in the end given the perfected ending, feeling like the characters "earned" it.

I greatly enjoy the current writeup however and don't feel as much need for tension so kudos to you for an excellent read!

** My head canon for how it worked was that Dr. Strange did optimize, but what he did in the movie was the optimization. If he gave Tony too many details and too much hope, Tony would get too determined and confident in himself, and just create Ultron 2.0 which would finish off Earth. If Strange gave Tony fewer details and less hope, then Tony wouldn't have tried time travel at all, he may have even committed suicide- something he even attempted it seemed by ripping out the arc reactor in the beginning of Endgame.

The 14 million possibilities may have even been a lie- something to give Tony a feeling it would be incredibly challenging, but possible- the real number of futures he saw could have been in the trillions, and he saw multiple slightly different winning futures.
