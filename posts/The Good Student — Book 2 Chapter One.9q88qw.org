** Fantastic writing as always. Loving the new characterizations. Really looking foward to seeing how Nic deals with Winnum Roke.

** I tried to read this once but could not get into it.

Is there a chapter I should get up to before I completely give up on it ? I think I was three chapters in.

*** You will be missing out on frankly one of the best world building I have read on rational fantasy fiction.

*** Not really an answer but: IMO The Good Student gets better as it gets on, with some lulls in the middle IIRC; the later part of the first book was excellent. It is kind of a slow burner though.

  gets better as it gets on

I found it got complicated and confusing at the later parts.

I'm not a big fan of surrealism.

***** I had the same problem, it also kept undercutting every single one of the MC's achievements as him just following the convoluted plans of the antagonists, so it never really felt like he was winning, especially when he wins and then is immediately proven to have been following the plans of the enemy the whole time, only to eek out victory at the very end because of one obvious decision.

*** I ran into this issue the first time I tried reading it. I couldn't get into the world. It felt very much like none of that shit mattered in the way that a tutorial to a videogame feels.

My second go around, I remember liking it by chapter 5. If you don't like it by then, I'd drop it.
