Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** Factorio reminds me a lot of three Zacktronics games: Spacechem, Infinifactory, and TIS-1000. If you enjoy Factorio's factory-making you might well enjoy one or more of those as well.

Infinifactory is a 3d first-person factory making game where you have inputs and have to create outputs by manipulating blocks with e.g. conveyor belts, lasers, rotators, welders, etc.

Spacechem is a chemisty-themed puzzle game where you have to make outputs out of inputs and do things like make water by bonding hydrogens to oxygen, or fuse hydrogens into carbon and then make carbon steel, or whatever.

TIS-1000 is a programming themed game where you have a very simple assembly language and a grid of low quality computers, and have to solve problems like finding the maximum of a string of numbers and outputting it.

If you like even one of these games I would not be surprised if you like all three.

**** The biggest thing you should learn to do is to create a main bus where you put the ingredients you need to make things work. [[http://i.imgur.com/yvjgVSx.jpg][Here's an example]]. So you have a river of basic ingredients running through the factory, and you pull from it with splitters and underground belt when you need them. Each assembly area can then be fairly self-contained, and the problems get a lot smaller because if you're setting up (for example) a place where you're making belts, you don't really need to think about where the inputs are coming from, because you already handled getting all the materials earlier on.

Another tip is to give yourself plenty of space. It's fun to find compact, efficient designs, but most of the time the only penalty for not using them is that you have a slightly larger space to defend. Trying to cram things in makes the logistics a lot more difficult.

*** I thought basically the same thing while watching the movie. The character doesn't have to be a rationalist to actually use their abilities in a remotely clever way.

The thing about this kind of movie is that the makers clearly wanted to tell a particular kind of story, that had nothing to do with the time travel aspect, and as a result the time travel was never fully explored.

To people with strong munchkin instincts something in a movie with immense implications not being well utilized can be very frustrating but alas we must put up with most movie protagonists being about as smart as a average middle schooler.

As a unrelated point I really wish it was standard to include a tag for movies that are depressing af.

***** The problem is that it doesn't make any sense for the world to secretly be ruled by time travelers because such a world would be so vastly (and obviously) different from our own.

Effectively by piggybacking information arbitrarily far back into the past it seems inevitable that as soon as you get some time travelers who know what the hell they're doing, you will almost inevitably get a singularity, spreading back as far as anyone has had these powers.

But that's kind of how things go, with nearly any setting with any time travel that can do much.

As for the trigger thing, well i'm not sure just being depressing is really a "trigger" so i'm not sure such a thing would exist. Still i've heard a lot of people complain about movies that totally blindside you by suddenly getting seriously sad part way through. The classic example is marley and me, which I never saw for that reason. I mean can you imagine if a massive number of comedies turned into horror films part way through.

I don't know why /most/ people watch stuff like that, but I have bipolar and shows like Bojack Horseman are very cathartic for me inasmuch as they reflect my subjective state onto the screen. Being able to see Bojack or Rick Sanchez spiral into self-destructive behaviors and suicidal ideation is a (probably very odd) form of validation: by their very existence, these shows remind me that I'm not alone in this, and some people really /do/ understand, whether because they experience it themselves or because they're just really empathetic.

(It helps that Bojack Horseman and R&M are both hilarious as well, but that isn't essential for the catharsis and feeling of being understood)

Like I said, though, I don't know why /most/ people would like sad stuff.

*** I really liked it. Sure, he's a bit short-sighted, but you could say the same of pretty much any movie protagonist. Not every story can be rational, just like not every story can be a romance, or a space opera; some stories in possibility space are both good and rationality-incompatible. The protagonist's antics are funny, and there's a lot you only get to learn about the world and the characters by seeing how they act in different timelines.

Also, your feminist critique rubs me the wrong way. A big part of the story is the father-son relationship, which would be lost somewhat if it were a father-son-daughter-mother relationship. Not to say that the alternate universe gender-inclusive It's About Time wouldn't be good too, but they're /different movies/, and I hate it when people act like the writer and director are committing some kind of cosmic wrong by making the movie they want to make instead of a similar movie with the same characters but an entirely different plot.

It's still planned to be interactive, but the stages of interactivity are initially going to be a bit low while I get the 'establishing fiction' up and then will be a more episodic 'slice of weird-life' that can get a lot more input after everyone has had some time for things to sink in how the world/characters work.

Otherwise ya, it's dead as far as a forum adventure project. If you'd like to be involved/read the rough draft I'm in process of writing scripts and then later will be doing story boards/illustrations etc for several months to come.

And, with the setup to a shokugeki between the two, I'm now almost 100% certain one of two things will happen: (1) Soma loses and works for Central (2) Something will happen to invalidate/postpone the shokugeki. There's simply no way, thematically, Soma can win this match, which is annoying to me as I really hate matches with foregone conclusions, which is what this one is. Although, to be fair, most of the important shokugekis are that way. Like, anytime we see Soma betting his expulsion, we know he's either going to win or get out of it somehow, which removes a lot of the tension from what should be an epic moment.

** Well, I don't have a new load until tomorrow at 1100 EST, so I have a little time to think.

I am closing in on acquiring a patent for what might literally be a game-changing space propulsion method, that can utilize pre-existing space-proven fuel-based propulsion technologies to perform interplanetary-range missions both rapidly enough for commercial exploitation and more efficiently than any current rocketry method. My last examiner interaction was an Ex Parte Quayle action, meaning it was patentable, but I had some cleanup on non-claim issues to take care of. That claim had too many limitations, due to my only recently determining how to use wording in a claim to more precisely define my claim. I have resubmitted, with a couple earlier limitations removed.

I believe I will have the patent in a few months. Supposing nobody comes forward with a publication that predates my patent application process, but was overlooked by the entire space propulsion community, what in the heck am I going to do with it?

I have no meaningful ties to anyone in the space science community. I have no experience with dealing with a patent. I'm afraid to sell the thing, because I don't want it locked in a box by some corporation. I don't particularly want to administer the thing (no experience, again.)

I'm also refusing to allow myself to look too forward and collect eggs for only one basket. As I mentioned in a recent thread, I'm currently a professional truck driver, and that's not changing until I get other money in hand, if this ever generates income. The return from this could be anywhere from zero to licensing fees that might mean I never have to work again.

I have considered a Kickstarter to put it into public domain, but I have my doubts about how well that would actually work, and what I'd offer for rewards and stretch goals.

I'm also considering holding onto it, pinching my nose, and dealing with lawyers and licensing agents to administer the thing, because I know I can trust myself to not lock it in a box somewhere.

Anyone here know of an example of an outsider in a field generating a game-breaking patent, and not making a horrible mash of introducing/administering it?

I'll say again, that I do not have the patent yet, but every office action gets me closer. The concept is patentable, it's a matter of what limits I'll be forced to accept.

*** I assume you don't have the time, skills, or funds to create an appealing video that explains the idea well. Do a small Kickstarter for those funds, then hire someone to make that video. Then do a huge Kickstarter promising increasing levels of involvement with getting the idea into some phase of production, mainly by making contact with you a scarce commodity. The goal of the huge Kickstarter will be to generate media attention, and the attention of Elon Musk or his competitor-colleagues in private and governmental space travel. Say you need the money in order to be able to spend your time getting the idea into some phase of production, and that all leftover will go straight to making the project not so large of a money sink for whatever entity decides to invest in the idea.

Again, the idea is to get PR and funding so you can spend more time getting access to people with the power to get it done.

An easier route might be pm'ing Eliezer this comment, asking if he's still in contact with Peter Thiel, who can then be the power broker between you and Elon Musk. Before that, e-mail one or a few respected Professor(s) of the pertinent field your patent and the idea, asking if they would invest in it had they the funds, or just what they think of the idea. Use that to get enough credibility to make clear to the power broker that the risk of embarrassment and time wasting is low.

Another way would be e-mailing engineers at SpaceX, NASA, etc. your patent and the idea, requesting they bring it up to their superiors if they find the idea something worth pursuing. Before that, though, you need to decide what deal you are comfortable accepting.

Would a kickstarter like that even generate interest? I could probably get a video made by the time I have the patent, but most of what I see done in kickstarters is media. Games/books/etc.

The direct contact with professors or industry professionals can be dauntingly hard to manage. Think about how many crackpots try to sell them new ideas. They are going to paint me with crackpot brush unless I have some sort of credentials, or a really good hook. I've already cautiously approached several, and not even one response. I've even written a book about the idea and published it for free, and only gotten a response from one science writer, who said she wanted to write an article on it, but was told no by her editor because the editor refused to believe it was valid that nobody had thought of it before. /shrug/

If you have a .edu e-mail address, or know someone who does, their requests will be taken much more seriously. The best approach, though, is to call a professor during office hours and ask for an in-person appointment to go over your idea. Make it clear you think it has merit, are pursuing a patent, and are genuinely looking for a technical evaluation of whether you should continue pursuing its promotion or give it up as a waste of time, as you have other things you could be doing. I don't know if your job would allow you the time to do that, however.

For example, if you try to patent something like tying little balloons into dog-shaped knots, you probably aren't going to be able to enforce it, even if it is valid. Every clown in the universe would ignore your patent. The balloon makers can't be held responsible either, they just make balloons.

Now, if you were to patent a new eating utensil, you wouldn't try to enforce the patent on people using them, you would enforce it on people making and selling the utensils.

2. Get rid of background noise

I mean, support it as a right if that's your stance, sure, but that doesn't mean that others can't similarly support the right to archiving things that have been openly posted on the internet.

Although this has its appeal, I think that on the whole it does more damage than respecting other people's deletions.

People sometimes have brain farts or emotional outbursts and say things they immediately regret. Or they change their minds and would rather prevent confusion regarding their current stance. Or (like Yudkowsky) they're famous enough that their every word might get scrutinized by people who don't have their best interests in mind.

When someone doesn't respect self-deletions, they make people more vulnerable to those things. So people are more likely to just not post potentially controversial things in the first place, and the conversation is poorer for it.

If the deleted post was super interesting (as happened on another recent occasion in the LW diaspora), then I can at least see the case for sharing the copy. But this is just a bit of humor and opportunity for gossip.

** /Deadpool/ is surprisingly good.

It's sitting at about the same score as /Ant-Man/ on rottentomatoes, and yeah, like /Ant-Man/, it isn't trying very hard.

But it's not-trying-very-hard at doing something original, while /Ant-Man/ is not-trying-very-hard at telling a bog-standard light-hearted superhero origin story. And the humor was less crap than I expected.
