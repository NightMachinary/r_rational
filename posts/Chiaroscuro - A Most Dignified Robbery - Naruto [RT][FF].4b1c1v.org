Are there any fanfictions similar to this one?

*** It depends on what you mean by similar.

Off the top of my head with my best guess at which parts of this you find interesting, I would rec [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/1/A-World-Full-of-Monsters][A World Full of Monsters]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]] and maaaybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/The-Empty-Cage][The Empty Cage]]

***** I really enjoy the chaotic randomness of the large scale fight scenes, and the characterisation is top tier.

  I think it would be better without the complication of crossover, but it's not terribly intrusive.

You reckon? I think it would come off as a bit contrived to have an OC who is as competent as Hermione show up at random with her unique magical powers. Because we "know" her though, I think it comes off as being less wanky.

*** The only thing that came to mind was "Lighting Up the Dark" by Velorien. There are probably more, but a lot of "realistic" fics tend to get too dark for my tastes.

** Chiaroscuro. I like Chiaroscuro. It's clever, the writing is proficient, the characters make good decisions, the fights are solid.

It's definitely not a bad story, its just sometimes it seems to lack that spark of greatness that would push it over the edge to being something really special.
