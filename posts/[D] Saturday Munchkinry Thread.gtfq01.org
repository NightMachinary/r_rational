Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

*** The easy money-making question is whether a certain volatile stock will go up or down. Though this is proportional to how much money you already have.

**** The stockmarket is bad with yes/no questions. You know if something is going to go up or down, but you don't know by how much and if you want to get full information on a single stock it will take multiple questions. On the other hand win/lose bets with a fixed rate of return (eg. sports matches) are much better.

Bets on things that have a 50-50% chance and return ~double your money if you win should enable you to get a return of 1024 times your initial capital. Even a more realistic return of 1.95 still ends up with you having 794 times your initial investment.

Even if you start with no savings if you properly leverage your assets and take on large amounts of otherwise crippling debt beforehand you should be able to gather a significant amount of money, which when multiplied by a thousand becomes a massive amount which will significantly change your quality of life.

Is it as spiritually or emotionally fulfilling as unlocking the mysteries of the universe? No.

Is the fact that you and your kids won't ever have to worry about being working for "the man" for 50 years of your life or living in poverty or losing your house because you get sick and can't work (hello fellow Americans) worth it? Billions of people worldwide would probably say yes.

Now: *Neutrino*

You have the ability to shift into a form entirely made out of neutrinos.

You can control how weakly or strongly your neutrino body interacts with the ambient world. With a minimum level of effort, your neutrino body interacts with the world enough to allow you to push off against hard surfaces. However, this level of interaction means that you become somewhat visible, much like a neutrino in a neutrino detector emits a flash of light. Except you're not a single neutrino: you're on the order of 7^{27} neutrinos (by some estimates, that's how many atoms are in the human body).

When you perform these sorts of interactions, you lose the interacting neutrinos. These lost neutrinos are deducted from your power's pool. When you run out of neutrinos in the pool, you revert to the non-neutrino form. Converting to the neutrino form takes one body-atom-count of neutrinos.

The number of neutrinos in your pool is 10 times the number of atoms in your body. The pool replenishes at the rate that naturally-occurring neutrinos intersect your body. While you choose to absorb neutrinos, you cast a neutrino shadow in all directions.

*** Wouldn't you instantly start sinking into the ground if not always using the minimum level of effort? Neutrinos seem to have mass so you'd be affected by gravity. (And if they didn't, you'd shortly fly off the earth as you continued in a straight line and it curved away from you.)

***** So unless you can control which portions of your body interact, you wouldn't be able to walk through walls.

But assuming you could... then you can walk through walls, open safes. Hm, you'd probably be both deaf and blind in neutrino form without expending "serious" levels of effort.

Given the neutrino flux on earth is about 10^{11} per m^{2,} you're looking at ~300,000 years to recharge, you'd want to treat this as a non-renewable resource.

You could probably leap kilometers at a time with your much lower mass and lack of air resistance. That would probably be fun. Do your clothes come with you? Or small items? You could do shrapnel removal from people without surgery if so.

This is an excellent observation, and something that I was kind of worried about.

What would be a good recharge rate, do you think? One-tenth the maximum rate at which neutrinos are expended from the pool? The Electron character's electron pool-filling rate is limited by the rate at which electrons are made available, and the Graviton character's pool-filling is limited to the amount of gravitons they encounter naturally. Perhaps Neutrino gets a multiplier to the background rate?

******* Honestly I think once you get away from some natural constant you might as well use some story based reasoning that sounds good.

Instead of saying the neutrinos get destroyed, maybe introduce a tiredness or contamination or entropy mechanic. "You've used up 100% of the pool, it takes 24 hours to reorganize the neutrinos from their diffuse state..." or if you want it to fail at a properly intense moment go with "each 10% of the pool used makes it twice as mentally hard to use the power", maybe.

******** With Graviton and Electron, the limits on pool usage are hard limits, with a warning sensation as the power-wielder approaches that limit but no barrier to approaching the limit. Graviton's power's pool size, if overflowed, causes a rather traumatic gravitational catastrophe.

Electron's power is limited by the duration that Electron holds electrons in the pool.

I wanted Neutrino's power to be analogously based with something regarding the pool, and I do like how your daily recharge idea gets around the neutron flux problem, but that seems kind of limiting. Graviton can dump their pool by touching something. Electron can refill their pool by touching something. Neutrino ... waits 24h? It doesn't fit the pattern.

If so, is it any time someone says something negative about <My Name> whether it's actually about me or not? If so, change my name to different things to learn popular opinions about the thing. Offer services for a hefty price doing this.

If not, and it's just anytime someone says something negative that happens to be about me (no name needed) then probably high-stakes competitive gambling where the outcome is know to an audience but not the players.
