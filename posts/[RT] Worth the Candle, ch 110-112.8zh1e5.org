** Fenn's willingness to just shoot arrows at people is equal parts hilarious and disturbing.

Also, you know how the popcorn variety serial fiction takes every opportunity it can for the protagonist to blow everyones minds with there seemingly impossible awesomeness? You know, the 'A is clearly impossible! No one has ever done blah blah blah' /protagonist proceeds to do said impossiblity/ and then everyone's jaw drops? Well that sort of thing is so much more satisfying when it's used sparingly and it's why i love every moment of Devil Valencia speaking 'unknowable' truths, dissecting water-sack-tendril sign language and leaving everybody speechless.

Also also, did anyone else feel sorry for Masters? He made the wrong approach, and i have no qualms with how Joon dealt with him, but you can see the chain of reasoning that led to his choice of actions and the poor guys been spending the last 500 years living a lie, waiting for this moment, at least in part for altruistic reasons, and he completely fucks it up.

*** If you want people to trust you then you can't betray that trust, Masters. You'd think someone that old would understand that, but I guess his desperation not to let June get away before he got his answers led to him doing the very things that ensured he wouldn't get his answers.

I suppose it's not all over, though. Masters is still alive, and the team could conceivably be willing to speak to him in the future if he was under their power instead of the other way around.

Find enough of those ways, combine them, eat all the bad guys. Voila, the hells aren't so bad anymore.

***** Valencia's ability to eat them appears to have come about from a loophole in her non-anima status, caused by the Game system requiring she be a "real" person and rewriting reality to make that happen. As the Game is unique to Juniper and Uther and this was done by the Loyalty system (which has an extremely limited number of slots, to the point I doubt they even /could/ get another non-anima in there) it is very possible she's unique in this regard.

Of course, finding ways to improve her rate of consumption might be possible.

Eh, I do have qualms, that basically echo Mary's issue with how Fallatehr was handled (and Mary's complaint about how this was handled!), especially given that Joon considered behaving in the same sort of way towards Doris Finch. There seems to be a huge split in how he deal with companions and non-compansions, and this makes sense, except that he doesn't seem to view non-companions in a symmetric way. That is, he's open, honest, and trusting towards companions, and highly closed and manipulative towards non-companions, and then judges non-companions for not treating him like a companion. If he met a copy of himself, I expect it would fairly reliably end up with one of them killing the other rather than them cooperating.

(Like, imagine one of Uther's servants stumbling across Joon's doorstep, and saying "uh, I feel uncomfortable, how about I leave and we'll slowly coordinate some meeting on neutral ground?". Would Joon say "sure, seems reasonable, you seem scared and I don't want to scare you" or would Joon use the duress he's unwilling to respond to?)

*** So, that means things have more than doubled since April. Which is good growth. From the numbers, it takes about a year from here, consistently publishing (and reminding people of your Patreon [which this "thank you" does a great job of]) to get to the ~$3,000-$4,000 USD mark. Weirdly, support is currently dying off for authors at about the $5,000 USD mark. I don't know whether that is just the number of people reading right now, or what people do not feel comfortable giving above that amount (armchair speculation says it might be the amount people are comfortable with authors making from their work).

Feels like there should be an option on Patreon et al to only show marginal month-over-month change in donation revenue, and hide absolute monthly donation revenue. (Sure, you could calculate it if you tracked the amount each month, but the point is that having the absolute number /right there/ beside the subscribe button seems to act as a deterrent, so less “right there” is better, even if it's still accessible.)

Though I suspect that sluggish growth might be due partly to:

1. audience isolation: web serial authors rarely do marketing or promotions. Spreading awareness of a serial is limited to word-of-mouth (which can be quite limited depending on which communities the recommendations circulate in), aggregator websites (TopWebFiction, AO3) or forum discussion vectors (reddit, SpaceBattles, DLP, etc.). At some point, each community reaches diminishing returns, and combined with the fact that most of these audiences are used to free works, it's not surprising there aren't that many hugely financially successful web serials.

2. release incentive models: certain approaches are correlated with bigger growth spikes. Usually those models are intended to spur and funnel invested readers into higher priced tiers of Patreon (so-called whales) so they can satisfy their cliffhanger insanity. If you compare the three biggest web-serial earners, Wildbow seems to have much less growth spikes than puddles4263 or pirateaba. My guess is because a bonus chapter upon reaching a goal is much less incentivizing at the individual patron level than reading several updates ahead. Paywalling releases is a proven business model in the web-serial-adjacent community doing translations for Chinese web novels, where a translation team earns as much as $10-20k/month.

** One thought I've been having:

The DM as he presents himself to Juniper is a simulationist. He has set things up, he's letting them run.

The DM as he must have been during Uther's time was narrativist as all get out, with Uther coming through literally hundreds of skin of his teeth situations.

The DM tells Juniper that Uther used to cheat on behalf of the players, and it totally undermined the game, if you knew he'd bail you out even on dumb risks, then pretty soon everything was dumb risks.

I think the DM is running the game for each of them in the manner that they DM'd. Juniper is living in a crazy world where naming the wrong actor may kill you, while Uther has endured decades of kafabe victories whose lack of real stakes drove him nuts.

***** My working assumption since before the DM-focused chapter was that the DM was a future (or current) Juniper trying to work through his psychological hangups (incl. e.g. residual anguish over Arthur's death) by simulating a game where he, as a self-insert, is undergoing the healing journey of maturity and self-discovery that is confronting a series of challenges tangential to the Arthur (and related) questlines.

It seems like something the Juniper of the story would do, given his love of DMing -- recognize his downward spiral, dissociate himself (from his character/representation of himself), and explore how that character would behave in all these different scenarios in order to better understand himself and his motivations.

Is it still Doylist if the story has multiple layers? (I guess DMing a campaign where you're the only player is just telling a story to yourself)? I guess a more Watsonian take is that it's not so much that the DM is some sort of future Juniper, but more that Juniper is the DM with his memories wiped.

Thus, there is no Arthur-DM and we instead have the omphalos hypothesis -- the world was instantiated when Juniper stepped foot in it (or maybe just before).

1. Aerb was created (and Joon thrown into it) by Some Jerk.

2. Said Jerk /also/ created a demiurge DM abstraction to sit there manipulating fate re: Narrative flow, in order to make the game more game-y.

3. Somehow the DM demiurge either gained sentience and decided to help Joon; or there is a strange loop where Joon eventually ascends in power enough to usurp the DM role (but not the creator-God role), and so can act backwards to help current Joon, but only through actions the DM demiurge was designed to perform.

In particular most exclusions occurred during Uther's time on Aerb, many of the worst of them are from Joon post-Arthur, and Arthur's descriptions of Aerb rather line up with Joon's description of his DMing while lashing out at people.

If that's true, the big difference between the DM for Joon and the DM for Arthur is that Joon is no longer providing him with fuel for the campaign...

** I really hope Joon doesn't back down on the democracy argument. Group voting is important, as is respecting vote outcomes, and I get that a big part of the story is going to be Joon overcoming some of these implicit biases toward dismissing his teammates but that vote was bullshit. There was no way to even know if what they were perceiving was accurate, and leaving a team member behind on the basis of a nebulous luck sense is inexcusable. It didn't really seem plausible even- Mary had to know that all of them leaving would have been an open-ended narrative risk. Walking away from a hot situation even for a minute while saying "She'll be fine" is A) /also/ dismissive, in a much more callous way, and B) just /asking/ for a kick in the ass.

Juniper touched on why leaving and staying were both... /less-than-appealing/ ideas. No fair omitting one.

From his own position he has the best reason to stay, with the confidence that his allies are not trapped or presently being deluded. Splitting the party is bad, but it isn't infinitely bad, and sending one part away from trouble (while not a terribly common /outcome/ in games) has merit.

Mary exerted considerable power by picking two choices (everyone leaves/stays) for the vote. No time to discuss other options? What a coincidence!

This got lost in the discussion for narrative reasons, but i think it's worth some attention here. Just being in the exclusion zone (to-do: find boundaries) forces these considerations.

** Binge read the entire series over the last few days, and boy are my arms tired.

I've gotten pretty annoyed about how much terrible litrpg is being published lately. Shallow protagonists by authors who think that increasing stats equals character development, often just as shallow plot, lazy world building, often times terribly unbalanced or just bad game design it the stats thing is something everyone gets, or is terribly overpowered with no real stakes being far of macguffins of even more power/freedom. It's gotten to the point where I found a decent looking premise isekai book about a trio from Earth swapping places with the big bad demon of another world, but after a bland opening chapter where they get sperated, one gets turned into a wizard and saves a pirate boy from a mob, and then gets to see a character sheet, I just dropped the book there.

Meanwhile, worth the candle has deftly used all the overused tropes to make something fresh. This story is the Evangelion of litrpg, isekai, and arguably harem fantasy/comedy, decon/reconing pretty much every trope in the genres, and will hopefully live on in many hearts after the fad of giving hero protagonists character sheets dies off.

The only major logistics for of the world I see is the confusing nature of how the Pendrag family managed to acquire to many entads that can specifically only be passed down by blood inheritance. Entads are basically randomly dropped onto Aerb, with only a fraction of them being especially powerful with no major downside, so it's rather unfeasible to expect anyone to have more than one good entad that they could only bequeath to their child. With ten generations of a tightly knit court specifically marrying for entads, they would still have has to average an intake of several entads a year. Something just didn't add up to me.

Aerb's Cosmology is rather curious, a giant hex with opposite edges being adjacent makes a tiling plane, but it raises the questions of how the edges were determined, as without a clear border line, the effective edge of the hex could be anywhere. If the border is set by custom rather than evident cosmology, it raises the question of if it's even possible to prove there is only one hex. It could be that each tile is an independent but identical hex, or it could even be some form of the many worlds setup, with each hex different but only by so little that you would have to travel across unfathomable copies to find a difference that was noticable.

On a similar vein, the boundless depth is said to get wider as it gets deeper. This raises the question of how wide can it get, does it slow to a convergence, or get as wide as the hex itself, or somewhere even wider? Also, how deep of a column of air do you need for it to become opaque? I can't help but think that much sir being heated at noon each day would create a pretty brutal updraft.

When Joon made a checkers game in basic, it said that it didn't support kinging or bubblegum. Despite thorough searching, I can't find any reference to what the bubblegum in that sentence refers to, plz explain.

The exclusion zones are a fun, curious, and existentially terrifying phenomenon. One detail that I'm dreadfully curious about is, what shape are the zones? Spheres or 3d stadiums would be my first hunch, but If they're hexagons, that possibly offers an interesting insight into the overall nature of Aerb itself... For that matter, what skill has the label of excluded #1? Looking at the first few exclusions could offer some interesting theories on the principle. Gestalting skills was #4, I wonder what those first three are, possibly to do with world building? Exclusion magic being exclusion #0 would be quite amusing.

The exclusionary principle says that some zones have a set magic/physics that is excluded elsewhere, while others are also locked to a specific person as well. What evidence exists for this to be the case? What rules out the hypothesis that the only difference is that the second type is one the original causer decided to stay because they have mastery over the space?

On the nature of the exclusion zone borders, do they simply block the excluded magic from exiting, or do they at times act as more substantial walls? Eg. Can glass cross the glass fields border in either way, can a zombie cross the risen lands border (does it act like a wall, a vaporizer, or simply stop moving?), can those with a personal zone leave the zone at the cost of losing the unique magic (something that wouldn't be likely done volentarily, but it could be a humane way to deal with a zone), or are they locked in, perhaps by the same "wrap around to the other side" system the hex works on?

The Ice magic exclusion zone was from Arthur making Ice-9, wasn't it?

It's rather curious as to what exactly the exclusionary principle covers, instantly obviously threats to the entirety of Aerb make sense, but the more borderline ones raise the question of some of the equivalent threats that weren't excluded. Why [Redacted], but not the Actual Cannibal? Why Manifest and the goblin, but not the soulraping elf?

Sapient beings have souls, demons and devils are sapient. I can't help but think that the way to reach the magical singularity is to use soul magic to convert six billion demons into skill points.

And that's not even touching on the hinted yet totally untouched areas of questions about the gods.

***** Well, there's not avoiding a bad situation, and then there's actively making it worse. In either case, the vote was already 4-1 so it was already as good as decided, since Fenn was saying she would only stay with Joon if she'd known he would've ignored the vote. To avoid listening to a majority vote on a technicality would have pissed them off even more, I think.

Like, obviously if you're making a vote about whether to rescue a teammate, you can't ignore the outcome of the vote because "lol the girl we're supposed to rescue hasn't voted". Joon's teammates made a judgment call ("this is too dangerous, we'll rescue Valencia later") and Joon disregarded it.

*** Sure. Imagine dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and writing down the first nine letters in each. To specify a square, you need to know if it's left/center/right and if it's top/middle/bottom. If you know those two things, that's a letter. To get 26 letters you imagine stacking these squares in groups of three, so that you also have front-inside-back. (9*3 = 27 > 26, so there is an extra square; don't worry about it.)

Now to turn movies into any of those three dimensions. A made up movie title is (let's arbitrarily say) left/top/front, a movie that they never watched but discussed is center/middle/inside, and a movie they saw is right/bottom/back. So if you agree that the first movie is the left-right axis, the second movie is the top-bottom axis, and the third movie is the front-back axis, you can uniquely specify one letter with three movies.

Now imagine you're Masters, and by tampering with the protocol you make someone rotate their imaginary square (so that the first movie is front-back, let's say). They'll get different letters from the same movie titles. They won't get words; they'll get garbage. But at least now they know there's an illusion.

***** There /is/ one other thing: Timing. ...I'm still assuming linear time, because time travel makes a real mess for this. (Unicorns, though. The exercise of waiting a few minutes at the right times is left to the reader.)

#+begin_quote
  I need to make sure that everyone is who they say they are.
#+end_quote

The most damaging thing an attacker could do is impersonate /everyone/ to everyone else, such that no two parties actually communicated but trusted that they had.

There are other attacks. Another is to impersonate absent parties well enough to fool to all present and give no hint that the illusion persists.

A /slightly/ less damaging variant on either attack is to fool some fraction of the group and leave the others aware of the ongoing illusion.

#+begin_quote
  Solace, you should have enough, given movie nights. Some small amount of repetition is allowable
#+end_quote

Repetitions carry risk, but they're nearly unavoidable for Solace's use.

An attacker could manipulate when everyone started their messages so that rather than sequentially communicate and avoid duplicates, they all communicate at once without hearing each other. Now the attacker has several encrypted phrases with presumably standard frequency distributions on the letters /and/ no one thinks they should have heard anything yet.

Everyone just gave a message and expects a response, so the attacker has very little time. All an illusion needs to do is stall. Maybe their new associates interrupt with a question; a delay from outside the system is dangerous.

If the delays vary, the attacker now has a few guesses in order to fool at least one person. Wrong guesses alert that person, but no one else knows a message has even been transmitted. However:

#+begin_quote
  Grak began.
#+end_quote

This helps the defenders because everyone wants to know if they can trust what they heard about the wards they're in. It's a mostly non-arbitrary choice who should go first. Imagine everyone being told they should go first. (If you're in a /hurry/ you can skip imagining Grak, since he didn't need to be prompted in the chapter. I won't tell him if you won't.)

Arguably, having common knowledge of being in the ward is an unqualified victory for the defenders, but only arguably, so let's keep going!

The attacker can also try changing the sender/recipient of a message.

Keep in mind that everyone in the party expects an encrypted message, even if the attacker changes it. In some cases the unencrypted message may be a known-unknown. (Does Fenn think she knows whether Mary and Grak watched /Fight Clown/?)

If the message seems suspect to the recipient and they react overtly with any of: facial expressions, shouts, or cleartext the discrepancy may be from the meaning or the non-common movies. Because movies were primarily watched in pairs, this seems like a strength of the system, but a watched movie is probably not also a fake movie in another context. It's still weak information to the attacker. Concerns along these lines probably led Amaryllis to say this:

#+begin_quote
  I want one short, coherent message from everyone, ideally something personal. If there's any doubt, we can ask questions and give responses to each other.
#+end_quote

The protocol wasn't fully specified by the text, but presumably if anyone encountered an /in/coherent message, they wouldn't overtly react to it, but would send a garbage message that will definitely seem like another protocol failure no matter what an attacker does with it (and it won't have the right letter distribution).

The more repeats there are, the better frequency analysis works. The protocol includes the character set, so it's no secret. The language would be a guess, but not a hard one.

Everything is a factor, the world is a web connected by countless strands. Every action you do has an effect, even through the butterfly effect of bumping atoms about.

Well no, that's completely wrong since you have a single sample you can basically make zero assumptions. We have no idea who Julian was before hand, he could have been anyone. At the very least we know that Uther was someone completely ordinary prior to becoming the Chosen One. Regardless it might be basically non-existent but it isn't non-existent. We have no guarantee that Uther knows who the next Chosen One will be. Even if it's really small odds (and no one is a position to even guess what the odds are) that Uther is wrong then again you're up against the infinite value of extinction.
