Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Curious to hear a less fitness / bodybuilding focused perspective -- of [[https://i.imgur.com/PZVrOSk.jpg][the following lads]], who do you think has the most aesthetically pleasing physique?

(ignoring differences in pose, lighting, & oiliness, and comparing only those included in the set above)

edit, as a follow-up question: circling back to a favorite theme of this subreddit, young-adult fantasy literature -- suppose the Forces of Evil have swept across the land, and you're to hire one of the aforementioned blokes to guarantee your safe passage across the Forbidden Forest, the Chaotic Crags, the Unkempt Undercity, and other Place of Interest, all while carrying an Object of Power well-known to serve as a homing beacon to those who wish you harm. Taking as equal the experiences and equipment of the well-muscled men above (i.e. they're /all/ in boiled leathers marked by hard use and careful maintenance, or /all/ in golden, gleaming full-plate enchanted by the king's finest, etc.), which would you trust the most to succeed in such a venture? Narratively speaking, whose physique connotes the greatest strength and overall competence? (IRL, 'show'-muscles are nearly as functional as they are aesthetic, contrary to media portrayal; Ronnie Coleman in h) and Konstantin Konstantinov in g) weighed about the same off-season and had very similar ~2100lb big-3s, for example)

edit_2, the extra details of the previous edit were maybe not too helpful here. An alternative scenario could be if you were the casting director for some fantasy miniseries, who'd project the best image of valorous heroism when clad in gleaming plate, or grizzled competence in cuir bouilli, etc.

It's not A's muscularity that throws me off specifically.

That said, I tend to hang out with people whose lives are sedentary and whose exercise routines are structured around cardiovascular health and flexibility, not weights. I have a lot of friends who are fit (including a fair number of marathon runners) but none of 'em look like that with their shirts off. (And the ones that do a lot of weights tend to also be pretty chubby; ridiculously strong, yes, but rounded.) So there's a definite weirdness that arises from that.

****** Hmm. Yeah, actually, now that I think about it all of them except for G appear to have a bodyfat percentage of 10% or lower.

There's a saying: abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. You can do as many crunches as you want, but basically abs will be invisible until you get down to about 12% bodyfat.

Pictures for a broader context than op's pictures give:

[[https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fa72ce512829b881c4615a61c6fb731c]]

[[https://kubexfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg]]

I concede that an extremely low bodyfat percentage looks pretty unnatural. I don't personally prefer the way it looks. 10 to 12% bodyfat is what I would consider the ultimate ideal for somebody trying to "look like they lift weights" while still looking "normal", and 12 to 14% bodyfat still extraordinarily impressive. I went with 14 rather than 15 because one percent does actually make a difference with how defined your muscles look. One percent can be the difference between seeing the outline of your abs and looking like you don't have abs at all. 13 or 14 percent is /pushing it/ as far as ab visibility is concerned, at that level they'll only be visible in certain lighting.

My own personal goal is to be able to maintain a 12 to 14 percent bodyfat percentage, but I can't seem to force myself to go more than a week without chips and end up eating three or four entire goddamn family-sized/party-sized bags of potato chips every single week for three weeks out of every month. I'm probably at 18 or 19% percent bodyfat, hard to tell just comparing to pictures, but I've got A's level of muscular development so it sits differently on me than it would on someone who doesn't lift. My biceps are actually bigger than his, they just don't look so chiseled/defined because of the fat surrounding them. There's no such thing as "low weight with high reps to get 'cut/ripped/toned' and high reps with low weight to get big", being 'cut/ripped/toned' is exclusively a function of bodyfat percent.

Anyways, I'm not sure if any of what I typed was in service of my point, but maybe your initial comment confused me because I'm looking at it differently, like, I'm looking at the size of the muscles, not how "ripped" they are. Obviously I'd prefer A and B and C to all have at least like one or one-and-a-half percent higher bodyfat. Is that the thing that makes you feel like it looks absurd? Understandable. I'd agree. There's tons of dudes who only weigh like 135lbs but have a sub 10% bodyfat so there's no fat covering what muscles they have so you can see their muscle definition, and they think they're "muscular" but they're not. You mentioned C being the least uncanny valley. Other than G, he's probably got the highest bodyfat percent, probably 10 to 12 percent rather than sub 10 percent.

If you can imagine them all being a bit less "ripped," a bit more fat obscuring the definition of the muscles, would that change your answer? Would the "smaller" ones still be more aesthetically pleasing, or do you think musculature on the level of E or F or H would look good if the muscles were covered with a bit more fat? (And F and H in particular probably have the lowest levels of bodyfat, particularly H, that dude is almost certainly at below 6% bodyfat, like, looking at his quads you can see each of the three top ones (one's underneath the middle one) individually.)

If we're spitting hairs, it should be noted that charts like [[https://kubexfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg][this]] tend to "underestimate" bf% a bit relative to more reliable methods.

Also, your abs are not "reasonably visible," they're just straight up visible. Just about every single one of those charts I've ever seen would use your picture to represent 12%... And you're 15%? ... I'm probably definitely over 20%, then. I might be creeping up on 25%. I /seriously/ have /got/ to stop eating potato chips the way I do.

********* I think it's just much more recent! I remember seeing those charts in the mid-2000s, and think they emerged from prevailing broscience informed lightly by caliper measurements etc. (which, when I looked into it last, tended to just be based off perhaps not the most reliable or x-population generalizable linear models fit via OLS back in the day... I actually tried to reach out in the mid-2010s to some science-y-er fitness folks to see if any would be willing to collaborate on something a bit more sophisticated but didn't get any bites). DXA was only invented in the late 80s, and only worked its way to the 'fitness enthusiast' crowd as a way to track body composition in the 2000s & 2010s.

Thanks! I will note that I found the strongest possible lighting for those pics too haha. [[https://www.instagram.com/p/BPvwEjOjcrd/][Here's a shot]] in more natural light (but still flexing hard as lol, and also not exactly selected at random from all possible candidates ;])

One way to maybe think of it from the perspective of appearance or athletic performance is that for a given physique, higher bodyfat % is always better because it represents that much more possible 'progress' able to be made (e.g. to look leaner or hit a lower weight class, if those are goals). But it's maybe a bit worse from the perspective of overall health and wellness.

Regardless, I'm still around where I knew I was, somewhere between 18 and 23% bodyfat. I've been at the grocery store for the last couple of hours, and no chips came home with me. I've been in a semi-dirty lite-bulk for basically the entirety of the last 6 years (except for 15ish months where I stopped lifting entirely due to impinging or tearing my rotator cuff, and a couple of other several-month pauses due to a health problem... and actually now that I think about it I did pretty much everything incorrectly for the entire first year and I think I was only eating like 1600 calories a day). At this point, I should probably get serious and shift focus away from getting bigger and focus on dropping the bodyfat by at least like 3 to 5%.

******* Keep in mind many of those photos were taken at bodybuilding competitions. They're not what those guys look like day to day, that's months of somewhat unhealthy optimization to get an optimal appearance to win a contest.

​

OP shouldn't have picked photos from those scenarios, they aren't 'achievable' to anyone, even body builders. Sure you can get there, after months of preparation, for a duration of 1-2 days but that's not how you're gonna look in general.

​

Optimally you stay at 10-15% bodyfat, at 15% you can still see abs, your diet can be crap and takes little effort to maintain.

******* You absolutely nailed it, in way better words than I could have. It's not the level of muscle size or fitness; it's that lack of bodyfat and the resulting "pop" of the muscles. In that second link you posted, I think the 15% picture is how /I'd/ like to look, and the 10-12 picture is what I think of as the visible-abs end of the canny valley, if you will.

I unfortunately don't think I can give you a good answer to your hypothetical question, because I can't seem to create an image in my head of how, e.g., H would look at 10% or 15% bodyfat instead of like 4%.

Helmut Strebl. Leanest man in the world, 4% bodyfat. A youtube channel I'm subscribed to, Athlean-X, just put out a video today that mentioned him. I actually now think H is probably 6 or 7% bodyfat, rather than sub 6.

*** as a straight woman (who was once described by a friend as "the most aggressiely straight woman she's ever met"), I... don't really find any of them aesthetically pleasuing.

I tend to like dadbods and skinny wiry men, and if I had to pick it would be a) and g) - a because he has a really defined adonis V which I love, and g beause he seems to have the most body fat.

That said, I'm also a domme, and I would find all except f and h really, really sexy if they were dressed in pink frilly lingere and begging for me to peg them (I am going on a date with a world-class athelete tomorrow and really hoping we get along because we would both like to do this), so it really depends what for.

As far as YA literature/casting the next GOT, I'd probably go for a, b, c, as they look the least "unrealistic", which is great both for men watching (to more easily identify with the character) and for male-attracted people watching (so think that this sexy person is someone they could reasonably kiss).

hope that helps!

Quote from video description:

  The external obliques insert onto the iliac crest and have a tendinous sheath that blends into this attachment called the aponeurosis. This is the “v'” cut line that you are familiar with in the lower ab region.

So the V itself is a tendinous sheath. That tendinous sheath is technically part of the obliques, so you're technically right, but also I think most people are referring to the external oblique muscles when they use the word "obliques" on its own without any modifiers or qualifiers. When I hear "obliques," I don't think "tendons and fascia." The transverse abdominis is technically part of the obliques too, but I don't think anybody thinks you're talking about the transverse abdominis when you say the word "obliques," y'know?

**** Insofar as I find men attractive (I baselessly believe that everyone is technically bisexual to some degree, and "as aggressively straight as possible" is like 95/5 in favor of the opposite sex and "the gayest of gay" is like 5/95, and most of the people who identify as "bisexual" are probably around 70/30 to 30/70... I think I'm like 65/35 in favor of the opposite sex. Obviously all those numbers are probably wrong, maybe "as straight as possible" and "as gay as possible" are 99/1 and 1/99 instead of 95/5 and 5/95, just trying to build a framework to illustrate the idea of being "just barely bi," like, I can comfortably imagine myself going as far as third base with a guy, but the idea of "going all the way" is, like, the opposite of appealing... Um, actually, maybe being comfortable with the thought of performing oral on a guy might be /way/ more than "just barely bi"... Hmm.)

*/ANYWAYS/*, tangent aside - Insofar as I find men attractive, I think what I find most attractive is a body like A's but with just a couple more pounds of fat and maybe a few fewer pounds of muscle. I think Tom Holland's got a great physique, like, my ultimate goal is to reach his level of fitness (I've gotta give up the potato chips). RDJ's got a pretty fine physique in the first Iron Man, but it seems like in later movies he lost more fat and built more muscle, and that's just not my taste. I definitely have an aesthetic appreciation for physiques all the way up to the level of H, but I don't find extreme and/or lean muscularity attractive.

***** IDK, I don't know what your qualia is, but my qualia is, apart from a period of my teenagerhood when I was bouncing around sexuality-ly speaking, I have absolutely 0 desire towards any woman (and I'm not a prude or anything, I've had plenty of opportunities, etc) but very strong desire towards men.

Do I believe that there's no way I could ever want to be with a woman under any circumstances? of course not, and I'm open to those sorts of things if they were to come up.

I personally find it really invalidating to my sexuality when people say "everyone is a little bit bisexual". I'm not, and it makes me feel "defective" that I don't want to sleep with women when people say that. I know it's a bit rich as a straight person coming through and saying "I am so discriminated against for my sexuality, pity me!", but this was/is my struggle, as much of a mustard seed as it is compared with others.

****** I don't mean like mentally/consciously bi, I mean like genetically. Bonobos are just as genetically related to us as chimps are, and all bonobos are fully bisexual. That might not be relevant to humans, maybe it is, who knows?

I didn't intend to invalidate anyone's sexuality, and I'm sorry if it came across that way. I just believe that the genetics of sexuality don't work that way. And that's not entirely baseless:

[[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/there-is-no-gay-gene-there-is-no-straight-gene-sexuality-is-just-complex-study-confirms]]

I'm pretty sure we all, /strictly biologically speaking/, have some capacity to turn out either way. Maybe. That's all. Maybe I chose a poor way of illustrating that in my initial comment. The comment was getting long, and I had gone off on a long accidental tangent. In your reply to my other comment, you said "i am probably getting a bit too enthusiastic but i love talking about how attractive men are" so I came back up to your first one and intended to mirror your "as a straight woman, this is what I find aesthetically pleasing in men" with my own "as a straight man, this is what I find aesthetically pleasing in men" and then while I was typing I realized "oh, I guess I'm not technically a straight man."

Maybe I should expand on the tangent to try to fix it. Maybe I was born with a genetic capacity for 80/20, or 95/5, or 70/30 (who knows?) and in practice that resulted in an expression of 50/50. Maybe you (and the majority of humans) were born with a genetic capacity for 90/10, or 99/1, or whatever it actually is (who knows?) and for you as an individual that resulted in an expression of 100/0.

I wasn't intending to make a claim about your own mind or anyone else's mind, just trying to express my (admittedly flimsy) understanding of the underlying genetics. I don't believe that people who are straight (or people who are gay) have some sort of subconscious attraction to people of the same sex (or people of the opposite sex). I'm doing some reading, and it turns out that some people believe that sort of thing, and I don't believe that.

*** Aesthetically pleasing (but not necessarily more attractive) are, to me personally, a) and c). But I'm definitely biased against too prominent muscles.

Edit: regarding your edit, I would've picked d), who seems to strike the best balance between showoff-y muscles and looking strong/competent (if that makes sense). g) is also close, but he makes me slightly uncomfortable. To be fair, I find the edit strange---I wouldn't choose a guard based on who has the most aesthetically pleasing physique.

**** The guard question was less about aesthetic pleasure and more about tropes, and which sorts would be narratively most associated with competence in a fantasy setting (also, presumably physique would play some role in assessment of IRL guard evaluation too, but maybe more-or-less plateauing before the first of the images). I feel in comics [[https://i.imgur.com/aS3mjBP.jpg][muscularity]] tends to scale well with [[https://i.imgur.com/5gY8oNq.png][competence]], but fantasy favors [[https://i.imgur.com/ajJMfMJ.png][wirier]] bodies, with [[https://i.imgur.com/Ynq2qyH.png][larger men]] largely serving to get worf'ed and show that muscles are meaningless.

***** In a fantasy setting, I would absolutely go with G, and stay the hell away from D. Body language/ expression make G much more approachable, and he is the only one that looks like he manages to eat well. Older (than the young ones) + more body fat + still obviously competent + not scary. Basically you go for the proven hunter. A and D look like they will kill and eat you for protein, and F and H don't give a shit about you. Edit: the tropes for competent big guys I think of are gentle giant, stalwart bulwark, stern instructor, classic hero played straight.

*** Aesthetically pleasing? G, or B. I think the extreme definition you get by cutting body fat over powerful musculature looks uncanny. Fascinating, and very aesthetically distinct, but not exactly pleasing to me.

To the edit, for assessing competence/reading physique for trope-driven competence, that gets very complicated very quickly. As a character in-world, the sort of situation you've posed makes me unlikely to hire anybody. The sorts of people used to accepting pay for prowess seem just as likely to be hired by my enemies, and trust matters a lot more than competence.

If I have some external reason to believe they are sufficiently trustworthy, and all equally so, then I let them decide among themselves who's best suited to help me.

If you just want me to identify, as a reader rather than a character, which body strikes me as most badass/competent... for me personally, bodybuilder's physiques just don't rate that high for me. Sure, weightlifting can demonstrate functional strength of a kind, but still doesn't really translate well to what I imagine the ultimate warrior's physique should look like, or what kinds of function I equate with functional strength. Still probably go with G, here, just because I'm inclined to have more faith in somebody who hasn't spent a lot of time cutting body fat.

*** RL warriors in Ancient and Medieval times were either wiry muscled and lithe (skirmishers, standing armies, duelists, assassins), or (if well fed, and specifically kept for combat like mercenaries or gladiators) would be heavily muscular and fat.

The bodybuilder physique did not exist in pre-modern warfare context: it requires and extreme diet and training regimen that makes no sense for a fighter. A medieval-ish fighter would have to either have a lot of stamina and be quick, or have a lot of stamina and be durable (stocky with layers of fat over muscle to protect from blows and glancing cuts).

Remove some muscle from the second left guy, or add a big fat belly on the second right guy, and you have yourself a proper heroic build.

As for pleasing physique: I would say the 3 from the left are nice looking, if a bit over-build.

**** Haha hence my inclusion of the world's first bodybuilder in the lineup, b) Eugen Sandow, born 1867! A bit hard to leave humanity behind without ample supplementation of exogenous androgens & other hormones :D

Although I'm not sure I agree with your analysis -- just because something did not exist back when, doesn't mean that today's supraphysiologically dosed super athletes wouldn't wipe the floor with ancient competitors (see steadily creeping world records across the board). At least unarmed -- afaict, most e.g. MMA exhibition matches between champion welterweight fighters & middling heavyweights pretty decisively show the lack of, err, zero-sum DnD mechanics governing real life combat lol. I'm sure medieval warriors with access to modern nutrition, training, and drugs would look quite a bit different if optimizing for combat ability ;]

Regardless, I think the rules differ quite a bit for narrative powered fantasy archetypes, anyhow!

*** Optimally you'd be asking women if that's your target audience.. They'd probably say A, C and D.

​

There's a point in attractiveness level where it doesn't matter anymore, once you're a 9-10 then it's just personal preference based on what's most genetically compatible with the observer. Comparing at that point is a bit meaningless, it'll just show the genetic compatibility of the group you're comparing, you'd see different results on england vs italy for instance.

​

To the edit, simply put I'd get the one my SO would be least likely to fuck, and bonus points if they look different from me making it easier for me to avoid raising some other dudes child, specially when DNA tests don't exist. So probably H because he looks taller and scarier. Also height is OP in melee combat, more reach, mass, strength etc.

**** I was actually far more interested in the men's perspective, and otherwise aesthetics as independent from sexual attraction (in the same way that one might find an artwork or mountain ranges or panthers beautiful). The whole ‘heterosexual women signaling / counter-signaling disinterest in muscularity' discussion is boring and overdone, not to mention somewhat well-studied, at least in western audiences (e.g. [[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819][1]], [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704919852918][2]], from a quick google).

***** You changed the question and I'm going to give a similar reply given that the situation is basically the same.

They all look capable, and like they'd fit that role. Preference here will just show other biases, like people preferring the actor that looks like them or a friend, or some random subconscious heuristic.

To get the results you seem to want, what would be needed is to have people that look different. One average, one skinny, one chubby, one chubby strong, one ripped etc. Maybe hide all their faces, or photoshop them to all have the same face. Then the results would show you what musculature level is optimal to get the desired perception.
