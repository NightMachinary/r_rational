So this might be a thing only the small cross section of Naruto fans and Rational/Rationalist fiction fans might care about, but I figured I'd ask you all about it.

Whenever I read rational Naruto fanfiction they tend to take the stance that the Hyuga are /blatantly irrational/. That the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Byakugan][Byakugan]] would be infinitely better for a ranged weapon style than the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Gentle_Fist][Gentle Fist]]. Nothing exemplifies this more than their ultimate technique being a 64 hit consecutive strike to precise locations on a targets body. While it looks cool, [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sixty-Four_Palms][Eight Trigrams 64 Palms]] should be more like Eight Trigrams "I stab you in the heart".

So normally the argument goes they're a clan stuck in their ways and would be more effective if they did other things. I want to see what set of truths we can all come up with that make using the Gentle Fist optimal, with as little potential contradictions to the universe as possible. (Although if you don't know the series then just say whatever and we can discuss it!)


** 1. Naruto ninja are incredibly resistant to blunt trauma. Even low-level ones. Disabling chakra usage is more efficient in some situations.

2. Naruto ninja are incredibly fast. I think of the 64 Palms as a kind of ritualized, intensely practiced, sequence of strikes. Because it's so practiced and rigid, it's very fast, as most highly practiced (as opposed to improvised) techniques are.

3. range attacks need to be incredible high-level to do damage in Naruto to someone near your level. The only useful ones we see in Naruto are usually from A or S-rank ninja: Rasenshuriken, Amateratsu, Kakuza's attacks, etc. I think as a general rule with some exceptions: ranged attacks are not great.

*** I don't think this is true in canon - at least, not in the manga. I can't remember a single instance of characters not bothering to block attacks because they can't be hurt by them. There's plenty of that stuff in Bleach, but in Naruto? Top tier ninjas are afraid of getting hit with kunai or shuriken, a single punch can break ribs if it's not blocked properly and an explosive tag took out Nagato's legs. I always really liked that semi-realistic feel to it.

Sure, there's parts in the anime where someone gets hurled into a rock and it shatters, and there's a part where Pain gets wacked in the head with a mountain repeatedly by the Kyubi, but I think those parts are best uh... interpreted in a less than literal sense. <_<

**** That's fair but if you do take it literally, then it still works. The reason they dodge other hits is because it does comparable amounts of damage. And the fact that they can /survive/ getting hit multiple times by attacks of that class or higher, prove that they are incredibly durable, even if they dodge most of them.

Like boxers can tank multiple hits from their opponent, but they still try and dodge / block each of them.

***** Garden was specifically saying that ranged attacks are useless. That doesn't mesh with what you're saying. Of course, you're right about anime logic being the problem: The reason why characters use kicks instead of knives is because if they used a lethal weapon they'd be much less likely to hit - because the fight would be over if they did. Same with a Rasengan being 99% more likely to hit the enemy if it's used as a finishing move. But if the goal is to make the Naruto world make sense, the question is how to move *away* from all of that.

And honestly, I think the only way to do that is to tone things down a bit. The moment you say that some people can move at near the speed of light, you can forget any hope of keeping things consistent. You can still have people *say* things like that about legendary ninjas, but if it's actually true, your setting is borked.

** Capture of enemy ninja for interrogation or stealing techniques/bloodlines is far more valuable than outright killing enemy ninja, especially for the higher-ranked/more skilled enemies. But this is rarely an option with all the ninjutsu-based strength, mobility, suicide, etc. techniques available. (It's been a while since I've read/watched the source material--do we ever see a non-genin captured outside of a temporary genjutsu or a specialized techniques like the Yamanaka's?)

Gentle Fist attacks shut down any chakra-based techniques that would allow escape.

** I don't think the Hyūga are particularly better suited to ranged combat, because the hard part of dealing ranged damage has almost nothing to do with seeing your opponent, and because ranged attacks in the Narutoverse are generally fairly lame, barring key exceptions the average ninja can't use.

Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms makes more sense when you take into account that Narutoverse characters are shown to be incredibly tanky (like, immune-to-hypersonic-bullets tanky), and the Hyūga's CQC abilities, while effective, don't have the high damage cap that other movesets can deal.

Then remember that ninjutsu are arbitrary. If you could design a technique that did whatever, nobody's techniques are anywhere close to optimal. Maybe the consecutive doubling thing is just how it has to work.

#+begin_quote
  Shikamaru shook his head. “The Hyūga don't really use weapons. They have their own Gentle Fist style, which uses the Byakugan to detect their opponent's chakra points and closes them off by forcing their own chakra into their body with their fingertips.”

  “What? That's stu-” /Not/ stupid, Naruto quickly corrected himself. A technique like that might not be well-suited to single combat, but it would be invaluable in capturing enemy ninjas alive, since you never knew what secret techniques they might otherwise use to escape even without being able to move their arms and legs. Couple that with their eyes' information gathering ability and the Hyūga were the perfect clan to assist the Anbu and the Hokage in making unwanted people disappear into the night. He glanced towards Lord Hyūga Hiashi, who was sitting in a seat of honour in the front row, watching the fight with an impassionate gaze. /No wonder they're considered a noble clan, with a power like that.../
#+end_quote

Basically, 64 Palms is only stupid if you assume it's a continuous technique that *has* to be executed in that order to deal bonus damage, or something. It makes perfect sense if you assume it's just a sequence to seal off the target's most important chakra points in order to prevent any chance of escape, and which you wouldn't normally use during single combat. In fact, given how valuable the Hyuga are, you shouldn't be committing them to combat /at all/ unless you're desperate. It'd be like sending your medic into melee.

This is also my preferred way of rationalizing strange things in canon. Instead of mocking something for being dumb, re-interpret it so that it makes sense. I also agree that the whole "use ranged attacks" idea is the kind of cleverness that wouldn't work in reality. It's not as if great eyesight makes you a great archer in real life.

** Look at it from the perspective of utility to the village, especially with the context that the Hyuuga and Uchiha were the founding clans of Hidden Leaf.

The Uchiha are famed for stealing /techniques/ from their opponents, which would be an incredible boon to a newly-founded village with only two clan libraries to draw upon.

Now what the Hyuuga bring to the table is new /clans/. It would not surprise me whatsoever that one of the reasons why Hidden Leaf has a million and a half different clans is because, back before they worked on their squeaky clean image, the Hyuuga contributed to the village by capturing enemy ninja alive, keeping them prisoner via chakra blocking, and breeding a new clan out of them. Basically the same thing Cloud did in the series.

Of course, capturing ninja for interrogation purposes has a lot of utility too which is why they've kept their focus on chakra blocking to present-day, but if you ask me that's why they started doing it to begin with.

Also if anything the 8 trigrams is supposed to be not overkill but overprepared to a certain extent it's supposed to cover all bases in a way that it might not have much use against a superior opponent ala mascara but if your reactions and speed are equivalent or better than your oppponent you can win the 1v1. It's I hesitate to say like a dueling technique because of how dueling doesnt and isnt supposed to be real fighting, but the way they describe it as something only taught to the Head(s) of the household means that it was like a technique made for their Clan heads to win against other Clan heads in say the Warring Clans Era. Also the fact that it continued to not be taught meant that there were fewer opprtunities for the technique to be analyzed for weaknesses by opposing forces.

** I think the main problem with ranged attacks is how fast ninjas in Naruto are. In fact in many cases I'd argue higher level ninja are faster than projectiles. A ranged style is only good for as long as you can keep your opponent at bay and in Naruto ninja are exceptionally good at closing the distance. We see only a few long-range specialists in Naruto, and the premier one also specialises in using close-ranged weaponry (Ten-Ten). A Long-Range specialist would have to rely heavily on stealth and the element of surprise - a tall order in a world so stuffed with not only super-speed, but also massive AoE attacks that destroy cover and a bunch of pretty over-powered sensory abilities that make stealth obsolete as well. It's surprisingly hard to hide in the world of ninjas, because everybody else is also a ninja. And the element of surprise is even harder to utilise properly - even if you get off the perfect snipe there's a pretty good chance your opponent has such fast, ninja reflexes that they can dodge your shot anyway and then your cover is completely blown.

Also an easy way to rationalize the 64 palms is this; this is a world where chakra exists, and is the foundation for so many bullshit invulnerability/avoid death techniques that it can be hard to keep track. The 64 palms (when executed as a kill technique) could easily start with the Gentle Fist equivalent of 'I stab you in the heart!', with the rest of the attacks focusing on shutting of the opponent's chakra system so they can't use some kind of bullshit back-up technique to survive the usually lethal opening barrage.

But here is my main idea. There is perhaps one great Long-Range vs. Close Range battle in Naruto - Kidomaru vs. Neji. In this fight Kidomaru notes that he has to resort to long-range fighting because attempting to go hand-to-hand with a Hyuga is suicide; ninja are entirely dependant on chakra usage, so the moment the Hyuga lands one good hit they can often end the fight. So Kidomaru retreats and starts a long-range fight, only there is one major downside. As I mentioned before, sensory abilities are a direct counter to the stealth and surprise needed to make precision, long-range fighting viable in a world as high-speed as Naruto. And the Hyuga happen to have the most over-powered sensory ability on the planet - the Byakugan. The lengths Kidomaru has to go to just to land a few good hits on Neji are comical, and would be far beyond the abilities of any common ninja - the average combatant in that situation would be forced into close-range (where the Hyuga reign supreme) or would be forced to flee.

So essentially the Hyuga found themselves in one of the few settings where long-range combat is actually at a disadvantage and high-speed, close-range fighting is the norm, and then went about making themselves almost unbeatable in close-range. They essentially force their opponents into long-range (and therefore into disadvantage) and are almost impossible to surprise or snipe; they can literally see an arrow, bomb, or kunai coming from a mile away. When fighting the Hyuga it is often a dead-if-you-do-dead-if-you-don't situation. If you get into close range you die, but if you stay at range you end up against someone with abilities almost optimised for dealing with projectiles.

This whole strategy, of course, breaks down once the enemies get strong enough that they have ways to easily deal with the Hyuga ability to suppress chakra, or have projectiles over-powered enough that the defensive prowess of the Hyuga don't matter. And this of course covers most of the A-S rank bad guys in the series. The Hyuga are a finnicky, but very effective build - it hard counters 90% of their enemies, but is completely in-equipped to deal with the remaining 10%.

But in those few cases they also have plenty of time to see the danger coming and just run away.

Law of physics say that the speed of the ninja throwing it influences the speed of the projectiles. So higher level ones can throw ones that are also faster.

Since most battles involving projectiles don't involve running away from them in straight lines like a cartoon character, this doesn't come up much either.

Also, at this point, from centuries of usage, people should already /know/ where the primary chakra points are, and design armor to compensate for people trying to use such tricks.

**** This is a world where ninjas can use magical chakra techniques to move incredibly quickly (e.g the Body Flicker or Replacement Technique) - I'd argue that it's easily possible for a high level ninja with access to these techniques to be far faster than any projectile they could throw.

The entire point of the Gentle Fist is that it makes armour useless. They are projecting chakra into their opponents body, not physically poking them very hard. It is meant to be so devastating because it's almost impossible to actually block, severely restricting defensive options and giving the Hyuga a massive advantage in melee range. Any armour thick enough to block the Gentle Fist would most likely be heavy enough to slow the ninja down, which is a serious problem. This may be a universe were dodging is easy, but its also a universe where offence tends to trump defence - not many ninja can actually afford to take a serious hit from a rival. Failure to dodge is usually going to be a death sentence, so lowering your mobility by wearing armour isn't usually going to be worth it.

** I brought this up a few other times, but my understanding is that the multi-kilometer range of Hinata was an extreme aberration and possibly an indicator that she had some kind of mutation that exchanged precision at close range in exchange for extreme range. I believe that this is backed up in canon as Hinata is the only Hyūga who demonstrated a range on her Byakugan that extends beyond close range and the range of Neji (a prodigy) was limited to a few meters.

This seems like a very simple way to explain why the Hyūga primarily focused on close-combat while also removing the ridiculous intelligence advantage that would come from access to such a ludicrously powerful spying tool.

** Hyuuga don't see particularly further than ordinary people though, or with particularly better acuity.

Hyuuga advantages are

1) can see through solid objects 2) expanded field of view (and presumably better ability to process information to compensate for seeing more) 3) can see chakra

The relevance of chakra is that it's easier to spot people, so I assume that suitability for ranged combat is what you mean. But, you have to consider fights that aren't 1v1

Expanded field of view means that a hyuuga sniper is ignoring half of his field of vision (the half behind him), and a hyuuga sniper can't have walls between him and enemies (or he'd have to fire attacks through the walls) so he's ignoring his xray vision, and a hyuuga sniper is vulnerable to return fire. If a hyuuga is assassinating a single target or participating in a sniper duel, that's fine, but the Hyuuga clan developed techniques in a time of clan warfare, as in groups vs groups.

So a Hyuuga sniper launches a distance jutsu, kills one or two enemies, then gets bombarded with return fire, and the best defense he has, the rotation, is chakra demanding and locks him in place. And that defense is still better than what's available to almost any other clan.

But, if a Hyuuga gets into a large group melee, the enemy can't just bombard him without large amounts of friendly fire. On top of that, in a cluster of bodies, a Hyuuga can see far more of what's happening than a normal person, and isn't as vulnerable to getting stabbed from behind as a normal ninja.

In this chaotic melee, the 64 palms becomes far more valuable. It mission kills basically any ninja other than a jinchuuriki, leaves a prisoner for interrogation or ransom, is quick to use, difficult to defend against, has degrees of success other than perfect victory and no-sell, takes a small amount of chakra/stamina and moreover, enemies further away still have to worry about friendly fire for their fallen comrades. Its ideal for messy, long melees between large groups of opponents.

You know how in canon, Madara dances through an army? That's how I imagine every high level hyuuga in the Warring Clans Era

Moreover, despite being just as strong a clan, you'll notice that the Hyuuga never had to deal with the same level of grudges as the Uchiha, which could be for a lot of reasons, but I imagine that ransoming captured ninja rather than executing them probably made them a "less bad" ninja clan to deal with than the more battle happy clans like the Uchiha or Kaguya.

That said, I always wanted to see a Hyuuga puppeteer burying themselves and fight a battle by proxy with puppets, using the Byakugan to see through 20m of earth as chakra threads control a puppet army without putting the ninja at risk.

** 1 byakugan comes at a reduced depth perception, making it less effective at precision maneuvers like hitting a target at range.

2 Byakugan requires a lot of focus, reducing your effectiveness at blocking and countering your opponents' moves, when they're not doing something rendered extremely obvious and ineffective by the Byakugan's 355 degree vision. Extra focus is also needed to keep moving your head to cover the blind cone.

1. To make up for this weakness in no. 2 the Hyuuga have developed a technique which disables a foe's ability to attack them from the outside in. Rather than trying to slip past a foe's defense as most warriors would call the efficient or effective route, the Hyuuga attack each exposed point of defense, to stop it from defending the next. They attack the fingers, to force the opponent to use their palms, then the palms and elbows to disable those as points of impact. They work on the feet and knees, head, shoulders, and work their way in slowly to set up a scenario where the opponent is utterly helpless to prevent the next strike right up until the deadly final one.

** You want to make it optimal? Make it fit a true Ninja mold--be sneaky about it.

The 64-strike thing is an obfuscation of the truth. There's only 5 or 6 key points that *need* to be hit. They're not hitting an actual 64 times to do it, probably only about 12 or 16, but a majority of those are feints to hide the true nature of the technique. Anyone who has seen it believes the target will be getting hit by the full advertised number of attacks, which serves to distract them from the truth as well as demoralize them because they believe an opponent who can pull it off is /actually that fast/ and they would be fools to try and block them all.

It *feels* like 64 strikes because many of those are instant hits to pain nerves which react a split second later causing agony farther down the line.

The 'exploding backward' effect it caused both by the energy expenditure of the user and a shockwave of chakra from the target as their closed chakra lines expel the energy they had been containing. Since it's expelled in the direction of the attack, they function as tiny little rocket boosters propelling the target backward just as the kinetic force from the attacker also pushes them.

The technique isn't use to kill, but to immobilize, capture, and demoralize. Watching your ally get hit with it and turned into a helpless ragdoll is enough to make you not want to get hit, either. It's also good in negotiation purposes because you can take down their most skilled/powerful guy without killing him, which makes it easier to negotiate an end to the hostilities later as they don't have families with new blood oaths to avenge against the technique's practitioners.

** 1) Ranged attacks have travel time. Gunpowder isn't a thing so you're looking at bows and arrows at best, and ninja are extremely fast with extreme twitch reflexes. It doesn't matter if you can aim and hit a stationary target 10 kilometers away, you'll never hit a ninja who's aware they're in a fight. You might get an ambush attack on them... but you might not, given that detection techniques are a thing.

Getting closer obviously means less travel time but it also puts you, the dedicated ranged combatant, closer to the dedicated melee combatant. You'd have to find a sweet spot between them being close enough to not be able to dodge, and far enough not to be able to cover the distance and kill you. It's entirely believable that for any real threat in the series, no such range exists.

2) Naruto's tech level isn't advanced enough to create projectiles that can fly straight over those huge distances anyway. You can aim your bow/kunai/whatever as well as you like, imperfections in the metal/ the wind/etc. will have it go off course.

3) Stealth is supposed to be a thing in the setting, even if the manga itself didn't really go for it. Many fights will begin with the parties finding each other at a relatively short range, where the melee combatant will win.

Overall, I think that to be viable any ranged technique needs to either also work as a close-quarters technique, have a negligible travel time (so lasers, or teleporting projectiles?) or have such a large area of effect that the opponent can't dodge even if they see it coming, which is /massive./

This is kinda contradicting. Why are ninjas fast? Because of chakra. What is chakra? Some kind of energy they can use to affect the world. What do you need to make things move very fast? Apply enough energy to it.

****** Yeah, it's a common fanfic trope that Naruto is using too much chakra, and so his jutsu fail, but it's not supported by canon.

Narratively, naruto always struggles to actually use the power available to him, whether he's not stick to a tree when learning to climb, sinking into hot springs when trying to walk on water, or summoning tadpoles instead of frogs.

This also fits with his character arc. Naruto knows what kind of person he is, and doesn't really change as a person that much, so his arc is more about finding a place where it's ok to be himself, and with jutsu, he has the power to pull off amazing feats, but struggles to reach the point where he can apply it. And a lot of his biggest moments have him juxtaposing a personal realization or declaration in line with his existing character and finally bridging that gap.

And it contrasts with Sasuke, who overpowers the exercise when tree walking, changes his fighting style multiple times, and starts out with big flashy fireballs and lightning strikes, before eventually settling on Amenotejikara spam, because Sasuke doesn't really know who he is or who he wants to be, so he does what he thinks is expected of him with as much effort as possible, starting with standard Uchiha fireballs, then moving to Kakashi-esque lightning jutsu (only bigger) and Orochimaru style summoning, then switching to Itachi's more flashy jutsu of Susanoo and Ameterasu, before, at the end of his arc, moving on to his own custom jutsu and special abilities, which he uses in far more conservative and low key ways. Seriously, watch the Danzo v Sasuke fight and then watch the Naruto and Sasuke v Momoshiki fight. That's a big change in fighting style.

******* I stopped watching shippuuden at some point and read it to the end as manga. I was getting really bored of watching one piece, naruto, detective conan... all of they are those looooong neverending series and manga is just so much faster.

**** Okay, hypothetically you could wave your hand and declare that it's possible to use chakra to power a gun - and you definitely are doing so, because chakra isn't real and whether or not you can "apply" that energy in that form is entirely down to an author's discretion - but the fact remains that such devices do not exist in the setting, and as such aren't really relevant to the question of why ranged attacks don't work in Naruto.

***** I'm not talking about a gun, just ranged attacks. Just launching items from your hand. Apply chakra to create an explosion or otherwise propel the item like Naruto does with his feet.

****** I would be amazed if it were possible to launch a projectile on a straight path across long distances via a controlled explosion etc. with your hand, and indeed have seen no such technique. Modern handguns are accurate to around 100 feet in the hands of an experienced shooter, with machine-crafted bullets.

Your first edit isn't a real thing, that's a fanon wiki. Those images are from several other anime.

Your second edit refers to Boruto canon, which takes place in the future when the tech level has gone up.

******* Oops on that first link. :D

But yea, they do a lot of impossible things. Surely they can help aiming with chakra. The dudes can control wires and all kind of items.

Yes, it's from Boruto, but that does not matter. It's the same world and we are arguing if it would be possible. If it is possible when they apply their minds to it, it is definitely possible.

This is from Naruto canon. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Handheld_Kunai_Launcher]]

Besides, there are a shitton of ranged techniques. Naruto throws Rasenshuriken around. Pretty effective and clearly he can aim it.

******** It's really easy to handwave as possible, and would be entirely believable... except that surely such a technique would make throwing kunai around extremely obsolete, so at the very least it doesn't exist.

I will concede that the Boruto machine guns show chakra guns /possible/, but they still fairly obviously require a higher tech level than Naruto had, which is the time generally referred to, because no one likes Boruto. As such, it doesn't really affect the reasoning behind the traditions of the Hyuuga clan.

The ransenshuriken is a top-tier technique that qualifies as relevant for moving extremely fast, and being usable as a melee technique. Again though, it's not really relevant to the Hyuuga.

Really only different attitude. Have you seen the tech in Naruto? They have TV and whatever. Did you read Boruto? They were like "oy, these machines are dumdum, real ninjutsu is where it's at".

Rasenshuriken yes. There are lower techniques.

Water dragon thingy: "The user manipulates water into the shape of a dragon, which they then direct at a target."

Here is a relevant jutsu. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Rock_Gun_Technique]]

The setting is just not that consistent. ESPECIALLY with the tech level, which is all over the place. Kishimoto thought guns don't fit ninjas so they shouldn't exist. Boruto is all about going forwards with that stuff.

But given this sub, I don't think a rational story should have that kind of limit without a good reason.

And throwing kunai should be obsolete, other than that it doesn't use chakra in itself and you can use exploding tags with them.

** It's a ritual dueling technique. Most of Neji's loadout in canon are techniques he's not supposed to have access to as a branch family member. Not all of them are going to be perfectly battle-ready.

Though if anything what canon shows is the strength of the gentle fist combined with the chakra-conductive web the spider guy, (kidomaru?) uses. Similar wire could be interesting.

The fact of the matter is rational fiction is about lightsabers and death stars. Making the gentle fist a rational choice doesn't require keeping it exactly the same
