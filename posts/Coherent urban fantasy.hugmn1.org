Have you ever read a realistic or coherent urban fantasy novel? Or setting.\\
Where there is a good reason why no one sees supernatural everyday, why vampires are not on MTV and immortal dragon ruling the countries?

I have read a couple of urban fantasy I like, Laundry Files and Monster Hunter International, but they are far from rational.

So, what is your favorite urban fantasy and what is the most rational urban fantasy you have read?


** Pact is probably worth mentioning here. In it there's stuff like the Seal of Solomon, which punishes supernatural things that act out of line, including by messing with muggles. Wildbow seems to have made an actual effort to think about how a masquerade can exist, even if its not the story's main focus.

*** Additionally you are magically responsible for the actions of the people you let in on the secret which creates believable incentives to keep it a secret.

I would assume that Wildbows new serial also would fit the description [edit: since it's the same setting] OP asks for though I haven't been reading it.

***** Pale is very good. The protagests don't have several generations of bad karma like Blake did, so their luck is much much better. Wildbow is also doing this thing with adding artwork, detective notes, spell notes, etc every few chapters.

** I'll mention Seanan McGuire's October Daye series. Modern day meets fairy magic, in a nutshell - the fae are mostly hypertraditional, but use glamour to hide their presence from the modern world, the protagonist is a halfbreed "knight" who gets sent for when the human world is involved. The worldbuilding is vibrant and beautiful, the stories themselves are more noire style though, with Toby being a fairy private eye - more like Jessica Jones than Sherlock Holmes though, its not a rational story in the sense that the character's intelligence is key to the plot. It does feature a cyber-dryad living in a decision tree though, who is basically the best side character ever.

** I think a coherent urban fantasy could be made true if a long time ago a group of people botched a "hide me" ritual that became a "hide all else" blood curse.\\
that way we have the "normal" that are made incapable to comprehend the abnormal (the crazy cultist are the "normal" that are trying to fight the curse by cheer will).\\
and we have an actual functionning "abnormal" society wich is surimposed.\\
this way we could incorporate the metal panda anime as an actual place where were-beast compete with the "normal" for office space.

*** I had toyed with ideas for an urban fantasy setting a few years back, and this was very close to my answer for a meaningful Masquerade. In an act of final desperation, the Chefzauberers of the Thule Society had repurposed an experimental antimemetic weapon into a global Pyrrhic bomb. The bomb indirectly killed virtually all magical creatures and magically active humans (magical equivalent of pilots suddenly forgetting, not just how to fly, but what flight was, en masse), and contaminated their works, remains, and ruins with a mighty antimemetic effect. In this setting, the mundane world was just what was /left/, and the magical world would have been a devastated post-apocalyptic wasteland, set in and alongside the muggle world, only a twist in perspective away... Abandoned wizard towers dotting the skylines of the bad parts of Chicago and Detroit, the carcasses of dragons rotting in unused fields. And a small number of survivors fighting for control over the few relics that permit selectivity of the antimemetic effect.

** /The One Who Eats Monsters/ had a lovely coherent setting, and was pretty good (if rather dark).

Basically the fantastic things tend to avoid urban areas where they are less powerful (too many humans amd too much iron), have a pretty serious antimemetic effect protecting them, and are very rare - think global population in the thousands. They also tend to be very, very nasty...

** The hardest part of a rational masqurade is that human nature opposes it. We probably would be ok with having wizards around rather than "scared of what we don't understand". How many cultures have given prestige and respect to the local magic user?

Or the idea that we don't want to know, check a poll for how many people believe ghosts exist. Even if ghosts actually do exist, they never ride a zombie dinosaur through Chicago. So the percentage of people who believe in wizards in urban fantasy should be higher than the percentage of real people who believe in ghosts.

I think you'd pretty much have to come up with a supernatural reason. Anyone who sees magic always forgets about it. Anyone with magic is cursed to have to hide or else. Or a powerful group with a motive (ideological or practical) enforces the masqurade lethally.

*Pact* has it. Mundanes have natural protection against magic. Anyone who notice magic become vulnerable to it and most of them quickly die and/or disappear. Magic is mostly metaphorical and it's effects on mundane world are seen as natural phenomena. Victims of magic often disappear with all their causal connections to mundane world, without any trace.

** I kind of like how the Dresden Files handles this. The masquerade is pretty porus, people aren't aware of the supernatural but the supernatural only really put in a lazy effort to keep things under wraps. Supernatural entities do run much of the world. The upside is that Dresden can go around doing whatever without worrying too much about the masquerade, though he's likely more cavalier than most.

There's also a clear weak-masquerade which would result in them not being taken seriously.

** Isn't the standard answer that it's in the best interests of the supernatural elements not to go to war with the muggles, and any ridiculously powerful creatures have been put at bay by the wizards and such? And that they use mind magics to stay undercover?

e.g. in the Alex Verus seriesthe vampires were wiped out, at least in the main dimension, by all the magicians uniting against them.

*** Mage: The Ascension has the concept of "consensus reality". When a Mage does magic, they are imposing their own view of how the world works, and the more witnesses there are who /disagree/ with that view (i.e. normal people) the harder it is for the magic to happen.

Then there's also the Technocracy, who work in exactly the same way as Tradition Mages, but /their/ view of the world is called "science" and they've spent a lot of time cultivating that view in the general public - so theirs works great out in the open, and we don't even consider it to /be/ magic.

** The reason why this is rare is that the constraints make for unsatisfying stories. The inability to do things at scale (because doing anything at scale necessarily means no masquerade) saps agency from the protagonist and strongly opposes the wish-fulfillment of the reader, and working through why is... shitty. But if you can do things at scale, or there isn't a masquerade and magic is publicly known / widely available, it's not our world and people connect to it less.

The solutions all suck. You can be:

- totally uninterested in coherence or sense (Rowling),
- your characters can just all be selfish, petty-minded pricks (Grossman),
- there could be a centuries-old conspiracy to hide everything (Jim Hines, highly recommended),
- the supernatural could be hiding for its own safety from the mundanes (Harry Connolly's "A Key, An Egg, An Unfortunate Remark", highly recommended),
- there could be a weak masquerade that lets people in but makes the civic/secular systems not take them seriously (Dresden Files),
- there could be a strong masquerade that no-sells your attempts to change the world by erasing or imploding you (the Mage setting).

But pretty much never are these things the point of the story (even Mage isn't about the masquerade so much as it is about being a super-badass up against the Evil Empire), so you don't get a better story by being realistic or coherent about it at the expense of other things.

It's interesting that you mention the Laundry Files, because it's about as ratfic as urban fantasy gets.

*** This is a very good analysis. I read all the things that you have NOT recommended and I agree.

Another issue it is that world-building is MUCH harder to do. You need to think of all the implications and consequences. In medieval fantasy it works better as the reader is not aware of how the medieval world functioned and can the suspension of disbelief is easier. I played TTRPGs and in modern ones players tend to overthink their action much more then fantasy ones. The fantasy stories that are praised have few and sparse magical elements in the current social structures (LotR GoT).

centuries-old conspiracy with some innate anti-memetic propriety of magic is my favorite approach but I never have seen it done well.

At a certain point a series have to go big scale to be interesting, escalation is the only way to survive, but you can also Mind Wipe entire cities Man in Black Style.

Each and every type and level of the masquerade is handled professionally by a very, very dedicated cabal of supernaturals, atop of which there is a powerful memetic/reality-bending principle at play, and atop of that, sheer human cynicism, mental complacency, and sheep mentality makes sure that even when the supernatural is exposes, people dismiss it as a hoax.

** In /Lord of the Mysteries/, the reason where knowledge of the supernatural are not widespread or well-known is because of a finite yet indestructible supply of a substance for mortals to consume from which all supernatural powers, items and creatures are born.

As such, demand is artificially limited by Church & State withholding all knowledge from the common public, reducing the amount of people competing over the substance, as well as limiting the severity of the existing competition between state-backed parties and criminal elements such as battle royale between empowered individuals, abrupt "battlefield promotions", and cannibalism to gain more of the substance. The restriction is enforced in major urban centres by empowered individuals in Church & State organisations, most of which are led by actual Gods. The Gods have another motive in limiting demand, as individuals who consume enough substance without going mad or turning into a monster can become Gods themselves. Gods also rely on belief from their followers as an anchor to maintain sanity and mastery over the ultimately foreign substance in their bodies.

As all Lovecraftian settings, the more one knows the easier to die or go mad. Mortals who accidentally get involved in supernatural incidents mostly die, and the few who survive well enough gets attractive offers to work for the organisations to maintain the masquerade and potentially become an empowered individual themselves.

I find the whole background setting about economics shaping the world as it is and interest groups creating pressures on supply and demand quite interesting.
