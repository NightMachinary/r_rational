** For someone completely new to this story, is there an "about" section that goes further than just "Looking back, I suppose my story really begins on the day I died. Of course, I didn't realize that had happened for quite some time..."?

I normally like to know what I am reading before sinking too much time in to it and "rational and/or rationalist fiction where someone's story starts with him/her dying" is kinda vague.

*** Not really.

It's about a world where a bad singularity happened. But not too bad of a singularity. It spends a lot of time chronicling the protagonists wanderings through that singularity.

*** It's times like this that I wish I had a TV Tropes page I could point to (and make suggestions for). :) But traverseda has it right; the core idea I started with, and which still seems to apply, is roughly "present-day cryonicist is woken post-Singularity, starts Walking The Earth". I've also described it as "Jack Chalker crossed with Charles Stross", or "playing with breaking the usual one mind to one body ratio".

** I've been reading this for a while and it continues to be entertaining. Is [[/u/DataPackrat]] transitioning to book six then?

*** There'll be at least six books, yes. I know where I plan on ending up with the story - I still have some leeway on how to get there from where it currently is.

Relatedly, I've got the first two books uploaded to [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/983729/DataPacRat]] , and the first chapter at the story's permanent home at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/]] . There's a bit of grunt work in setting those up, such as my preference for writing italics with /slashes/, so I'm not updating those particularly fast. (If anyone has enough regex-fu to be able to, among other details, turn apostrophes 'surrounding text' into proper HTML left-and-right curly quotes (as seen in the first chapter on my site), without affecting apostrophe's that are just part of words, that could certainly speed things up, and I'd appreciate the assist... :) )
