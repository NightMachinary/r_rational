** That plan would have worked, were it not for Welexi's secret ability. For all his ostentatious heroism, Welexi is clever and knows when to hold things back.

Also, Vidre killing the bureaucrat probably saved their lives.

** Reposted from my comment on the website:

Interesting that Welexi believes his light-form takes something away from him when he uses it. How does he know? Did something change in him the first time he used it (presumably when he discovered he could)? And did he learn of that change by comparing it to his memories, or did somebody close to him say (I think not the latter, since only Dominic knew of the ability before this chapter)?

Assuming it's true, it means that prolonged usage might progress him towards some prototypical "light-domain" personality, which is an interesting concept. Personality doesn't directly correspond to domain (e.g. you wouldn't say "That's so typically flesh of you."), but it could be the personality of the progenitor of the domain (if they exist).

I'm also interested in how the whole thing works. He travels through the iron door just fine, but doesn't fall through the iron floor. There could be an element of intent behind it (he didn't intend to fall through the floor, so he didn't), which seems to be the usual explanation for phasing.

Further, his light-form continued to move in the direction he planned and reconstituted itself as expected. That means that he must either be able to consciously control his transformed self, or it derives instructions from his mental state at the time.

Also, I'm curious about the potential "final form" for other domains. Shadow is obvious (like light's, but dark), as are electricity, frost, fire, etc. But what about the non-elementals? Is the ultimate iron skill basically the terminator from T2? Is ultimate flesh as gross as it seems? Does ultimate cat just turn them into a cat?

*** From proximity to Gaelwyn, he probably knows that the brain is the seat of the mind. He knows that he loses awareness while enlightened (heh). He knows that his brain turns into light, because it travels with him.

All that? It's worrying, and probably disorientating. Given that he's probably among the only illustrati in the world that can pull that off, it's not like he's got a precedent to work off of. Anything he does, he risks his life doing, because he doesn't know how or why it might go wrong.

*** I would think he doesn't fall through the floor because he was moving fast enough with a certain direction of movement. Like a quick leap, only at the apogee he was incorporeal.

** A strong chapter which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

I'm often surprised by the comments and complaints that a clever, fun and well written story can somehow generate. You've created a world where a man can turn himself completely into light, where a woman can have what seems to be a pretty complete control over glass and where, in general, fame grants super powers. With all of that, air being removed quickly from a room is no surprise to me at all and I simply assume 'illustrati magic' and continue to enjoy the story.

It's already noted that Dominic was feeling light headed and wondering if the air was thinner at the top of the building. Perhaps the room, or even the whole floor, had reduced oxygen in it. This needn't cause a significant change in air pressure if the oxygen was replaced with a greater concentration of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In this case, removing the oxygen out of the room could be much faster than in the normal, everyday situation that we initially imagine it to be.

I'm surprised how often readers assume that all the information they've been given so far is all the information they could possibly need to judge (and then criticise) a situation. This is even more surprising when it's an unfinished story set in an unfamiliar world which we are discovering through the eyes of the protagonist.

** I think the suffocation in that room is way too fast, unless Vidre is prevented from plugging the suction hole. Is it purely a mechanical effect, or is there an air-domain illustrati involved?

*** The fudge factor here is that some unknown quantity of air has already been removed from the room by the time Vidre finds the vent (and she only finds the vent /because/ there's enough air being removed that this noticeably disturbs particles in the air). When the door opens, there's a hiss of air from the pressure difference. I'll confess to having done only some sketchy math, but I was hoping that it wouldn't break plausibility if it was off a little (especially since no times are given, especially in the break between when Welexi leaves and comes back).

If you would be so kind, let me know whether this is something that you thought was intuitively wrong, or whether it was something that you worked out with math after the fact? I probably won't be changing it anytime soon, but it might be something that I come back to when I do a full edit at the end.

**** It did feel intuitively wrong to me, like people being trapped in an elevator and immediately panicking about suffocation. I find it not at all plausible without a device or air illustrati pumping air out, and if air illustrati can do /that/, it makes them potentially very very powerful.

****** Minutes passed. (Combat rounds, even.) Not the /several hours/ that would be required under normal conditions for a small room to become stuffy.

That aside, I think that it's fixable in-story. All that is needed, is some good reason for the air to be going out of the room much faster than it normally would, without Vidre being able to do anything about it. Like a water-driven suction pump, with the room set up as a metal bell jar. Vidre could probably still stopper it though.

Maybe the air could be teleported out in chunks? "Scooped out"? I don't know what domain that might be.
