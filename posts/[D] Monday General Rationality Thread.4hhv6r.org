Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** How much do you track your finances? I keep a spreadsheet that tracks my monthly outlays and expenditures and categorizes them by type. Every month, I examine my credit card and bank statements (and reference receipts if need be) and enter in all my outlays and income.

Each page in my spreadsheet is a month, and at the front of the spreadsheet is a page with [[http://i.imgur.com/X5ebWet.png][graphs]] and a page with tables. This lets me identify trends in my spending and saving. Basically every dollar that I gain or lose is tracked in some way, though small cash transactions between friends are not.

Since I started doing this a couple years ago, I've become more careful and conscientious about my spending. If I spent too much one month, I am aware of it, and I also know how and where I spent too much money. It has helped me build savings.

Do you do something similar? If so, how?

  How much do you track your finances?
#+end_quote

Not very. Mostly out of laziness and lack of immediate need, I guess. I tried using [[https://www.youneedabudget.com/][YNAB]] for a little while but didn't get much from it. I don't make a lot right now, though, so the consequences of any inefficiency now are likely to be small (grad student stipend is $20k-40k per year, depending on what I do or what sort of funding I'm on, and my wife makes a similar amount).

Mostly money's deposited into my/our bank account(s) automatically and we use a variety of credit cards to buy groceries or toys, pay rent and utilities, travel, etc. (well, rent requires a check, but we use credit cards to make almost all other purchases). Card balances are then automatically paid in full every month. Every few months I'll check how much is in the bank and make sure there haven't been any weird purchases. Depending on the time of year, we'll give some to various charities (a few k, though I do it over fewer transactions to avoid having more fixed fees) and toss some $ in investments (e.g. max out Roth IRAs for the year and put whatever's left into a taxable account, leaving enough in the bank to serve as a ~3 month emergency fund).

Every few weeks I'll check up on investments (a fairly aggressive lazy portfolio made up of index funds) and credit scores, since it's fun and a little addicting to see how the numbers change through time.

I don't really give much thought to finances and tend to buy random stuff as desires strike. But I don't want for much, so it's worked out well so far.

**** One strategy if you're having self-control problems with internet purchases is to create a ritual for yourself. For example, if you are sure you want to buy something on Amazon, you write down the item on a piece of paper you keep on your fridge. Also, write out the URL, by hand. Then, at the end of the week, you buy any items on that piece of paper that seem like a good idea still.

Adding a couple trivial barriers might be enough to help.

Learning basic accounting (double-entry bookkeeping) was a bit of a hassle, but I can't imagine going back to the fuzzy, ad-hoc, reinventing-the-wheel-poorly "accounting" I was relying on before.

If you are programming-inclined, I definitely recommend ledger-cli. There are plenty of alternatives if you aren't or just don't like it for whatever reason.

*** Closely, but only occasionally. I use mint to keep track of all expenditures, and a spreadsheet to keep track of my investments. I only really go through it in detail once every couple of months though, with the exception of any 'high spending' alerts that mint might bring to my attention. I find that this is more than frequently enough to keep a good understanding of my savings rate and projected finances, while also not requiring much of my time. If I find that over the last few months I've spent more than I'd projected, I'll figure out how that happened and course correct.

At this point, I'm more often surprised by the growth of my assets than by unexpected spending.

It's making me feel weird as shit, which so far is an interesting if frustrating experience. My ability to put my thoughts into words coherently on the first try is at 50-70% of normal. Apparently I'm in for 3-6 days of various types of crapulence before I can expect to see benefits, and should discontinue use if I develop toxic epidermal necrolysis (don't google image search that lightly).

*** The downside to having cash in your wallet isn't carrying it, but getting it. Basically, everywhere that I shop accepts credit cards. When I bank, I do so via the internet or mail-- set up my deposits, pay my bills, write checks for credit card bills, etc. I literally do not enter my bank or use an ATM on most months.

Looking at my budgeting spreadsheet, an example of transactions I had in the last month included:

- Groceries, paid with credit card
- Gasoline, paid with credit card
- Some dining-out expenses, paid with credit card
- Some entertainment and subscription expenses, paid with credit card
- Some checks deposited or written, for rent or transferring money with friends, all deposited using electronic internet deposit
- Paycheck, deposited directly
- Paying down credit card for the month
- Some money transferred between friends using the Venmo banking service
- A check written to my landlord for rent
- Other expenses and purchases, such as some stuff at the drugstore, a new video game, all done with cards or checks

Basically, unless I specifically seek it out, I don't actually end up using cash for anything. I haven't used an ATM in several months. I do carry about a hundred dollars on me, but if I instead only had twenty dollars on my person, or no dollars, it would have no impact on my life. Going out of my way to go to an ATM is the cost, rather than carrying the cash in my wallet.

- whenever you lose your wallet, you lose the money in it, and

- money that is sitting as cash in your wallet can't be used for anything else.

The first is a small downside because (frequency of losing wallet * amount of cash * how bad losing money is * risk aversion) is quite small in most cases. The second is usually small because it's a small amount of money.

I also make use of the brilliant strategy of squirreling away $10-$20 in various bags, compartments in the car, electronics cases (e.g. in my cell phone), etc. in case I lack small amounts of money when it's needed, forgetting it's there, and rediscovering it years later.

** I just discovered something called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/faq][Tulpas]], what do you guys think of this whole thing?

If you peel away all the woo and nonsense, there seems to be a kernel of truth that you can set up mental models with enough fidelity that they don't feel like "you". From what I understand, this happens to writers some times. Apparently authors spend so much time fleshing out characters that they can metaphorically ask the character questions and get surprising results.

The reason I'm interested personally is because I've read about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/20r/city_of_lights/][the benefits of treating your separate and sometimes conflicting desires as their own agents]], but I've never really been able to take advantage of the technique. It feels strange to me when I try, like I'm trying to fool myself. It seems like something that has a lot of potential though. If you're getting surprising answers, it's allowing you to think it ways you wouldn't normally and that seems pretty exciting.

Does anyone have advice or personal experiences to share?

I have friends and family who are highly religious, and they also describe rarely hearing a voice in their head that is not their own. They believe this is the voice of god. They pray in an imaginative way and imagine God speaking back to them. Sometimes, this comes true.

I don't have, nor have I had, this kind of experience before. It seems like there is something that's possible in the human mind that's like this. If you are in the right frame if mind, you can believe you hear someone speaking back to you.

*** The problem with tulpas is that if you strip away the woo and nonsense, you're just left with basic human empathy and storytelling, which isn't all that exciting or novel. I think the "surprising answers" thing is just an extension of empathy and a modeling of another entity's thoughts, but it /does not/ require some kind of separate independent entity living inside your head. This is already a well-worn trope: "Think, think ... what would X do? /Gasp!/"

That's not to say that I think it would be useless for therapy, since what you're doing is attempting to isolate and examine thought processes. But the tulpa thing, while interesting, seems to be almost entirely constructed of woo.

Oh absolutely, I strongly agree that the claim of "separate conscious entity" is a mistake. I posted here because I could be wrong, but I think it's an interesting kind of mistake that might point to something useful.

The part that does seem true about the whole thing is that the mind is capable of promoting a passive mental model to an active one. I think the real trick is making the practice of asking "what would X do?" so habitual that you do it automatically, perhaps even subconsciously once you get to the point where you expect to get an answer. It tidily explains everything that people write about their experiences with "tulpa".

The reason I find this all interesting is because I wonder what could be done with this information and some smart choices. I could see it being used to force some good habits on yourself, especially if it can help you remember to use rationalist techniques that you know. Or maybe you can use it to develop qualities that you want like curiousity and gratitude.

**** I disagree. For one thing, it's a really easy and common thing to become someone who has only a very basic relationship with your normal mental state. From personal experience, when I've dreamed, I've noticed that as often as my dream self is basically my normal waking self, it's also normal for it to be some random character that fits in the dream.

In what sense is something like that still me, that has completely different memories and goals from my waking self, and in what sense is it it's own being? I would argue that both interpretations are right, to a degree, since when you're inside the dream, you usually won't be able to bring you own thought processes into the equation, but you can still see how it's templated on you.

So while there may be a lot of woo and nonsense, there can be a mechanism for a truly novel personality to take root in your head. Sure, there's the woo and nonsense to object to, but you have to remember that inside the human mind is literally the one place in the universe that that kind of thing actually works.

*** Something similar to this, is that I've found that your brain can simulate /at least two entities capable of passing the turing test/. The reason I know this is from lucid dreaming, while in most dreams I find the npc's are pretty low quality you just don't notice because you're not lucid. In lucid dreams however, npc's can actually be convincing enough that even with full lucidity they are seem convincingly like real people even when you know they aren't. Obviously the processing for the npc's is all subconscious, but as far as I'm aware for a sane person it's the closest thing you can have to having 2 entities in your head at once.

This scenario always struck me as odd, because there must be quite a lot of processing going on internally, to simulate both your mind, but also the output from the other entity, which appears indistinguishable from if it had come from a real person.

I have been interested in the overlap between "Magic" and cognitive therapies to reduce cognitive dissonance and cognitive therapies to reduce cognitive dis intense. One of the techniques they mention a lot in a term they call shadow work is visualizing the difference subsumed parts of your personality as their own separate agents and by giving them a name and a form they don't affect you on a sub conscience level anymore you would address them and become more capable of addressing them in the moment. I think that Tapas are another manifestation of this and as you pointed out the brain is capable of having multiple running operating systems of personality in its Hardware at the same time.

Since they can calculate what responses sound good to you it doesn't seem like they would be incapable of doing the same processing against someone else.

I think it could be quite similar to the Hollywood version of mind palaces. I'm sure it's possible that some people have conceived and memorized entire coherent visual spaces in their head and can recall it eidetically, but I am certainly not capable of it, despite my burning desire to have a mindscape.

*** If I understand what Tulpas is, there's a story on Sufficient Velocity where the main character does basically what you're talking about, and I'm pretty sure the author does it themselves.

Basically the author does a self-insert fiction story where they die and are cryonicall frozen, and wake up in a post-singularity world, where they may be the only rational/sane people left any more.

** Is anyone who /hasn't/ watched Log Horizon willing to read over the first two chapters of my LH fanfic to tell me how intelligible it is? I'd like to appeal to the general [[/r/rational]] audience alongside LH fans, but at the same time, I'm writing a continuation fic, and those tend to require more knowledge of the source material.

If all it requires are some extra descriptions (because I tend to be rather sparse on those anyways) I'll try to tailor it to the general audience, but I don't want to have to insert any more exposition than I'll already have to as [[#s][semi-spoilers for LH]]

Reply to this post saying so or PM me for details.

(And to clarify, I'm doing my best to make it [RT], although not [RST].)

edit: and because people who haven't seen log horizon probably don't know what it is, it's one of those "gamers trapped in the game world" stories, but with a focus on worldbuilding (because it's an actual world now) instead of getting out. And it's not just a few players, it's literally tens of thousands spread out over the entire planet.

**** PM sent. For now it's just the first two chapters (doesn't include the mini-backlog I've accrued) but I'm just trying to get an idea of how much I'd need to change it.

**** Story's already posted, you'll find the thread on this sub. The general consensus is that it's fairly understandable without knowing LH.
