Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** This will sound ranty. I have this crippling sense of helplessness when dealing with the real world in general and Asian bureaucracy in particular, in stark contrast to the elegance displayed by rational heroes. The world seems explicitly anti-munchkin. A rational hero typically reads the rules, be it physical, magical or legal and then comes up with a clever exploit. Guess what, my home country doesn't work that way. Regulations are subject to the whims of corrupt officials. The most basic govt. services requires knowing the “right person”. Socially skilled people who are willing to “grind and level up” do far better than someone socially awkward no matter how ‘rational' they may be. How does one go about exploiting rules when the rules are interpreted at the whim of some incompetent govt. or bank official. It's deeply frustrating. Almost everyone I know is better at this stuff than I am. And the skill required is basically a willingness to accept huge opportunity cost in running through the system like a lab rat.

*** I sometimes wonder if over-consumption of fiction is actually unhealthy (at least for myself) for this exact reason.

Sometimes I spend a considerable amount of time reading stories or imagining scenarios in my head that seem more preferable and easier to game than real life. And of course imagining a world in which you're better equipped to achieve success doesn't actually make you more successful in the real world.

The problem with some rational fiction, is that it assumes that there are significant unsolved problems that will give a single person an advantage over other people if solved. And often times this just isn't the case in real life. In most cases, if there's a loop-hole someone's already exploited it to the point where it needed to be closed. If there's a more efficient method to do something, it's probably already common practice or you'll find that it costs more to execute than you gain from using it. It's still good to examine things and make sure you're doing them in the most rational way possible, but the people who find new improvements in old fields are by far the exception, not the rule.

I think the hard truth is that it's the people with the most resources or the people who are most naturally skilled (at whatever they're trying to do) who are most likely to succeed. And the only way you can realistically increase your chances of success is to pursue goals that play to your current strengths and incrementally increase your own resources and skills where possible.

And all that sounds a lot less appealing than doing some brief calculations and figuring out the optimal route in life. Or being able to point out some fallacy that someone else is using and surpass them by avoiding it.

**** Exactly, the actual steps to succeed are very mundane and boring. Superficially, I am better off than most people, and that's mainly due to my upper middle class parents giving me a good education along with a pinch of luck. My brains were a distant third in determining where I am today. My brother for example, is naturally a far better rational navigator of the real world & that's only partly because he is very smart. He is also more willing that I am to put in the effort to understand regulations, navigate bureacracy & fill out forms.

I would recommend reading [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ddcsdA2c2XpNpE5x/newcomb-s-problem-and-regret-of-rationality][this]]

The most important line is this

#+begin_quote
  Rational agents should WIN.
#+end_quote

Calling the people who are making the wrong decisions to get ahead in life "rational" just because they try to think like stereotypical "rationalist" characters is a fallacy. It is similar to the average person thinking of "rational" people as emotionless and spouting statistics to 3 decimal places rather than simply people who make smart choices.

If people see that who you know is more important than what you know and use that to achieve there goals that is rational. Complaining that it shouldn't be that way and not getting what you want is not.

The closest thing I've found in the real world to an exploit is [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/][this]] which I found very interesting and am currently working towards.

**** Agree completely. That's why I put 'rational' in quotes. I have read EY's Newcomb link, but a refresher won't hurt. I just don't like dealing with people and that puts me at a disadvantage. Terminal values can also put constraints.

Thanks for the Money Mustache link. This subject is very dear to me. Would love to retire earlier. A few wrinkles I want to point out from my experience as an older person (since most [[/r/rational]] people I assume are younger than me):

1. Your expenses depend on your dependents too. Kids, aging parents, etc. If you retire single and then meet your SO and get married and have kids, that can change the equation.

2. Living in a country where inflation rates can increase significantly will also throw a wrench in the works.

3. Your medical expenses will increase as you get older. This can dramatically alter the equation.

***** Ahh all good then, I guess if it's a matter of preference and not of lack of ability then that makes things harder as it is a lot easier to train yourself to be better socially than it is to train yourself to like it.

I do agree with your first point, I guess you have to plan for "I want to be able to spend x each year" rather than "I currently spend x each year"

About the second and third they are covered in [[https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/][this]] fairly well in that the 4% rule survived the big inflation rates in the 70's. I must admit that location makes a difference in that I'm not sure this would have worked if you owned only, say, Japanese shares considering the shit they've gone through recently. To plan for that sort of thing though you simply buy a mix of international shares.

****** This Money Mustache not the first guy to spout this type of nonsense. I could argue with you how 5% returns after inflation is pretty much impossible after taxes and fees. Or how it has too many dependencies on things you can't control like market fluctuations and all that type of stuff. Or even how it's focused on defense and saving when you should be focusing on making more instead, so you can save 5% of 1 million instead of 5% of 100k.

​

But I won't so here's a post to do it for me: [[https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/from-fire-to-dire.86108/]]

​

Rich people don't waste time saving money, that's a futile effort. It's much more productive to spend that time finding ways to make MORE money instead. Mainly because there's no limit to it, if you make X even if you somehow save 100% of X you still can only make X. But there's technically no limit to how much more money you can make.

****** Thanks, I really need to go over Money Mustache in detail. Looks like a solid reference. Regarding social skills, it's a bit of both. Social anxiety which leads to a sour grapes mentality "I don't really need people.". Given a choice I would like to impress people with my charm of course ;-)

*** Move, either to a different country or to small town where competition is lesser and every opportunity hasn't been taken yet. Or just play a different game, maybe you're better suited for a different area. The top is far easier to reach if you have a competitive advantage, be it talent, early start, resources, contacts, skills etc.

​

Besides there's no point in trying to argue with some low level government secretary / attendant. Even if you stomp them, they'll just call their boss over and he'll tell you that's not how it works, you are mistaken, that source is outdated, this is a very recent change..

​

Exploits and opportunities exist IRL but they are mostly available in the business world, not in the employee scene. Opportunity is out there, it just takes either a lot of work, time, risk or money, and possibly all of them to get it.

​

It's mostly a matter of risk, and using rationality to choose the most optimal risks to take, without risking failing so hard you can't get back up again..

**** That's exactly what I did by moving to the US as soon as I got the chance, and slowly drifting into the kind of work that I like. But I still find it necessary to deal with bureaucracy back home. I'm too old to be making big waves, but it's fun to look at the world through the eyes of smarter people and understand what I've missed.

** For non-Americans, how nationalistic is your country's media? This is a topic I've been thinking a bit about lately. I'm in Canada and our media isn't very nationalistic at all, regardless of whether its state produced or by Canadian writers. It's often set in Canada or at least has Canadian characters, but that's about it. The fact that it's set in Canada may even entirely go over your head if you miss a few minutes/paragraphs.

By contrast, the light novels, manga, and anime from Japan and Korea I've read are often much more nationalistic. The small scale slice-of-life stories often talk about how great Japanese/Korean food and deserts are. The larger scale urban fantasy stories often have Korea/Japan be the premier world power that can defeat countries like the USA or China.

**** I specified it because I, and I assume everyone, already sees a ton of American media everywhere. American media for the most part to me doesn't seem nationalistic because it doesn't need to be. You cannot fake your country being the most powerful in the world when it is the most powerful in the world. Seoul or Tokyo would be a weird place for aliens to invade, Washington DC or New York would be realistic first strike locations.

Not that there aren't hypernationalistic American media, just that relative to the total volume of American media it's rare.

***** Tokyo is a pretty sensible place to invade, actually. It's one of the A1 world cities, along with NY, London, Shanghai, and whatever the fifth one is (I forget.) Plus, it would be pretty sensible for the aliens to invade a mountainous island archipelago. They'd have orbital superiority and therefore total freedom of movement, but any counterattacking force would have to deal with Japan's highly defensible terrain.
