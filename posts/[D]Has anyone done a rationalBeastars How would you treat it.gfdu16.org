So I watched (and read a bit of the Manga) of Beastars, and I think it would do well with a Rational fanfic treatment. The main premise is 'in a civilized, modern world full of anthropomorphic animals, how do individuals and society cope with the instinct toward predation?' And it follows Legosi, a teenage wolf coping with his experiences and struggles in that domain.

The thing is... Legosi is acting like a realistic teenager. IE, pretty much a moron when it comes to interacting socially with others. And the society, being a bit of an obvious critique at historic (and current) taboos toward interracial marriage, isn't much better.

So the thought occurs to me -- how would or should both society and individuals deal with people who sometimes have instincts to flip out and murder others, in a way that's more elegant than seems to be going on in the canon of the series? Or, if individuals within a society that isn't handling it that well want to

interact romantically in predator/prey relationships where there's high risk for violence unwanted by both parties, what are some sane steps that they can or should take?


** Hmmm, I can't really think of a good way to ratfic Beastars in a way that would be actually meaningful. Setting is already pretty rock solid, to be honest. Legosi & Company grappling with their Inner Animals and the societal pressures surrounding him is kinda the whole point too. What problems with rational!Legosi be more equipped to deal with? Genetically modifying instincts out of people? If it's trying to effect social change, then Louis is kinda already following a very precise path towards gaining the prestige necessary. The Panda guy filling the market's need for actual meat by using ethically sourced hospitals and such to run his Black Market is another great example of dealing with a very thorny societal problem in the most ethical way possible.

I just don't think this is a source material that is conducive to a ratfic story. You could have an interesting time brainstorming worldbuilding tidbits, such as self-training methods to smother the carnivore instinct, but making bigger changes besides "it's Legosi but he is smarter" would erode the source material too much for me.

If you think about it, this is likely a japanese allegory for sexual harassment and rape. Where it's commonly portrayed that sometimes people "just can't help it", which is a very bad take and takes the responsibility away from the criminal.

Isn't the point of a work on this theme, to break down what's going on inside the opaque "responsibility" node, to the conflicting forces that exist within the mind? Like people with ADHD are taught to do to the opaque concept of "willpower."

**** Hmm. Maybe carnivores-as-subclass because when guns were invented, herbivores were more effective at working together effectively and won the war. Carnivores were sanctioned heavily, essentially as vengeance for their historical depredation. Now carnivores are permitted to live, but are heavily discriminated against and kept subordinate by threats of force, and are not permitted to own weapons or organize significantly.

​

If you're okay with it being different, you could give it japan-occupied china vibes like Ip man, or pull on post WWI germany for the simmering resentment. It could be an interesting "will it end in fascism or will they win civil rights" dynamic.

If you want it to be a little truer to source, you could play it like a Ruby Bridges scenario where Legosi is an experiment with reintegration of schools, and he was picked because he's more docile than many wolves, but puberty and being physically bullied by herbivores is a struggle for him. There would also still be room for the love subplot, but now it's super forbidden and the basis for further conflict and discrimination.

​

For either option, a layer of complication which you'd probably have to add for the setting to be cohesive would be the role of omnivores and carrion eaters in the historical conflict - which side of the tenuous peace were they on, and where do their sympathies lie? Could have carrion eaters who were on the herbivore side because they saw how the wind was blowing, but dislike that everything is meat substitutes now and sympathize with the losing carnivores. Or you could have omnivores who were unfairly lumped in with carnivores and have a superiority complex over them, maybe occupying a middle social stratum. Extremist carnivores would see them as traitors, extremist herbivores would still look down on them.

****** I think that's a fair inference, but to me it reads more like an inconsistency - if carnivores had that much power, I'm not sure there would be so much pretense of equality in the schools (e.g. carnivores getting bullied by prey animals). I would also expect the story to take place amidst herbivores agitating for their rights (again, unless they're explicitly oppressed and just live at the sufferance of carnivores).

E.g., it's "oh no, another devouring, how horrible!" Rather than "another devouring, maybe the [equal rights group] has a point about herbivores being allowed to own weapons", or "Another one. Fucking carnivores". Also, the meat market probably wouldn't be so secretive or taboo if things were more carnivore controlled. Plus Louis gets a gun somehow and clearly knows how to use it.

It just seems like canon beastars is much more concerned with telling its coming of age and star crossed romance story than it is with following through on its setting and social commentary.

What if it was that carnivores are elected by a mostly-herbivorous base? Because, y'know, food web---fewer of each species as nutritional demand goes up. (Now it's essentially a class allegory: 99% of voters are in, well, the 99%, but almost all candidates come from the wealthy "political class", because you get taught politics at your daddy's knee.)

Also, what if this dynamic was only stable for international-realpolitik reasons? (I.e., if herbivores elected carnivores to represent them, because they think carnivores are better at intimidating /other countries'/ also-mostly-herbivore populations into cooperation/trade concessions/etc.? Or also, that the richer herbivores that run PACs, would think that carnivores would make more effective leaders in potential wartime---which might always be simmering in such a world---due to their ability to intimidate /their own/ populations [and their appropriations committees] into a high-budgeted war footing more quickly?)

School classes on how to detect and determine when a predator is likely to attack, locations with highest risk, behaviors you can use to tell with high accuracy when a predator is near losing control.

​

Basically any remotely socially capable group of prey would have a big advantage over any predator ever in politics and pretty much every other situation where proper social behavior is desirable.

​

They can anger predators then accuse them of attempting an attack, bait political enemies implying they are going to attack them, use specific scents that increase the likelihood predator attacks, and infinite variations of this to the Nnth degree. Basically either predators or prey would be second class citizens, or their society wouldn't work.

​

PS. It'd be very VERY difficult to beat millions of years of evolutionary psychology to make these 2 groups safely live together. Probably impossible in a manner that even comes close to our modern ideals of equality.

Wouldn't this be an arms race? I'm assuming here that predators /want/ to eat prey species, not just /need/ to; and so they actually would prefer, if possible, to eat them /before/ going into a berserker rage, since then they have more control over the situation and can potentially "get away with it." If that's true, then predators would be all about figuring out ways to get prey-species people to /volunteer/ themselves to be eaten.

Like, say, drugging people with chemicals that cause depression and suicidal ideation in hopes that they eventually decide life is not worth living, at which point they can jump in and offer to eat them as a means of assisted suicide.

Or, like, creating extreme sports (think BASE jumping) with high chances of death, and heavily marketing them, while also setting up certain predators as the instructors [probably because they paid for the privilege], and making the participants sign a participation waiver with fine print that says that in a remote wilderness environment, the instructor has final say on how to dispose of their body in the event that they die in an accident and are unable to be transported home.

Or, a more "interesting" case: I'd presume that carnivores would run all the abortion clinics.

(Tangent: do egg-laying demihumans exist in this world? Do they sell their unfertilized eggs on the open market as a foodstuff for carnivores and obligate ovivores to eat? Would it be unusual for a snake-man to date a chicken-woman under the expectation of being able to eat her eggs?)

--------------

I would also point out that, in reality, carnivores don't only eat herbivores. /Most/ carnivorous species eat other carnivorous species! If that dynamic persists in this setting, then I'd expect carnivores to /maybe/ maintain some sort of blasé "if you can beat me, you deserve to eat me" kind of sentiment when in the company of other carnivore species---sort of like cultivators in the more cruel Xianxia stories; and it'd only be in interactions with herbivores where this dynamic would be called into question.

Also, I haven't watched the show: do non-uplifted animals not exist in this setting (any more)? Can carnivores not, in fact, just eat the cow-cows, instead of the cow-people? Can society not just keep livestock around for carnivores to preferentially attack in case of a sudden rage (much like one would imagine a werewolf would)?

Yes, and they sell unfertilised eggs on the open market. There's a side chapter from the point of view of a hen who does this, and takes pride in producing high-quality eggs for people to eat. This is considered fine and non-taboo; however, at one point an egg is found to have somehow been fertilized and there's a stillborn/(premature?) chicken, i.e. child inside. The group of carnivores who are eating lunch at that moment have to deal with this, with some of them wanting to treat it as a rare opportunity to eat real, live meat and some of them (protagonist) horrified because of his social upbringing.

No. The only non-sapient animals are insects, which are legal to eat, no smarter than real-life insects, and mulched for meat substitutes. (Though the main character does, eventually empaphize with even them in a way somewhat analogous to real-life vegetarianism, leading to an interesting, yet somewhat comedic scene where he ritualistically consumes a grub after fasting for a week in a manner reminiscent of ancestral tribes worshipping the spirit of the animals that fed them, metaphorically absorbing its life force. He's later visited, in a dream, by the spirit of the insect the grub would have become.)

Well, yes, it's undesirable, due to the consequences. Presumably the people who do it anyway are people with impulse-control problems. But people who /know they have/ impulse-control problems, can plan around those.

Let me put it this way: if you know you're inevitably an arsonist, i.e. someone who has a /compulsion/ to set things on fire, then---presuming there's no clear way to just /preclude yourself from being an arsonist/---wouldn't you rather be an arsonist who 1. (even if you're a sociopath) avoids long-term personal consequences for your actions; and 2. (if you're not a sociopath) causes the least global-utility harm in the course of your arson? Maybe by, say, going into demolitions as a career?

Again, having not watched the show---I've been assuming the whole problem with the "urge to kill+eat prey" in the show, was because the carnivores were being forced to eat only vegetables/grains mixed with alternative protein sources (i.e. how cheap cat food is made), and so were in some sense feeling this unsatisfied instinctual drive.

I feel like the whole premise of the show would be defused if there were non-uplifted animals, because if they existed in the setting, there'd be absolutely no (diegetic) reason that carnivores couldn't just get their ya-yas out by /hunting live specimens/ of those species. It's not like they're obligate-humanivore vampires; the death throes of a pig/rabbit/etc. as they eat it alive are presumably /just as satisfying/ as those of a demihuman.

Let me put it this way, if someone has weak impulse control and harmful / dangerous urges they need to be put away. They are not fit to live in our society, it's why we have prisons and hospices.

Some might be able to avoid it by being very capable of hiding their actions but that still doesn't change what should be done to them. If they can find a workaround or channel it in a non harmful way they don't necessarily have weak impulse control.

There's still fish and crustaceans. I don't see the problem the analogy is from what I can tell just an instinctual urge the predators have to kill prey.

What we're basically talking about is a set of interacting societies/species, where the societies' members have incompatible preference-functions.

It so happens that I know an example, the group of people that has the highest number / percentage of serial killers that are probably on the loose and not even suspected are truck drivers.

It's the perfect job for them, they can pick up some hitchhiker, do their paperclipping, deal with the evidence and be virtually scot free. They aren't suspects because they don't know the victim, work alone, have no oversight, are in remote places often, and never stay in the same place for long.

What they should do depends on their specific sense of morals. Ideally they'd turn themselves in, and opt not to reproduce and pass on their genes to anybody else.

Since that's not likely an option, cause the least amount of harm they can, avoid victims that have close families, focus on causing the least amount pain overhaul, that kind of thing.

Not exactly. I was trying to talk about the interactions of metaethical models between eusocial sibling-civilizations that have incomptaible terminal preferences.

Like, humans civilizations have, after bumping into one-another for a bit, developed a metaethical model that suggests that there are certain "human universal" social mores that are okay to insist on, because no neurotypical human is okay with violating them; while other things are merely cultural mores, and are left up to the members of that culture if not seen as harmful by other cultures, but trod over in the name of "human progress" if they /are/ seen as harmful.

But this doesn't sound like what would happen if two civilizations with truly incompatible sets of terminal preferences (the herbivores and carnivores in Beastars; or humans and some form of eusocial paperclip-optimizers) collided.

What would happen instead, /in terms the development of a shared metaethics/, if we ignore the large parts of the possibility space where one or both civilizations decide that a positive-sum relationship is impossible and just blow one-another up? What social mores would be generated---would be considered foundational? Would the paperclippers agree to not turn humans into paperclips, just other things? Would the carnivores agree that they /should/ be shackled in some way, and do so voluntarily even when there are no herbivores around?

Or, to put this in simpler terms: what do religions in the world of Beastars preach about?

********** You see my point of view on this is that it's not possible. Evolutionary psychology wise, it's just not a thing. That society couldn't work in an equality manner similar to one we'd find pleasant, given those two groups.

They could potentially live together with the prey in power and the predators as second class citizens. If the predators were in power I don't think they'd bother keeping the prey around, maybe for labor, but if these animals grow at a rate similar to humans, which seems to be the case given schools, they just aren't viable livestock.

The predators could keep the prey in reserves, similar to the native american ones around. Or give them a country / island and leave them be as a more humane option.

i.e I don't think it's possible without too much authorial bs, to the point that I'd even bother consider it.

Between aliens, sure they could coexist, between 2 sentient species that evolved together with one preying on the other, no. Maybe with genetic manipulation to a degree nobody would be comfortable with otherwise, never.

We are talking about millions of years of evolution, which curiously doesn't just affect our bodies without touching our brains or psychology. It's too much.

I presume you know why we have rapists, psychopaths, and every other kind of criminal imaginable ? If not, it's simple for a long time, enough for these tactics and adaptations to evolve and be selected for, those strategies worked, they gave them enough advantages to be passed on repeatedly.

It's not to say those people can't be helped or treated, but it's very difficult and costly and often not worth the effort, even in our own world where there are very feel of them.

With aliens it's a very difficult and complex subject. People are really uncomfortable assigning differing levels of intelligence to different types of sentient beings. Generally in a same planet basis, it's very difficult to come to a condition that ends in equality.

If the species have the same origin generally the most optimal one will take over to a point where everything else is replaced as happened here with the different human species that coexisted.

If they are different species it'd have to be some really elaborate scenario where they developed at the same rate or met at the exact right time where their technology levels were identical.

In space it'd be very similar, either a very elaborate scenario is required or there'd need to be a very powerful and influential species that forced every other species to treat each other with a semblance of equality.

Even within the same species equality is almost impossible, among different species with different intelligence and technology levels it'd need to be enforced by some higher entity to happen at all.

The usual assumption with any story with intelligent demihuman animals in a hard sci-fi setting is some sort of bioengineered "uplift virus", which, over a very short period of time, mutated both the bodies and brains of all animal species it could infect, into their present forms. They all just wake up sentient one day.

The other assumption some settings make, is that some precursor species (humans, usually) uplifted all these animal species within a bioengineering lab as test subjects; and they escaped, revolted, and banded together through a shared hatred of their captors to destroy the entire precursor species. This isn't implausible in terms of effort/impact, if this is happening on a recently-terraformed or colonized planet, used as an isolation environment for such experimentation, with no native fauna, and the only humans being the workers at the lab.

************ Even then you wouldn't expect it to last. In the long run natures optimization processes would take over and equality would disappears.

You'd still expect there to be a most optimal, or fit species that'd end up on the long run becoming the dominant and eventually only relevant species in that environment.

If not species, then it jumps to something else, i.e culture, religion, society. Just look at earth, non optimal groups were replaced, not necessarily via death, but often so.

It's just how 'Life' as in biological life, rather than our life, works. It's an optimization game, that's basically what evolution is. It just so happens that it extends past species when there's isn't another species to compete with and other selection methods become available, i.e societies and it's customs, and eventually ideas.

It doesn't mean the replaced species in a multi species society would disappear, just that they'd become a powerless minority which ends up meaning inequality.

Can you elaborate ? What tendencies ? Please be more specific, quotes would be appreciated.

​

Yes I know it's almost certainly an allegory for sexual assault, I state it in other comments on this thread, I speak this way because almost nothing is 100% certain.. We are on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] it's normally how we talk here.

Men aren't 90kg, 6th tall wolves or bears with sharp teeth and jaws strong enough to break and gauge necks in a single bite. Nor do we have sharp claws. Both of which serve no purpose in their modern society.

I'd argue the comparative danger / risk here is much higher than our own. We are talking about big beasts trying to eat you alive, and no irl people don't pass out from pain. And actual people without anime constitution, healing and lasting damage dismissiveness.

There's a lot of scientific literature and evidence that many women that have been abused become overweight as a defense mechanism.

Even when they participate in studies and diets that actually work and make them lose weight they tend to relapse and regain their weight when they start noticing signs of male sexual interest.

It's often sited in psychology circles, and a lot of scientists are trying to develop treatments. So maybe not "repulsive scents", but plenty of women consciously adopt an 'unappealing appearance' for most males to decrease the risk of sexual assault.

My point is these are very different scenarios. Most women are plenty careful when in dangerous scenarios and situations, and are very likely to avoid those situations entirely. It's one of our male privileges to not notice it very often.

** The food chain aspect isn't fantasy. Most of us already eat sentient beings as it is, and those of us that don't often have to override significant instincts and cravings (and perhaps even a degree of vitality, depending on which nutritionists you believe) to do so.

At the same time many of us maintain close emotional inter-species bonds, often with creatures that would ordinarily be our prey in another context. And we are happy to condemn people who eat what we consider pets, so we even have the same taboo aspect here.

So how do we deal with it? That is how it would be dealt with in a realistic story. The fact that it's a taboo yet still super common isn't unrealistic at all. (Inb4 "but it would be different if the prey were intelligent" it would be good to remember that slavery was a historical default.)

I think if we actually had multiple sentient species, the story would be about a lot _more_ than just predator prey relationships. That's really just one aspect of inter species interaction. Consider different physical capabilities (some people can fly!), different mental aptitudes, etc.

***** Yes because it is blatantly obvious that the people in this setting are controlled by their instincts to an extreme extent, beyond humans or domesticated animals. I don't think a human's capacity to have a relationship with (say) a pet chicken, and also butcher and eat other chickens, is that relevant to these creatures that only have vaguely human psychology.

****** You just don't notice the degree to which you're controlled by your instincts because you're a human! I'm sure a sentient rabbit would have all sorts of observations about your behavior and correctly attribute them to your human instincts.

In general, I think there's definitely people in this world who would not refrain from certain actions which significantly improved their quality of life, even if it meant killing people (even if they morally believed it wrong, even if their society put a taboo on it). If you don't agree with the point when it comes to meat, just consider the general case.
