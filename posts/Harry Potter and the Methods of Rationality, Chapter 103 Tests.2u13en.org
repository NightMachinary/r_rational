It's a different culture.

Our special attitude to kids is just artifact of culture, that clearly isn't shared by wizards (and wasn't shared by many historical cultures IRL - there are some nice quotes in Old Testament for example, teaching that parents should sacrifice kids if they can't both live, because kids won't live without parents anyway, and parents can have another kids - quite rational TBH).

True. Hermione blasted so many fireballs and Harry accidentally nuked Ireland in the movies. /s

************** I wouldn't be happy with half the thing they did in HP and not much less they did in HPMOR.

The fact that transmuting stuff into air is stupidly dangerous was my whole point - they give kids wands, teach kids transmutation, and then say "don't do this, that and that, cause it's dangerous".

It's like we gave loaded guns to every kid the first day in primary school, but told them "never shoot unsupervised". Good idea?

Also - the fact that it is incredibly dangerous contradicts your statement that their offensive capabilities are pathethic.

BTW Fireballs never were particulary good idea for offensive magic spell - canon HP got much better idea with avada kedavra, but evenwihtout it - why waste huge amounts of energy to create dangerous, highly visible and slow projectile, if you can just transmute someone's tooth into cyanide, cut his vein with small cutting hex, teleport him to deadly place, both teleportation on purpose, do 1000 things that are deadly and have way less property damage.

Dangerous, in the way that it's way more probable to kill yourself and all others around you with it. It's not "offensive", it's darwin award worthy idiocy.

Yes, I know fireball is kinda stupid. Did you miss the /s? It means sarcasm. Why not tell me something fancy about nukes too?

Because it's magic. It doesn't even have to be slow. Magic in that universe doesn't care about how much energy you waste.

  if you can just transmute someone's tooth into cyanide
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure you need to touch it with your wand, this is why the transmuting isn't good offense. Also, it's damn slow if you don't train very hard. That kid who just got his wand does not suddenly become proficient with it. They do not teleport. They do not know cutting hexes. They stick the wand through someone's eye socket if they want to kill someone with it.

If people adjusted their behaviour because of this, and fewer people were ready to sacrifice to defend others - in my opinion total utility (and survivability of the group) would decrease.

************* I'm not saying he is a good guy. I'm saying he is pretty rational, wanted that job and is a damn good teacher. I don't think we have any reason to think he would grade unfairly.

I think the argument that he wants to teach people to not be heroes fails completely, when we remember he tried to raise the whole nation against a singular threat. He is just cynical because he failed.

You are apparently arguing from the point of view that his main identity is "mass murderer Voldemort" instead of that identity just having some utitily value for him in history.

Being possessed is irrelevant as it looks obvious that the original owner of the body hasn't done anything the whole year and the possessor is in the complete control of the body. The teacher for all intents and purposes is Riddle. He just might be a bit more complex person than you apparently think.

edit: I'm also not argumenting from authority there. My argument is that you have no way of knowing his real grading system. The author does. You are kinda saying "In my opinion this works like this, but grades don't reflect that and it's unfair", when you probably just don't know how it works.

Also, we have gone pretty far from my point, which was that grading Hermione whatever is not unfair to anyone.

There's no indication that he's adjusted anyone's grades other than Hermione's (to keep her from getting a second troll) or probably Harry's (to mark him as his equal).

There's a parallel that Hermione died and failed and that Neville escaped and got the highest grade, but I think it's more likely that Q sees the lesson there and implies it to the class, rather than makes it happen in order to force the lesson to exist (which would be less clever on his part).
