So right off the bat this is not porn or fetish fantasy or wish fulfillment self insert work. Yes I know the initial impression can feel like that. I'm striving to deconstruct the entire genre here along side a bunch of other things.

If your new to the story start [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dance-Magic-Dance%21][here]].

If you want the latest update go [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dance-Magic-Dance%21&p=7871651&viewfull=1#post7871651][here]].

If you'd like to poke and prod at my world building and get some spoilery information or links I'm game for that too.

I want to make this project as good as I can reliably make it time budget allowing.

So please let me know what is or is not working.


** Is there a story only thread? It's a bit annoying scrolling though all the suggestions to get to each segment of story, and only having a couple segments per page.

*** Would it help if the images had some text on them? such as saying NEXT and PREV or perhaps just arrows? or maybe a hover over state?

I originally thought the coins were super obvious but have been hearing it's not actually something people realize does anything (personally I always check what hidden/image based clickables are on stories like this).

**** Text or arrows would be helpful (I probably wouldn't know to hover). I'd tried this story a couple months ago, but quit because I had the same issue.

I'd also be fine with a table of contents that links to the individual story posts.

** Showing the readers the wiki spell list would be work and would lock down the set of start-spawn spells, huh?

How extraordinary is Magic 22? What spells have such requirements?

How are XP gained?

*** I'm debating whether I want to make an actual wiki to fill with spells, or just include that in an update. Suggestions are welcome.

By the way, someone totally needs to cast Discern Properties on a Discern Properties window. Then again, since that is not something only our gang can do, the results are already on the wiki, since if I am on that planet, my clone already thought of it and posted the results to the wiki :P

And now you are starting to get some of the many planned trope inversions my friend :) welcome to a story with a 'global' supporting cast.

****** Make a wiki! (Also make a formula to roll, for every experiment we suggest, whether someone already did it and you add it to the wiki as a response to the suggestion :D. Involving rarity and max power of the used spells, time since the beginning of the event, etc.)

******* Any suggestions for a good free wikispace?

I'm not particularly picky, but ideally should let me do a really clean format/style template.

** Also interesting thing I'm seeing, this has been upvoted and downvoted in precisely equal measure.

Never seen that before. Would appreciate reading which things people are finding issue with or the inverse.

** u/Gurkenglas:
#+begin_quote
  how to store sufficiently complicated vivifications and metrics instead of suspensions
#+end_quote

So he is reading these comments after all! Valiant backpedaling there.

** Having read from start to end, it seems like maybe this is a bit slow for my tastes, both in terms of story progression in panels and production of said panels. Though maybe it's just the medium that I'm not used to...

*** Difficult to up production speed on this side.

Story progression wise though I think I might agree. It's a little slow.
