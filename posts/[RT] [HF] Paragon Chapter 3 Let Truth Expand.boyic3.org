** This has actually grabbed me - I'm going to keep following this.

Anyone who gets stuck on chapter 2, there's no link to chapter 3 at the bottom - you'll have to find another route.

*** Thanks for letting me know. I've fixed this and added a link to the bottom of Chapter 2 to get to the third. There is also a link in the menu which takes you to the latest chapter, and a table of contents.

Appreciate the note!

** Hmm. Seems well written, and the first chapter was captivating enough to make me want to keep reading. I'll be interested to see where this goes!

** The comment about willpower was interesting. It could have referred to resisting social pressure, or curiosity - or perhaps, a magical effect.
