*** You're not the only person to mention that. Believe it or not, I've never actually read it, but have seen some similar ideas expressed elsewhere that inspired me.

***** The sources I was most consciously aware of being inspired by were Deathkiller by Spider Robinson, and Mogworld by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw.

I think I've tried to start it once but have eventually dropped it. Was it an overall well written book, in your opinion?

******* I think it was competently written. There's a certain cynicism that is very clear throughout the whole thing that I found a bit off-putting, but given that perspective, I think it's well written and I don't think the perspective is unfair. It's just often bloody and uncaring in a sardonic sort of way.

*** Haha. Well, sure! Crazy-extreme experiences aren't for everybody... and that's okay! I would rather avoid the Drop Zone and other extremely intense rides at the fair. Some people love them, though.
