Looking for examples. I have a passing familiarity with the major biases, but haven't really internalized them such that fictional opportunities are obvious.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the references. I'll chew on it.


** It's a dangerous ploy, because any plan that depends on you successfully predicting your opponent usually runs afoul of [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/11/28/chapter-8/][Kakashi's second rule]]:

#+begin_quote
  “Then nothing,” Kakashi said as he leaped to the next roof. "It doesn't matter what level other people play at, because cleverness is still going to get you killed. Technically, the real second rule is that you should use the simplest possible strategy that can be made to work, so the worse the situation you're in the cleverer you're allowed to be. But you're not supposed to ever get in a situation like that in the first place, so it amounts to the same thing in practice.
#+end_quote

As such, a rational antagonist should really only be trying something like this if he's in a desperate situation, or if failing doesn't cost him anything. In the second case, he could be on the lookout for any mistakes that the protagonist is /already/ making and then try to take advantage of that. If you really want to go crazy though, you can put your antagonist in an impossible situation that /requires/ him to completely play his opponent, like [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/chapter-15/][this scene in NTBS]]:

#+begin_quote
  “It's obvious if you take your beliefs seriously,” Haku said with just a touch of ice in his voice. He wasn't sure if his master was provoking him intentionally or if his remark really had been intended as a compliment, but he resolved not to let it get to him either way. “You've said many times that Leaf ninjas are too soft and that this makes them weak. However, if they really were weak they could never have won three shinobi world wars. So the correct conclusion is that they are hypocrites, motivated not to do good but by a desire to have others think of them as being good.”

  “Oh?” His master was looking at him with good humour. “What difference does that make?”

  Haku turned away from his crystal ice mirrors and gave Zabuza his full attention. “If we forced Hatake Kakashi to choose between his life and any number of civilians, he would simply turn away, since if he were truly that good a person he would be dead. But if the choice is between the certain death of a civilian he knows and a mere risk to his own life, then he will choose the latter in order to avoid having to think of himself as a bad person. To exploit this, all we need do is to confront him with variations of this same choice, over and over until finally the effect is the same as if he chose to sacrifice his life after all.”

*** A minor variation would be that even if an antagonist doesn't technically /need/ to do anything to win, they might also run some costless B-plots with higher potential profitability just on the chance that the A-plot doesn't work for some reason.

However, if they then try to deliberately sabotage the (simpler) A-plot in order to attempt to force the higher profit of one of the B-plots, they've fallen prey to one of their own biases. Probably something like the sunk-cost fallacy.

** If you know what bias this falls under, I'd be interested to know. This happened to me inadvertently.

tl;dr People have a tendency to assign blame for malicious events that negatively affect them to their most available competition or enemy.

I was acting as a merchant in an online game, as were guy A and guy B. We were all in different areas, they knew each other but had not 'met' me as I'd just come online that day. Basically guy A and guy B had been competing in the same item categories (and now had some overlap with me), but apparently still had enough moral scruples not to fuck with each other as badly as I was about to... By DDoSing guy A with fake customers using unrealistic item prices.

Given the nature of the game, I don't really know if this works until I check up. When I do, I see guy A in a tiff with guy B (who I had not spammed). Then I check the boards, and sure enough someone (who I must assume is guy A retaliating) posting fake offers under guy B's name.

Then guy B, who I can only assume has no fucking idea why guy A randomly started cursing him out and presumably spamming him, decides to escalate in the same fashion.

It was a nice surprise for me.

I learned that day, that if you start fucking with someone and they can't directly attribute it to you, they'll have a short list of people to blame.

**** Hmmm, I dunno, iiuc “availability heuristic” is usually used specifically to describe the related flaw in how people judge relative probability, and I very much doubt Person A ever stopped to think about /how likely/ the situation was to be B's fault.

Also, I notice that it would be just as easy in the counterfactual world to say “availability heuristic” was why Person A blamed the newcomer, on the grounds that we'd expect recent changes should be very available!

** The easiest approach is to take a false belief they already have and exaggerate it, but only if such exaggeration can be made be useful to you. See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv3oLT3K4OQ][this]] for example. EY does this in HPMOR when Hermione's army pretends to be easily wiped out leaving Harry and Draco's armies to diminish each other's numbers before Hermione's army comes back and wipes them both out. Draco and Harry had the false belief that Hermione would be an inferior tactician, so she was able to plan around exaggerating that misconception and then exploiting the exaggeration.

Exaggerating misconceptions works well due to a variety of biases. Confirmation bias is one - the model you worked out or predictions you made seem to be even more on-point than you originally thought. Bandwagon effect is another when groups are involved, people don't want to run against the group consensus that X is true, so if you exaggerate X, they don't typically suggest that it's merely a ruse and X was actually wrong all along. Actor-observer bias also plays a role here since other people will be more likely to explain exaggerated X through your personality/characteristics than through external circumstances that could artificially encourage the appearance of X. The self-serving bias also plays a role when the trait you're exaggerating is a negative trait, like cowardliness, or ineptitude - the easy 'victory' must have been because of innate superiority!

** "Rivalry" is a cognitive bias in and of itself.

It's something like 'target fixation'. People focus so intently on their immediate-next-step ("observe the motorcycle" / "beat this specific guy") that they lose sight of their long-term-goal ("don't crash" / "win large-scale victories").

When you realize your opponent is doing this, you look for the places where you could be "defeated" without losing much ground on the things you care about. Alternately, look for long-term gains that don't look like a "victory".

Say we find ourselves in a Highschool Tennis Anime. My true goal is "be the best tennis player when we graduate in 4 years." I realize I have a rival. My rival's goal is "defeat [[/u/best_cat]] at whatever formal contest is next." The first thing I notice is that I don't have to care about my rival. But maybe contests provide some resource, so I need to win some.

Next step is looking for resources that don't seem like overt prizes and get those before they're contested ("Hey, senior student / inexplicably talented janitor, are you up for games on weekends?"). Then, I'd look for contests that WILL become relevant in 4 months, and see if I can start laying groundwork now.

Then I'd invent stuff for my opponent to do. They want to defeat me. I want to build resources. So create contests where they spend a bunch of energy "winning" a morale-victory, but not getting resources. ("Hey! A week of snack-money says I'm a better player with my off hand!")

*** One example could be, in that situation, practice with your opponents and either subtly throw the matches or show behaviors you wouldn't normally (IE you intentionally bias one side of the court, if that's a thing in tennis- I don't play). Meanwhile, you practice with the better players who aren't your direct competition to actually improve.

Of course, this is one of those things that seems smart at first glance but looking deeper reveals it's not a great idea- so pretty much par for the course for plans in anime. If you get a reputation as being a poor player you may lose access to the resources you want since people won't see the point of spending them on you. Also you are betting a lot on being able to show false behaviors while covering up the actual weaknesses an opponent might be able to exploit in the real match, which wouldn't work on weaknesses you aren't aware of. This is the sort of plan you'd only want to do if you're already behind and want to cover up your progression.

** This would be a pretty bad plan. Biases exert influence when someone has enough information to come to the right conclusion but then they go to the wrong one instead. But a good villain shouldn't be giving away possible clues without significant recompense. So biases would only ever be used incidentally as part of backup backup plans.

A detective novel of some kind might be a good place to look for this. My first thought was that Death Note might have some of what you're looking for. Alternatively, is there any genre of fiction in which people spend a lot of effort trying to manipulate public opinion? I guess Shadows of the Limelight would involve this, to an extent.

If you're looking for deceptive characters, and not ones who leverage named biases specifically, the Vorkosigan Saga by Bujold and the Going Postal series by Pratchett are both good.

That's what I meant. The OP asked about how a rational antagonist could use biases against their rivals. If by rivals here we mean the heroes, and not other villains that they're struggling with over the same goals, then your suggestion would require the heroes to be the racist/sexist ones, and that wouldn't make them feel very heroic - unless being tricked by the villain on the basis of it was a starting point for a character arc of self-improvement.

****** I suppose you can narrow your concept of rival down to that if you want to. That feels one dimensional, limiting, to me. Heroes and villains can be rivals with each other.

Superman vs Lex Luthor were rivals for the public regard, each trying to prove the other one is the real bad guy.

Spiderman and Venom are rivals. Plenty of hero/villain rivals for a relationship.

How about a villain pretending to be a hero? Or a struggling hero cast as a villain?

There are so many examples and possibilities for the concept of "rival"... why stick to the simple version?

******* I did not say heroes and villains can't be rivals.

My point was:

1) the OP asks how might a rational /antagonist/ use cognitive biases against his rivals;\\
2) the /rival/ of an /antagonist/ must be, if not another villain, the /protagonist/, aka: the hero;\\
3) the trick you suggested only works if the victim (namely, in this case, the rival) is racist or sexist;

THEREFORE

for your trick to apply to the scenario the OP asked about, the hero would need to be racist or sexist. Or at least having some form of strong enough prejudice to be impairing. That's it.

******** 1) yes 2) no 3) you have this literally backwards. If the protagonist is a woman and their rival the antagonist is a mysoginist, then it fits as an answer just fine.

Why did you assume the main character of the story is even under discussion? Not necessary for purposes of an antagonist and their rivals? The protagonist can easily get caught up in the rivalries of others as part of the story. We generally have one protagonist in a story, but a protagonist wasnt mentioned. There can be many villains and many heroes and they can all be rivals with each other in a story...

I can see that you seem frustrated. I am not trying to annoy you. We just seem to have come at this from different directions. I am guessing you write in a different genre than I do, so villain/hero/rival have additional connotations to me.

I think you do. The OP says "How might a rational antagonist use cognitive biases against his rivals?". The trick is used by the antagonist, the hero is thus the one who has the cognitive biases that are exploited. I don't think the genre has much to do with it.

I know it doesn't make much difference in practice as it can be done either way, and I didn't mean to make this a long discussion. I just made a joke about how applying your proposal to the scenario suggested by the OP might make the hero less than sympathetic.

** I think that can work if the antagonist (Ant) and his rival (Riv) are talking with each other.

For example Ant wants Riv to commit to a bet he is likely to win. So they both are on motor cycles (or horse golems or what ever) and Ant says to Riv: "The king/boss/authority figure said a great rider/driver could jump over the bolder if he is fast enough."

Riv believing he is a great rider, wants to prove that: "Yeah, I can do that. This should be easy for me."

Ant shouts: "No, you will kill yourself."

Riv jumps over the bolder with ease and also over the cliff behind it.

So Ant used (badly) authority bias, anchoring and probably some others, to get Riv to kill himself.

And afterwards he uses the hindsight bias to show how it was clear, Riv would die. And he was the only one trying to stop him.

But honestly that is a bad written example.

** In Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy the mastermind sets up Smiley by having the mole cuckold him. This becomes a source of negative emotions and aversion to considering the suspect. Smiley is so sure that the guy is an awful, vicious idiot that he is unable to see him objectively and notice clues about his involvement with things gone wrong.

This sort of thing happens all the time in stories where bias is a main character. We enter the scene with the subject, who is set up to look like the protagonist but has a cognitive bias, then we see the antagonist who looks stereotypical, and then the antagonist gets one over on the protagonist because of the latter's inability to recognize that the former's stereotype is actually a mask.

"Sorry to Bother You" has a lot of this going on, where people are all treating each other out of context. I couldn't swear to it, but I suspect that the more you look, the more cognitive bias you'll see in every character. Some are real villains, some are opportunists, some are just getting by, and some are heroes.
