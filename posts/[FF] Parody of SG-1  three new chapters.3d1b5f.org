** One of these is actually the one that was posted before (S1E21: Politics) but I wanted to get it in the chain.

*** Thanks for including one of the 'they got it right, actually' episodes. Always thought of SG-1 as one of the smarter sci-fi shows I've seen.

**** You're welcome.

There's actually an episode in an earlier season where the villains did absolutely everything correctly and only lost because /script/. (I don't remember if the heroes did it right or not.) I need to write that one up.

****** Two parter, [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709111/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl][Jolinar's Memories]] and [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709184/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl][The Devil You Know]] Those are IMDB links that contain significant plot summaries/spoilers. If you like, you can [[http://watchseries.ag/episode/stargate_sg-1_s3_e12.html][watch the episodes]].

These are the best episodes I've seen yet. (I'm up to the start of Season 4.) Sokar is the only intelligent villain the show has had to date, and he is both smart and genre savvy.

******* I dunno, he still ignored the 'Shooting is /not/ too good for my enemies' rule.

And he put his torturey prison world right next to his main production world, and allowed there to ever be a way out of its gravity well at all.

Plus, he buys his own hype.

At least he did some R&D - the Roshna addicted merc with the zat-proof armor was working for him.

Still, wait until you meet Ba'al. Then you'll see the true Genre Savvy Go'auld. That won't be for a few more seasons however.

Well, he had a prison planet, true, but when he heard about SG-1 he told Bynnar "go whack those guys immediately". Bynarr was all "awes, can't I please torture the chick?" And Sokar was all "nope, kill 'em right away."

Okay, that's fair.

That's not too unreasonable-- he needed a way to communicate with his prison warden. Considering there was only one way out and it was in what should have been the most heavily guarded part of the prison, I'm not too bugged about that one.

I don't know, I think that may have just been playing to the crowd.

Now THAT one I'll give you as stupid, in hindsight. If you're going to commit genocide, do the job right.

I'll look forward to it.

** Fun stories! I love sg1 though as others have said, it took a season or two to grow the beard.
