** I just got into this, and quite enjoyed it. Stayed up too late, even.

*** Thanks!

I don't think that I would be the person I am today without HPMOR; it really left its mark on me, and for that I am forever grateful.

** Good to get more discussion on how/why the different artifacts are bound to Amaryllis.

Curious why the skin tattoo failed. Wondering what the high-level results of a skill as broad as "Engineering" will look like.

Gotta say, I also think the author does a good job in both the emotionally resonant scenes and the nitty-gritty worldbuilding which often appear as if they're mutually exclusive skills.

*** My guess as to why the tattoo failed is that the fortress is under an anti-magic field.

**** What if the skin mage just stole the teleport stone?

** #+begin_quote
  Worth the Candle is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

If you haven't read any of this, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here's the link to the full thing]].

If you want to know how to make [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_vLuMobHCI&list=PL4e4wpjna1vxXNa7kCTF3i2LzFE9uKPPU][pemmican]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fE5KzvOZRk][portable soup]], I have helpfully included some "hyperlinks" earlier in this very sentence.

** Oh man, your too good to us <3. This is quickly becoming my favorite litrpg. You need to work a little harder catch to the wandering inn.

Whats the best way to support the story? Any plans for a patreon?

*** I am sadly not fast enough to /ever/ catch up to Wandering Inn. My current average word count is ~2600 words per day, while Wandering Inn seems to be ~3700 words per day.

I do like money, because it can be exchanged for goods and services, but I don't plan on ever monetizing this story, short of some publisher or agent coming up to me and offering me a reasonable deal (which almost certainly will not happen).

If you want to support this story, my preferences are:

- write some fanfic
- draw some fanart
- post about it somewhere
- recommend it to friends

But those are really just "things that would bring me personal happiness".
