*** We're currently doing a 3 weeks on, 1 week off rotation :) This week I accidentally edited the wrong episode, so had to rush edit this one once I realized it, hence it being late.

If we ever decide to discontinue though, I'll be sure to let everyone know.

** [Canon Harry Potter spoilers follow]

I hadn't actually thought about the ending of the Harry Potter series criticially before, but you're absolutely right. It should have ended with him dying, not with the triumphant and impossible return.

Thinking about it, I think the best option would be to have Neville be the hero at the end. He was contrasted with Harry as a potential prophesied hero, except that Voldemort chose Harry. If Harry's sacrifice enabled Neville to succeed, that would be perfect.

I'm actually getting frisson imagining it right now.

It would also avoid the "everyone marries off and has kids" ending that grated on me even at the time. Despite everything they had to do they all become perfectly well-adjusted adults with no psychological consequences.
