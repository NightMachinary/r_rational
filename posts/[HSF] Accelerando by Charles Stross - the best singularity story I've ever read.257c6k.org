** On [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Charlie's site]] you can read it for free (though it wouldn't kill you to buy a copy to give to a friend).

There's also the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accelerando_Technical_Companion][Accelerando Technical Companion]] which is woefully incomplete, but still helpful.

And of course if you still have questions, you can ask guys like me who can probably explain anything confusing.

** Reading it now and it is quite interesting. I wonder how close to that book we will come.

We will have some quite interesting problems in the future with robots and sentient programs.

***** Nobody said we're gonna make you die. Why would we do that?

No, we're mostly just not gonna let hostile and alien superintelligences dismantle half the solar system.

I think. One time [[/u/michaelkeenan]] of CFAR told me over dinner that we're gonna dismantle the solar system. I objected rather adamantly.

But at least, if our lot go around dismantling planets, it's because someone came up with an ethical argument in favor of doing such?

How about a practical one. Gonna have to build a dyson sphere out of something. Mercury seems like a pretty good cantidate.

Well, Earth has value as a tourist attraction. We can predict total solar eclipses far enough in advance to make sublight tourism to come see one possible if physical travel is required and agreeable if lightspeed transmission of personality is acceptable as a form of transportation.

Total solar and lunar eclipses should not be common features of most planetary systems. We get them here only during this period of time because of a quirk of diameter and distance involving the moon and sun. If technological life has arisen in other star systems, and the quirks of our star system are not absolute requirements for such to arise, then people will want to see the strange beauty of eclipseworld.

******* Well, you probably live on Earth, for one.

But if we had colonies on other planets/systems, I would probably want to keep Earth around for sentimental reasons. For one, Earth is /the/ birthplace of humanity.

Nature, bro. Nature. You do realize that most of humanity associates Nature with ultimate goodness rather than with blind, gibbering idiocy?

********* Personally I was actually hoping to keep most everything besides the asteroid belt as a Historical Origins of Peoplekind Museum. For one thing, the limitation would help get us focused on colonization rather than on going oil-crazy and consuming our resources like locusts (/again/).

It's also important to keep the ecosystem of Earth intact, especially: without it, where will people come up with ideas for new body-shapes?

We care about it because we evolved in that kind of environment. But if you started extrapolating people's values, I don't think they'd really value what nature's about. Nature is chaos, subsistence living, mostly suffering and death with regular extinctions. The balance of nature is just an illusion and only appears on human time frames. See the blue graph on the top of this page: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event]]. Does that look like balance to you?

I think most animals' lives have negative utility, do you disagree with that? On what basis?

Many people have a romanticised idea of the natural world that probably has little to do with the reality; they appreciate the polished, TV-friendly aesthetics of nature documentaries without actually spending much time beyond their urban boundaries.

Negative usage-value to us, or negative ethical utility? I definitely disagree very strongly with the latter, since I tend to object-level value Nature itself /as such/. I don't want to live there, but I refuse to destroy it.

When you pick animals' lives apart, there are more things that I don't value, like intolerable pain, starvation, frustration, death, failure etc. than things I value.

It's my way of dealing with the fact that I find it intolerable to destroy Nature, and intolerable to enslave Nature to my own values and desires, but simultaneously feel that Nature is morally abhorrent most of the time.

Conclusion: damn that Nature stuff is creepy; leave it alone until it can speak well enough to /ask/ for my help.
