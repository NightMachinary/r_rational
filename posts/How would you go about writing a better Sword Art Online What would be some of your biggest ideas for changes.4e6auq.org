For a couple of weeks I've been writing a story, the beginnings of a book. There aren't any good US novels set in a Death Game MMORPG, and I thought that SAO could have been so much more, so I've been starting to pursue this.

I'm not expecting a completed draft in 2016. Right now I've got maybe 80 pages of material, largely composed of worldbuilding, character ideas, the plot outline, etc. I'm pretty set on sticking with some of SAO's broader ideas - being primarily set in a floating castle in the sky, a dual wielding black swordsman protagonist, a strong female deuteragonist/love interest. Aside from that I've been considering new and broader ideas to make this world far more faithful to real MMOs while having the kinds of advancements you'd expect from a late 21st century (2089 is the year) after the market has had generations of more traditional MMOS come and go.

What are some of your ideas? Ways you'd improve on SAO's plot and setting? I'm particularly interested in ways a videogame would meaningfully progress through a 'gigantic floating castle' world without using SAO's 100 floors to clear, 100 bosses model. Wasn't at all a fan of that aspect.


** SAO had a lot of potential, and did a lot of things ... well, I hesitate to say "wrong", because the show was very successful, but not the way I wanted them to be done.

/Personally/ I would have placed the focus on guilds and guild politics, since that's a proxy for people and their interactions with each other, but I was a guildmaster in World of Warcraft so naturally my perception of MMOs centers there (this was back when beating Molten Core was considered impressive). From what I can remember, SAO comes close to ditching the guild concept entirely, and the protagonist does pretty much everything by himself as a lone wolf.

If you want a different progression, the progressions that most MMOs have are:

- Level progression
- Attribute progression
- Skill progression
- Item progression
- Player skill progression (how good the player is at the game)
- Story progression (areas locked until questlines are followed)
- Faction progression

I would probably split the castle up into sections that each have their own requirements. To get to floor 81, you need to have killed the boss of floor 76, acquired a rare pendant that can only be made by crafting from rare ingredients, and be able to make it past that iteration of the Hall of Trials.

The bigger problem with the conceit is that if permadeath is enabled, the optimal strategy is really boring; grind grind grind on enemies that there's no risk against. If there's a 1% chance of death when fighting an enemy, then by the time you've fought ~70 battles there's a 50% chance that you're dead. There are definitely ways to combat that from a mechanical standpoint, but I generally think that risk minimization doesn't make for great stories. (And if the game combats risk minimization, I would expect an enormous attrition rate.)

Check out [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]] if you haven't yet. I often describe Log Horizon to friends as "SAO with more focus on guilds and politics". It also avoids risk minimization behavior by having respawns with a few penalties.

*** There's an extremely wellwritten SAO AU called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] that places a lot of focus on politics, altho it's designed differently so it's less "guild politics" and more "race politics". The premise is that Alfheim online is the death game, with 20,000 players, and the race that gets to the top of the world tree first, and two races of the winner's choosing, get to be freed of the game (there are 9 races) Revival magic exists but it's very high level and your remain light only lasts for a minute. Unfortunately tthe story isn't complete yet, nowhere near, but what's there now is epically good. I particularly like how the author approaches racism as that's a big theme since only three races can clear, and also there's other things thathappen that demonstrates how easy it is to stereotype people based on their race

*** Yeah, I'm also a current GM of a Warcraft guild - we've full cleared all of the current content on the highest difficulty. For this story, guilds are to be the main political entity. The loyalties and beliefs of the faction leaders - the heads of player government - are to have a large impact on which guilds can be on top, etc. Voting for the faction leaders of each race is to function as a true democratic system - so clearly the system would be heavily biased in favor of the guild masters of large, popular, well connected guilds.

I absolutely agree that risk minimization and forcing characters into grinding of easier content is a natural consequence of a permadeath penalty. And to an extent, that's fine. In real life, across military history, each active duty combat soldier has been supported by on average 10 support personal, I read that statistic somewhere. In World of Warcraft, cutting edge raiders are only a small minority of the playerbase. But, still, given the permadeath penalty, powerful incentives with a real life impact are needed to get people to play the game as intended, minimizing grinding by elite players.

To get past this issue, I'm strongly inclining towards a multiple-faction game. Ironic that Alfheim Online could have possibly been a better Death Game than SAO's Aincrad. I'm thinking, say, 7 factions/races that each have combat and crafting strengths and weaknesses. Only the faction/allied factions that defeat the final boss can leave the world. Any players left behind, die, including players of a victorious race but who are no longer in that faction or its allied faction races. So it's literally a race to the top. Petty grinding is taken care of internally by guild farming teams. Between this and the American warrior culture/shaming of cowards (see how people thought of WWII draft-dodgers) I think that could be enough to address your concern.

Strong incentives are to be in place for faction betrayals, scheming, etc. Your idea of considering the entire castle as a magnified Opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj-type scenario is very good and can potentially play into this. Let's say that important gateway/attunement items are highly limited in availability, but have multiple sources, and that the easier sources, once claimed, never again are available. So second/third place guilds will have to deal with increasingly more difficult challenges. A weaker guild's way around this is by fielding more players, sabotaging the higher ranked guilds, and scheming/treachery. Players can be incentived/bribed/corrupted to betray their guilds and rob from the guild bank and seek refuge with a new guild or faction. Important Main Quest items need to be stored in the guild bank or the Guild Hall and can be stolen with high enough connections. Soulbound gear does not exist and virtual player inventories are limited, so items can be stolen right off people from their corpses, their houses or their guild hall quarters, etc. I've never played EVE Online, but I've been reading on it and its 'Corporations', trying to find inspiration.

To incentivize players being raiders on a more personal level, I'm inclining towards base pleasures and insurance. Food and sleep are important - you get tastier food, more quality and restful sleep, your own house or guild quarters, more secure ways of securing your items/loot, if you are a raider. Raiders will tend to be significantly wealthier than plebeian grinders or merchants. Sex is also a factor - in this world, the full-dive VR (I call it 'synaptic' VR) industry was jumpstarted by the porn industry after it started becoming accessible outside of medical and military functions, so pretty accurate sexual functions are in the game. Cutting edge raiders are absolutely provided with women by their guilds - which will absolutely horrify and fascinate the real world when they begin learning what is going on in the game.

I'm still uncertain about this idea, I have not put in much critical thought yet - in particular I'm not sure what it would mean for gender relations in the game and in top guilds in particular. But I did think it was /ridiculous/ that sex was a possibility in SAO and only briefly elaborated on. In a rational, mature portrayal of such a setting, prostitution would absolutely be a fairly significant 'profession.'

Large, established guilds also provide a salary and life insurance, to take care of a raider's loved ones in the game if the raider dies. This is augmented by solemn promises to carry on the duty in real life after the game is cleared.

That...

That is going to be a hell of a psychological shitshow.

All the worst parts of tribalism, combined with a fight for your life which you were completely unprepared for, with only one group able to emerge alive at the end?

Betrayal, mass murder, a lot of things start looking like valid tactics in that kind of scenario.

It's even worse, because there is no chance anyone will cooperate cross-lines. If they lose, they will die anyways, so why bother helping them? Only one faction can survive, so why bother making friends or forming connections with someone in another group? Only one of you can survive, or perhaps neither will.

Cooperation was at lest technically possible in Alfheim because the prize was only permaflight. Here the prize is /life./

I can't see a way for that kind of scenario to not end up being very, very dark.

Can you switch factions? If so, the clear and first response by any rational person is to pick one faction and have literally everyone join it. Leave the other 6 empty, so that when someone wins, everyone escapes - but if that's possible, the whole drama is removed.

***** Multiple factions can survive - but only the ones 'allied' with the faction of the player that is raid leading the final boss encounter.

A situation never emerges of all of the factions allying, or all players joining a specific faction, because they aren't rational/trusting enough to do it. One of the factions 'zerg rushes' another in the game's first few hours, causing a lot of bitterness. Racism absolutely becomes a thing, quickly, in the game. Furthermore, I earlier mentioned how there are strong incentive in place for betrayal, since you can steal from other players and switch factions. Players may choose to switch factions purely to isolate or remove themselves from a dangerous enough environment, since they can be stolen from/attacked by members of the same faction. Jails in this game are barely functional, there is no equivalent to a secure federal prison and no higher law enforcement from real life authorites...so the scheming is going to be multi-layered.

Yes, the setting is intended to be pretty darn dark. Not out of intention, but purely because the scenario, carried out to its logical conclusions, demands no less.

What are people suspending their disbelief in?

- Disbelief that Death Games exist?
- Disbelief in strong VR?
- Disbelief in VR MMO existence?
- Disbelief in unbalanced VR MMO mechanics?
- Disbelief in strange Death Game-specific mechanics applied to the VR MMO?
- Disbelief in character reactions to the the Death-Game-specific mechanics of the VR MMO?
- Disbelief in character reactions to the the general mechanics of the VR MMO?

I mean, does TF2 make sense? Does Call of Duty? Does Age of Empires? Does Neko Atsume?

Games don't have to make sense for players to want to play the game.

Sometimes people play games because they specifically /don't/ make sense.

The only suspensions of disbelief that I suspect matter are your reader's disbelief in the world's setting and the player responses and player sociology. Death Games don't make sense.

That's not really multi-layered. That's one layer: The only effective method to enforce rules is death. You only have two kinds of 'crimes', ones which are minor enough to be dealt with via slap on the wrist, and capital crimes.

Unless there is some mechanic induced other way to show displeasure, such as a way to shun or remove people involuntarily from a faction, this is going to go the way of post-apocalyptic wasteland politics very quickly.

This actually reminds me of Log Horizon, where the players were collapsing into anarchy because it was impossible to enforce rules, until one group stood up and through manipulation of the game systems forced a set of basic laws to be accepted as they had the power to control access to player housing or bank locations.

Also depends on how private property rights are enforced. Are things in your inventory inviolable? Do they drop when you are killed or knocked unconscious? Can you be stolen from? If there is some leeway here, there may be an option for some other punishment form.

You'd get guild-level bureaucracies to handle the decisionmaking, but they'd have to convince the combat leader to press the appropriate buttons. And what if the faction leader isn't reporting the faction's accounts correctly to the bureaucracy? An upstart young fighter could beat a rat in the farm and learn new things about the faction's books that put the former leader in a bad light.

  I'm thinking, say, 7 factions/races that each have combat and crafting strengths and weaknesses.
#+end_quote

There's something you should keep in mind here though, and that is faction imbalance. Just look at WoW, where pretty much no server has a Horde/Alliance balance and even if you take all servers in to consideration there's still more of one than the other. This becomes even more extreme if you look at the numbers of players for each race, which are often chosen for aesthetic reasons. Then there's also the thing that if the races/factions give different benefits there's bound to be some power imbalances, simply because such things are never perfect.

Also, if race matters for which faction you belong to in the end of the game, how does betraying/faction changing work? And if faction allegiance is mostly a thing you can freely choose and change, what incentivizes people in a literally alien death world to not all stick together and slowly converge into one faction? Sure there might be crazy outliers but anyone who is sane would join the strongest faction in a heartbeat. I mean even if the leadership is oppressive, as long as it shows results without using people as cannon fodder one always knows that it is the best way to get out alive and after that it doesn't really matter anyway.

Tribalism might be a thing but usually that happens after either separate communities form in earnest or if there's no common outside threat. Assuming that the MMO imprisons everyone the first time they log in, people have pretty good chances to have friends and allegiances all over the various races as long as they chose them on their own instead of coordinating for a shared leveling experience or something.

No matter how unintuitive in a crisis, they'll still end up electing leaders democratically. How much that actually matters depends on what mechanical powers said faction leader gets.

** You could also draw inspiration from Log Horizon. On that anime the MC is a somewhat rational mage whose specialty comes from strategy and planning, he doesn't fight in the front lines but rather directs the party keeping close control of their health and mana levels.

He also deals with the ramifications of a system where there's no set economy and the NPCs as resources or characters on their own right.

I think the first days would be chaos and the characters would require to stay together and avoid getting into trouble until things settle. Everyone would be in need of leadership so if they're charismatic enough they could rally them and form the first guilds.

Kirito was a misantrophist and wasn't much of a team player. Depending on what you want to focus on, you could keep him like that and have +Klein+ BallsDeep69 (the fun but sadly forgotten support character) manage social interaction or have a more people person Kirito trying to lead his group.

There's also the fact the SAO system wasn't defined, in most MMORPGs you can't get by going solo against everything and you require to party. My main grip with SAO was how Kirito seemed to roll over any enemies on his own when that's usually counterproductive in RPGs.

How he's a competent problem solver, capable of piecing together genre-pertinent information, and a competent mercenary besides. Kirito is a /very/ good character to use as a window into worldbuilding and problem solving.

My intention with the story's dark swordsman is to have him as a competent mercenary who quietly work on behalf of several faction leaders while he's piecing together the greater mystery behind the world - finding the identity of the Game Master and his accomplice, and other lesser criminals. He's in an unusual situation. He's forced into being a solo-er as much out of circumstance as by his own choice.

Guild leadership/battlefield leadership is more intended to be the role of the heroine and the main character's friends.

Thanks to this thread I'm realizing that in a setting as guild-centric as this one will have to be, the main protagonist can't quite be a second Kirito. He won't be as dominant in the raiding scene. I'll have to consider how to go about this.

That's where Kirito and his mercenary group enters the scene, taking care of the obstacles or undesirable players so that they can stay focused on grinding and clearing the game. Asuna could be his main link to the Knights of the Blood Oath and primary contractors, and have romance and the like come from those deals.

That would also mean he can ask for good fees and get rare drop items from the guilds as payment if you want him to still be a powerful and dangerous enemy. Conflict could come by him butting heads with other mercenary factions like Laughing Coffin that perform the same "services" his group does.

I absolutely 100% agree that the main theme of SAO was bridging the gap between the real and the virtual. I need to do that in my own way.

I'm not willing to outright nerf Kirito, he's too useful as a independent, unaligned problem solver. But dramatically changing his story role could work. Elsewhere in the thread the idea was raised of making Kirito the /GM of Laughing Coffin/ - making him the leader of a guild of cleaners, assassins for hire who clean up after broader faction conflicts. I like and am strongly considering. It's a /really/ dark road to take his character down though, I'd have to figure out how to make it work without bogging the story down in PTSD.

Guilds are powerful entities and having backing and resources from powerful players is a good incentive to join one. Kirito may create his unaligned mercenary group as a response to seeing guilds abusing players to bring a certain level of control and fairness to the game.

That would be like sending a message, "you can organize and deal all you want with petty politics, but step out of line, abuse the weak players and you may get a nightly visit from Laughing Coffin (whatever Kirito's guild name is)".

*** Yeah - the stat and skill system.

What I've been leaning towards is a two-part leveling system. Leveling of the character and, more importantly, their skills. Character leveling (player power increasing) is intended to be strongly logarithmic, if graphed out. A max level character (intended to be functionally impossible, there will be exponentially increasing diminishing returns on the speed of character leveling as one approaches level 100) will be stronger than a base level character, but only by severalfold, like how a world-top weightlifter can bench only several times what a random joe off the street could.

The real onus of character progression is intended to be in their skillset. A high level character will be many times more mobile, have more stamina, have a far higher mana capacity, have a much broader skillset for defensive abilities, illusions, healing, armor piercing, CCing/tripping up enemy movement, etc.

It is intended to be a difficult stretch to overcome, but a level 1 starting character should absolutely be capable of beating a max level character. Leveling up won't increase one's base walking or attack speed, weapon skill, won't dramatically increase HP or base weapon damage, etc. A critical headshot will still kill anyone.

Inflation is to be dealt with by a strongly resource intensive crafting system. a housing market, taxes and rent (faction and guild taxes - the faction leader is a player, also system rent fees for owning the property), and middlemen fees. There will be no Auction House. Rather, raiders will have the strongly incentived option to sell their unneeded drops, farmers sell their farmed goods, to brokers - middlemen - who in turn sell to players who make a full time living selling in the central town square, etc. Where possible these economic functions are handled purely within the guild (guild brokers and mechants and farmers). Solo players and members of non-elite guilds will have a more expensive life, in general.

  taxes (faction and guild taxes - the faction leader is a player)
#+end_quote

If the tax revenue goes to actual players instead of vanishing into the ether (the way WoW's auction house tax does for instance) then it won't really help in any way to prevent inflation. The moment the guild/faction leaders purchase something from the player driven market it's all out there again.

Also, what role exactly will NPCs play in your world and how much will they be people vs being automatons that look like people?

  The future probably has incorporated women into the hardcore gaming crowd to a greater degree, but there could still be a wide demographic split and I'd love to see how "white knights" and competition for relationships would affect things.

More importantly, how many people will actually be playing their real life gender? In WoW for instance I know that it is much more common for a man to play a female character than for a woman to play a male one. Both happen though and they usually don't reflect the player's real life sexuality in any way.

*** Yeah, I thought for a while about Endbringer-type enemies, as a way to force the lowbie players/cowards into taking action, but I don't think it's for the best. Awesome as the Endbringers are as a story mechanic, I don't think they are a rational solution to the setting's flaws and they would introduce some of their own. How would the people who stay in the Town of Beginnings be motivated by an Endbringer showing up? They'd just die or flee - they couldn't contribute to such a fight. Attrition on the front lines will be bad enough without putting in place unbeatable enemies. Motivation to force people to raid can be put in place by other ways.

Also, the Endbringers aren't characters so much as they are forces of nature. It's probably best to focus on purely human opponents and motivations.

***** Too arbitrary and non-genre-compliant. It's natural and expected for only a certain significant minority of MMO players to be front-line raiders. And /predictably/ removing the starting town/towns on higher levels would play havoc with the economy/housing market. There may be merit in having the /city/ move up with raiding progression, but would have to think further on it.

There is definitely too much safety for the lowbie players, though...

Hm. Right now I'm thinking of what it would be like to have a/the starting town be a safe zone for several months to a year, but then a boss is kited (intentionally or unintentionally) to a faction city and due to mechanics becomes invincible there. I'm imagining what would happen if you had a Doom Lord Kazzak equivalent be kited to a faction capital, with no GM intervention. The city would have to be abandoned...

I'm not quite willing to go full on Endbringer. But this could work. The Endbringers were in any case a mechanic that operated over the course of decades. Only one or two Endbringer-caliber acts of destruction on the playerbase would be needed in the 1-2 year timeframe I have in mind for this story.

For reference - Doom Lord Kazzak was an open world boss in Warcraft that would heal whenever it killed a player or NPC, even ones that weren't in combat with it. If it wasn't killed within 5 minutes, it would also begin continuously spamming a massive radial AOE attack. It was kited to a faction capital and literally broke the city...there is potential in this.

****** If we use World of Warcraft as our example, starting zones become ghost towns through natural progression of the world anyway. So long as there's some incentive for it to happen, elite raiders will trivialize content for lowbies simply by virtue of being able to come in, party up, and blow through everything. Back when I played this was fairly common, not just with elite raiders helping their real life friends, but also with smaller guilds trying to recruit new members. There's little risk involved for either party; the lowbie gets powered up in a hurry and the elite raider is at virtually no risk of death.

As for alternate incentives you might be able to use, if you think you need them, a raider needs support personnel, but he might benefit from those support personnel being higher leveled or with better attributes. I believe at one point World of Warcraft tied secondary skills (fishing, cooking, enchanting) to character level, though I have no idea whether that's still the case.

(I also think there's a certain level of narrative drama available in a ridiculously powerful guy in Tier 15 armor blasting his way through a dungeon for a herd of lowbies.)

** The one thing I would really want to see with loner protagonist similar to Kirito is to make him /lose/ because of lack of cooperation.

That is, present a weak, inexperienced character (let's call him Klein), hilariously incompetent but with decent management skills. The initial perception of 'Klein the comedy character' will gradually turn into 'Klein the guild master/strategist excelling at leading people towards the common goal'. But still being horrible at direct combat.

Will Kirito detest Klein as a 'coward who can't fight for himself'? Will he later realise that, perhaps, if he joined Klein earlier, he could have saved more people? Will Kirito resent Klein for that?

Immersion and suspension of disbelief in this world is supposed to be nearly perfect. LH was too 'gamey' for what I want to make.

That being said, I've only watched the first two episodes of LH. I really should watch it, if only to see if there are any ideas I can use and to be able to intelligently debate with the show's fans. But - yeah, link your post, I'm curious about what you wrote.

** Floating castle setting possibilities:

A Hogwarts-like setting where the higher-level enemies are /there/ in the halls, but only care about level-appropriate prey. Occasionally a "major" "villain" "attacks" in a free-for-all crossover event where everyone can help kill minions and the greatest players get to enjoy teaming up against the Big Bad.

The castle is neutral ground; you can only fight training dummies in the designated combat areas. There are "bridges" to other floating locations of varying difficulty, clearly labelled, and possibly requiring the entrant to be of appropriate level (a challenge to a skilled, underleveled protagonist who punches above their weight class.)

There are 100 floors to clear and 100 bosses. Bosses on the ground floors protect players. Bosses on the higher floors attack players; each is more fiendishly difficult than the last. Bosses below ground are weak and ineffectual, and the most ruthless players reign as kings. (EVE Online version.)

There are no posted difficulty settings and no explanations. Players make maps of the explored portions of the unfathomable-large castle, marking areas where no-one has returned, or which contain valuable resources, while others plot to exploit secrets they've discovered. Some use flying machines to travel quickly around the impossibly-small exterior. (Minecraft version.)

There are no enemies. Players construct dungeons filled with fiendish traps and empower themselves with insanely broken magic items. Low-level players must find a patron to survive, in exchange for promises to repay them later. (Ironfell version.)

The castle is under siege from flying demons. The players must specialize and cooperate in order to defeat the ever-more-powerful waves of enemies, using limited tools to enforce compliance. (Social experiment version.)

Fire melts metal. Metal smashes stone. Stone endures/extinguishes fire. The metagame constantly shifts between the pyro/ferro/terra-kinesis being dominant, as players reshape the structure around them in complex duels. (Or some other triad - perhaps archers defeat pikes defeat armoured knights defeat archers.) Weak players jump on board with the powerful faction only to find the tides turn before they've built up enough strength, while the most powerful have amassed enough that even their vulnerable element needs a master to penetrate their defence.

** SAO gets a lot of flack for "It could have been better". The way I see the anime, it did an excellent job at telling an excellent story in 15 episodes, then ended. (And then I simply ignore everything after the first season of the show.) It was very much character-focused, and did a great job showing the emotional aspects of a death game, and the domestic aspects of what it meant to /live/ there. You have shops, you have schools, you have crime, you have power-hungry leaders, you have old fogies who love to fish, you have romance, and if you're really lucky, maybe something more.

So yes, you could stretch the Aincrad arc into a show spanning several years, and there'd be a lot to explore. Personally, I wish they did too. But as a 15-episode story, that wasn't its purpose, and they did a great job showing something new every episode.
