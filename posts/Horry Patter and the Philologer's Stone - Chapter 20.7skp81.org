** Ok, I'm going to take a guess that Horry really isn't magical and it's just his wand casting spells at his command

** So I'm guessing /some/ Master Patter understood the last classified thing the wand said.

If they really want to screw their own heads up, they could tell the wand to take a specified action if and only if it is/is not the Eldar Wand. For bonus points, end up in a state where knowledge of your own existence is classified to yourself.

** This must be what being dyslexic feels like. I wish this is easier to read.

*** If this were what it felt like to be dyslexic I expect fewer people would complain about it. This is fun.

**** Imagine that, but always and not for fun.

I'm not usually lysdexic, but I've had some bad days.

** I wish the author would use more dialogue tags. It's obvious when the wand is speaking, of course, and generally easy to figure when it's Horry, but lots of dialogue without saying who is speaking just makes the scene collapse into a blank void with a single speaker.
