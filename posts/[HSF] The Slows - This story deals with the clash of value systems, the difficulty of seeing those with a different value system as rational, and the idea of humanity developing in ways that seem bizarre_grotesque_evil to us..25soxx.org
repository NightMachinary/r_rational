** I do not see how this could be a development that could be considered grotesque/evil. Bizarre, yes, though it would most likely not be by the time such a concept would have been developed. I understand the fact that some people would find having a child growing/maturing extremely fast abhorrent, but there should be much less people who would do so at that point in time.

*** Do notice that it is implied that the procedure dulls emotions. The narrator finds it distasteful how the Slows "twist their faces wildly". and believes their rational thought is diluted by their "emotional exaggeration". A.O.G. evidently also removes "the swollen protrusions on [Slow women's] chests", which plenty of people of all genders might object to. If there's anything to be read into the black and green makeup the Slow wore in the narrator's honor, it might do pretty bad things to your complexion too.

Is it? You could consider emotions 'dulled' if the level of emotional response was reliably insufficient to get the right things happening for the current situation. But the necessary levels themselves seem to depend on individual psychology.

You could with equal validity postulate that in Slow childhood, the child forms unhealthy biases towards particular emotions, leading them to overly seek out some emotions and avoid/repress others. (ie. Slow -> permanent emotional trauma)

You could, but that's not how I was using it. I was considering emotions "dulled" if the level of emotional response is lower than it would be without the procedure. You are free to argue that natural emotional responses are unhealthily strong, but it isn't stupid to object to that.

****** What I was saying is that natural emotional responses are *unknown*. We are not in a position to separate them from the mess of other processes happening in a child's life, so there is no basis for clearly saying 'X emotional response to Y is natural' -- most of our knowledge is more like 'X emotional response to Y is considered natural in Z culture'.

(that is, there is no 'correct', 'emotionally healthy' claim to be made here. All you can do if you want to improve outcomes is to measure outcomes.)

******* By "natural", I just meant "Non-A.O.G." Sorry, I assumed that was clear from context.

Take as large a population as you want, and divide it into two groups by random lottery. Consistently apply Accelerated Offspring Growth to one group, consistently deny it to the other. Do this for several generations. Subject individuals to tests designed to draw emotional responses. Have judges (or an algorithm, or something) rank each individual's degree of emotional response, without knowing which group they came from. Put all your data together.

The story strongly implies that the A.O.G. group will have weaker emotional responses than the non-A.O.G. group. Relative to the A.O.G. group, the non-A.O.G. group has exaggerated emotions. Relative to the non-A.O.G. group, the A.O.G. group has dulled emotions.

/After the outcomes are measured, after controlling for the unknown mess of other processes/, the procedure dulls emotions /relative to a non-A.O.G. population/.

It is not irrational for the two populations to disagree on which had the improved outcome, if they have different utility functions.

******** I agree except for your final statement. This is why they cannot reasonably measure emotional response as the basis of the comparison. If they do, they are essentially disagreeing on the /definition/ of 'good outcome', not on whether the outcome /is/ in fact good. The situation has left the realm of trying to understand things, and entered the realm of manipulation and politics ("your opinion sucks, mine is better, no, I'm not providing any supportable reason").

I suppose on reflection that could be rational, if the other party has shown themselves unmoved by reasoning. Otherwise they need to first agree on what a 'good outcome' looks like in order to proceed rationally.

********* Yes, they are disagreeing on the definition of "good outcome". That's what a utility function /is/. Disagreement on that level is not unreasonable.

Yes, I acknowledge that according to your definition of "good outcome", it would be suboptimal if I killed everyone by disassembling the Earth to build a quadrillion Buddha statues. But according to my definition, it sounds lovely. I'm going to do my best to steer the world towards what /I/ think is the best outcome. And if you disagree when I start doing it anyway - I don't /care/. Yours isn't the definition I'm using.

********** And what I'm saying is that their actual disagreement is in utility function, but if they avoid saying so by pretending that their own view is objectively 'correct', then they are both talking (political/manipulative) nonsense.

This is exactly what's wrong with speaking like a moral realist.

*********** True. People should be aware of where their disagreement actually lies. Accelerated Offspring Growth can be AOG-good but not Slow-good, because those are two different things. I am only saying that if those two populations vote on whether A.O.G. should be forced on Slows, they will vote differently. The fact that their votes are different is not caused by stupidity or irrationality in either party, and there is no way to reasonably debate them into changing their vote. (Assuming they know what they want and they know how to get it. Which is basically never true in the real world, unfortunately.)

I think we're just quibbling over each other's ambiguous wording, and we actually agree.

When it comes to values, it's sometimes really hard to understand other people's and cultures' point of view. There are people in today's world who think it's evil that homosexuality is allowed and women are free to choose whom they have sex with. It's far easier to understand why people would cling to the traditional way of raising kids because usually people cling to traditions even in far more controversial subjects.

When it comes to new developments, it's always possible to see similar numbers of people opposing those developments. I don't think it's that implausible.

And yeah, I'm not yet sure if I'm ever going to be a parent, but something about slowly raising a child seems really fun. Seeing a few kilos of pooping and crying meat /really slowly/ becoming one of the most effective general-purpose machines on Earth sounds kinda interesting.

Incremental progress is really cool. If you've ever played [[http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/][Cookie Clicker]] you would understand.

Also, I think [[/r/childfree]] would enjoy this. You should submit it there. (I will if you'd rather not, but I don't want to take your credit.)
