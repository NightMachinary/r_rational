**** Or at least he /thinks/ he's fighting voldemorte/Riddle/Quirrell. Remember from Ch. 27: "Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level he played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had responded, One level higher than you."

The primary source for Harry's perception of Quirrell's motivation is from his speech in ch. 34-35. While there is further evidence that HPMoR:Quirrell was expressing his true opinion in that speech, the majority of that occurs after FtP split off, so it is not really part of FtP. If voldemorte/Quirrell's assessment of his own ability to model Harry is still accurate by chapters 34-35, then this speech (or for that matter the whole related aspect of the Quirrell personality) could have been shaped to produce this very result.

In fact, I would be surprised if a rational Quirrell would let something like this happen unintentionally. By allowing Harry to put a binding on Malfoy and Dumbledore and take them to the negotiation, Harry's surrender has pretty much removed any chance of the government of magical Britain forming an effective response.

Since the bindings and the negotiation team were both widely available information and there was relatively long duration available for Quirrell to act on it, we can only assume Quirrell did nothing to disrupt it because he found it would most likely not go against his plan. So either Quirrell made a significant error in both assessing his confidence in his ability to predict Harry's actions and predicting Harry's actions, or the result was intentional.

***** Oh! Lucius Malfoy's comment about how easy it would be to imperius all the muggles there. I bet that's what voldemort's planning. Once the British Ministry of Magic is under the control of the British muggle government, Voldemort and his death eaters swoop in and start imperiusing the most important government officials.

******** If you recall the humanism arc, Harry put several different trains of thought into his TPC. The absolute rejection of death was part of it. But Harry also thought of his will to protect everyone from death and of his certainty that mankind would defeat death even if he should die. Quirrelmort does not care to protect anyone else from death, and he has no faith that mankind might overcome death together.

** While surrender could be a viable option if it was conditional, surrender in name only perhaps, unconditional surrender is not going to go over very well.

I feel like there is going to be exposition in the next chapter that perhaps makes this seem a better option than it does now. Though I feel that sort of defeats the purpose of a rational story - in that we are supposed to have access to the same information as Harry (in general) so we can follow his thought processes.

I don't know about the rest of you, but this doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Even if he is just doing this as a big middle finger to Quirrel, I think we've got enough evidence now that any blatant confrontation of Quirrell is a *really freaking bad idea*.

** I think I've found a world in which Harry's gambit makes sense.

Next Chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course," said Harry, "a large majority vote by the wizarding equivelant of the house of lords can overturn my decision and dissolve our treaty. So this is your oppurtunity to win them over. I know these people and can offer advice, but ultimately, what you offer them for their surrender is up to you. What, your majesty, would become of magical Britain under your rule?"
#+end_quote

In this way Harry puts himself in the "Us" category in parliments "Us against Them" view, but still manages to get a fair deal for wizards, since the Queen is likely to offer /more/ than she otherwise would have as she now has no idea of how much she needs to give up to ensure peace and giving more than she could have is safer than giving potentially too little (in addition, she only has one shot at it, as opposed to the ability to negotiate that she would have had dealing with Harry).

** I don't really understand Harry's strategy here. There is no way that the Wizegnomet would agree with Harry's surrender to the muggles. Couldn't the just overrule his surrender? I remember Harry mentioning in a previous chapter that that the Wizognemet could overrule him if they had a 90% majority. That doesn't seem difficult at all considering what Harry is proposing.

Honestly if I was a wizard I'd be pretty pissed.

He just destroyed the entire political game of Magical Britain and its base in petty, unideological rivalries and personal power gamesmanship, to replace it with (we can idealize) the ideologically rivalrous, upwards-reaching democracy of the Muggle world.

From the point of view of his earlier goals, mission accomplished.

The original problem is Voldemort plans around Harry, not the war. Solving the war with Harry as belenvolent dictator for life wouldn't set Voldemort back much, it would be actually playing for his hand.

*** He is limited in how he can use the time turner. The information he receives from the future limits his options in the past. Our best guess on his previous scheme meant that he would have had false positives on Harry's death in order to avoid any risk. So Quirrel may have up to six hours of prep time, but he cannot have retroactively interfered in shaping this event. But yeah, he probably has a time turner.
