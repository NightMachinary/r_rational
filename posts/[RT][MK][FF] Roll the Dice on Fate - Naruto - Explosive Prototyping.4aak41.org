** Do you think you could combine the smaller meta-chapters together to make more sizeable ones? From what I could tell, you've designated every chapter at around a thousand words - while all of them are concise and well written, it would feel more storyish if you merged all of the smaller arcs into bigger chapters (Worm had an average chapter count of 5000 words).

I know it might seem strange, but trust me - if I were browsing the website looking for stories I'd be much more likely to click on a story that had a 1/5000 chapter to word ratio than one that had a 1/1000.

*** Perhaps once it's finished (or at least the first book is finished) I'll do just that. For the moment though I work best when putting out larger numbers of smaller individual chapters. Once I've finished with the story I do plan to run a pass or three back over the whole thing to smooth it out and make sure it all makes sense, and that seems like the kind of thing that would be lumped in with that whole process.

**** That's cool. It was just kind of unique to me - I looked at the page and then blinked. /Wait? 30 chapters, but only 49,000 words?/ That being said, that word count is still really respectable. Not everyone can be Wildbow.

*** Just the one actually and a couple extra paragraphs added near the end of the one before that. I was re-arranging some chapters (because of re-writes) to make sure everything was in chronological order, and the interface threw a bit of a hissy fit and e-mailed everyone.

Edit: I did kinda expect something like that to happen, but so far as I could tell it was the only way to re-order things properly. I've added a note to the start of the chapter to explain.
