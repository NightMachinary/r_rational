** A bridging chapter, closing off the last conflict (with the Dwarven duke) and opening up the next (with the Dwarven king).

Not really a lot to say about it, other than being glad to see the story still updating at all.

**** I've only really seen one intelligent charicter, all the others seem pretty much at best part of the scenery and the exsplainations often seem more like exscuses because the implications and reasoning are always good for her, infact pretty much nothing ever gors wrong for her. It improves over later chapters but by then it seems sorta too late because of how big a powerbase has become canon for her. For exsample the implications of teleportation don't seem to have been exsplored, especially before Mercury's arrival. Really it does seem rational but only where the story's focused, the rest of the world just acts however's convenient for the plot.

This is enough to make a story rational. The rest are just minor complaints, which don't really affect that.

I don't understand what you meant by these two sentences. Could you explain them?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I have noticed the exact opposite. Mercury is practically constantly struggling, against both Good and Evil. She wins most of the time, but if she loses even one major battle she is dead. I honestly don't see at all how could you think nothing ever goes wrong for her after reading the fic.

****** Minor nitpick.. While I don't agree with they said about the story, I think we could all tell they typed it out on a phone device. Don't you think it was a little condescending listing out those words like that?
