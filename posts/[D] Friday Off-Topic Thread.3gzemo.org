Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

******* The idea is to represent an executable string of bytes - ie a computer program - with binary input. /How/ this output is executed doesn't matter much - as x86 assembly, Python bytecode, source to be compiled against the (language) VM... so long as the effect is good, we just want the shortest string that gives that effect. Assembly language is likely to be suboptimal, since it's not concise - hence a high level language like Python or Haskell.

You can use this trick as a binary search for a string representing /any desired information/ for that matter, or even "the string whose production would yield the greatest net utility". Or "the Turing machine of length X that takes longest to halt". True oracles are OP!

** Why do self-insert characters act like telling someone that they're part of a fictional work would be mind-breaking?

It seems like the writers and characters are skipping over steps in the world's credulity. The levels of belief that I see are "This person is lying", "This person is crazy/deluded", "This person is honest and of sound mind, but wrong", and "This person is right". The stories all seem to completely skip over the third possibility.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388][A Wizard Named Harry]] does this well:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore opened his mouth, but I continued rapidly. "Please wait a moment, sir. I've thought long and hard as to how to convince you, and the best I could come up with was eight words."

  He simply nodded, and I took a deep breath, and blurted "Tom Marvolo Riddle has eight horcruxes."

  That had to have had an effect, but I'll give the old man this much- he had a poker face that would do any card shark proud.

  "That was only six words." he pointed out.

  ....

  I nodded sharply. "Well, first and most important, Voldemort... or some weird ghost-bit of him... is here, stuck to Quirrell's head under that stupid turban. He's here looking for the Sorceror's Stone... er, Philosopher's Stone?.. that you've got hidden in the third-floor hallway behind Fluffy- Hagrid's three-headed dog thing- a logic puzzle with potions, a giant game of wizard chess, and maybe some other crap....

  ....

  ...where, I might add, you are a fictional character, and the boy whose body I've gotten stuffed into is the star of a series of popular childrens' books bearing his name."

  "And yes, I've read the series." I said, ignoring Dumbledore's look of blank surprise. "That's how I know about Fluffy and all that stuff, and fun little trivia like the fact that you're going to die of... Hell's bells, something or other, to do with the horcruxes I think... in five-ish years, that Snape is your double-agent because he still has it bad for Lily Potter and that he's going to hate Harry Potter... well, me, I guess... because I represent him never getting her, or that the teaching position for Defense Against the Dark Arts actually is cursed because of old Moldy, or... well, let's just say that it's going to be an entertaining ride."

  Dumbledore continued to stare at me for a while, then wordlessly handed me a quill and a piece of parchment.

  To this day I don't remember much about that night- just a lot of writing down of absolutely everything I remembered from the series, and then dreamless sleep.

They could both happen at the same time from the same source, but I don't think that "it makes a better story" is a strong enough justification for how specific the fears/actions I've seen are. Motivations like keeping a personal source of information/power, limiting misinformation, maintaining a low profile, keeping a good story, and many others make sense, but worrying about the mental health of a person you tell shouldn't be that big of a concern (for someone who's already healthy when you tell them.)

Most SI characters that I've seen appear in their own body, for example by waking up in an alley. Having a pre-existing family in the new universe is a reason for not telling in general, not a reason for considering mind-breaking to be a credible consequence of telling them.

It's pretty simple: On each tick, a random blob is chosen, and that blob attempts to expand into every tile that borders it. If a tile is already occupied, the chance of a blob's winning the battle over that tile is directly proportional to that blob's size--if a 100-tile blob fights a 200-tile blob in a tile, the 100-tile blob's chance of winning the tile is 1 in 3.

Usually dubbed instead of subbed, so that I don't have to pay the full amount of attention.

/Fate/Stay Night/ does seem to have a huge amount of background materials, but /Infinite Blade Works/ introduces/follows new characters (unless I'm missing something). I /think/ it's a standalone sequel.

It's not that I think anime doesn't have a plot, just that a lot of the exposition/setup is so */blunt/*, with people explaining the rules to each other over the course of a long stretch of conversation. I might be totally wrong about this being less common in Western media.

****** That's because Fate/Zero was made after the original Fate/Stay Night and thus had much higher quality art, animation and fight scenes, among other things that more money and experience gets you. I tried to watch the original Fate/Stay Night after watching Fate/Zero and it was like rubbing sand in my eyes by comparison.

The /new/ version of Fate/Stay Night is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works and I am finding it much nicer. Very enjoyable.

******** Basically yes, if by 'Fate/Zero comes after it' you mean 'Fate/Zero was made after the original'. Damn prequels make talking about it complicated.

Then there are a bunch of games, each with different 'routes' through the plot and it all gets rather complicated from there. Long story short, you're watching a remake of the original. And it seems pretty good so far.

******** Fate/Zero was originally a light novel that was written to set up the backstory for the Fate/Stay Night game. The game itself has three "routes" that represent three different ways the story could go based on the protagonist's choices. Following the popularity of the game an anime on the first of the three routes was released in 2006. Then Fate/Zero itself got an anime adaptation in 2011, and more recently the second route 'Unlimited Blade Works' got an animation too in 2014.

  It's not that I think anime doesn't have a plot, just that a lot of the exposition/setup is so blunt, with people explaining the rules to each other over the course of a long stretch of conversation.
#+end_quote

I suppose that depends on what type of anime you watch. Most of the stuff you've listed is shonen, and you really have to compare to stuff aimed at that demographic in Western media to compare it. While I agree that exposition is certainly very blunt compared to something like Game of Thrones it's not so different when compared to Transformers (the Michael Bay movies) though even that has far less still. There's also the comparison that almost all the shows you've listed there are set in a whole new universe or world with new rules which happens far less often in Western media (which is interesting in itself) and so need more exposition.

I can't really think of the top of my head excluding Game of Thrones (which even then doesn't have flashy combat) of a current TV series set on a different universe with different rules. Superhero stuff is probably closest in character and they do tend to have large dumps of exposition.

Any canon (preferably a broad one that most people would have some familiarity with) which you think would make a good future prompt?

As far as what might work good for future prompts, there's a wide array to choose from. I'd like to see a few more videogame focused prompts, personally. Maybe a few prompts based on popular movie franchises. Those that have enough depth to be rationalized, that is, such as Lord of the Rings, or the Percy Jackson series.

** I've noticed a weird phenomenon over the past few weeks, and I'm curious if anybody can explain it: During the summer months, reader participation in fanfic drops drastically--reviews, PMs, and so on. However, average readership stays around the same. Why?

*** Assuming that this is a real phenomenon, not something caused by selection bias, variance, etc.?

Summer months mean school's out for most of Europe and North America. I have to imagine that students make up a large portion of the fanfic reading community (which I don't think you can deny skews young). So why would they be participating less?

At a guess, it has to do with how people are satisfying their social impulses. Reading is mostly for entertainment, while reviews and PMs are mostly social. So there's some difference between how social impulses are satisfied during "school time" and "not school time". (I would naively assume the opposite effect, but I don't know.) Or it might be a matter of available energy; reviews take more effort than reading does.

But we'd need raw data in order to tell that the phenomenon is real and to gather data on where the differences are coming from (whether it's /actually/ students as I predict).

That being said: 1) It's long 2) It really requires six players.

There is a remake published by FFG recently. But they didn't have the rights to the theme, so they put the game in their universe.

There's been so many interesting things I'd love to get around to reading, non fiction specifically.

I never seem to be able to make time nowadays though. And it just keeps getting more and more obese as newly discovered books start to pile up. This has been the case ever since I started my classes.

And now when I do find the time, I don't even know where to begin.. Prospect of finishing them all seem so daunting, I end up reading something else - ongoing webserials, or shorts.

I've tried making reading tracking notes, choice picked a few from the lot - got audiobooks. Nothing seems to help.

  The computer that simulates the fictional universe actually executes the basic quantum laws of physics. All the general-relativity stuff like gravitational time dilation are just leaked abstractions that come from the implementation details of that computer. The characters figure this out and use it to take control of the simulating machine and eventually get out into the parent universe.

But I like the idea of taking the [[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html][Law of Leaky Abstractions]] so far as to hack the universe using it. You probably want to focus on phenomena which may easily be explained by the finiteness of the machine's capabilities, like quanta and the speed of light. You could also probably somehow blend in the Universal Scalability Law here to explain some observed physical phenomena.
