**** As an alternative viewpoint, I really enjoyed all of the Elcenia books (as well as Luminosity and all of Alicorn's other work), including /Silver/, /Siaddaki/ etc. Reading about normal, not world-shattering or "supergenius" characters, but in a fascinating, really well-developed fantasy world (or more exactly a collision of two fantasy worlds (ignoring Isatei)) was very interesting.

I loved Ehail, as a character --- how she tried to cure Shrenhood over tens (hundreds? --- it's been a while since I read the books) of years and then Kaylo fixed it in a couple of months, just to make his girlfriend happy (rather than because it was a huge humanitarian problem...) or how she coped with one of her adopted children being taken away, because the birth parents who had shunned their child suddenly want them back when they were cured.

I also liked the exploration, in the background, of fantasy societal issues such as the (horrifying) problem of Shrenhood and the stigmatisation of Shrens by dragons, the power-imbalance between Elcenia and Barashim and how their alternative attitudes towards the treatment of children, clashed. It's nice how the problems in the books are not just intended as metaphors for (or are a crude transplantation of) some real world problems, but organically develop within the fantasy world.

Also, the universe is realistic --- for instance, how the greatest recent jumps in progress were due to the interaction between two, until recently separate worlds and the sharing of knowledge/magic between them. (e.g. Kaylo is a genius, but he would have probably achieved slightly less if he didn't have access to Kamai).

****** Perhaps by this communities standards, I'm eccentric. Not, I think, by the standards of most people, though.

Do I want everyone to die? I suppose so. Not in any particular case, though. Give me a person and a scenario, and I'd probably argue for life (though I'm sure someone could come up with an example of someone who just needs to not exist any more). But in general?

If /this/ is what people will do with forever... then maybe they and everyone else would be better off not having it. Person wants to die. Wants for her existence to come to an end. And then finds out that no matter what conditions she had set, society would eventually meet them and force her back into the world. Can they cure her of not wanting to die? Would she still be herself afterwards? And the whole thing about the perfect girlfriend. "If I'm not good enough, we can find someone else who is"? I'm pretty sure that's not how romantic relationships work.

Should people really be able to bring historical figures back from the dead? My first "celebrity crush" was Jane Austin. Of course I'd bring her back if I could. And I shouldn't be allowed to do so under any circumstances. So creepy!

How long can a mind live while still being fundamentally itself? It's easier to argue that we are constantly changing into someone else, the new self displacing the old. It must be so, else the old self would become stagnant and a thing no longer living. How can one balance long term stability with continual self-renewal? And how will you handle the heat-death of the universe? The fundamental problem of scarcity? Once you've solved those problems, you've probably attained godhood by any reasonable definition and can be trusted to make these decisions for other people. Then maybe you can be trusted to give immortality to others, and decide when, where, and how.

Normally, when someone wants to die, they are considered mentally unfit. Depression, by the way, is treated and even 'cured' right now, in the present. It usually involves medication and is widely considered to be a good thing.

It would be creepy if you brought Jane Austin back from the dead and then tried to own her like a pet. It would not be creepy if you petitioned your government to use advanced medical technology to return her to life, give her full citizenship, and allow her to live her own life. How could that possibly qualify as creepy?

******* I have to assume that Cory retains the option to return to being dead, if she chooses. We know that she had the option the first time, and there's nothing in the story to suggest that it's no longer available to her.

Also, it's implied that she chose death because she was clinically depressed, and she no longer is. Surely it's better for her to have the opportunity to decide if she'd prefer to be alive /sans/ depression, than for her to just stay dead forever because the only options she was ever presented with were "miserable" and "dead"?

I'm not sure I buy the argument that you need to know how to handle the heat-death of the universe in order to have the right to bring people back from the dead. Personally I think surviving /until/ heat death would be a damn good deal. Anything beyond that is icing.

As for the problem of scarcity, it's implied in the story that "Singleton" makes this a non-issue.

I can agree with you that resurrecting someone /for one's own gratification/ is pretty creepy, but I don't think that means all resurrections must be creepy, or that creepy resurrections are worse than being dead forever.

********** To take a living person and make them be dead... I think we can all agree that murder is wrong. And in the case of accidental death or murder, if I could rewind time five minutes to save people, I'm sure I would (though I'm not convinced I should). But that's not what the story proposes. I am far from convinced that bringing someone back to life after the fact is better than leaving them dead -- and the more time between death and potential resurrection, the harder the question becomes.

If you have the power of a god, but not the prerequisite wisdom, you end up with the kind of situation here where you are now forcing the dead into a form of de facto slavery to the singular. I note that the protagonist did not do any of this because it would be better for the dead girl, but for entirely selfish reasons. And everyone she interacted with seemed to think that "waking a sleeping maiden" was sufficient reason for everything. This in a world proven to still be subject to the laws of scarcity.

This seems to be the point of confusion in the description of your philosophy, that the moral value of resuscitation trends down based on the time elapsed since death. That's counter-intuitive to me, and seems to be for others as well. Is there some specific element of time that's causing this trend or is it an implicit element such as decay of social bonds, loss of familiar environments, competitive disadvantage or something else suggested by a passing of time?

************ As I indicated, I'm not sure time elapsed should matter, morally speaking. But on an instinctual level, it does. In general, one would suppose that the more god-like the powers needed to perform the action, the more god-like wisdom is needed to make such a decision.

Naturally, to the dead, the difference between a second and a billion years is the same. But the motives of the people performing "resuscitation" a billion years later are not the same, and are in fact quite opaque. Presumably a society doing so would be sufficiently advanced morally and ethically to know that what they are doing is right. Or perhaps they've been caught up in some kind of perverted oneupmanship game and are bringing back the dead just to prove some stupid point.

There are other, more current, issues where the passage of time seems to make a difference in peoples' moral judgements.

*** I think I felt something like this, so I'll try to put it into words:

We went around the solar system, so whatever ideas I get by the end of the story, I expect any place in the solar system to have similar aspects.

There's clearly huge material wealth e.g. fabbing. The tone was casual, even when asking for economic things like work or production, or surveillance or behaviour restriction. Banks' Culture felt similar. I don't like trading such things. The actor who didn't like the show will return - presumably he'll get money, and the person who'll be surveilled gets money. For a utopia these feel to me like suspicious solutions. It seems to put a low ceiling over people's social kindness and intelligence.

WARNING: RAMBLE INCOMING.

I admit the body modification thing weirds me out. [In the rationalist reflex style, I try to come up with some I might like, and I have a vague idea about the interest of inhabiting an animal body for a while, so I give the whole idea the benefit of the doubt.]

...but my unease with that section continues. The person gives shallow aesthetic justifications for modification. (Damn that's a clunky sentence). I think I want such power to be used... responsibly? with more caution? but is there any harm? [In another rationalist reflex I think about this: what do I expect to go wrong if it's treated casually, with only a little aesthetic thought? Well I'd expect any possible modification that has some possible aesthetic justification to be tried. But wouldn't that lead to a huge mess overall? I think of a hypothetical crowd of people there - with such huge variation, it might to be ugly from any perspective! And if the justification is shallow, you won't be able to get other people not to do something you find ugly. Maybe this utopia, like Banks' Culture, 'solves' this by giving enough space for people to avoid each other. But this seems to put a low ceiling over people's social kindness and intelligence.

END OF RAMBLE - WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR FORBEARANCE.

The girl wakes up at the end, cured by miracle. There /are/ loads of good things about it. If she seems shallow, well she is young. I might have different thoughts if she was 120 and receiving such kindness without blinking. There doesn't seem to be any pressure on her to improve but it's a short scene right? And do we need everyone to improve in a utopia anyway?

RAMBLE ALERT SECOND WAVE What worried me? The /trivial/ wishes were treated /seriously/ . [The part of me that dreams about AI says that the wishes should be treated with the same sophistication as the cognitive processes that gave rise to them. The part of me that rewrites every story to make it nicer for me, says that there's a good principle making the singleton fulfill the letter of such wishes, and the person can improve themselves within their wished environment just the same as another environment, and she won't stagnate at the level-she-woke-up-in for eternity.] The prospect of her stagnating is what frightens me I think. The rest of society seemed like it might allow it: there didn't seem to be pressure to "increase WIS" at any of the locations we visited, avoiding things she doesn't like completely is economically possible, and even trivial dislikes, which wouldn't normally fix themselves in a human mind, might be taken seriously, and therefore fix themselves in hers. And I don't want space filled with stagnating humans. I want us to grow up together. CLEAR SKIES AHEAD - THANK YOU FOR FLYING WITH US

My dream-AI wouldn't set up a "10-year simulation of the-effects-of-this-pain-on-this-human-in-the-wider-society-simulation" [the sophisticated response] but would act with a basic "get rid of that pain source quick" [non-sophisticated, i.e. of same-sophistication response]. /That's/ not a fail mode man.

Hey thanks for the comment. It's nicer to have a discussion than to just throw my thoughts into the ether, so you should know that I will read your response if it comes :-)

Edit: about "sophistication" for the depressed girl, which you might have been thinking about when you interpreted my comment. The reasoning would go something like; acting to bring about the particular future specified by her in her depression is way more sophisticated than the source thoughts of the depression, so, all other things being equal, a less sophisticated solution should be found. As an example the other direction, a hug might NOT be sophisticated enough for this depression.
