Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I'm writing a novel set in a vaguely-medievalesque fantasy world where (to make a long story short) the most significant magic involves "witches" making deals with spirits that came from another world. (Other forms involve using plants that came from that other world, et cetera.)

When I was designing my magic system, one of the rules I set myself was that magic can't affect people's minds. It can affect your general mood, like cheer you up or make you tired, but nothing more specific. Being from another world, the magical spirits can't see your mind that closely, and the magical plants can't interface with it. Anything else seemed to me like it'd be just too powerful.

That said, I've now got a plot point where it'd be really convenient for a witch to be able to (temporarily or permanently) suppress some specific memories in someone. She knows the person decently well, and the memories are a couple weeks old.

Can you think of any way for that to be possible without breaking the setting and having witches erasing all sorts of memories to hide their plotting, disrupt their enemies, and so on?

It was just an example anyway.

Could tie it to unique curse magic or hypnotism or a number of other things.

Also, it could be that the spirit isn't invading the mind but the medium that allows the witch to invade some one else's mind.

** My housemates had Star Wars on the brain recently, and they proposed a thought experiment: what would Star Wars look like if there were several different Jedi orders with different competing philosophies about the force, instead of just one all-encompassing order?

1) I'd like to know what kind of Jedi orders you can dream up! What kinds of philosophies might Jedi reasonably espouse? How would they interact? Which ones would cooperate nicely, and which ones would conflict?

2) We came up with a list of factions of our own, and I went and wrote up a series of interviews with fictional characters from each faction. It's not a "story" in the traditional sense, as there's no plot, just philosophical explorations of different ways of being a Jedi... is this something that the [[/r/rational]] community would be interested in reading? Would it be appropriate to post on this sub?

*** - *The Brotherhood of the Force:* a communist collective that uses the Force (especially the ability to communicate over large distances) to form an utopian communist society, and finally, achieve a Force Hivemind. They oppose megacorporations, trade guilds, and oftentimes clash with local governments. The Republic tolerates them because they also provide free healthcare and social care to the downtrodden masses.

- *The Lifesingers:* a society of extreme anti-technology Force users, who believe only biological life and its connection to the Force should exist. They reject most technology, and destroy droids on sight. To them, artificial intelligence and cybernetics are the worst abomination, and only a return to a pastoral, simple life can save the Galaxy and unite all beings in the Force. Members are all vegans, but ultimately aim to nourish themselves with pure Force. They use very curious spaceships: hollowed asteroids pushed around by sheer Force. The entire lifer support of their ships and stations is based on natural ecosystems. Many other factions consider them terrorists. Republic technically considers them criminals, but does not pursue them unless they happen to accidentally kill someone (which happens occasionally when they damage vital technology).

- *The Pyramid of Light*: a lose society of professional duelists, only a fraction of them are Force users. The entire goal of the Pyramid is to train, teach, and then duel using light-sabers. Their philosophy is that only fighting with a light-saber and defeating an opponent in a fight to the death is a true manifestation of the Force. They believe that by pitting all Force users and other warriors against one another in mortal combat they will finally find the Pinnacle of the Pyramid,a true Savior, someone who is perfectly in tune with the Force who will then guide the galaxy. A traditional mark of their brotherhood is a lightsaber scar across the face.

- *Freeholders of the Galt Cluster:* a loose coalition of former Jedi, former Sith and non affiliated force users who reject their former sects, reject the rule of the Republic/Empire, and in general, wish to be left alone by the powers that be. They believe that the galaxy and its society are inherently corrupted by the needy masses that strain the economy and the Force, and await its downfall. They are all consummate capitalists, who believe only in free exchange of value and reject both the selflessness of the Jedi and the evil of the Sith. Currently, the occupy a small clusters of systems hidden behind a natural Force Storm. There is just one safe route through the storm, and the access to it is granted on "invitation only" basis to fellow "freedom loving" Force Users.

- *Hand of the Void*: a tiny, mostly unknown cabal of Jedi that believe that conscious Force use is an abomination against the natural order, and wish to exterminate all Force users (and themselves, right after). They are a fanatic death cult that hides among other Force factions, only rare surfacing to assassinate the most powerful Force users they can find. Their modus operandi is usually to gang up on the victim, using not just the Force and the lightsabers but things like explosives, poison gas and assassin droids.

You might enjoy a recent fanfic called Using the Force Made Easy, in which a young Jedi abandons the Order to travel the galaxy and decides to publish videos telling the public about how to use the Force.

I'd be interested in reading the interviews, personally.

**** Spinning off from the themes of Using the Force made easy:

A faction dedicated to “open-sourcing” the force. As we see from the Monk character in Rogue One, non force sensitives can still access the force with enough training and meditation. Perhaps with guidance from natural sensitives and bio-feedback and monitoring technology, the average person in Star Wars could manage to use the force to a moderate extent. Even a minor bit of luck, empathy, and intuition could make a massive difference if spread through a large portion of the population. This faction would thus go about teaching how to connect to the force to anyone that wants to learn. Actual force sensitives end up primarily acting as teachers and as force-guided planning committee members (although the actual upper levels of leadership is decentralized and is supposed to select for leadership skills more than raw force sensitivity). Less sensitive members learn what they can and then return their every day lives, keep up with enough training to maintain their skill. On the few planets were they have the most influence, children learn enough in public schools to consistently perform the occasional act of force guided empathy, luck, or reflex by the time they are adults, but on most planets they are more like a hobbyist group and are often looked down on as Jedi-wannabes, minor party trick users, and/or as plebeian knockoffs of proper force-sects.

*** I'm not well versed in Star Wars lore, but here are some things I'd expect to exist:

- Utopian technologists using Force-driven intuition and "luck" (and maybe prophecy?) to guide research and development of novel technologies.

- Force users who use mental/psychic Force techniques to create a gestalt/hivemind, perhaps including non-force users. These could be aggressive/expansionist or peaceful/voluntary.

- Devotional religious orders that worship the force directly and figures who are purported to have become one with the force. You could get some nasty conflicts between groups who exalt different prophets.

- Artists who use Force techniques in live performances to create sublime experiences for their audience. Since we're talking about art, there's any number of different ways the Force could be used, but there could be a more or less cohesive faction that considers Force-enhanced artistry to be the highest form of artistic expression.

- Pacifistic healers. Basically a Star Wars version of the Red Cross (possibly also including talented droid technicians?) whose mission is to use the Force to save lives. Even if direct Force Healing isn't a thing, there's any number of ways a skilled Force user could accomplish ludicrous feats in this domain.

- Explorers. The resilience, mobility, reflexes and intuition available to Force users, not to mention ancillary enhanced skills in things like piloting or what have you, could be invaluable to people trying to explore star systems, or planetary frontiers. These could be anything from plundering grave robbers to legitimate historian-archaeologists to wilderness guides to cartographers. Maybe not enough to be a fraction on its own, but they'd share enough in common it seems likely that some faction somewhere would show up to offer training in these abilities and support those that apply them this way.

Come up with five different ways (cough, colors) to use the Force, each sect of force users focuses on combining two of them. For funsies, also force them all to coexist and cooperate in the one galactic society without outright war.

** I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for a CYOA and a possible story that takes place in a world governed by Fighting Games logic and physics. But I could use some help making the world building more weird and interesting. Here's what I have. Anyone have ideas or details to help flesh out this world and make it feel interesting/weird?

Title: Sucker Punch -- Making the world a better place with your fists.

A Fighting Game World CYOA. The main god happens to look and act like a parody of a dude bro. With a world that someone like that would have designed.

Narration: So it looks like you died. Yay! That means you get to come to my awesome cool world with all the best fights and ass kicking. Who am I? Well duh, I'm god. Isn't it obvious? Oh, ignore the beaten-up face I've been challenging a few other gods to fights and kicking the absolute shit out of them. WUUUUUUuuuu! Up top! Come on, don't leave me hanging...come on...you know you want to. Thanks. You know I don't usually get too many reincarnates to my world and it looks like you unlocked your power already thanks to the whole dying thing. So, I'll let you pick your own character as a reward. Yeah, I'm just that fucking awesome man. Be sure to say a prayer to me while you beat the shit out of your opponents. You don't like fighting? Hah, that's fucking hilarious.

Hey, want to know a secret while you're deciding? If you manage to win the big 4 Tournaments, I'll let you challenge me to a fight.

Explanation: You have died and been reborn into a world that seems to follow the logic and physics of a fighting video game. In this world, anyone who masters martial arts to a certain degree and wins enough fights can awaken an aura that makes them stronger, heal faster, and do far more damage to nonliving things just by hitting things. It also makes them far more resistant to non-hand to hand damage to the point it requires explosives and artillery to knock out or wound them.

This aura can be trained like a muscle and can eventually reach a point where you become outright immune to all non aura damage. In rare circumstances and for unknown reasons, several aura users will develop a special power that explains away some of the weirder abilities some fighters have in fighting games.

But this is world that worships strength and talent above all else. A world where martial arts duels are protected by law, where teenagers get tattoos and scar themselves to look tougher, and disabled people are looked down upon and mocked. Social services don't seem to exist, bullying and child abuse is explained away as training, and intelligence/creativity is not valued except for how it can help support fighters. If you're strong the world is your oyster but if you're weak, well this world is probably not very fun what with it being far less technologically advanced, filled with arrogant assholes that like to bully or kill people because they can, demons are starting to show up and eat people, secret conspiracies that are threatening to destroy everything, and tournaments that can affect the course of the world. It's time to fight.

Choose your fighter: Fighters come with their own individual quest line that can improve and expand their special power, but you are not required to follow it and there are other ways hidden in the world that let you expand your abilities. Here is a fully fleshed out character to give you an idea of what I'm going for.

*The Joke Character-* Appearance: Picture you but a shorter, frailer, and uglier you. Well not ugly exactly, you look the same but the oxygen tank, thick glasses, and leg brace screams weakness which makes the world consider you ugly by default. You also get to be born with a nasty lung defect that makes it hard and potentially dangerous to exercise. So, add a wheezy and ragged quality to your voice. But on a second glance your glasses and phone look strangely stylish and advanced.

Power: Machine Interface -- allows you to merge with and upgrade technology.

Talent: None, zero, zip, zilch, nada.

Quests:

Revenge against the Bullies.

Revenge against the Parents.

Revenge against the System.

*The Assist Character-* Appearance: Your face but slightly stronger features and add two feet to your height no matter how tall you are. Your eyes will glow white when power is active.

Power: Mentor System -- allows user to identify weaknesses and shows projected effects of possible trainings.

Talent: Low

Quest:

Raising a champion

Top of the World

*The Shotoclone-* Appearance: Pretty much you with an average height except always barefoot and without sleeves to all your clothes since they always fall apart before too long.

Power: Energy Blasts.

Talent: High

Quest:

To Master Oneself

*The Fighting Clown -* Appearance: You but dressed a bit whackier or sillier. Maybe add some clown makeup.

Power: Toon Physics -- Random changes to reality that only affect you and you can't quite reliably control. Though they are always in your favor if you are dressed as a clown or something at least one person considers amusing.

Talent: Varies day by day

Quest

The Last Laugh

*The Secret Character*

Appearance: You look exactly the same except for your hair. As it will be a slightly lighter or brighter color and grow much longer once you activate your power.

Power: Gutsy Fighter -- The more damage you take the stronger your attacks become.

Talent: Average

Quest

The Mysterious Stranger

*The Guest Fighter -* Appearance -- A cross between you and the looks of a younger version of a chosen character from a fighting game. You also have the option of changing the sex of said character and you will look normal enough to still pass for human so nonhuman characters will be drastically changed.

Quest: None

Talent: N/A. You can't learn new techniques at all.

*** Let me break it for you. Militaries would just train soldiers, have tournaments all the time, then they'd optimize the aura training and done, the premise kind of breaks. Few people will be stronger than professional soldiers, and depending on how you structure society the rulers will be quite strong or employ very strong people.

​

If you want to do fight game type of plot it's better to go with, hidden martial arts masters fighting each other for 1 million dollars in a somewhat normal world. I mean just doing it in a different era would already be novel enough.

​

Also you need a proper plot, win many fights so you can fight god is not really a plot. Make money to pay for medical bills for a relative works as a basic motivation. Then enemies threaten family so you can keep the plot going etc.

*** [[/u/fassina2][u/fassina2]] covers a lot of the broad strokes issues, but I'd like to add:

This seems really weird. Like, I feel like you've never met a “bro” before.

I *think* you should try watching like, Adventure Time(?), because that does a really good job of “taking itself too seriously without taking itself very seriously.” (venture Bros is another example).

A better way to structure this would be to scrap the CYOA feature (if you've never written before, CYOA is an exceptionally difficult format), and have your MC have a power based on his previous life OR have him accidentally unlock a power because his father was a fighter in The Tournament or something and now he's on a quest to find his dad.

Whatever. A great place to start would be playing 90s Fighters, and reallllllly leaning into the tropey shit.

Maybe like rewrite the 90s mortal kombat movie as a rational fic?

** I'm trying to make a simple battle royale game. I think I want it to be set in a utopian/optimistic version of the future, kind of like Overwatch or Star Trek. Maybe it takes place during the first days of apocalypse, when the utopian society begins to fall apart.

The main goal of battle royale games is to kill everyone, and be the last one standing. I'm struggling to justify it in fiction. I know that it's not necessary for making a game, but it would be fun to come up with a story in which this behavior makes sense. Under what circumstances would it make sense for people to turn on each other like that?

My game is pretty lighthearted and colorful, that makes it extra difficult. I think it should probably have some dark humor, to make sense (or make fun of) the premise of running around and killing everyone.

The obvious solution is a "rage virus" that just makes everyone super violent, or some device like in "Kingsman: The Secret Service", this idea makes sense, but I don't like it too much.

Does anyone have thoughts on how to make the battle royale premise make sense? Without making it too bleak/dark/depressing?

*** The best way I can think of to make it less dark is to just make death less permanent. This Utopia has the technological means to have people download into a new body whenever they are killed but limits citizens to a certain amount of lives because of resources required. With higher ranking or skilled citizens getting more lives. But now there is some type of virus or contagion that is causing madness, which doesn't necessarily mean violence, and the condition is not something that is fixed by respawning. But one man has found a cure for the condition- extreme amounts of adrenaline. Which is taboo in this utopia. Thus they have started the battle royale to help citizens cure themselves. The authorities treat this as a ring of thieves for the theft of resources since death is less permanent and its hard to actually kill someone enough times that they stay dead.

*** The gold standard lighthearted battle-royale concept is, in my humble opinion, /Mobile Fighter G Gundam/. It's a free-for-all mech combat using Earth as the arena. Each country enters one mech, its pilot, and the support crew. The teams fight each other until there's one mech left with its head intact, at which point that team's country wins the right to rule all the space nations for a year. There are other rules, too, like not attacking the cockpit.

So: - give the contestants something to fight for, outside the battle royale island - make "kill" metaphorical or symbolic, like by using paintguns or playing hand-tag or by trapping opponents so they can't move outside a square meter area for more than 12h - give the people outside the battle royale island a reason to be invested in the success of individual fighters
