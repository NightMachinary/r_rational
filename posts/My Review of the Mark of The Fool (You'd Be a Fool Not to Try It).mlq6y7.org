Here's my review of the Mark of the Fool, which you can also find [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy?review=985833#review-985833][here]] on RR. (The review is also attached to the story, so you can scroll up to read.)

Before that, though, here's a disclaimer: I'm very new to this subreddit, so I'm still not /entirely/ sure how much any individual fic fits into the genre. However, going off of the sidebar, this story does seem to be a good fit. The characters still have times of intense emotion, but mostly the MC stays levelheaded and uses reason to analyze every situation he's put into. Also, I say this in the review too, but I've read beyond the chapters that are currently up. The author also seems to be spamming chapters now, which should make that pagecount grow drastically in the next couple days.

Now, onto the review.

I swear, Mark of the Fool is going to hit trending HARD in the coming weeks. This story is just about everything you want from a good RR story without the drawbacks that normally come from this format. There's great plot, amazing writing, complex characters, and brilliant fights - all wrapped up in one awesome package. Before I get into that, though, here's some things to note.

I'm a fan of the author's previous works, and had the good fortune of being able to read this story before it got posted here. Thus, I have more to work with than the 60 pages currently up, and might reference vague "future events". The author also has a history of completing whatever he starts, which might be reassuring for those cautious of drops.

Now that I've gotten those disclaimers out of the way, let's get right into things!

Like some reviews before this have said, the prose here is /good/. Like, /really good/. /Some of the best on the site level good/. If I could give this section a 6/5, I would. Normally, RR's writing tends to be fairly minimalistic, and a lot of stories with fancy flourishes end up having the prose detract from the actual story. Not this one, though. All of UnstoppableJuggernaut's writing /enhances/ the story, making the story and characters come alive in your mind in a way I rarely see on RR. It's never too much, never too purple. Just the right amount to make your reading experience 5x better. I swear, if for nothing else, read this story for the actual writing.

Of course, that isn't to say that there's nothing else about this story that's worthwhile. Even if you don't care at all for prose, the story and characters more than carry the book on their own. You could say that the plot of Mark of the Fool is a twice-subversion of traditional fantasy plot. He doesn't get the /Chosen One Amazing Hero/ Mark, /and/ he doesn't go out to fight the dark lord. Instead, the MC carves his own path and tries to evade getting dragged into the grand quest as much as he can. Basically, the MC actually gets to drive the plot forwards by himself, and it only gets better in the future.

He's also much more realistic than some protagonists can be. He's rational and clever, but he still has emotions. For a spoiler example (chapter 3):

*Spoiler*

We can take the scene where he gets the Mark. At first, he reacts negatively, because he doesn't want any Mark, and especially not the Mark of the Fool. However, after he gets some time to process the situation, he immediately starts testing the Mark's capabilities in order to see what he can do with it, and if he's able to exploit it at all.

His catchphrase is even "Think. Adapt," which should tell you everything you need to know about his character.

It's not just the MC who gets to be "an actual character", though. /All/ the side characters are interesting, which is something I see in very few fics on RR. Even the kinda-sorta-antagonist-figure is semi-likeable, when it could have been easy to make them human trash. The banter between the MC and his companions is heart-warming and genuinely funny sometimes, and it offers some nice contrast to the tension of the rest of the story.

Just a warning: There /is/ a romantic subplot, though it's minor and handled wayyyy better than your typical romance is. I personally enjoyed it, and you can rest assured the characters aren't going to do stupid things because they were "blinded by love" or anything.

There is a very slight nitpick I have to give, and it's honestly almost unfair of me to give Mark of the Fool's story score a 4.5 because of this when it's really more like a 4.9. That very slight nitpick is that the beginning takes just a /tad/ longer to get to the meat of things than RR may prefer. This may come down to, as another review said, the "Trad Quality" of the story, because in a bookstore I probably wouldn't blink at an intro twice this length. It's also chock-full of still-interesting moments that I wouldn't mind reading it even /at/ twice the length. I'm just nitpicking because the most likely reason a reader is to pick up this book might take a bit longer than expected to appear.

Anyways, I've rambled on for long enough, so let's wrap things up. Overall, I couldn't praise this story enough. It's all the best qualities of progression mixed with the masterful prose and characters of a professional. No stat screens in this one, but it doesn't need them to be interesting. Like I said, this will hit trending like a truck, so why not get in now while it's still young? I promise, it only gets better in the future.

Alright, that's the review!

** The top post comes across a bit negative, which I want to counteract. Welcome to the subreddit, and we could always use more new & different recommendations, even if some of us are jaded by the number of serials that put up 20 chapters and languish unfinished indefinitely :)

I read to Ch 4, and it hasn't shown any major red flags so far, and has managed to catch my interest to read further. However, I will be putting it aside until there's over 20 chapters out.

What else has the author written? His patreon is new, with 0 subscribers.

** Normally I would leave something like this on Read Later till it gave me a nice long archive binge, but I got bored last night and this caught me at the right time.

So far, I'm taken with it.

The writing, mechanically, is solid. No obnoxious tense-switching, no glaring errors or nonsense word choices. That right there puts it a step above a lot of the unedited junk on RR.

The characters are sound. Each of the three main characters has a goal of their own. Even the ten-year-old little sister has a goal: to get over her fear of fire. The female lead isn't a mindless cardboard love-interest; she's a wannabe adventurer still trying to decide if she wants a family or adventure more.

So yeah, this post may or may not strike you as sus, but I certainly don't regret having binged seven chapters of this story. Go ahead and put it on your Read Later lists of nothing else.

** Regardless of whether you've read ahead, I think you're jumping the gun posting a recommendation for a story with only 17k words out. No one who reads webfiction regularly will get out of bed for anything less than >50k words. Maybe even >100k. It takes more than 20k words for frodo to sell bag's end, let alone leave the shire!

Also, it's always kinda suspicious when someone's first post in a community is such a strong endorsement of a niche/unknown product. You say you read the sidebar but your story isn't tagged, and you made a new thread instead of posting it in the monday recommendation thread. Not a good look friend.

**** Well, first of all you can check /my/ account on RR. I'd ask you to please ask for clarity before making suh accusations, unless you think the author decided to write 300 pages of bad xianxia for a single review. UnstoppableJuggernaut is an alt, though, and I'll see if the author is okay with sharing his other account privately. You can even check our writing styles if you want. Hell, check out my other reviews. You think the author has 50 alts and 50 different stories? Whenever I review, I always look for the good in a story. You'll find that consistent over pretty much all my reviews. That's just my style - you can disagree with it, but don't accuse me of being an alt because of it.

And look, yeah I get that posting so early sounds suspicious. Like I said, I've read further than is currently up. The author even asked me to hold off on reviewing right away for this reason, but he hit trending earlier than expected so I decided to post it now. No, I'm not the author's mom or anything. I'm just a reader and friend who wanted this guy's first delve into progression fantasy to succeed. I'm not blowing smoke up his ass or anything - I genuinely fucking liked the story. I mean, of course I would if I liked his other shit, right? You guys might not like it as much as I did. That's fine.

Look, if I'm really pissing you guys off I'll leave. I don't normally read rational shit because that's not really my style, and I probably came into this sub less knowledgable than I should have been. I just wanted to hype up this dude's story because I genuinely believe he's combining traditional fantasy with progression in a great way.

***** I don't think anyone's pissed. Everyone here likes a good sincere recommendation. But your review doesn't pass the smell test because like a rational whodunit let's look at what we know:

1. Your review is long and fervent for a story with only 17k words published

2. This is your first post to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]

3. New thread promoting a new story

4. Sentences trying to build hype around a new product

5. You mention the author's previous works but his RR account was made in February and has 1 story. For all we know, he could have 50 alts.

6. Your own story was officially ended 2 months ago

If someone had to bet, one explanation seems more probable than the other.

If you're really just a fan, then the moral is to be more patient and sound less like a shill.

This subreddit has been experiencing, in recent years, a slow increase in the proportion of subtly rude (without swearwords) and/or pro-hate-speech comments, which unfortunately remain unmoderated.

Also, I clicked open the profile of the person you're responding to, and found that this sort of troll-like hostility seems to be a general pattern in their recent comments across subreddits (edit: specifically, I saw him accuse someone on a completely different subreddit of the same thing), so it really isn't anything you said.

** This is the third time I happened across this post, and I decided to try reading the story despite an issue that bothered me with the review: there is a clear lack of a plot summary or blurb to tell us what's it about. I suggest adding one of those in future reviews. Telling us various characteristics of a story is fine and all, but it is not particularly attractive in anything but a purely analytical way, one that is slightly attractive by the promise of a lack of problems, rather than the presence of features.

** I know both Nameless and the author of Mark of the Fool and just thought I'd quickly weigh in. They're definitely not the same person and this is a legitimate case of a fan and fellow author wanting to support great writing.

I haven't personally read MotF yet since I tend to binge stories all at once, but I *have* read the author's previous work, which in my opinion is some of the best on Royal Road. Based on the strength of their previous work I would be very surprised if this turns out to be anything less than stellar. It's on my read list for the near future. :)
