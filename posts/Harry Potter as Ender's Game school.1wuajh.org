** This is a Fanfiction that I found yesterday. I don't know if anyone here has read it, and it's not too rationalist, but it seems that literature links are frowned upon now at [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]].

This story's premise is that Dumbledore died right before Voldemort went to take out Harry, and named Snape the new Headmaster. Snape has reformed the school into a battle academy pretty much.

It is a very interesting, and quite fun read IMO. I like how Hermione and Harry interact in this story, and the story does have many similarities to Ender's Game. The classes are different, like now there's Battle Class and Strategy, and they do many more duels, but also battles like in HPMOR, with teams or squads. The imaginings of those aren't as creative as in HPMOR, but they're still good. Snape and some unknown character have mysterious plotting talks like Graff and whoever did in Ender's Game.

It's also definitely not a straight port of Ender's Game into the Harry Potter universe.

Any theories on this? As of right now I'm assuming the [[#s][unknown is]] .

** I found it difficult to read. It could almost be a grimdark meta-fic of HPMOR. I think the most difficult part was the fact that the characters and situations were similar enough to HPMOR to remind me, but written worse. It's by no means awful, but it doesn't have the crowing moments of awesome that HPMOR had for me, and as mentioned, the battles aren't as imaginative.

If you're not enjoying it by chapter 10 or so, I would not recommend continuing. I didn't find that it improved much, but it didn't get any worse (up to ch 33).

** I would not recommend this fic. Maybe it gets better, the few chapters I read had: - Perving over 13 year old girls and 'dirty humor' every. second. line. of. dialogue - A highly OOC Harry for no explained reason - An overpowered Harry from the very beginning

Either way, there are better things to read.
