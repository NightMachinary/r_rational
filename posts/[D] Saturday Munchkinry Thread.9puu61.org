Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You gain the ability to use Portent dice, as for a Divination Wizard in 5th edition D&D.

At midnight each night, two random numbers between 1 and 20 pop into your head. (You can roll 2d20 yourself as long as you do it within 5 seconds of midnight.) For that 24 hour span you can replace your "natural roll," or that of someone you can see, with one of these numbers, 1 being a critical fumble and 20 a critical success. Once you use a number it vanishes, and unused numbers vanish at midnight.

That said, it's only a d20. Getting a 20 for Portent means you can guarantee one action you take that day resulting in an outcome in the 95th percentile--you're not gonna win the lottery, but a nat 20 on your Charisma check when asking out that cute barista would probably get you a date.

Given that it's unpredictable (some days you'll get two 12s) and that the best-case scenario is 2 chances to limit results to either the top or bottom 5%, how do you munchkin your fancy new power?

*** You win the stock market every day you get a 15+ by giving yourself a 75% chance of choosing good stocks for the day on a luck roll. You don't ask for the best stocks, just stocks which will rise, which is roughly 50% of them anyway. You could become the first hedge fund manager who actually beats the market consistently by moving out of the market when you get crappy rolls.

Furthermore, putting bad numbers on others' sense motive checks and good ones on your charisma checks means getting clients is easier. Money is the best superpower, and this one is really easy to turn into a lot of money.

​

But yes, your method works. Seeing that this is the case I'd use FX where you can multiply your returns because of the way it works, i.e say you'd get 1000 profit on FX you'd get 100.000 because it can multiply your money, I forgot the specific word for it.

​

I just thought of this, doesn't this dice only mean you make a choice at the top 95% percentile of every person on earth, so compared to experts you'd basically be at their level without their knowledge 1 every 20 days.

If this works based on your personal skill, you could get technically on the top 5% of the top 5% by getting all their skill and knowledge.

But since we know that these 'experts' and hedgefund managers can't even do better than random chance most of the time, and even the times they do it can be attributed to random chance, the skill becomes less useful.

It gives you an /outcome/ in the top 5%, and most of the trading done in the stock market is being done by experts anyway. So given how much chance there is in the stock market getting a number above a 10 is going to make you outperform the market since plenty of people already outperform the market /on a specific trade/. The difference which gives you a massive advantage is that you /always/ outperform the market.

****** I'm fairly sure you get the top 5% based on your base, or the world's base, depending on the skill. i.e there's a bell curve of possible outcomes, you get the top 5% of that curve, the curve is based on either your skill or average skill..

From what I know and read, nobody beats the stock market consistently. They can technically do it for a few years because of random chance, but then they return to the mean.

So seeing that even the most skilled at it are fairly incapable of beating the market, I'd say that if you got the top 5% of the expert outcomes you could make some money.

You could get rich out of this, but it's just not as OP as some people are thinking.

#+end_quote

It says the top 5% of outcomes for a specific attempt you're applying the roll to, which is a very different thing from getting the /average/ outcomes that you would expect from the top 5% of people.\\
If it uses your base then you're still going to do much better than average simply by trading in a basically competent manner and getting the outcomes people who do that get a minority of the time, since again beating the market isn't possible typically. If it's going off the average then you should expect the exact same outcome because almost by definition the average trader performs at market level since the market is the average of the constituent traders.\\
Getting the top 5% of expert outcomes is absolutely amazing if you're getting the outcomes the best traders can only normally get 5% of the time, and importantly since you're only picking good rolls you can consistently do this (well not top 5% say since you won't have either roll be 20 most of the days, but still very good) so you won't have any failures which average out your successes.

Importantly the advantage here is going to also be massively amplified by the fact everybody will want to give you their money to invest since you can substantially outcompete everyone else. So eventually you'll likely become a fixture of the financial market and probably the richest person alive since a massive portion of all financial trades will flow through you with you taking some small cut.

******** You're assuming this trading skill is much more powerful than I'm assuming it is.

The average trader performs with the market because the market will grow anyway and with enough diversification you'll get the same growth the market did. It's not a skill related outcome, it's an expected outcome based on statistics.

i.e the market is a massive sample, it's going to move. A trader picks stocks from the sample, his picks will move and so will the market.

All he's doing is getting a small sample of the results of the market. This small sample size can be higher than the market, or lower. But on average over a long enough period of time it will equal that of the market.

To keep it short, there's little impact from skill on stock trading / investing if at all. You could maybe (if skill has any effect on this) get an average 5% extra from the market rate consistently with the top 1% skill in the planet.

With a top 5% you'd get maybe 2% advantage on the market on average. While that's not bad it's not as great as you are thinking it is.

TLDR the bell curve is not that wide. So while you could do well, it's like 1-5% better than average give or take.

And that's depending on where the base value is taken, from your skill or average skill, and if skill has any effect on stock returns.

That's exactly my point, that you're not relying on skill but just the fact that it's as though you're picking only the best subset of the random results you would expect to get from normal trading.

Again you're not necessarily impacting your skill here you're skewing probability, so having every trade you make be as good as the best 1/20 trades (assuming the most extreme case where you always roll a 20) of someone else is /insanely/ good.

Managing other peoples money gets you a faster ramp, but ramp-up is not your problem. ¨

Not making giant waves and getting bloody well assassinated is. For whatever your target level of personal wealth is, you will be less of a disruptive force in the market if you only execute trades with your own money to get there. Sure, you could end up controlling a huge faction of all trades as a money manager.. but that just de-legitimatizes the market as a social mechanism, which you do not want.

Heck, in general, I would recommend just not ever appearing on the forbes list of the ultra rich - you can always earn more money, so you have no particular need of a huge bankroll unless you have a specific project you need funded. (Molten salts Thorium reactor commercial scale prototype! )

As for managing other people's money if you're taking say a 5% cut, then you could possibly speed things up pretty quickly to the point where you don't need to take other people's money. At a certain point though making the financial system heavily reliant on you will allow levels of profit not otherwise possible without causing more issues than otherwise. If every billionaire or massive company has to accept some very small fee to you in order to stay competitive with everyone else I really doubt that's going to be something that voters will care all that much about.

How much you'd cut down your time is debatable because you'd be showing dramatically better results than anyone else that aren't limited to just one area like you'd expect from somebody using insider trading or the like. So I suspect you could get some money to speed things along a few years in your plans from some people willing to take interest in high risk high return investments.\\
Still this early stage is ultimately not as important and will last less than a decade either way before you can start the next stage in your plans.

The point is that the status quo stays exactly the same except now a few percent of the global GDP is being funneled to you and various organizations under your control. While you can certainly own many massive companies there's limits to how much power you can accrue this way. Whereas by making yourself an integral part of the financial sector (plus you'd probably make the market more efficient which would improve economic growth) you can start accruing enough wealth to equal a large nation in power.

************ Years? I see the problem. You can execute one natural twenty trade every ten days on average. That is not enough volume to increase market efficiency, but it will double your stake on an incredibly short turnaround. Every month in more volatile markets. That is why I say the concern about time is ridiculus - you gain very little by raising capital where you do not own the full returns, and in fact, since it makes your volume larger, it may even cripple your earning capability, because there are not a lot of high-volatility markets for billion dollar investments.

And trying to own the market really will just get you dead. The stock market is meant to be a mechanism for capital allocation, not a way to become king of the world. If it starts to become the latter, that does not mean they hand you a crown, it means they shut you down.

Well you don't really need the number to be a 20 for it to still be pretty advantageous anything over a ten should beat the market if a 10.5 is /average/. Plus numbers 10 or below are about equally useful, since I can make a small trade and apply that roll to it, then short the company with a much larger some of cash on my own and take advantage of the lower performance than usual of my small trade. So it's important to note that I can basically make 2 large investments/shorts every day with them just being successful to different degrees.\\
Importantly though the roll doesn't just say it applies to skill/ability style checks so you could use it to enhance the performance of an existing stock or (as pointed out in my answer regarding prediction markets) to alter the probability of practically anything and thus steer world events.

Also worth noting is that once it becomes obvious how well your investments always do people will start copying you thus causing investments that would otherwise have only been top 5% (if a 20) instead do much better, with the same also being true for your shorts.

At this point though I do doubt there's really much point to actually doing hedge fund type stuff beyond /maybe/ a short initial period if you can find interested high risk investors. Since you seem better suited to just trade stocks yourself since you can accomplish the same effect.

You're not going to be king of the world though, you're just siphoning a portion of global GDP to yourself and various organizations connected to you. The effects are distributed enough to not be massively noticeable to many individuals and certainly not enough to cause much outrage. Plus much of that earnings will be from the success of companies you own, since you can save the really good rolls for buying startups that will later turn out to be the best 5%.

*** The real power is that you know what you rolled. If you portent a 1, do your thing with a 1 and then do the opposite.

Attempt to flip a coin to see if protons do decay; heads they do, tails they don't. Regardless of if you know the answer, it's a 50-50 chance. So, if your portent was 11-20, you know you flipped correct and if your portent was 1-10, you know the opposite is correct.

Imagine a game with a clock labeled 1 through 20. In this game you must roll a d20 against some target x between 1 and 20 on the clock. You get points equal to the number of spaces you need to go clockwise around the clock to go from your roll to the target, with a direct hit being worth 20 points.

So if the target is 5 and you rolled a 3, you get 2 points. If you rolled a 6, you get 19 points.

Irrespective of the target, the scores will be uniformly distributed from 1-20, so your portent will equal your score. So, you can get what the target is by starting from your game roll and moving clockwise a number of spaces equal to your portent.

Then, play the game with the target being the nth digit of some string of text you would like to know encoded in base 20.

Assuming average is a low value being on the 95% percentile of that is still low, unless you have a very wide bell curve going on. An IRL example like height you'd end up around 6'3, so not very useful, 95% percentile of IQ is also nothing insane (less than 130).

Sure you might need to pay some taxes, but if you aren't in the US nor is your hedge fund it doesn't seem like you are going to need to pay income tax at the very least.

You have the ability to "absorb" diseases and physical issues from people by playing pattycake with them and doing a specific chant about the issue you're absorbing. You can also pass those issues on to other people in a similar way. The person you're absorbing or passing on issues to must consent to playing pattycake with you and say the chant at least once, though they don't have to know what will happen. You can also recover from diseases and physical issues quicker. How do you use this power?

(For the record, I use "physical issues" because the original story had stuff like hiccups and bloating being transferred.)

If the practice has no effect when the song mismatches the disease, with tailored songs you could be used to diagnose specific diseases for which there are no good tests.

You'd also be able to remove complicating ailmets, allowing doctors to treat an ailment in isolation before returning the other ailments.

But all of these require a way to store ailments, which requires a battery of healthyish patients. Enter the prison industry. Reduced sentences for time served as a diseasr battery.

Given the whole pattycake thing you're not really likely to be able to transfer conditions to unwilling recipients.\\
This is still the best strategy even from an altruistic standpoint since you could give most of the money to charity.

Once your abilities become high profile enough you could probably find some terminally ill people willing to take on an arbitrary amount of potentially very bad conditions for the greater good (and in exchange for payment to their families). After you've found those willing recipients you will be able to massively step up your operations healing thousands of people per day and making staggering sums of money in the process.

** Telekinesis is a frequent subject covered here but I wasn't able to find a previous thread that addressed this particular question:

Telekinesis with no real rules about what can be moved except it doesn't work on humans. It can be used as a projected force field and the field itself can be shaped, and there can be subdivisions within the field. A competent user could for example form a massive torus and accelerate the air to incredibly high temperatures. It can also be used for more simple brute force, like throwing a force field to stop a car. The fields can also be brought close together and have a fairly high upper boundary of how much pressure they can exert, perhaps as high as 100 gigapascals. I see for commercial work a common use of this ability being excavation, as it's very well suited to moving dirt and it can be used to tear stone apart, as projecting the fields has no rules other than it ignores humans.

How could you munchkin this power to make money in a way people don't know about? You have limited starting capital, you can probably get up to around 50K-250K in a small business loan. Detection is paramount, you can't be caught using the power and you also want to avoid being too suspicious/conspicuous. That's an arbitrary line, but I trust your judgment.

I think becoming a lobbyist works better.

It's subtle and as long as you artificially reduce your rate of success, you should stay under the radar.

In the end you goal could be creating more rational agents in politics, preferably ones who align with your own moral values.

On earth the powers wouldn't be discovered, you'd be strong and fast. Maybe the top athlete in history, there's no doping involved so that wouldn't stop you.

And sports organizations don't care if you have a mutation that can give you an advantage, nowadays most sports are dominated by people with genes that give them advantages anyway, i.e height, arm length, long legs, higher O2 capacity etc.

I doubt you'd even learn you could climb walls, unless you try, and who in normal circumstances would try that ?

So it'd be more like, assuming peter lvl intelligence or even average if you want, pro athlete make millions, retire early or don't depending on how the situation is.

If you made more than 5 million, you can technically live the rest of your live with 100k+ a year only using dividends and bonds. This is the lazy retire early route

Or you could go businessman and go full elon musk if you want.

Swords are good weapons, they can be worn and are light. And as you know, weapons are force multipliers, i.e 1 punch deals x dmg, 1 sword slash deals 3x-10x dmg. Since you're multiplying from a higher base strength value they could cut a lot of things, very powerful. Of course they'd get damaged, but you can replace them.

Now if your world has better weapons, and other comic book tech we don't have sure use that.

PS. large rifles like a sniper rifle are very difficult to use in enclosed spaces, there's a reason militaries all over the world use submachine guns for close quarter combat.

Long weapons get in the way, they are worst at shooting from corners and a lot of other things, do some research if you want.

Besides if you're fighting humans why do you need more damage? A gunshot will kill anybody, multiple shots even more so. Sure they can be armored, but they still go down from it. It still breaks ribs, knocks the air out of their lungs and incapacitates them.

It might not kill, but incapacitating is fine in most combat situations.

But sure as I said if your world has better tech than our own, and peter can get his hands on it, use that.

Just don't assume he can built that in his basement, building things is not limited by intelligence, but by equipment and materials. Unless peter has a full fledged forge in his basement, magical batteries, and future circuits he can't ever 'make' high tech things, even current tech equipment would be very difficult to manufacture.

Just as an example, any retard can google how an assault rifle is made and how it works. But he can't build it at home, no matter how smart he is.

He doesn't have the steel, or the equipment to heat, mold, forge and do all kinds of other things at home. It's an equipment and resource limitation, not intelligence.

This is a thing because it was a man competing in the women competition. Even if she/he didn't know that was the case.

Nowadays the chromosome testing was abandoned, they measure testosterone levels to define your gender, it's still not perfect but it's what's being used.

But that's a gender thing, not mutation thing.

It's gotten to a point that the body types of olympic athletes are more similar to his competitors than to his/her siblings.. That's how competitive it is, and how important those traits are.

Spears are better 1v1 for humans, with superstrength I'd assume you'd want something that can hit multiple opponents at a time or at least control a larger area (angle wise not reach wise). With realistic physics spears would get stuck on your enemies and crack often.

One thing to bear in mind is, the powers under discussion (Spiderman, but with inhumanly fast reflexes instead of actual danger sense) will /not/ remove the risk. Nothing in this power set protects you from a bullet in the back. (Bullets outrun their own sound, so you can't hear it before it hits).

On top of that, simply becoming a vigilante and beating up criminals has a bad habit of leading to your becoming simply a bigger thug, unless you are in some way answerable to someone else for your actions.

Also, in all honesty, wearing a mask and a costume is a /terrible/ way to hide your identity in real life.

Given all of the above, I'd suggest that in the hypothetical in question (i.e. you have the powers described in the original post /and/ there is a lot of crime in your neighbourhood) then joining the police is a far superior action to becoming a vigilante - you get better supplies, more help, the ability to call on backup, etc.

And, even if the police as a whole tend to the corrupt, you can still try to change that around - pay attention /personally/ to the little crimes, and so on.

** The party, after a gruelling journey, has arrived at the city of Town, populated by around 10,000 people. They narrowly managed to outrun the horde of perhaps 4,000 gnolls, evil super-strong hyena-people who were hot on their tails. With perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms and the unbroken walls of the city, can the party turn the army away, or failing that, save the people from the horde?

This is all Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

We, the party, are 6:

- A Wizard (Illusionist) who is sworn to harm no creature.

- A Bard (Swords) who is the party face

- A Warlock (Celestial) who is the primary healer

- A [[https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/1_UA_Artificer_20170109.pdf][UA Artificer]] (Alchemist) who can make items

- A fighter (??) who can use both sword and bow

- A pugilist, who refuses to share any information with the party.

The town's walls are defensible, but the enemy has among their numbers 12 Hezrou, spread out throughout the horde, which are living siege engines. Seeing as the heroes are among the only people who can make a difference with regards to the oversize demons, we have been saddled with that particular responsibility. We are all *level 5* at the moment, but have acquired enough XP to move to *level 6* on a long rest. However, we have opted to explore the catacombs beneath the city to try to find a tunnel out of the city, either away from the main body of the horde, or directly underneath it. We intend to delve the catacomb again before we rest to find an area to keep the civilians, which might bring us up to *level 7*. How can we defeat 12 CR8 Hezrou, given that they are surrounded by 100s of CR1/2 gnolls each, before next morning when the gnolls will likely attack?

Details:

- The Wizard and Warlock both have familiars.

- The Artificer might be able to enchant the Fighter's weapon to deal magic damage.

- We have found a long tunnel in the catacombs, but we don't know which direction it leads. Finding which way is goes is helpful.

- The demons were presumably not summoned by a creature, but rather entered the world through portals (think Out of the Abyss).

- We have potential allies - both a teleportation circle within the town might bring in a powerful hero, or a Green Dragon ally who split up with up before we got to the town. Both might be contacted with a Sending (which the Wizard does not have yet), but should not be relied on.

- The men-at-arms have ballistas arming the walls. These might take out one or two Hezrou on their own, but shouldn't be relied on.

- The horde outnumbers the men-at-arms. If the wall falls, it's over.

Ideas we've had (reveal after giving it a little thought)

- Level 6: Have the Bard cast Dissonant Whispers to get the Hezrou to attack the gnolls around them - the gnolls have no ability to de-escalate and will attack the Hezrou back

- Level 6: Have the Wizard Disguise Self/Tongues to infiltrate the gnoll camp while the bard does his thing - Disguise Self gives no save, only revealed on investigation, so could take advantage of the chaos caused by the bard to abuse pack mentality and get gnolls to attack other Hezrou

- Level 6: Get the Fighter the Sharpshooter feat or the Warlock the Eldritch Spear invocation (Level 7) and Fly them above the camp, so they can rain down terror from above. Ideally combined with Greater Invisibility (Level 7).

- Get the Artificer's Mechanical Servant to be a Large Eagle and use Enlarge on it to get it to carry rubble and bombard the enemy camps.

- The pugilist has Mold Earth - teach it to the casters within the city and have them start digging escape tunnels. Alternately, make tunnels under the gnoll camp for quick collapse and exfiltration.

*** I can only come up with marginally effective strategies. And I'm using internet sources, so I hope it's all canon.

​

I would split the party.

- Have the Artificer work on the ballistae; load them up with spells (like protection from evil to make them last longer in the fight) and formulae. A tanglefoot ballista could wreck the plan of an army. See if the villagers can make large scale alchemical fire under his guidance.
- Have the pugilist to direct villagers to make traps with mold earth. The illusionist can cover them later.
- Have the bard, illusionist, and maybe warlock make the enemy's night before battle a living hell. Start fires everywhere with prestidigitation and invisible servant. Use acid or poison (if available on food supplies) Use enthrall to make the enemy fight each other. Blind hezrou or use illusions to make them stomp around. Use loud noises and alarm spells so they don't sleep. Smokesticks plus illusion to make them think there's an invading enemy. Invisibility and impersonation would help a lot here. Ask the DM for will save modifiers for sleepless gnolls, and then use enthrall again during the battle.\\
- Point out to the DM that gnolls love fighting each other and do it all the time anyways.
- Were this another DnD, I would have the warlock counter summoning or dispelling demons, but 5e's don't have that power for reasons?
- Weaken a section of the walls for a killing zone when it falls. Have it prepared with alchemical fire, archers, and all sorts of nastiness.

*** Discordant Whispers seems to cause fleeing, not attacking. The Illusionist might wreak havoc though, throwing Hallucinations and Figments of infighting.

*** if you get to lvl 7:

- illusionist should choose hallucinatory terrain as 4th lvl spell

- now you can hide everyone in a 150 feet cube and make it look like a cliff/huge bolder

real munchkinery: * go to plane with different time scale(? / speed up time?) to have more time (you could go to the feywild and hope to be lucky)

- make scrolls of hallucinatory terrain (just 2 weeks and 2.500 GP for each scroll)

- go back and cast it around walls... maybe make it seem like the walls are cliffs(?) and there is a river around it (there should be water or the illusion fails)

- hope they leave before the spell duration (24h) ends... maybe use one scroll to make a small (150 feet cube) replica of Town farther away, so army thinks Town is in that direction (and farther away than the illusion)

Hope for Natural 20 strategies:

If you don't get to 7th level use minor illusion/silent image to make a really tiny Town in the distance. You probably need to get close to the leader with disguise self or something like it or your familiars. Maybe the artificer can enchant the enemies leaders telescope so whoever looks north/south/east through it sees the town in a realistic position (always at the same distance)

You would need to take out scouting parties or convince them the town is there.

I just realized Town may be already under siege. Then those strategies would be useless...

If the main strategy is useless... Instead maybe convince them, they got tricked by an illusion and the town isn't there at all. It is all some kind of trap... maybe the walls are where a dragon sleeps... or tesseraque... or something... or in reality there is only a wood wall and behind it are traps and pitfalls or just a hill... Best if someone makes his checks, they get told they see the illusion of Town. If someone fails there checks, they believe there is a dragon/hill/tesseraque hidden under the illusion of Town. (You would need to convince your DM that that works)

basically you would need to make two or more illusions above each other.

And maybe a way to convince the leaders.

also artificer looks boring... lets your DM make you original stuff? Like a potion that gives everyone who is in range disadvantage against illusions? (or at least a -5/-4/-3/-2/-1 ). Smoke grenades would work. Maybe just burn stuff for smoke...

honestly not sure what else the illusionist can do... I think I am to strict with the no harm vow. (are pitfalls hidden with illusions allowed? they could be just tunnels and the Hezrou would be the only ones heavy enough to collapse the tunnels with spikes and other surprises in it)

What spells have the warlock and artificer?

Any magic items of interest? (something that gives you new abilities not just more damage/better stats)

*** Just have the Artificer make a Giant Eagle as their Mechanical Servant and put the fighter with Sharpshooter on their back with a bag of holding full of arrows and maybe a spare bow. Optionally, cast (regular) invisibility on the Giant Eagle (it won't be making attack rolls, and thus won't break invisibility).

Send the pair out to kill the army. Let the fighter just shoot into the army below from maximum range (see if the DM will let you shoot an extra 5 feet due to shooting directly down) -- this'll make it so nothing the Gnolls have can hit you. Focus the Hezrou if you want, but no reason not to just kill the full army. Primary constraints are whatever the DM decides exhaustion should be for the Giant Eagle and the Fighter, and just how "by the rules" they play ranges (since, they could in theory say "You're max range with a longbow is the same as the Gnoll's, thus if you shoot at them from 600 feet in the air, they can also shoot at you from the ground. I'm going to roll 200 attack rolls against you now.").

Likely, you should be able to kill the 12 Hezrou via Sharp Shooter Longbow (by my math, each arrow will do ~(1d8+15) / 2 ~ 10 damage, and about every other arrow will hit a Hezrou. Given the fighter can fire 2 arrows a round, this means it'll take about two and a half minute to take down a Hezrou.

Presumably, the Giant Eagle can fly in a holding pattern for at least a half hour, which should be enough to take out all the Hezrou in a single flight. If they stick around, they could also solo the full army -- Gnolls should drop in 1 or 2 hits with sharpshooter.

Greater Invisibility is nice, but only marginally useful since it only lasts 1 minute, and it'll take more than 1 minute to do anything worthwhile with arrows.

*** The gnolls are not the problem. Between the men-at-arms and the unbroken walls, they should be driven off even without the party's involvement. The hezrou are the problem; all strategies should concentrate entirely on eliminating/destroying these creatures.

I'm not familiar with 5e, but is it possible for your Alchemist to create an Apple Of Discord-like item - that is, something that everyone who sees it wants and will fight for? Dropping one of those in the path of the oncoming army will drastically improve your odds as they stop to fight amongst themselves.
