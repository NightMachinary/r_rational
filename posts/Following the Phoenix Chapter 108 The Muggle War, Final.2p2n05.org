** LORD MALFOY JUST SWORE HIMSELF INTO ETERNAL BONDAGE TO HOUSE POTTER.

*** If you can't beat them, join them. He has seen young Potter do multiple impossible things and has heard more yet from Draco. He recognises Harry will achieve power in the wizarding world that is simply out of his reach: Lucius has peaked. On his own he will never be anything more than 'faction leader'. Better to elevate Harry and follow closely in his wake.

That I think is the intended logic. However, like many things in this fic I find it a little too convenient. I feel like the author picked an ending and is transparently writing toward it, rather than letting characters do what they will. I am enjoying the ride nonetheless.

My sentiments exactly. Although I do hold out hope for the alternative.

*** The Malfoys have been doing this for centuries. If there's someone who's going to be The Most Powerful with capital letters and everything, you glue your lips to their signet ring and make sure you end up their second in command. This is perfectly in character for Lucius /if/ he's extremely certain that Harry is going to win.

**** Well, the /obvious/ scenario is that, since Harry is sort of a horcrux, his control only works if Quirrell wants it to, so Malfoy if safe from him, even if Harry doesn't know. This also means that Dumbledore is under Quirrell's control, so MASSIVE WIN FOR VOLDEMORT.

*** It makes perfect sense, though I never would have pictured him doing it. Having given it some thought, the parallel with his servitude to Voldemort is natural (and suitably chilling after you read the final sections of the chapter).

*** There is an out. He simply has to kill Harry in such a way that Harry has no time to realize Malfoy did it and order him killed, and avoid Harry setting him a task with a kill condition. He knows Harry is unlikely to do the latter.

Also, this secures his /legacy/. Which is more important to him then his current power level or life.

Which, I believe, is why Harry named Hermione the heiress to House Potter.

(I actually don't like the title "The Muggle War" for 4-6, because all the battle is going on in the background, but I didn't have anything better. Suggestions are entirely welcome. :))
