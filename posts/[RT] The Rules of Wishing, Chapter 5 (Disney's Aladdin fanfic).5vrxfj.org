I trust that after their holiday, they'll get down to the business of fixing problems like slavery on a larger scale?

**** I think it will be less a holiday and more exploring the world fixing what they find that needs to be fixed, though their do-gooding will probably remain erratic for a while.

(But I'll leave that for somebody else to write. I've enough on my plate with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966][Programmer at Large]])

Also, speaking of Programmer at Large, you can't leave us with a cliff-hanger like /"OK. Have you heard about gender?"/ Unless you're secretly Greg Egan or something.

Actually I'm bored of the story and was thinking of waiting another two or three years before continuing.

Err. Wait. No. The other thing. [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/programmer-at-large-how-did-people/][New chapter out today]] but I forgot about the new "Only post your stuff once a week" rule, so somebody else will have to post it for me (hint hint).

(The schedule is every other Friday. I found doing weekly a bit too much, and intended to use biweekly to build up a buffer, but I must admit so far that hasn't happened).

Not as far as I know. It would be a bit confusing if I turned out to be wrong about that.

That actually sounds like something from an early Egan short story. Would work as a side-arc in Permutation City.

So eg. /Inversions/ might become a story about Jasmine and Aladdin subtly influencing the Wars of the Roses...

*** Pretty much. He knew Jafar would pursue them, and be supremely confident in his ability to overcome Al/Jasmine because of the genie limitations. And /obviously/ the genie would be bound by all the rules too, so the second he shows up, he binds the kids and poof, insta-win. Jafar's only weakness would be his assumption about the genie. The fact that not only had they freed him, but done so quickly, would not occur to Jafar- and rightly so; neither kid had given him the impression they'd do so ever, let alone so quickly.

***** Was Jafar bind to the genie's lack of bracers? Attention to detail would be an important trait for an ancient sorcerer, and he did pick up on the genie's attitude change.. But didn't notice the loss of the jewelry that signified binding, which was practically the only thing the genie wore?

*** Yup. Freed Genie is roughly as good at magic (innately) as Jasmine and Alladin, with millennia more experience.

The anvil was just to amuse himself. Jaffar was dead the moment he picked up the lamp.

It's really the only explanation that makes sense once I rule out genies being able to see the future. See also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8886151][Under a broken sky]]

My official stance on this is that if it's not in the text then any opinion I have on the matter is just another headcanon. I didn't write this with any sort of Sufficiently Advanced Technology in mind, but there's no reason it couldn't be.
