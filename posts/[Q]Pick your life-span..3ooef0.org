An interesting question I've seen elsewhere dealing with optimism vs. caution wrt one's life.

Basically, a random -conveniently anthropmorphic- alien decides to grant you as much life as you choose to have. You are generally at your peak health and stay in a sort of stasis for as long as you're alive, until you die after a set period of time of your choosing. You cannot really be locked down in horrific scenarios like being buried alive permanently, but it'll take some time for circumstances to conspire to let you out if you do indeed get grabbed and trapped. But it won't be ever permanent.

You can't set conditions on your immorality (e.g. "I want to live so long as I am not being hunted by every government on Earth). You have to pick a particular amount of time. 10 years, a thousand, a billion, up to you. But, once set you have to live it all out. Permanent stasis fails much like permanent entrapment, though there is again some randomness to it. You cannot opt out. You must pick an amount of time right at that moment.

Luckily for you, enhancements can be grafted and will become part of your unchanging state, but you still have to have a purely physical body (no uploading). Barring enhancements you're assumed to function as a normal human would (sustenance being optional) psychologically.

So, what is the maximum "safe" amount of time you're willing to gamble on life still being comfortable and worth living for? A hundred years? A hundred thousand? A billion?


** The interesting point here is that I'm going to live and remain healthy. That implies that the universe cannot end or become completely unfriendly to humans until I die...and I can't die.

This means that if I choose G(G(G(G65))) or some other ridiculous number, I can help the human race survive past the currently projected end of the universe.

It also means I don't need a spacesuit for ET EVA work. That's pretty awesome.

** Yeah, I like being sane, but not more than I like being alive. I figure I pick some immense number - G65 years or something. I'm guaranteed to experience an unmatched magnitude of suffering, but I also get to see the ultimate fate of the universe, personally. Hell, I might even be able to sculpt what comes next, if this immortality binds my substance to existence, the only node of curved spacetime in an immense flatness. Perhaps I become a lonely god, drifting through every configuration of atoms possible, including the ones that include meaningful other entities. Perhaps there's nothing, and more nothing, and more nothing, and whatever degree of change my broken mind is allowed has it reform into coherence and insanity a number of times beyond all human comprehension.

** This...this is a pain in the ass.

On the one hand, I'd enjoy living "forever", though a better way to put that is probably indefinitely.

I'm also not bothered by the concept of death. I've no idea why the concept of permanent 0 is supposed to be scary.

So, so long as my existence is at a +1 value, I'm happy to continue living. If it's at 0 then I'm indifferent and if it seems like it's going to be below 0 for prolonged periods of time then 0 is the obviously better solution.

So yes, this situation is a pain in the ass. I don't want to pick a time frame that would kill me while I'm still existing at a positive value. But I don't want to pick a time frame that would leave me alive in a prolonged negative value.

Fortunately, you specify that I'll never be trapped, with entrapment being one of only two things that register a -2 on my scale (with -2 representing things that death is an immediate better alternative to.)

So the only thing I have to worry about is boredom.

**** Isolation doesn't concern me. Do I have access to sufficient entertainment? I'm fine, then. Outside of maybe 100 hours worth of TV shows / video games I've been reading and writing for the past year. I believe outside of the occasional forum or reddit post I may have interacted with people 3 times.

Let's call it a nice, round, 5,000 years humans have been writing. Call it a pessimistic estimate that we'll exist in a state to continue to produce creative works for something like another 5,000 years.

It took me about 6 months to catch up on the backlog of HP fanfiction I was actually interested in. It's 18 years old, but has one of the largest fanbases for producing works. Between it, Worm, and time I write, new works consume about 2 hours a day.

A quick glance of my backlog of original fiction I intend to read at some point shows me about 200 series / independent books on log. If I extrapolate and take in the lower producing fan bases, we might get up to 4 hours a day worth of newly produced works to keep me occupied.

Expanding population, increasing availability to both internet and time free of work to produce entertainment...

I wouldn't request anything less than 100,000. And I've got another 10 minutes to think about it.

****** If I was immortal I would definitely be very interested in ensuring humanity's continued existence out to the end of my period of immortality. But you know...I'm already interested in ensuring humanity's continued existence, and being immortal would help me do that. I could try and study myself to uplift more people, I could use my long lifespan to ensure certain knowledge is retained through disasters and help rebuild society in the wake of calamity. I could slowly acquire the funding over the course of hundreds of years to start building space colonies and research immortality.

Sure everything could go bad in the end, but I'd be around to try and stop things from going bad. I want humanity to live to see the last stars in the universe go out. (what comes after that is a bit more of an open question). You'd be offering me the chance to never have to step aside and hope for the best. I would be fit and healthy the whole way through.

But even if humanity was wiped out, and there's still immortal me, still running around on the slowly recovering earth in the wake of mankind's extinction. At that point I could, I don't know, start selectively breeding animals to create another intelligent species? Playing god in a weirdly direct way? As long as I had /stimulus/ I don't think I would go completely nuts, even in the absence of other humans.

That's obviously not ideal though. The goal isn't to be a god among sentient parrots, the goal is to /win/, and winning means humanity survives to inherit the night sky. If I fail, and humanity goes extinct? Well maybe I deserve to go insane for failing.

Can you though? I mean, doesn't this imagine that you'd have sufficient lead time to do so? You are after all, as far as I know, another random human, not The Doctor. No powers, no hyper-intelligence, no nothing. Hell, even with lead time you're still just "going the long way round". No future tech knowledge (assuming that humanity doesn't regress massively in the interim) and we do a good job of updating new scientists on relevant old material already.

I mean, think of trying to solve the...the Cuban Missile Crisis. Right now.

I think that's my general problem, and applies to all other plans (like breeding new life). Ability to act here is more limited than it seems /and/ the psychological issue also seems like something that can't be ignored when trying to set yourself up to exist longer than our planet and species.

******** Immortality allows you to accumulate money over time. Not to mention that you need to care a lot less about healthcare and healthy living as you are pretty much exempt from any chronic issues (or at least I hope so because if you aren't then everything will be horrible after just a few lifetimes). And through said money you should have a good amount of power. At some point maybe even enough to enact actual changes.

And outliving our species is already a pessimistic stance in and of itself for any time span not approaching whatever age that the universe itself will go through fundamental physical changes. If humanity manages to survive the death of our solar system I don't know what other mundane threats could make us go extinct.

******* I think if I wanted to ensure the survival of humanity, then within the first century I would learn genetic engineering. After, I would plot out a tech path from stone age all the way to the tools necessary to achieve human cloning, then learn the principals of all the steps along that path. Then I would make several repositories of human DNA in all its various forms, and a few repositories of all of our knowledge. Plunk one in the marianas trench (I don't need no stinking swim suit, I'm immortal!), and a few others in various places.

Then, if humanity dies I can bring it back. Worst case scenario I can use my own DNA to do the job, though there would be far less variation which would cause problems for many hundreds of years unless a workaround can be found.

It may be that it is impossible to create a proper genetic lab from scratch with no civilisation. In which case I would have to follow your plan of uplifting parrots or something until they had enough technology for me to achieve my goal. The worst thing would be the religions that would spring up. It would make me very uncomfortable to be worshipped.

Then I would very much regret not knowing genetic engineering.

Of course, I would also amass wealth, and pay scientists to figure out the best solutions to this problem, but the knowledge would be a good backup. It would hardly be a chore to learn, with as much time as I would have.

Replace each neuron with something else capable of doing the job and the mind is still a pattern of electrons (real or virtual) on a physical base. There's no reason a virtual electron pattern couldn't use an underlying base which extended outside the skull, or was replicated offsite in real-time, unless it was actively suppressed.

There's no reason a physical body can escape being trapped by fiat either.

There isn't certainty here, just like with the escaping from being trapped issue. Your body will just reject and "reset" if you cross a certain threshold, that threshold being biased towards preventing mental enhancements to the point of uploading. Get a prosthetic leg? Sure. Replace everything except your skull with a Terminator exoskeleton? Reset, to right after the decision and lose it all.

** Hmm.. most likely, my life will get more valuable, not less, as time progresses, if most people realize my existence substantially increases the size of the pie, which it probably will (generations to learn, so the hard part is the relearning), and cooperate- even if the relationship is with me as an inferior is still better than it is now, so long as the standard of living gradually rises.

The biggest downside is i have to see freinds die, but i won't get to avoid that either way, it just means i see all of them die- which there's a non-zero chance would happen either way. I'd probably choose probably a huge number, but i don't know what it would be. a googol sounds dangerous, since your definition of trapped means tossed into the cosmos to drift at 15 MPH for all eternity is going to take quite a while to be freed from (since i can theoretically go just about anywhere), and more after. probably in the billions- i'll always want to not die, but significant brain memory expansions seem like a shortly-before immortality or shortly-after immortality tech, so it's not that likely that it'd make the difference, and at that point, every experience is being overwritten by another. either humanity is still around, and immortality and revival is really impractical, or humanity isn't and i might be bored to death anyways, or humanity is and tech is high enough that i can be rescued at this point in time- just enter a cyrogenic state- temporary, and short enough that i don't escape automatically by probability manipulation, and if i do, and die from the probability manipulation effects of the death, i still profited, and made the gamble i felt best. Yes, I'll die permanantly one day, after the effect ends, but i predict there will be a point where i'll want to die, even if i've never reached it yet. (that may be depression speaking, though.)

** I'd say a million years at the most, probably lower. I don't think you guys really comprehend how long a million years is. Recorded human history is only a couple thousand years long and look at all the stuff that's happened. A million should be more than enough for me. I'd imagine after a couple thousand years things would lose their meaning pretty rapidly. What does sex matter after the hundred thousandth time? How many kids do you need to have before they bore you? How many books can you read before it all becomes iterations of previous books?

Humans haven't evolved to live that long, we are not designed for it. We get happiness from doing things and what happens when you've done everything? Artificial drugs to dope you into happiness?

Ten thousand years later you'd likely be bored out of your skull and want to die. That or you'd start taking big risks. You'd train to become the best gunman in the world and go around killing people, or get involved with wars, or become a politician and make wars. You'd be richer than anyone else (because of investments and interest) and more skilled than anyone else.

Then what happens? You can't die so killing people becomes boring. Worst that can happen is you'd be restrained, then you'd probably experience horrible pain for a hundred years or however long it takes for them to give up or die, or forever if you can't escape. So you probably don't want to go around killing people.

After a million years you'd likely go insane or become so twisted that you seem insane. Boredom or insanity, take your pick. After thinking it out I'd say twenty thousand years. Enough time to experience and do everything I could ever want, but not enough to go insane, hopefully.

** This is easy. Infinity, of course. As soon as medical tech makes it safe I wirehead with a timer. If anything unfortunate happens I can spend time in infinite bliss. And isn't the heat death of the universe going to reverse over infinite time due to random chance and EVERYTHING being possible?

When medical tech makes it there I'll install the tech to modify my mind to be happy and fulfilled in any situation I specify, doing anything I specify, to find beauty and wonder in anything I specify, with occasional checkups from my unmodified mind to see how I would really feel about the situation. I'd also have the tech to edit my memories as I see fit when checking in with my normal mind.

I suppose additional safeguards might be a good idea. Something to bust me out of any loops where I and my normal self decide to torture myself for infinite time. And to bust me out of any loops where my normal self and I decide to giver me really weird memories. So I'd need backup for all memories deleted, and occasional automatic reviews by various versions of myself to see if any need reinstatement.

What's infinite lifespan regret when you can edit yourself to be happy about /anything/ and find meaning and fulfillment in /anything/? This tech, plus infinite lifespan sounds like pretty much the definition of heaven to me.
