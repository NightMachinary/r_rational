** Earth is destroyed! (Well, all the buildings and everyone who is inside them.)

Aliens are going to strip-mine the Earth, but first they're going to run the 13 million surviving humans through a reality TV show consisting of a dungeon crawl. Carl is unfortunate to go in with no shoes, no pants (he does have boxers -- it's not that kind of dungeon!), and a cat.

There's a nice mix of understated humor, action, and character development. This is currently my favorite story on the internet, ranking above Worth the Candle.

*** I really enjoy this series - not just the humor, but also the drama. For the life of me, I can't come up with much rational content in it. The main character (not to mention Donut) is smart enough. The setting is downright surreal to the point where very little analysis and planning seem possible.

**** Hm...not sure I agree. For example (some of these may reference Patreon chapters, I'm not sure):

1. They discover that bosses have weaknesses and they plan accordingly, such as using the ramp and spike strips against the Ball of Swine.
2. Carl figures out out to give Katia a literal ton of mass to work with despite there not being any equipment with anything like that amount
3. They build barriers to block off the doors of the trains in order to funnel their enemies into a killbox.
4. They come up with a specific playbook of combat tactics instead of always going ad hoc
5. Careful planning during race and class selection.
6. Carl's handling of Grimaldi and meta-handling of the producers of /Vengeance of the Daughter/

It takes a while for the rules of the dungeon to be completely revealed, but I think Carl and Donut work with those rules in a sensible fashion once they know about them.

***** I love the story, but it's one of those things that only pushes rationality because the author is withholding information. Since we don't know the game mechanics, we can't rationally discuss the game.

But I've said similar things about PGtE and that does well here.

2.The author Deus'd this in with the book won from a roulette carousel; +the only thought on Carl's part was following the book's instructions to disguise the idea as his own+ Edit: I misremembered. Carl was clever here, but the book is anti-rational shenanigans.

5.In-story issue here, there were too many choices for the author to list. We got to see like 5 classes, and the races were essentially chosen arbitrarily after blowing the rest off as not worth discussing.

6.This is an interesting point, mainly because there was only communication from Carl. He could have been correct in not seizing victory, but he could have killed Grimaldi. Logically, he could have killed Grimaldi, and should have for the greater comparative rewards. He didn't, because he thought that he would somehow be screwed out of his victory because 'That's what happens'. And I'd argue that it makes sense, but only in the context of an already illogical world: I.E. A world where looking at the sun blinds you, because God pokes out your eyes, not because of bright sunlight. Everyone knows God's gonna poke your eyes out if you look at the sun, or the gameshow is going to screw you over, but it doesn't really have good backlogic.

  For the next two hours, I read through every available race. There was a wide variety of choices, from short, squat, purple-skinned little people called Night Dwarves to tall, thin gazelle-like fighters called Lyrx Elves to monstrous rock creatures with molten centers called Coal Engines. There was even a finger-sized parasitic worm creature called an Intellect Hunter. I wondered if they were the same creatures who ran the Valtay Corporation, but I was afraid to ask. They could take over the bodies of any creature they killed, though the bodies would immediately start to rot. Mordecai said that was actually a solid choice, but I couldn't imagine losing myself to that form.

******* Because it's the equivalent of God poking your eyes out for looking at the sun. God exists. Your eyes exist. Poking happens. You can deus ex a reason that the poking won't happen, or use luck as a justification, maybe God's having an off day, but there's a lack of rationality applied there unless we get into the whys and the hows.

Backlogic in this case would be knowing more about the "interests behind them" and their rationale behind acting, so they could be predicted or predictions could be discussed intelligently by readers. We got a bit of that for Grimaldi iirc, but not enough in my opinion for Carl to do what Carl did and have any significant justification beyond wind in the plot sails.

I'm not going to argue that Carl did not act intelligently in this choice. I *am* arguing that Carl's choices here were not something that we as readers were given enough insight into to be able to discuss rationally beyond 'It worked'.

A one-path-forward storyline is not rational by definition, just because there is only one path forward and the main character follows it.

There were other options for Carl that we could not rationally speculate on because we do not have enough information to do so.

****** The "too many choices to list" seemed actually really realistic to me, very indicative of the real world. With only 8 days to choose, literally going through thousands of choices would waste several days. That may not be enjoyable for the optimizer in us, but it's certainly realistic. Sometimes the optimal choice is to take advice and not get bogged down in details.

The deus was a little far fetched, but didn't annoy me because we know so little of the world or system anyways. Who knows how rare that actually is.

******* You're right, I suppose, but the other choices /are/ relevant because each player has a unique build that could have utilized them. So while it's impossible for the author to list off that information, Carl and Donut both have the insight that the in-story list provided while the readers do not.

And yeah, part of the general lack of information is due to Carl / Donut's lack of information, but the game mechanics specifically could be better fleshed out, if the author were aiming for [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I mean, there was no good reason for the list to be thousands long. It could have been 3 long and provided the same context, but without Carl and Donut getting massive amounts of background information that we as readers were left out of.

It just strikes me as a deus ex in the chamber at best, anti-rational worldbuilding at worst.

But I recognize this as an actual argument I have with this sub. Like I said in my previous comment, PGtE doesn't qualify as ratfic in my mind. Pretty much for this exact reason: Cat just randomly recognizes 'rules' as existing, and uses those rules to her advantage, when the readers have no reason to believe those rules are in place or exist prior to her actions.

Agreed. But, of course, there's the rub...what exactly do we mean by that? DCC is definitely not rational/ist/ because it's not trying to teach the science of psychology of logical thinking, math, etc. Is it ration/al/? Let's run the list:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

This one is met. Donut is a child who became sapient shortly after entering the dungeon after a lifetime of being a show cat. As a result, she has problems consistent with that -- impetuousness, etc -- but I think it's fair to say she's intelligent. Carl is an everyman (i.e. not a MENSA member etc) but he is definitely smart about how he approaches problems in the dungeon.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

This one is met. They both want to survive the dungeon. Additionally, Donut wants popularity and enjoys having control of her surroundings for the first time. Ergo, she negotiates with shopkeepers, plays to the crowd on the TV shows, etc. Carl wants to save the other humans so he puts himself at great risk to help the Meadow Lark group, the staff and residents of a retirement home.

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

The story is ongoing but the individual encounters involve intelligent solutions. The ramp / bunker / spike strips used to kill the Ball O' Swine being a prime example.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

There are clear rules. The rules expand as new encounters happen and new elements are added, but that's no different from any other novel. Authors typically don't start with a giant infodump on page 1 that says "Here are the precise rules of every spell that will be used in this story." The universe looks like it does for very sensible reasons based on interstellar politics and economics.

The one part of the worldbuilding that could be questioned is "Why is Borant mining a populated planet instead of the asteroid belt?" That isn't touched on but there are plenty of standard responses:

- Kill off young civilizations before they become threats
- In a galactic society containing quintillions (sextillions? more?) of intelligent beings, some of them are going to be cruel. Modern Europe and America still has a small number of people who enjoy dog fighting, so why shouldn't the future galaxy?
- You get the same amount of minerals either way but if you do the planet thing then you also make a gazillion space bucks off the reality show. If you don't care about non-galactic-citizen species then why not?

I'm going to juke point away from Carl to say that there is a *big* difference between small / foreshadowed rule expositions and throwing new rules in to immediately affect the plot in a major way.

WtC: Exclusions Zones? Foreshadowed from like the first chapter. Masterful use of an established rule to cause major meta shenanigans later on.

PGtE: Pulling a sword out of a stone to get a free resurrection? Literally what reason would anyone have to believe this to be a thing prior to it happening?

Is there an example of such a thing in DCC? Chapter 4 is the setting exposition chapter. One of th every first things we're told is that it's a reality show run by an AI and that there will be loot, some of which may come from viewers who really like you. Pretty much everything meta-gamey falls out from that. Specific spells are introduced as Carl and Donut level up; their mechanics are explained up front and then remain constant thereafter.

The closest thing I can think of is on the third floor where it's revealed that the AI may have 'fudged a roll' in Carl/Donut's favor but that was set up in advance when Carl was called the AI's bitch and told that it often happens that the AI for a given season will have a 'pet' Crawler that it both rewards and torments above the norm.

********* No it has not been a problem, to my knowledge, in DCC. It is a problem elsewhere, and could be a problem here if the author drops the ball. I juke'd it away from Carl there for a moment: It is occurring to me that too much of Rational as a genre and (ungenre'd) intelligent writing are identical. DCC is intelligently written. The world follows rational(enough) tenets. But the story itself is not disposed to rational discussion and therefore doesn't get the Rational genre tag for me.

I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that if the author doesn't give the readers a runway-volume of information to discuss their work in a rational way, then it does not deserve a Rational genre tag.

And to consolidate posts, because I was a twit and posted in a way that opened up a few threads between us, Carl's story can't be placed in the Rational genre in my mind because its story lacks that runway. Almost by definition, because it's a fast paced death game with massive structural changes each 'floor' the characters descend.

DCC moves by the introduction of *new* reader-unknown content vastly more so than the analysis of *old* reader-known content. That /skew/ in the storytelling is what I'm hung up on. The Rational genre tag, in my mind, requires a skew towards analysis of reader-known content over new content, or at least a greater volume of analysis. And DCC is a little too far in the story for me to believe that this will change.

There are other facets of the Rational genre, I'm not going to go nuts and claim this is the end all and be all, but explaining this one facet is why I bothered to write out this post.

It would have been possible to tell an interesting story about how Lucia Mar used her dogs and her viciousness to claw her way to the top, but the story would have had much less humour, much less problem solving, and even more gore than it does. It certainly would have been interesting to tell a story from Hekla's point of view, leading the Daughters, coping with her split from her husband, etc, and seeing how she was loaded up with magical gear to make her a powerful shield maiden. But I'm fine with getting a story about the guy who's running on clever tricks, shiny feet, and a hyperactive talking cat.

**** I found that pretty believable. For months after my father died I found myself getting angry at small things for no particular reason. Carl just lost literally everyone he's ever known aside from his cat and is being forced to participate in a snuff-film reality TV show. The impressive part is the fact that he's holding it together as well as he is.
