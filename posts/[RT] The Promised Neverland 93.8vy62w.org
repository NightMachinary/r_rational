** Huh. I must say it was kinda obvious that Emma would survive but I'm disappointed at the “power of friendship & determination ” explanation

*** I'm a week late of course, but I would argue "getting up for a few seconds to fire a single bullet, in spite of mortal injury" is well within acceptable bounds. That's the sort of thing that people do in the real world with some frequency. Not kids, of course, but it's already established these aren't ordinary children.

*** I'm not entirely convinced that it was "power of friendship" vs some kind of psychic thing. It seemed like Emma's determination wasn't enough--she was still sinking--until Norman showed up to lead her back to the surface and Mama pulled her out. We still don't know what exactly happened to Norman or Mama, and Norman in particular seems like a likely candidate to have obtained supernatural powers in that facility.

**** I don't think that it's likely that Norman would have developed supernatural powers since no powers that could potentially save Emma has been mentioned in the past. You can't introduce a completely new magic just to solve a problem without it being deus ex machina, at which point, you might as well just use “power of friendship”

***** The only other person we've seen come out of that facility can casually toss chunks of house around. It's not that much of a stretch.

** The little monkey demon thing is clearly Chekhov's pet and its going to be a problem in the future . Maybe I'ts smart enough to tell their enemies about what happened ,or just finding it will indicate other demons that Lewis is dead.
