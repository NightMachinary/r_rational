** /Chicago/ is an ongoing /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfiction, written Bavitz, the author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][/Fargo/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][/Modern Cannibals/]]. /Fargo/ was commonly viewed as rational on this subreddit, and there was interest in the sequel.

#+begin_quote
  Chicago's hundred Magical Girls, united under a theocratic Empress, plan to expand their territory. Except Laila, Chicago's bookkeeper. Cushy job, couldn't care less about conquest---until she's assigned to Chicago's invasion of St. Louis. Yeah, maybe this "Empire" thing's not so hot. Maybe it's time to get out. But the bigger an empire gets, the harder it is to escape...

Also, because it needs to be said: I turned out to be completely incorrect, /Chicago/ actually /is/ a /PMMM/ fanfiction, not an original work. In my defence, I was working off [[https://i.imgur.com/A11Ndd2.png][that tweet]].

** This looks interesting! Can you tell me if Fargo is stand-alone enough to be a satisfying read on its own? I have a bit of a thing about incomplete stories, I tend to binge stuff once it's done, or at least has a good stopping point.

*** Stand-alone from /Chicago/, or stand-alone from /PMMM/?

If former, then definitely yes. /Fargo/ ends conclusively, with no major plot arcs left unresolved, and only one plot arc of moderate importance (on which /Chicago/ seems to be based) left.

If latter... Well, it's a 336k-words-long story. I don't think knowledge of source material is really necessary in this situation. Every unfamiliar term could be understood from context, every unknown plot threat could be inferred in time, if you have enough general knowledge of the tropes. Tentative "yes". (First interpretation of your question is probably the correct one, though, so nevermind.)
