** "How long have you been acting like one of us?" Brilliant ending to the chapter. Love this story so much!

** Uh, anyone else getting the feeling that the story has ground to a halt? Feels like wheels spinning.

The past several chapters have just been people talking about talking, talking about negotiations and stuff. That can be totally interesting, but it just keeps going on...

*** I mean, considering that the universe runs on narrativium, all the talking IS action.

Also dude, how can you be jaded with those quips that keep flying? Such good banter!

TL;DR - No way dude, story is /booking/.

*** The talky bits are great and I have no idea why you'd think the story's ground to a halt, given that almost every chapter this arc has moved the plot forward.

Yes, sometimes Catherine Foundling moves the plot forward by diplomacy, but chapters like these are an absolute delight to me.

*** You didn't get enough action with the bonus chapter? It had a dragon and everything.

**** I am going to be really honest. I did not notice the extra chapter at the time of making that comment.

I am sorry. I got my fix of fireworks factory fun.
