So I was re-reading the story from the start and I found this:

​

#+begin_quote
  the gardens of Castel Chernwith, one of the old holdings of Uther Penndraig with plants yet living that were planted by his firm hand. The largest of these was a *juniper* tree, which had grown to shade a large bronze statue of the great *smith* Merschen Edel. It was here that *Uther was said to come from time to time*
#+end_quote

​

Was this a hint to Juniper Smith to meet Arthur there?

​

It's from [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/371606/plot-relevant]]


** I doubt it. During the Episode at Speculation and Scrutiny we pretty much see Arthurs Plan:\\
Should anyone of the old gang show up (though unlikely) Masters has a candle to be lit which will notify Arthur to get there.

The candle was lit during a crisis, Arthur didn't show up, presumably because he was already in that tube under what is now Fel Seed. I'm more worried that Arthur really is that most horrid of exclusions, which would kinda piss me of, since for all his flaws I really like him

*** I think this is quite probable.

On Earth, creation of Fel Seed was a direct consequence of Arthur's death -> on Aerb, Fel Seed is also a consequence of Uther's demise and Bethel's gonna obliterate what's left of him

**** What we know for certain is that Arthur has been in that tube ever since he left - Fel Seed came soon after. Though I'll grant there is some evidence for the theory (timeline matches, "you know his weakness", there doesn't seem an apparent reason why else he would be there for such a long time). With that said, it just seems too obvious to me. I also don't like the idea of "Hey, that friend you put on a pedestal and who you loved? The guy who was kind of a dick at times? The guy who saved Aerb a dozen times, brought it into the enlightenment, brought peace and order? Well, he is now the most evil thing imaginable, take that for clinging too hard to your flawed best friend!" And to Bethel: Should Arthur not be Fel Seed I think her obliterating him would go against her becoming more reformed and wouldn't fit the trajectory she is on.

****** Redeeming Arthur, reviving Fenn are exactly the tropes author aim to deconstruct. Either that will not happen or results will be disastrous.

******* I don't think you can make blanket statements based on authorial intent to write antitropes. There's plenty of tropes that aren't "deconstructed" and there's no indication I've seen that would say these two are off limits somehow. It's extrattextual meta speculation.

However, I could see Arthur choosing to set up a scenario that narritively requires another "pc" to intervene, such as creating fel seed as a final boss that requires a hero. The goal being to break the narrative cycle by bringing a final conflict to a head and thereby opening a way home, or at least to end this world

******** Especially given that WtC seems significantly more like a reconstruction of wish-fulfillment self-insert isekai stories than a deconstruction. Ultimately the distinction comes down to how a story ends, but for the time being a lot of the story's elements seem designed to reinterpret and justify tropes rather than to break them apart.

******* but Bethel was redeemed, twice even. Although maybe that actually deceases the likelihood that arthur is redeemed.

***** Yeah, I don't like the idea of it either. I didn't like the twist of Arthur raping Bethel either. I feel like it cheapens Juniper's own mistakes in the past, like dating Tiff while hiding it from Arthur, leading to Arthur pining for her up until his death, never having the chance to move on to someone else. Juniper felt so much regret about that and then he finds out that Arthur is a rapist? It just makes things too easy for him if the person he wasn't a good friend to suddenly turned out to be a bad person all along.

****** Or it makes it even harder for Juniper.\\
The person he wasn't a good friend too ended up getting ruined as a person the same way he ruined DnD for the rest of his group. Not only did you fail your friend, you created a world that slowly turned him into a monster.

***** I just assumed that Arthur saw the world as a story and decided that the only way to get out of the constant grind of being the main character was to become a completely irredeemable, one-dimensional, gross villain. Then, the heroic main character role would have to be taken by someone else.

** I didn't read it that way. I just read it as Arthur making a 'monument' to remind himself of a lost friend.
