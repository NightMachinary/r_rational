  Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

  - The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

This is not terribly complicated. It's Foreshadowing 101; the pieces are there before they are needed. Nothing is a true /surprise/ for the reader, because if you surprise the reader you damage Reader Expectations.

But what about the kinds of meta-contextual information widely-read readers bring with them into every story they read, their awareness of various tropes and plot-devices and ongoing speculations on all of their combinations?

I once read a story where, near the end of the first chapter, a character is introduced as a colleague of a protagonist's father. This new character had some four lines of perfectly innocent dialogue, but I still declared (out loud) when I read that part that "This guy is totally the villain" and I was proven correct many chapters later.

How do you prevent this in rational fiction? It was nothing about the character's attributes, description, or mannerisms which pegged him as a villain, merely /his position within the story/. He was an adult in a position of power who worked closely with a protagonist's father, and that was enough. Perhaps I made the judgement on insufficient evidence and got lucky, but the problem remains that the suspense failed to affect me after that realization.

It's a similar problem to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEscalatingThreat][overescalation]] where the story looses focus of its original goals in favor of bigger and bigger events. [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann][/Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann/]] did this right; [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill][/Kill La Kill/]] did not. When the world is doomed, the heroes have to win, right? Nobody ever pulls an actual Everyone Dies tragedy anymore (the next chapter of [[http://qntm.org/ra][/Ra/]] may prove me wrong on that point).

How can an author preserve the suspense and emotional impact when the readers go in with (explicit or implicit) goals of dissecting the story to discern the outcome? I'm not asking how to craft a convoluted plot, but how it should be done for optimal Drama.

High-powered sci-fi like /Ra/ or [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7562764-the-quantum-thief][/The Quantum Thief/]] go for the wow-factor to keep readers engaged over intricate characters, while [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/][/Worm/]] is a distilled and purified example of the superhero genre and actively denies or subverts many tropes in said category,

Or is unpredictability even an ultimately desirable trait as in end of itself? I don't think you can argue the merits of a well-executed reveal to the reader over their satisfaction that one of their speculations was proven correct. That seems to imply the best way to deceive a rational reader is to add lots of red-herrings and noise, which may just as easily frustrate a reader instead of entertaining them.

Thoughts?


** Optimizing drama is an interesting problem.

Stories are structured in a certain way because that way /works/, but also because humans enjoy pattern-matching. A subversion of expectations can really backfire for an author because the audience /likes/ to have their expectations fulfilled. Actually, more than that, I think that the audience likes to think "well, of course that's obvious in retrospect".

I think the best answer is to make multiple solutions to the end of the story. If the characters are really driven into conflict by their values, and no one is just "good" or just "evil", and they're more or less evenly matched, then it shouldn't be a foregone conclusion that one side is going to win, even if we see all the maneuvering that's happening. I'm trying to think of a story that I thought did this successfully ... /Death Note/ maybe? The characters are driven into conflict by their values, and the viewer for a long time really doesn't know who is going to come out on top. I'd also say the movie /Hard Candy/. Possibly also the television series /Hannibal/.

I'm currently writing a bit of Superman fanfic, and I'm at least trying to ensure that the conclusion is not foregone, so this topic is of interest to me. Even going into the final chapter, I think there needs to be more than one narratively satisfying possible ending.

Counterpoint: subverting tropes can make for good drama in itself. Not in a "I'm so cool and subversive!" way, but in the way that you build up the readers' expectations and desires, and then /dash them upon a rock/ and do something else. It helps if your characters have a rational reason to do something else.

Sometimes the right resolution to a plot point is to /piss the readers off/, but in an /intelligent/ way.

*** One possibility is having an ending that is both predictable and tragic but that the audience hope doesn't happen. They won't expect it because they think a plot twist will happen to save the day because otherwise it would be too predictable and this belief is reinforced by the desire for the plot twist to happen. Then they will be surprised that there wasn't a twist in the end.

Visual novels (or choose-your-own-adventures) can do this since they can have many endings.

** Tension feeds on uncertainty. If I, the reader, am certain, there is little or no tension, regardless of whether a mountain of fire is about to rain down on the protagonists, or whether they are shouting or crying. Sometimes you can maintain tension by making the reader wonder /how/ the mountain will be deflected, rather than wondering /if/ the mountain will be deflected. But for the most part, the more true (not theoretical) uncertainty you can maintain in the reader, the more they'll be driven to keep reading.

Example of this being done correctly: Worm.

Example of this being done /weirdly:/ HPMOR.

Example of this not being done at all: Traditional comic book.

I am an aspiring Fantasy writer, so I find these discussions very interesting. In my world, there is no 'genre savyness' as such, but the most important and well studied part of the world's history is a decades long war between ten villains with industrial scale laboratories and armies who did little /except/ trying to find new ways of getting at each other. So... at least as far as 'evil' and battle related tropes go, my main characters are familiar with them because they have read accounts of that war. They don't have anything like rationalist training going for them yet, but hey, we have to let the masterminds get a bit of a head start first, no?

#+begin_quote
  readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
#+end_quote

My work is nowhere near being published yet, but I have written 90%< of the first draft of the first book. This is something I try very hard to make sure I do right. It helps that I have two main characters I switch between, who have very different personalities, and often learn and pay attention to different things. So because they do not sit down and compare notes, there are several things that the reader could work out earlier than the characters do, and some the characters never work out at all, but which would give the reader more insight into what must have happened behind the scenes, if they do work it out. The hardest part about this for me is making sure I have explained how magic works clearly enough that the reader has a fair chance to realize that what seems to be happening is impossible, and somebody has to be lying.

I think making your character genre-savy is one solution and that's why HPMoR's Harry Potter is genre-savy.
