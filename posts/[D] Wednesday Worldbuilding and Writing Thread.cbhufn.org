Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Would anyone be interested in rational-ish Yu-Gi-Oh! fanfic? The card game battle format lends itself to exploring strategy, but the actual show tended to resolve everything with "Now I use this card the audience hasn't seen before, which does exactly what I need to win the game!"

*** it would be very interesting but difficult to pull off, I feel. There's a lot of problems to resolve about a realistic take on yugioh's world, starting with the logistics of Duel Monsters. Frankly, the card game really shouldn't be that popular unless it is liberally being bankrolled by Pegasus or Kaiba. You have the implication that the most powerful cards are only printed in extreeeemely limited runs (exodia and BEWB), but also that there are so many cards someone who lives in a game shop can be consistently surprised by them, but despite this is still considered a competitive game.

Still, I'd definitely read it if you managed it.

Being someone who plays various card games there is often a lot of uncertainty regarding whether a loss comes from choosing a poor strategy or whether just due to bad luck. Repeated games with the same strategy will solve that but only playing for fun and playing many different games I don't normally do that.

I think a story could be cool -- I'd throw out everything but the storing creatures in cards mechanic. To be properly rational, though, you're going to have to put some serious thought into how the world would be different with such cards (do the monsters exist outside cards?, how are they made?, how long ago were they discovered?, how does the government control them?, etc.)

** I'm struggling with this and have begun to realise why people don't write rational stories most of the time. I've talked about this here before but about a year ago and I'm going to whine again and see if I can think of an out.

Goal: I want my vampires to be able to turn into fast zombies and ALSO to be able to make zombie body doubles.

Essential facets of zombies I want: Relentless hunger for blood, mindlessness, no moral qualms with killing them (i.e. they are not "human" in any meaningful sense)

Good thing: The rules of My Vampires allows them to make body doubles like starfish make body doubles - they grow back from the severed part under certain conditions

Problem: Rationally, because of how brains work, the body doubles have to either be complete copies (down to memory) OR newborn babies (can't control themselves, flail around cutely)

Detailed explanation of problem: If a brain grows from "nothing", there's no reason for it to have a "rawr kill humans" zombie utility function: it's either going to be a "blank" brain (i.e. baby, doesn't have the neuronal circuitry to control its body), or a "snapshot" from some time (either when the severing happened, or when the human was turned, are the two obvious points). So either you have a useful but not scary body double, or a perfect duplciate of yourself who will not be "rawr zombie".

How I'd most likely do it if it wasn't Rational: Something about being a vampire, or souls, means that the vampire copy doesn't have a soul or whatever so it just runs on Vampire Base Instincts of find food (and I can't use souls as a gimme in-universe as My Supernatural Creatures all run on Sufficiently Advanced Technology)

Candidate Workarounds:

- I do already have vampires act in a zombie way if they're drained of blood (extreme hunger), but this means that the zombie would become a normal vampire when it's managed to catch and eat something, so it's not morally OK to kill them (it does make it, like, very horrifying to think about, though, which I like, but I feel like someone would have figured it out by the Present Day so the zombies wouldn't be around to be plot relevant)

- Have the doubles start out as babies but slowly work out how to walk / run / eat, so maybe it's harmless for a month or so but becomes a zombie later. It means that the vampire corpse in the basement all of a sudden attacks you two months later.

My favourite work around that I just thought of writing this post:

- If vampires run on Sufficiently Advanced Technology, the same fail-safe mode that activates during extreme hunger is potentially activated in a severed body part. Extreme Hunger mode isn't actually controlled by the vampire's brain like non-hungry vampire is controlled by its brain; the Vampire Tech takes direct control over the body to get food. The brain is a "baby brain" incapable of controlling the body, so isn't suffering or anything. The only problem is, the Extreme Hunger mode must get deactivated when the vampire isn't hungry anymore, so the zombie would presumably get deactivated after eating and become a "baby vampire" until it starved again and became a zombie. This is interesting and maybe a Feature; otherwise I suppose I could say that the Extreme Hunger mode is deactivated by the vampire "willing" control back or some bull like that.

Thanks, thread, for helping me with this. Any comments would be appreciated (especially how easily you'd swallow that last paragraph), but as you can see, this was mostly a "thinking out loud" exercise as it turns out.

This logic is only as valid as you want it to be. You'd be totay justified in saying that, idk, epigenetic effects in the vampiric genome cause a regenerated limb to create a crazed murder-brain instead of a docile baby brain.

Option 1: The vampire tech intentionally don't regrow brains to avoid identity crisis and instead uses a template brain, possibly with parts from a different animal.

Option 2: The vampire tech stores information about how to control limps/other non-personality related brain parts from the user in the DNA and rebuilds the brain with only those parts remaining intact and the rest being from newborn.

Option 3: There's a flaw in the vampire tech and it doesn't create a prefrontal cortex(or whatever part of the brain that stops vampires from always trying to feed)

Option 4: As 3 but instead of a flaw that removes a part of the brain, the flaw is instead that the part of the brain that activates 'Extreme Hunger' is too big or is otherwise broken/overly active.

Vampires /were/ originally created as a superweapon (and all the weaknesses are a result of people "hacking" them to make them less super), so the idea that the original way to create them was to get a freshly dead human, vampire them, and then cut the head off and let a "default" head grow back could work. However you'd assume that the "default" head would identify enemies somehow, so the indiscriminate zombie like hunger for blood is... less likely.

The whole zombie thing is an extreme edge case, so any of these could work, though probably the one that seems the most "default" would be the easiest sell.

**** IDK, I feel like hand waving and say "the vampire technology just works to give me zombies sometimes because Zombies are Cool" is kind of... the definition of irRational, if you get me? Like, as much as I want something to happen, if I can't justify it based on what vampires actually are, then it's not coherent.

I try to keep myself honest as I already have a few vaguely tentative gimmes (invitations, silver, stuff like that) and the more faithful the whole suite of powers and drawbacks can be to the premise, the better, IMO.

The best thing though is that you end up finding some really cool details and twists that follow naturally from what you end up choosing: like, the concept of the zombies being a fast!zombie until they get a meal at which point they flop helplessly to the ground seems novel to me, and would make for some interesting plot points.

I do get your point, though, but like I said above, it seems "cheap" to go "vampires can control their legs once their brain grows back for Reasons". The other thing is that baby brains do a lot of - I don't know I'm not a brain scientist - neuronal pruning, or something? And they're actually qualitatively different from adult brains in some way, anyhow. And since a vampire definitely knows what age it is when it grows back limbs/heads, it stands to reason it'd be an adult brain, which puts me back onto "surely they'd have a whole personality (maybe a brain scan from a good soldier?)" camp.

In the end I think the creators of vampires didn't think "what if the head was cut off but the body wasn't destroyed perfectly and then a week later the head grew back?", they were in the warmongering business after all and presumably were able to track their "fleet" and deal with them appropriately when they fell? Or they figured any fallen soldiers wouldn't be decapitated but killed by other means? Or they figured that their enemies would take them as prisoners and best to leave them unable to give military secrets? IDK.

***** If the Vampires had appeared randomly, yes, then it would make sense to base them on human developmental milestones. But if these Vampires were genetically engineered as apocalyptic war weapons, then it would make even more sense for them to be both able and willing to fight the instant their heads finished growing back (before, if possible). And the example of the horse suggests that this is a plausible way for an engineered newborn brain to be.

Sure, they won't be able to use martial arts, or any sort of decent fighting style; they'd have to follow the "hit it and bite at random" school of fighting, helped along by a good dose of berserker rage. You don't /need/ a whole personality in there, especially as whole personalities often do embarrassing things like form unions and petition for the right to vote.

In fact, ideally (from a weapon-of-war point of view) you want /all/ the vampires to be mindless, unreasoning beasts, especially those of newly-turned enemy soldiers; it's possible that the current strain has developed a few flaws along the way, and one of those flaws is that the consciousness of a person can survive the vampirisation process (if present at the time)...

wouldn't that mean that any injured soldiers you recover will start killing friendlies? I think once the brain is obliterated, either the enemy will destroy the body completely (due to knowing a vombie will result), or the friendlies will recover the body in which case it's a liability? IDK, it depends whether the friendlies are more ilkely to want to recover the body to use or whether the vampire is more likely to fall behind enemy lines

This is definitely something I've been thinking.

--------------

copy of my reply in the other thread since it's mostly relevant and i'm guessing that you're not going to see it otherwise:

--------------

The thing is the physiological developments of the brain involve neuron pruning and stuff to control the body - and also that memories and personality are also stored "physiologically". So, I guess if I had to summarise it, the issue is that the ability to walk/etc is a TYPE of memory (or memory adjacent) - and foals/etc are born with that "memory".

So if you say that a human brain grows back that has been pruned to control the body, then you are saying that the vampire technology stores the brain structure pre-severence to save the "pruned" state of the brain. In which case, why doesn't it store the brain with the personalities instead? (Maybe the society that created vampires had a taboo against duplication of minds, but I think part of this setting being Rational is occam's razoring these things, so adding an element of culture to an ancient society purely to let me have vombies seems excessive)

Like, you have these options for the regrown brains:

- Grows back with memories of original vampire (at turning OR at decapitation OR at least backup) - NOPE, has moral value

- Grows back with "template" memories of exemplar vampire (soldier?) - NOPE, probably has moral value, definitely is not vombie mode

- Grows back with no memories but with the ability to control the body - ??? - it seems more difficult to grow back a brain without the memories but with the ability to control the body, the old adage about mixing glass A of water and glass B of water together and then trying to separate them back out down to the last molecule seems relevant

- Grows back with no memories or ability to control the body - NOPE, can't be an evil monster

Yeah, though the lack of eyes will be a bigger problem - this is very much the "random flailing" school of attack.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes. Yes, it will.

Bear in mind, though, that a lot of the vampires on the battlefield are made from enemy soldiers, in the thick of the action. You do /not/ want an enemy brain inside your supersoldier's body, and you /especially/ do not want an enemy brain deciding who is friendly and who is not.

Think of war vampires as super powerful attack dogs - you drop them on the enemy and /really mess him up/, but you don't expect them to come up with anything in the way of strategy. He's a weapon, not a person.

I'm thinking that it grows with a default brain; that default brain is (like a baby horse, which it may have even been partially modelled on) able to at least manage basic limb control (though it's going to be shaky at first), hates anything that moves, is /really really angry/, and can probably figure out how to bite and drain blood after a couple of hours. (I imagine the ability and willingness to fight was considered more important than the ability to sustain itself).

IDK, I always envisioned vampires being made in a field hospital - surgery is involved. The reasons My Vampires have such low success rates in turning is because they are not able to replicate the surgical conditions exactly and are probably missing important steps.

That said, it raises a few questions:

1. Where did they originally get the bodies?

2. Why does the vampire-making goo only get potent after ~100 years of development in the body?

For #1, realistically we're either looking at the output of a hospital (you know... "do you want to donate your grandfather's body to the war effort?") or, as you said, fallen friendly/enemy combatants. Either way, realistically you're probably going to want to put a default mind on: as you said, you can't turn enemies into vampires and expect them to be on your side if you don't overtake their minds too.

Perhaps, as you suggested, the retaining of the original human mind IS a bug rather than a feature - in going with My Vampires being software that's got 100,000 years of built up bugs thing. It would also mean that the original way vampires functioned may have been the nanites holing up in the brain and just hijacking it while the consciousness watched helplessly, which is dark and I'm here for it.

So, maybe the "bug" is that the nanites can't go past the blood-brain barrier somehow? IDK. So... it does make sense that when the vombie head grows back, it has nanites in it, because the nanites are working to assemble it, so they're able to take control of the brain As Intended and become a weapon. But...... then you run into the opposite problem, which is that you expect the nanites to make a competent fighter (you know: strategy, ambush, etc, not zombie mindlessness). This plan ends up making them much further from a zombie than I'm comfortable with - they almost become a Horror Movie Vampire.

OK, let's go to #2: vampires propogate by getting goo out of their own stomachs and shoving it into a dead human. This goo gets more potent and thus works better after a few hundred years, but... why does it exist at all? I suppose if you assume your army is full of vampires anyway it's convenient to keep the goo factories inside the vampires, but why doesn't it make a potent enough good? I guess the idea would be to refine it somehow, or perhaps the stomach!goo is only 50% "of the way there" and the real magic happens when the gall bladder adds something to it in the small intestine?

Like:

*/proper way to make new vampire/*

1. Black Goo produced in stomach

2. Yellow Goo produced in liver, stored in bile duct

3. Black Goo and Yellow Goo mix in small intestine, producing Green Goo

4. Green Goo is extracted surgically and surgically put into Recently Dead Human Heart

5. Human becomes vampire very quickly

*/shitty way to make new vampire/*

1. Black goo produced in stomach

2. Vomit up Black Goo, put it in Recently Dead Human Heart by ripping open the chest cavity

3. Do a bunch of things afterwards to give the weak Black Goo enough time to work before the body decays

4. Human becomes vampire VERY slowly (I actually want My Vampires to take a year to ripen, so I like this)

You can say it's more effective in older vampires because perhaps the Yellow Goo or Green Goo builds up in the small intestine and some of it goes back into the stomach (a vampire was never meant to live 100 years, after all!). I wonder if this means the really old ones will sometimes just yakk it all up for no reason. Perhaps that's part of a reason they make new vampires: it relieves that horrible abdominal discomfort.

..... hmmmm, I can live with this. What do you think? (thanks, again, for being such a wonderful and reliable sounding board).

it does make me wonder if vampires have ever given each other autopsies (necropsies?).

********* So, based on your post, here is my somewhat modified proposal:

*Proper way to make new vampire*

- Black Goo produced in stomach. Black Goo is for body enhancements; it makes you faster, stronger, self-repairing, and allows very limited shapeshifting.
- Yellow Goo produced elsewhere (doesn't much matter where, liver is fine). Yellow Goo contains the personality, the memories, and, in short, much of the /mind/. Black Goo is designed to be inert unles provided with a Yellow Goo mind to work with.
- Black Goo and Yellow Goo mix in small intestine, producing Green Goo
- Green Goo is excreted from small intestine by natural means (far easier to get hold of the stuff than battlefield surgery) and thrown at the enemy. As soon as Green Goo gets inside the enemy (via mouth, nose, wounds, anything) enemy becomes vampire very quickly.

--------------

Both Black Goo and Yellow Goo are self-repairing and self-correcting; to a degree. However, modern vampires completely lack Yellow Goo.

Black Goo was mostly designed to be inert without Yellow Goo; but it has a higher priority than that, which is to keep its host alive.

--------------

*Modern way to create vampire*

- Black goo produced in stomach
- Extract Black Goo from stomach in any way you like (vomiting it up works). Black Goo is inert until activated; a human eating it will have no effect due to lack of Yellow Goo.
- Put Black Goo in Recently Dead Human Heart by ripping open chest cavity. Black Goo recognises that it is in Rapidly Expiring Human Tissue and emergency programming takes over; it begins to ensure that subject /survives/ (providing oxygen to the brain and so on). Subject is kept sedated, in anticipation of rapid arrival of Yellow Goo.
- Yellow Goo never arrives. Eventually, after sufficient time, an internal timer rolls over and a buffer overflows, causing the Black Goo to think it should be active. Vampire wakes up, retaining his original mind.

Since the Yellow Goo never arrived to overwrite the new vampire's brain, he retains his old brain. If his head gets cut off, he grows back a head that contains a brain that's an amalgam of his brain, his Siring vampire's brain, /his/ Siring vampire's brain, and so on back into antiquity; with the result that only the things all those vampires held in common are there (i.e. limb control), while the higher brain functions are an incoherent /mess/.

This implies that you might be able to go direct to Vombie by ripping apart the subject's head and putting the goo into his brain instead of his heart (but I have trouble seeing why anyone would want to do that).

I like black + yellow = green = proper vampire mixture, and the... rectal delivery mechanism (WHY DIDn"T I THINK OF THAT), but I don't think I like the chimpanzee school of warfare that's implied (... vampires are meant to be sexy and it's not very dignified). I think your description of the modern vampire creation process is really good, too.

I do ike the fact that your vampires don't have the Yellow Goo any more due to a bug (or maybe, a Jurassic Park style "feature" meant to avoid reproducing in the wild - turns out life, uh, finds a way). However, I like the fact that under my most recently posited system the yellow goo builds up in the intestine, backs up into the stomach, and then creates dilute green goo in the stomach that can be used for vampire creation in an old enough vampire. I feel like this answers the question of why older vampires have better success making babies, and why the success rate is so low. HOWEVER, I don't like the obvious fact that you pointed out which is that if the vampire is able to will herself to poop (or just vomit and give herself an enema and mix the resulting fluids), she'll be able to make super potent green goo and given that rubbing fermented piss on your body is something people today think cures cancer I'm sure a vampire tried it at some point in 2,000+++ years of recorded vampire history.

And my decent-layman knowledge of the digestive system doesn't give us any real way to do it. The digestive system doesn't like working "in the wrong direction" for obvious reasons. The stomach-intestine divide is pretty strong because of the acid and all.

So the only way I can think for Black Goo to get more potent over time is it ferments, or there's just /more of it/ over time. So I think you're right in that, if we assume Yellow Goo exists, it is no longer produced by vampires (or maybe is produced in the gall bladder but never released, if we want to leave ourselves open to sequel hooks).

I /love/ the idea of the Vombie brain being the "base state" brain of all generations of Sires, because that gives you basic bodily functions (walking, but probably not very gracefully: perfect vombie) AND the hunger for blood (since they'd all have the blood hunger).

Unfortunately, the chimpanzee warfare comes with the rectal delivery system. I honestly can't see the one without the other.

#+end_quote

This seems to be the biggest upside that you're finding in your system. I've been thinking about it over a couple of days, and I think I have a solution.

It involves having two sorts of Black Goo - corrupted Black Goo and uncorrupted Black Goo. Now, the vampires rely on having Corrupted Black Goo, because that is what allows it to work without Yellow Goo. However, under certain circumstances (i.e. when automatically resetting, in order to fix severe damage, or when creating more Black Goo) the Corrupted Black Goo can be factory-reset into Uncorrupted Black Goo. (This generally doesn't affect all the goo at once; only part of it). Over time, however, Corrupted Black Goo will eventually corrupt Uncorrupted Goo; but it's an incredibly slow process.

So, here's how vampirisation works, paying attention to this new divide:

- A vampire pukes a load of goo into a prospective vampire's heart. Some of this goo is Corrupted, some is Uncorrupted
- The goo picks up that this is a human heart in desperate need of repair. A whole bunch of the goo gets factory reset (into Uncorrupted Goo) and then starts rebuilding the heart.
- If enough of the goo remains Corrupted, then it starts slowly corrupting the Uncorrupted Goo.
- If there is a high enough percentage of Corrupted Goo in the new vampire's body, he awakens. If not, he just... never wakes up.

This way, the higher the percentage of Corrupted Goo in the sire's goo, the better the odds of success in the Turning... but at the same time, certain wounds (like cutting open a vampire's stomach and spilling a lot of the stuff) can set him back along that path by a decade or two.

If I'm understanding it correctly what you get is that the zombie is alternatingly in a crazy frenzy killing machine and lying down drooling(babies learn to crawl after 7+ month), depending on whether EH is on or off? I like it. It feels natural if the Vampire Tech can override the persons actions directly and it's natural that you would have the full Vampire Package including EH despite not having a full brain. I should point out that in this case the zombies does have some moral value, they can be taught to be real people by a dedicated handler, however a reliable and steady supply of food is needed. There is a chance though that people wouldn't know this as it's a health hazard to have even a docile zombie around.

What happens if vampires feed on other vampires? I feel there is a certain connection between that and some mental change.

Exactly that - but I think they won't be learning to crawl because the adult brain physiology is different from the baby brain physiology and (probably?) can't learn this sort of thing (though actually I think they've taught adult monkeys to control robot arms with their brains, but those adult monkeys are adults and can think/reason/move other limbs, so it's not a direct analogy).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If we say that vombies learn to crawl after 7 months, talk after a couple of years, etc, then yeah, they have similar moral worth to a newborn baby: and I'm kind of in the Peter Singer camp that a newborn baby in itself doesn't have moral worth until it reaches a certain (very young!) age, so this doesn't bother me. If we say vombies aren't capable of learning due to Brain Science Which I Don't Understand, then they have negligable moral value.

Fun fact: if this ends idea up shaking out, and it looks like it does, vampires with body doubles keep them staked in coffins (i.e. immobile and in the dark and probably in the quiet) until they may be required (usually to fake their own death). Even if they're in ExHun mode, I have to imagine this would not be conducive to turning a "newborn baby" into anything resembling a mentally healthy "adult". It was actually a way I was considering handling the vombie issue - giving them the Memories at Turning and the zombie behaviour is just a consequence of them having gone insane from such a long period of isolation. Though, now I think about it, if a vampire is buried in, say, an egyptian tomb and is let out after two thousand years, once she eats I want her to be "normal" (but probably a little off) - so probably the staked state is more akin to sleep than sensory deprivation. A pity.

#+begin_quote

Hmmmm. Let's quickly go over the way vampire feeding works: the vampire pulls out the human's blood and at the same time deposits their... "pee" i guess... back into the human: a bunch of dead blood cells as well as waste products. Mechanically I'm not sure how this works: perhaps there's a reason there's two fangs, one in fang and one out fang?

So, let's say hungry!vampire!Agnes feeds on full!vampire!Beatrice. I imagine that this will make Agnes feel less slightly hungry and Beatrice feel significantly more hungry. If Agnes was full and Beatrice was hungry, I'd imagine Agnes would actually overall feel about the same level of hunger but Beatrice would still probably be worse off.

Ordinarily, vampires don't really notice this, but someone who was crippled, then healed of their injury, and then immediately turned into a vampire would require no adjustment time (I'm not sure if becoming a vampire heals injuries in itself, but if so, this would be highly relevant and probably be the reason for it).

When a vampire is beheaded, what comes back lacks memories but is still wired as a vampire, meaning that yes, it's kind of a blank slate baby, but it's a blank slate baby in the way that precocial animals are, meaning that it doesn't need to spend years learning how to walk or anything like that.

So if you say that a human brain grows back that has been pruned to control the body, then you are saying that the vampire technology stores the brain structure pre-severence to save the "pruned" state of the brain. In which case, why doesn't it store the brain with the personalities instead?

Like, you have these options for the regrown brains:

- Grows back with memories of original vampire (at turning OR at decapitation OR at least backup) - NOPE, has moral value

- Grows back with "template" memories of exemplar vampire (soldier?) - NOPE, probably has moral value, definitely is not vombie mode

- Grows back with no memories but with the ability to control the body - ??? - it seems more difficult to grow back a brain without the memories but with the ability to control the body, the old adage about mixing glass A of water and glass B of water together and then trying to separate them back out down to the last molecule seems relevant

******* I'm suspicious of the idea that humans are uniquely bad at passing down ancestral memories. Why would would we be worse than basically every species at "remembering" to walk?

Instead, it seems likely to me that 'walking knowledge' is hard coded into the structure of an adult animals brain, along with a general map of their body.

New born humans are special in that we're effectively born "premature" so that our heads can fit through a birth canal. A consequence is that our brains take longer to get to their adult shape (and thus unlock the knowledge that comes with this). Once we reach the adult shape, I'd assume that we have at least as much "innate" knowledge as a crocodile or a chicken.

And I'd address "regenerating personality" by saying that regeneration knows the genetic layout of a body, but not environmentally determined specifics.

So, if I lose a hand, I'll regenerate 5-fingered hand. But I won't regenerate any tattoos or scars.

Personality and sapience might require experience to develop. But stuff like walking or throwing objects is probably close to hard coded.

** This is a brainstorm post for a system that I refined based on prior feedback.

The world is split between the physical and the plane of ideas. When humans think of a thought, the brain converts biological energy into power that goes to the corresponding idea in the idea plane.

Ideas the world in a way that is defined by the idea. For instance the idea of a chair doesn't do much and just keep building up power. The idea of the western bastardized version of karma(do good things and the universe rewards you) actively affects probability in favour of people who have a 'good karma score' and decides on what 'good' is by referring to the idea of 'good' in the idea plane. Gods exists and have a pseudo-consciousness that is determined by the idea of them which they use to take actions. The idea of 'wizard' can be tapped into if one conforms to one of the wizard stereotypes(strongest are ancient wizard(gandalf etc.), and flamboyant and young(Dr. Strange etc.))

There's a lot of things that go into how strongly ideas can affect the real world but important contributors are internal consistency(how 'focused'/'narrow'/'clearly defined effect' an idea is), how much the ideas effect deviates from the baseline world, the current power reservoir, and the inflow/outflow ratio(how much is the idea being thought about versus how much energy is drained from the energy).

Intuitively we might think that love have a really strong power level, however think about how much 'true love' is supposed to fix and you'll see that the outflow is pretty intense.

What ideas would you think would have a very high power reservoir? If you were in this world and you wanted to draw power from the ideas by creating a new idea that connected to an existing ideas power reservoir(like Karma connects to Good/Evil) what would you cook up?

For the first, it's extremely rare for a character to truly escape one once a chase scene has initiated. For the second, it's also rare for a chased character to actually come across someone who could help them while being chased, unless it's someone who already knows they may be in danger. Consider it a “don't notice this” aura that is difficult to overcome if you don't already know the victim is in danger, with additional bonuses towards cutting phone lines, locking escape routes, running out of battery, etc.

That second isolation ability is what would make them especially dangerous. And here's an interesting thought: do you think that governments and companies would start creating secret pseudo-cults, worshipping very specific gods and rituals to try to influence the stock market or provide beneficial divinations without having to share that influence for other purposes?

Mind control is to a large degree countered by the very strong idea of 'Freedom' and there are other probability manipulation ideas around(such as the western bastardized version of karma)) that might counter the probability manipulation part. Nothing comes to mind that would counter the improved skillset though. Thank the gods serial killers tend to be rubbish at actually fighting.

In fact I imagine that this was how gods started out. A single organization could create an idea that would give some power but it can hardly compete against just tapping into one of the existing ideas, such as using Tarot cards when you are about to make a major purchase.

Even a mere modern printing industry can make an imaginative author very powerful very quickly, by churning out cheap but popular novels.

** I had an idea about a possible rationalisation of The Skylark of Space, by E. E. Smith, but I'm not sure I'd have a high enough level of physics knowledge to do it properly. The premise is that the protagonist discovers a metal that, basically, catalyses the conversion of matter - specifically, copper - to energy, in a somewhat controllable fashion. Thus, a nearly unlimited energy supply. So far, so sci-fi.

Naturally, there's a megacorporation that wants to kill/neutralise him and monopolise his discovery to revolutionise power generation and make themselves rich. But most of the story is about him building a copper-powered spaceship and meeting/befriending/fighting aliens. Missed opportunity here.

Now, what I'd be interested in is a divergence from a relatively early point in the story, where his girlfriend is kidnapped (to force him into a deal) in a copy of his spaceship, and in her struggles, she accidentally triggers the engines at full power. In canon, apparently the floors and chairs are "special" designs and the result is simply that everyone passes out until the ship's power is depleted and its acceleration slows. The protagonist chases after them, they all end up far away from Earth, etc. Clearly this part is bogus, since there is no possible way to design a floor that would let a human being survive the kind of acceleration that is described. The girlfriend, the villains, and the pursuing protagonists (assuming that they attempt to use a similar level of acceleration) would all be goo on the floor of their spaceships.

So what I'd be interested in writing is the perspective of a staff member back on Earth, who has been given the job of taking the available samples of this wonder material and redesigning their power plants. Knowing that the previous researcher working on this managed to vaporise his entire neighbourhood, and the company's best expert on the subject was on one of the spaceships (because he's the hero's nemesis, that's why) and is therefore presumed dead. The difficulties he faces in making the reaction controllable at all, working out the best way to turn it into usable power (would steam turbines still be the best approach?), dealing with management expectations, and above all, experimenting without destroying the planet.
