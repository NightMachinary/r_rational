** This chapter fell a bit flat. I was confused for a bit about the Hot Springs / Sound village thing. They were used a lot next to each other so I was initially of the impression that HS was the main city of land of Sound, or something, and had to reread once that stopped making sense. Seems sound is a new village that's taken over some HS territory, is that right?

But most of all Naruto and Sasuke are holding the biggest idiot ball here. You want to respect his 'I might die but if I live I'll be stronger?' Okay, but what reason you have to believe its true? Just the word of a stranger that conveniently knows a lot about your powers? That might be in character for canon!naruto, but is jarring here.

*** I thought it worked well. Naruto was panicking about alienating Sasuke and did not think the situation through properly and Sasuke never had half a brain when it came to "free" powerups to begin with. It's still idiotic of course, but believable nonetheless.

*** I don't like how it reads either, it doesn't /feel/ realistic, but it probably is about right.

Psychologically you have several biases in play for both of them.

Orochimaru is playing the trustworthy friend to kabuto's suspicious character, think of it as a form of God cop bad cop.

Sasuke has been given a very valuable gift for free, the sharingan he is obsessed with, so he now trusts snake face way more than he should.

Then his new benefactor is honest with him about the risk of the cursed seal (but only partly, presuming it still carries the other side effects) which again builds trust.

Finally, this person he trusts has used it himself (apparently, presumably a lie) so he clearly thinks the risk is worth it. Add in the story they /happened/ to overhear about a young, short chunnin beating several jounin at once...

As for Naruto, in this story he is riddled with insecurity. He describes them all as loners, like he is trying to see similarities between them. Projection, or something.

He is constantly trying to tie their team together and make a family it seems, because he hasn't had any before. He gives away power for free, despite knowing how valuable it is.

And he had also fallen for the small risk/big risk set up by orochimaru.

I think the characters as written could do this. It just reads like they are being silly, because they are being gamed and each have psychological weaknesses.

**** I dunno, Naruto is actively trying to convince Sasuke not to try it at least for part of it; "why do you think it's even going to do anything if it works" is such an obvious question, ugh.

Oh well. The story goes on.

In a team, power is more valuable when shared. If teammates are more powerful, it might lead to you not dying.

***** I agree, but the young Naruto seems to be rationalising when he takes that position, to my mind. His underlying motivation seems to be insecurity.

****** Well, it paid off massivley in the newest chapter.

Sure, I'd agree, especially when he was all for illegally teaching kagebunshin to his team.

******* It has paid off /if/ Sasuke doesn't get corrupted by the seal. Which he put right on his frontal lobes.

*** They should have just reported everything to Kakashi before going for awakening of the sharingan.

After that, Sasuke was hooked for easy powerups.

** Maybe I'm too used to seeing Hinata stutter through every other word in the stories I read--but, until this chapter, I was assuming that she didn't have her canon shyness because I hadn't seen anything to indicate otherwise (stuttering, smiling only weakly, shrinking in on herself, etc.). Maybe it should've been made more apparent earlier?
