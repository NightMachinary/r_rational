** Eh. I think Egan's main problem is that he can't write a good villain because he can't make himself believe, internally, that they have a point. All his bad guys end up caricatures.

Pretty good Turing Fuck Yeah story though. (TFY)

*** I see most of his stories as basically villainless, this one included. I don't see Hamilton as a villain, but as an essentially noble adversary the main characters are unable to save.

**** Fair enough. All I can say is, he reads as a caricature to me.

***** I agree that the story doesn't do Lewis justice. I actually think that even though most of us disagree with his views on religion, a lot of his work is worth reading because, surprisingly enough, it often deals with biases, the ways we deceive ourselves and other things rationalists like to talk about.

** The story starts a bit slowly but ends up being a fascinating historical hard science fiction story. It's an older one, but this was the first time I'd read it and I was impressed.

*** If it's good, do you think it should be added to RationalReads? I'd do it myself, but I rather not just add stories when there is someone who has read it and can evaluate it's worthiness instead of me just deciding from the summary.

**** I'd say probably yes? Though some of his other work may fit better. I posted /Bit Players/ a while ago and that may seem like more representative of Egan. Though this almost reads like a Turing alt history fan fic which may be fitting.
