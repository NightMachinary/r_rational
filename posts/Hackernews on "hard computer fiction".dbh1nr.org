  Works recommended but lacking confirmation and/or review

  The Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown

I can save them the trouble.

Comp-Fi score is /maybe/ a 2. (The US government built a machine with literally a million processors, so they can decrypt anything! Someone put a virus into a message being decrypted, so the machine got infected!).

Which is to say, Dan Brown knows as much about computers as he does any of the other subjects he writes about in his novels (e.g. the virus in /Inferno/ which, as described, would wipe out the human species in ~20 generations, rather than saving it).

*** Well that's not... an inaccurate description of how a lot of viruses work. I mean, yeah, there's a bit more to it, you have to exploit a bug in the system (e.g., buffer overflow) in order to inject the virus and give it execution privileges, but ultimately, a lot of hacking is about maliciously crafting the input to the system.

(I haven't read the book.)

**** It gets worse. The method that the hacker supposedly used to make it uncrackable was a virus which constantly re-encrypts the file so that the encryption code is constantly changing. That description got the NSA to turn off their antivirus so they could attempt to decrypt the file. That's how the virus infiltrated the system in the first place: the actual encryption on the file was negligible, and it loaded the virus from there, which then infiltrated other secure systems on the NSA network by "eating away at the databank's security" so that it can be accessed publicly. At one point, a "security expert" sets a password to, and I'm dead serious here, the number 3. Just that one digit.

President Skroob could be hired as a security consultant for the NSA and it'd be an /improvement/.

** Both the discussion and the link they're discussing are worth talking about. The [[https://fiftysevendegreesofrad.github.io/hard-comp-fi-fiction-list/][link]] explicitly mentions rational fiction. It mostly covered stuff I'd already heard of, so I figured I'd make the HN comments more prominent.

** Something that's not on there but which I would heartily recommend is [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083DJXCM][/The Cuckoo's Egg/]], which is 100% hard computer storytelling because it's a true story of a thing that actually happened, and the sneaky espionage / counter-espionage that a sysadmin and a hacker got in to against each other.

*** I second this; it was a great story just as a book, and being all true is icing.

** The top level comment mentions the Bobiverse as something "absolutely loving attention to detail regarding both software and physics sci-fi concerns".

I have avoided Y Combinator so far, is it always this silly?

*** Y-Combinator is the most start-uppy of start-up communities. It's actually an incubator, I think, where start-ups are products intended to demonstrate viability for investors and be sold-off as quickly as possible. Hacker News is a decent site for topic selection within an extremely narrow range and worldview, for better or worse.

**** That's pretty off. Y Combinator is an incumator, but new.ycombinator.com is a forum community. [[https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html][The Guidelines]] say:

#+begin_quote
  On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.

  Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.
#+end_quote

I've found it to be full of useful information and perspectives. There are usually experienced experts from many fields there weighing in.
