** How crack does the crackfic need to be? And can I use my own stuff (and is it wrong that my own stuff is my favorite, since it is /exactly/ calibrated to my tastes)? Screw it, I'll do it anyway. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Lex Luthor from Metropolitan Man]] gets dumped into [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/][my crack/slash epilogue of HPMOR]].

Lex Luthor is sucked through a portal, and ends up in the far-off future of the year 1991. The world is a new and confusing place; technologies that were theoretical in the 1930s are now the sort of thing that only old people use. Lex has been deprived of his vast fortune, his invaluable assistant Mercy Graves, and the bulk of his knowledge is out-of-date. He goes to the library to find information on what's happened, and finds that the entire world is not what he remembered it to be. There is no Metropolis; New York City has taken its place. Lex greedily searches out references to Superman, only to find that in this universe, Superman is a fiction, as is Luthor himself.

He spends the next few months trying to rebuild his knowledge and his wealth; identification has become much more difficult in this new era, and knowledge is the domain of specialists rather than the generalist that Lex had always seen himself as. He's intelligent though, and driven by the desire to understand the gulf between the universe he'd been in and this new one. He takes over one business, and then another; the technologies have changed, but the backroom deals and pressure tactics largely have not, given that people are still people. There are exciting things happening in the world of financial securities, and over the course of seven years, he propels himself to the top.

Still, there's something missing. There's no big problem to be solved; there are no aliens here. The very laws of physics seem to be different, as they would never permit something like krypto particles. Lex reads the comic books, and they make his past life seem foolish. The accumulation of power seems pointless; it has nothing on the importance of saving the world from Superman. All that changes in 1998 when Lex falls ill with lung cancer.

He makes a study of his disease. He learns everything there is to know about it. He brings in the best specialists, and oversees new and exciting research. None of it does much more than slow the progression. His comic book counter-part died of cancer, and Lex wonders if this is a joke the universe is playing on him. Then one day, he makes a miraculous recovery.

Lex does not believe in miracles.

His people want him to be thankful. Instead, he's suspicious. He makes a study of spontaneous remission. He gathers logs from hospitals, under the guise of an interest in healthcare. It's natural for him to assume that his opponent -- and he already thinks of this phenomenon in those terms -- can watch him at every moment. It takes a cluster of top-of-the-line computers and complex mathematical models in order to find the pattern. The enemy is smart, his tracks have been covered, but there is still an unmistakable sign. The enemy understands statistics and how to make a pattern appear random, but the fact that the enemy is trying to accomplish his goals means that there is some leakage of information.

Lex Luthor finds his first wizard in the spring of 1998. By the time summer comes around, he is ready for war.

***** I'm not an intellectual property lawyer, but I am an intellectual property enthusiast. Let me preface this by saying I don't really have an interest in taking this any further, which would make it a non-starter. And *tl;dr:* No, it's not "legal". But if I did want to do it ...

Legality is a tricky thing. In some alternate universe where I made a Kickstarter in order to write "Lex Luthor and the Twilight Masquerade", there are a couple of possibilities.

1. Kickstarter/Indiegogo/Gofundme shut it down right out of the gate because it violates their Terms of Service or they have the legal right to pull it. I don't know that any of those explicitly prohibit fanfic, but they could shut it down anyway with no questions asked.

2. The project gets funded, I begin writing a story/novel/novella, I get a C&D from either J.K. Rowling, Warner Brothers, or DC Entertainment (or, technically, Eliezer Yudkowsky). Either I violate the C&D and we go to court (see 4) or I stop writing. If I stop writing, the TOS of all those sites probably demands a full refund, and this resembles option 1 except for having wasted time and possibly money.

3. The project gets funded, I write the story/novel/novella, and I get a C&D. I stop hosting it on my website or anywhere else, stop all promotion of it, and never mention it again (or ignore the C&D and we go to court, see 4). It's still out in the world though, so mission accomplished, unless they want to sue me anyway, in which case, see 4.

4. I wind up in court, against a very large law firm. If I'm lucky, or happen to know someone who knows someone, I get representation from the EFF or similar. Almost certainly this would be an ideological case rather than one intended to secure earnings; court costs would almost certainly be higher than I would expect as a payout on such a niche book. The primary argument for dodging copyright:

   - The story I have written is /transformative/ in a way that has artistic merit and does some good for society. It does not diminish the originals in any way, and does not deprive the original creators of income.

   That's the whole argument. If the court buys that, then we're good, I've won the case, and I'm free to continue distribution until the inevitable appeal. If the court /doesn't/ buy that argument, we're considerably less good. The work gets taken down and out of distribution, there are legal costs, etc.

5. The project gets funded, no one sues me, we're good! Ideal scenario.

But like I said, I have no real interest in the first place, aside from all the legal issues involved.

****** Alternate thought: is it alright to /heavily suggest/ donating to your Patreon account, by outright stating that those donations will directly translate into you writing more IP-infringing works?

In that case, you're not making money /from the works/; you're being given gifts to go on being you, and you are a person who happens to make those works.

I'm pretty sure that as long as you /don't/ outright state the connection, everything's good, especially if there's other creative outputs the you have besides the IP-infringing work. The key question is whether you can actually say out loud "if I get sufficient donations, I will /be able to/ continue work on [IP-infringing thing X]", or whether that has to remain implicit.

******* The question isn't "is this legal or not". It's:

- Would anyone notice?
- Would I get a cease and desist?
- Would I honor that cease and desist?
- Would they take me to court?
- Would I have to settle things with them in an arbitration process in lieu of actually reaching court?
- Would I be able to win in court?
- How much would winning cost?

Specifically with regards to "I'm not being paid for this, /wink/," that's not really a new area of the law. Prostitutes do this all the time; the john pays for "time", not for the actual sex, but there's an understanding between the two that sex will be involved. This doesn't have that good of a record as far as fooling the police or the courts, because the justice system is made up of people who are capable of the same logic.

I don't think that having a Patreon or similar up disqualifies you from writing infringing works, but I do think it has the potential to draw someone's eyes towards you, and since infringing works are already of dubious legality, it could result in a world of trouble. Remember, the "legal or not" distinction separates out into a bunch of other questions, and it's not so simple as saying "this is totally legal" because if you're going before the courts you've probably already lost (unless you win big enough to cover your legal costs).

(And again, I don't really have the interest in the first place.)

Close analogy, but what we're really talking about is (the arts equivalent of) a /sugar daddy/ relationship---the sex and the money are exchanged on different time-scales, rather than as a 1:1 transaction. I've never actually heard of someone being pursued for participating in such an arrangement.

And yes, I didn't quite mean "is this legal" so much as "is this able to escape notice by being seemingly above-board to the relevant parties, such that companies with a history of pursuing IP claims don't bother to pursue people who are infringing in such a manner."

********* The thing is that you can get a C&D regarding your fanfiction even if you didn't earn a single cent and didn't intent to earn any money either. It's just that most IP holders don't care to go through the hassle of sending out C&D notices and/or following through with them when it comes to mere non-commercial fanfictions. Only most though. There have definitely been cases in which IP holders successfully stopped instances of fanfiction.

  The Obliviation Problem had been troubling Hermione for a long time. In short, it was possible for a wizard to do whatever they liked to a muggle without regard for things like consent or ethics, and then erase all their memories of it after the fact. This made it nearly impossible to realize there had been a crime at all. Under the old regime, the response had simply been to shrug and say that these things happened, with the unspoken agreement being that it was practically a victimless crime. Hermione had reformed the Department of Memory Modification over the course of three months (/Hermione Granger and the Amnesia Codex/), but that left every other wizard on the planet to deal with, and the only real stride that had been made towards stopping the problem had been letting everyone know that Hermione Granger took that kind of thing seriously. Eradication of anti-muggle crime seemed impossible short of panopticon surveillance or making every wizard take an Unbreakable Vow, neither of which were currently practical.
#+end_quote

The "we're doing this for the good of everyone" line is what I would expect out of the wizarding department of public relations. The real reason that memory erasure is legal is that muggles have very few rights in wizarding society (which was the case in /HPMOR/ as well).

And even if you break the Statute at great risk to yourself, wizards are still in charge. They have all of the power and the will to use it for their own ends. If you're Lex Luthor, are you going to trust a handful of quasi-medieval people led by a trio of seventeen-year-olds with nearly infinite power? Especially given how they've acted up to that point?

(And add to this the fact that Lex is working with incomplete information, almost by necessity.)

Edit: If you want, the alternate ending is, "By the time summer had rolled around, Lex Luthor had secured a position as Defense Professor at Hogwarts."

The detection of underage magic has to already imply some similar mechanism exists for enforcement, no? Even just making every usage of memory-manipulation magic cause an automatic report to the DMLE would be enough to disincentivize bad behavior, I'd think, whether they're currently /doing/ anything with those reports or not.

*Lex attempts to acquire magic, through employing wizards or purchasing magic items.

*Send in the obliviators

*Lex is prepared for said obliviators. He has empirically tested them, hiring people to signal awareness of magic, then having other people spy on them from far off, observing the inevitable obliviation process. If he can't fight the obliviators off, he at least has backups of his knowledge and plans.

** I had to reread TVTropes' entry on crack!fics to remind myself of the particulars, and... there aren't too many that I'm particularly into. About the only two I really like are EYudkowsky's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover]] and the multi-authour [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops]] . Of the two... I think I enjoy the latter more; for one thing, there's so much /more/ to enjoy.

As for my favourite (aspiring) rational character... I've got to admit that I have a certain fondness for Bunny of S.I.

So - Bunny wakes up one day in her own past (probably when she was pulled out of cryo), and gets to live the rest of life again, until she dies. And then again. And again. And then she wakes up and things are a little different; some of the talking ponies claim to have been repeating their own lives for many, many loops.

Bunny, naturally, assumes she's gone insane; but the framework described does continue to match her experiences. She has millions-or-billions of loops to look forward to while the computer running reality gets fixed. She's probably going to get crossed over into what she knows as fictional settings in some of them. Nothing she does has any lasting effect, save on herself or any loopers (or sysadmins) she meets. And she's started to get a handle on the more likely ways she can die.

"And the best thing, the very best thing of all, is there's time now... there's all the time I need and all the time I want. Time, time, time. There's time enough at last." (Her glasses break) "Oh, come /on/. Fine, I'll go hit the age zone to get my eyes replaced first thing. Maybe /this/ time I'll live long enough to find out when the Second Singularity will hit, so I'll know how long I've actually got to work with in any loop..."

OK, so we've got Skitter adventuring her way through a chain of increasingly "higher" universes, picking up companions along the way. I imagine she'd achieve godhood in a few of them, considering, um, her ability to break even the most innocuous-seeming power.

**** I would fully support doing the next gen kiddies (altered sanely, of course) as the focus of a sequel. Maybe even keep one of them as local-Sakura's kid. Remember, Salad's mom isn't a demi-god herself, but she would have gotten the skills dump from meta-Sakura. And local-Sasuke could still be Salad's absentee father, because fuck the set of all Sasukes everywhere.

Drop one or more of the kiddies into the ongoing meta-loop along with the adults, but not in direct contact with them. Start with Salad going off to find her father and dying almost immediately to a mysterious foe. And then again. And again. And again. She thinks the key to ending the loop is finding her father. Remember, she's cursed already, so she's making some bad decisions. She's also already awakened her eyes' first level, which is a Bad Thing.

I think dropping three or four of the kids into the same loop-zone would be a good change from the original, too. Just have the big scary three as background godlings in the metaverse and their local copies as slightly better off canon versions. Would take a little while to work out the butterfly effect of Sakura not sucking during the Chuunin exam, but it should make everything work out better for her to literally have her own deity looking over her shoulder.

The canon ninja war likely wouldn't even have happened with a competent and literally blessed Sakura helping keep Sasuke from going evil, but that doesn't mean the curse on the world is lifted. The big bad is the still ongoing fight with the forces of evil, of course. Something little ninjalings can't really fight off. And you'd get a chance to have them run into the super trio every once and a while, as they are dimension hopping themselves, putting out fires and trying to use the loop to find more answers.

I think this makes breaking the Uchiha eyes demon curse the overall goal, and "big bad" for the story being the demon realm itself.

** The entire crew of the Impossible from EY's "Three Worlds Collide" wakes up to find themselves in the world of "Shiny and Blue" a shockingly well-written, funny and heartwarming Harry/Dumbledore time travel fanfic that I read several years ago and only vaguely remember now. The wizards in the department of mysteries notice the strange fluctuations in the spacetime continuum that mark the arrival of the crew shortly after Harry arrives in the 1957, and some of them are captured under the charge of "violating the international statute of secrecy." When they're interrogated under veritaserum by representatives of the International Confederation of Wizards, it is believed by most that they are crazy and therefore unlikely to be a threat to the statute. But a few of the smarter ones, (including Tom Riddle) realize that they are muggles from a world with "magical items" but no wizards or witches, and are of course horrified, believing that the muggles of the TWC earth had somehow exterminated all of their wizards and witches, like witch burnings on a global scale, and with the "magical" weapons that these muggles had with them on their "ship" when they arrived, it was entirely plausible. He also realizes that the alternate humans have an indefinite lifespan. Fearing for the safety of wizard kind from muggles, Tom Riddle researches a bit about the muggle world, discovers nuclear weapons and the internet, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before the statute of secrecy is broken permanently, and the only way to save the wizards is to take control of all of the nuclear weapons before the muggles can use them. Harry "Crockett" and Dumbledore try to stop Tom Riddle, while the crew of the Impossible is trying to figure out what to do. They don't have a way back to their home universe. If Tom Riddle successfully takes over the world, the global quality of life for muggles and muggleborns will significantly decrease, as will the quality of muggle science, technology and education. But if Tom Riddle doesn't take over the world, then the nuclear weapons would still be a threat to wizard kind, and the crew of the impossible of course can't use the imperius curse. Meanwhile, Harry "Crockett" and Albus Dumbledore are still teaching at Hogwarts when they're not fighting Riddle/Voldemort or seeking out his horcruxes. I'm not sure how they do it, but a plan is thought up by the ex-confessor (not sure of his name) to try to figure out the key differences between this earth and their original one, and if it was possible to adapt some of the methods used for saving their home earth for the one they are now in.

Also, is it weird that I'm rather unsure whether I want to ship Akon with the ex-confessor or not? If it weren't for the centuries of age-difference, I might think they could be kind of cute together...blehh. I can't believe I just said that.

Also, you can read "Shiny and Blue" here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny-and-Blue]]

It's a surprisingly great read, and I highly recommend it. It's kind of long though.
