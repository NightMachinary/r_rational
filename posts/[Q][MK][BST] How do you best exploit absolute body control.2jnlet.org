So I have this power I am working with a character having. Virtually absolute body control.

Specifications are:

- It obeys conservation of mass.
- It is literally an unending number of nanoscopic telekinetic tweezers.
- Every change requires conscious concentration. It has a limited capacity for functioning autonomously.
- It includes full, constant awareness of everything inside body.
- It is slow. Healing a cut in the back of the hand takes an hour if left on autopilot, or five minutes of constant attention.
- It is limited by the users knowledge. One has to know the transformation is possible, and have a clear goal in mind before the power starts supplying guidance.
- It is not possible to become grossly inhuman, in any reasonable time-scale. Either mentally or physically.
- Damage done to the brain is generally irreversible. The tissue can be repaired but the information is lost.
- Severed tissue loses control property.

Mental self-editing is go, and it has built in safeguards against messing yourself up. It will readily supply guides for how to do just about anything.

So far I have thought of:

- Perfected physiology: strength, cardio, breathing, bone density, reinforced tendons, myelinated nerves, more connective tissue, no diseases.
- Cerebral maturity, (character is 15 years old,) for improved empathy, etc.
- Little to no sleep required.
- Improved productivity, by editing away how mental fatigue accumulates.
- Improved memory.
- Intelligence enhancements.

What else is there?


** I can't answer this question unless I know what the character wants. Also, you should look up Sandersons laws of magic. “A character's weaknesses are more interesting than his or her abilities”

I've actually written a full length novel with a main character who has a similar, though much weaker power. He could self edit, but only at natural speeds. So for example he could regrow a limb, but it took a couple months for the flesh to grow.

He did many of the obvious things, of course. Upgrading touch until he could feel the footsteps of opponents, upgrading hearing until he had sonar and could hear heartbeats, upgrading smell to be better than a dog, upgrading taste until he could taste poison, things like that. He could put half his brain to sleep at a time, and so never sleep again, but it caused him to act oddly (Dolphins actually do this).

I explored the way he invaded everyone's privacy. There was one moment where he started smelling blood everywhere, then he realized it was menstrual blood. He could tell if someone was pregnant with a sniff. He could generally tell if someone was lying. Knew people better than they knew themselves.

I explored his ability to self-edit. He could make himself feel euphoria. He could orgasm with a thought. Could wire head himself at any time, for any reason. Could remove any pain or trauma. Magic in this world was tied to your emotions, where stronger emotions gave you more power, so he would make himself insane with rage or pain for short periods, then wipe the memories.

That said, all the best tricks were for specific opponents. At one point he was fighting vampires, so he changed the circulatory system so that major veins were deeper in the body, and what blood he did have was less useful to them. There was a fortress surrounded by a moat of poisonous gas that he needed to break into, so he made himself able to go for long periods without air. He threatened to become a typhoid Mary. There were people that used mind control, so he created a second brain (He could only use the brain for short periods, as otherwise it would overheat. Brain produces huge amounts of heat).

The entity that he got his power from was even stronger. It had turned all its enemies into giant worms that were immortal and exquisitely sensitive to pain, then turned them loose. The worms felt everything as pain, which caused them to thrash, which caused them to leak poisonous blood, which burned them even more, which caused them to thrash even more. The end result was that an entire ocean was poisoned and full of giant insane monsters constantly trying to kill themselves by attacking anything that they thought could threaten them. The entity also saved the brains of people who were exceptionally skilled or unique in some way, then gave their abilities to itself. It created a giant clone army, star-wars style, made out of half a dozen supremely skilled and loyal fighters.

But seriously.

#+begin_quote
  It includes full, constant awareness of everything inside body.
#+end_quote

Awareness does not equate to understanding. Unless you have a body OS already installed, or a masters in medicine or the like...

Actually, that sounds /seriously/ distracting. See brain enhancement notes, below.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Little to no sleep required.
#+end_quote

Nope, sleep is not a well understood effect, and might be structural to your huge humaniform brain.

Your...your mind /is/ still running on your brain, right? No way that isn't safetied. So too little sleep == damage. If anything, you'd be *less* able to intentionally miss sleep, as that might count as damaging and engages safeties.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Improved productivity, by editing away how mental fatigue accumulates.
#+end_quote

Right, but again: how /exactly/ does this work? Unless your body control works on magic, or has instinctual or automatic elements, this won't work without a greater understanding of neuroanatomy than the vast majority of people actually have.

#+begin_quote
  Improved memory.

  Intelligence enhancements.
#+end_quote

Same issue, just more so. This is your /brain/. Safeties engage the moment you try to make it "better" with some abstract, pop-sci thing you came up with.

--------------

What I've got:

- Muscle fatigue disappears as recovery times and repair becomes instantaneous. You can run your body forever, any way you want.

- Not bruising or bleeding for significant amounts of time.

- No more coffee, as you can control attention and focus after reading up on what common drugs do to affect your systems and replicate this (carefully) through trying the drugs, then trial and error to get the same effects.

- Unaging, as all decay is stopped.

****** I see two problems: overheating and short-term energy supply. Overheating comes from the increased activity. You can't eliminate heat just by shifting things in your body around.

Short term energy supply: increased activity means increased energy use. ATP is in extremely short supply and hard-limited by how fast you can recycle it chemically. Oxygen supply can be increased by forcing away diaphragm fatigue, but the alveoli already have nearly the maximum possible surface area and haemoglobin already has a near 100% affinity for oxygen. Once you run out of oxygen, you go down anaerobic pathways for energy. They are less efficient and accumulate cell-damaging acid in the muscles and blood. You character can't control chemical reactions, right? Then this is a weakness.

******** I was thinking mostly in terms of the character wanting to exert more effort or run faster... Humans produce lots of waste heat, yes, but it is short bursts and released for long after the exercise is over. To exceed your limits would mean to run against your body's capacity to regulate its internal temperature.

You see, the body is mostly a bag of water, and conduction of heat from the muscles to the blood, and from the blood to the skin, and from the skin to the sweat and air, is mostly done through aqueous conduction. Water is a poor heat conductor. There are limits to how much heat you can remove from the muscles over time.

The longer it goes on, the worse things get. The core temperature builds up, meaning the difference in temperature between muscles and the blood lowers.... Thermodynamically, lower heat difference means less joules can be transferred per second. Also, as the muscles heat up, the enzymes move outside of their optimal efficiency temperatures. Each mole of glucose you provide will give you less energy. It goes downhill from there. Your breathing is limited by how many times you can pulse the signal to the diaphragm per minute... Long story short, you won't be evacuating enough CO2. Its much more of a problem than providing O2. Once CO2 starts building up in the blood, there ability to regulate your blood's acid levels decreases. Enzyme efficiency is affected by your blood's pH too.

So while your character can push herself to her limits, she's going to run headlong into chemical barriers.

What I suggest is that she carries drugs and solutions with her. While a regular person would die from a litre of basic solution being pumped into them, she would be able to control her blood vessel pressure and osmotic pressure so that she could make use of that injection to quickly act against acidosis. A human would be greatly damaged from 100g of glucose being released directly into the blood, but she could artificially increase her insulin levels in preparation for the injection.

There are many things she could do like that. A regular human cannot prepare their body for treatment, while she can force her body into a short-term lethal situation in preparation of outside intervention,

** Er...if you're saying that you have total and complete control over a human sized bundle of mass down to the nano-level then there has got to be some better defined limitations in place here (or at the very least, an extreme rigor requirement for the language used to program the mass) because at this point I think it's harder to talk about what /can't/ be done.

As in literally - name almost any random thing which doesn't grossly violate the laws of physics, and we can probably figure out a way to accomplish it..

In other words, if you want to write a hard munchkinproof fiction you've got to start from something more well-defined. You can't start with intuition-driven nano-tweezers or you'll end up with rational! [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryb9IIiB100#t=6326][Tetsuo]]. It sounds like you want the powers to stay body-themed, so we should probably BST a set of premises which remains mostly within those constraints.

If you can control everything in your body down to the molecular scale then breaking down cellulose into base sugars should allow you to eat very little of almost any plant, and you could create useful artificial chemicals, such as tritium, or nearly anything if down to the atomic scale.

** Depending on what means "grossly inhuman", Alice (let's call her that) can alter herself pretty efficiently. For example, it may be possible to duplicate her brain (hide it inside the body, so nothing actually gross). She may then tinker with it (always keeping "backup" for safety), for example optimize it for performing rapid calculations and controlling of her ability, thus increasing speed to conscious levels (already x12 or even better if optimization worked). This may also make sleeping redundant (there are papers on sleep being mandatory to cleanse the brain).

Alice should study biology+chemistry, and study HARD. If she finds good scientists (who won't vivisect her on the spot) she can provide them alot of answers about human body. Also, with dedicated team, she should be able to engineer and craft different specialized self-replicating bacteria (and that's what Panacea should be doing instead of inefficiently healing people one-by-one).

Actually, depending on exact mechanism of "gross" limit, it may be possible to craft and eject "parts", designed to combine into "flesh golem" (working completely on regular biology). It may be possible to make this flesh golem Intelligent, Friendly and self-replicating. I don't need to tell what it means, not in this subreddit.

** You can (probably) become a lot stronger/faster if you have complete control. There's something called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor][governor theory]] which posits that there's something in your brain that stops you from using your body to its full extent. That comes on top of making your muscles stronger/faster/better, which you're presumably already doing.

You can remove pain, obviously. You'd still want feedback of some kind, but there's no real point in making it something that you can't ignore, or which debilitates you (stupid body).

Can you change gender or physical appearance? Or is it basically just at the limits of what a person could plausibly do without any power (badass normal)? Can you alter your DNA? If you have that level of control, you could clone yourself pretty easily. Or just turn into a cloud of spores. Or take over a person's mind. Depending on whether there are any limits, you would get into really crazy stuff.

You could study your micro-expressions and control them in order to become a really good liar. A polygraph would never work on you.

You would never need birth control again (or conversely, could get pregnant pretty much at will).

#+begin_quote
  The *central governor* is a proposed process in the brain that regulates exercise in regard to a neurally calculated safe exertion by the body. In particular, physical activity is controlled so that its intensity cannot threaten the body's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis][homeostasis]] by causing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)][anoxic]] damage to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia][heart muscle]]. The central governor limits exercise by reducing the neural recruitment of muscle fibers. This reduced recruitment causes the sensation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_fatigue][fatigue]]. The existence of a central governor was suggested to explain fatigue after prolonged strenuous exercise in long-distance running and other endurance sports, but its ideas could also apply to other causes of exertion-induced fatigue.

** Being able to grow new brain tissue (so damaging it isn't a problem, and you have unlimited tries) as well as locally and selectively disable immune response, and maybe small muscle clusters for generating electric current like those eels and such, would make brain machine interfaces trivial. Possibly to the point where it's more like growing an organic USB port.

There are a /bunch/ of ridiculously potent toxins with the exact formula know as well as being easy to make yourself entirely immune to once you know it.

Lots of systems are really only limited to conserve energy, going on full power only in rare emergencies. With a bit of tinkering you could get the thinking speed and strength of split second emergency response, constantly and without most of the downsides, for example.

Take that, and if you beef up your lungs and heart, add a coolant system (wich may very well be partially technological, extremely energy consuming, or at the very least rely on filling up on liters and liters of ice cubes), and disable safeties on damaging things you can repair easily, you can soup things up even more.

Temporarily turning of boredom, warning signals, induce hyper-focus, hunger, etc. means you could work like a machine singlemindedly on a single task for weeks just sitting in the bathroom with a laptop and a glass. Then you eat a lot.

** Is it limited to cellular control? For example, if she were to eat the eye of an animal that has ultraviolet awareness, could she "understand" the eye, and modify her own to get ultraviolet vision? I doubt it, since eating would destroy the eye before it's considered "hers." But there may be a way to bypass that limitation. Something like skin-grafting, maybe?

Another idea: by consuming small doses of poison, she should be able to get immunity very fast, and maybe even get to synthetise it. A deliver mechanism would be more difficult to develop.

Elsewhere you said that severed tissue does not retain control. Did you consider the case when a severed limb is still alive? Like, rapidly implanted into someone else, or modify some of her cells to become virus-like and "infect" other people, to tag them. Maybe even giving limited control over their physiology (releasing hormones or painkillers to boost allies, for example.) This would easily spiral out of control and become too powerful, so to limit it, it may need a lot of concentration, having to fend-off the host's immune system constantly.

I think many uses would be chemical-oriented. I'd started making the liver bigger, since it's the chemical factory of the body, to have more to work with. Besides liver-things, I wonder if she could control the gas exhaled in respiration. Some kind of killer-kiss made of pure CO2 or pure oxygen?

Also, she has lots of intestinal bacteria to tinker with. But the delivery mechanism is the problem. I guess you don't want her flinging poo.

As far as delivery mechanisms go, we humans are fairly limited. Besides spit, what else do we have? Lots of ideas here, but they would require some major modifications. That's were my "eye" idea at the beginning would be required.

Another way would be to further the perfected physiology to beyond human, while retaining a human shape. For example, pre-programming reflexes. A reflex signal goes from the hand (for example) up the arm, to the brain, then back. If she modifies the nerves on the hand, creating some sort of mini-brain to control it without needing to go up to the main brain, response times would be vastly improved.

Or she can just modify her brain to give herself telepathy and control over bugs ;)
