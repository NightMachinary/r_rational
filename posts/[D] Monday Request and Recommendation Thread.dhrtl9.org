Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm currently out of completed webfiction to read. Before I get into even more serialized web fiction (The Good Student is going to be my next target), does anyone want to recommend *completed* works of web fiction or web serials (or other free digital text-based content)?

Doesn't have to be rational fiction. I've read and am currently reading plenty of stuff that isn't.

--------------

Full, /finished/ web serials I've finished so far, roughly in descending order of length (if anyone's interested in any of these works, I can give little reviews of them):

- Wildbow's works [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], and [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] (all mostly rational)
- [[https://towercurator.wordpress.com/][Void Domain]], "modern magic and demons" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://entirelypresentingyou.wordpress.com/][Entirely Presenting You]], "what if only one person had superpowers, and they took Taylor's approach?" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://twistedcogs.wordpress.com/][Twisted Cogs]], "what if everyone with powers was a Tinker in Renaissance Italy?" (Not especially rational)
- [[https://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], "what if Harry Potter actually made sense?" (extremely rational)
- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]], "what if kabbalistic Judaism was right?" (Not at all rational but very much worth reading anyway, like Terry Prachett)
- [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]], "what if your superpowers depended on fame?" (Rational)
- [[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], a rational-ish approach to what magic might look like in the modern day if discovered (Mostly rational)

  - also, most of the rest of qntm's miscellany

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]], Superman, but from a rational Lex Luthor's perspective (Rational)
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/][Post Human]], an AI slowly becomes self-sufficient following the apocalypse that wiped out humanity (Rational)
- [[https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/][Interviewing Leather]], a muggle reporter's perspective on supervillains (Rational)

--------------

Stuff I'm currently up-to-date with and actively reading as it comes out (for no other reason but than to provide recommendations if anyone wants them), in roughly descending order of update frequency:

- [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][Practical Guide to Evil]], "what if the world literally ran on stories" (rational)
- [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]], the sequel to Worm (mostly rational)
- [[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]], an Isekai except the protagonist decides to run an inn instead of be an adventurer (not very rational)
- [[https://tiraas.net/][The Gods are Bastards]], a take on high fantasy as the industrial revolution begins and the age of adventures ends (somewhat rational)
- [[http://inmydaydreams.com/][The Legion of Nothing]], a fairly standard superhero serial (not very rational)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], an Isekai except the world is made from the protagonist's RPG ideas (rational)
- [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]], a rational take on the story of Pokemon Red/Blue
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], wherein the protagonists munchkins the hell out of the Groundhog Day time loop he's stuck in (rational)

*** since you seem to like superhero fic, I'd recommend Super Powereds by Drew hayes. Now, it used to be fully available on the author's website, except he took it down to sell it on amazon. However, you can still access the entire series through the way back machine here - [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170606031105/http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/spy1/p]]

and you might need to leap forward a bit in time to catch the 'book' of it, which represents year 4. Because by the time the author was finishing the story he already put year 1 up on amazon I think....

Basically super powereds is about a superhero training academy. not particularly rational at all, but likeable characters + interesting powersets + decent ending makes it a solid superhero story imo.

It follows Jordan, a mercenary without powers but with a quick wit and peak-human fitness, and his sister who is a cape, as they try to find their place in the post-apocalyptic multiverse. If Taylor is a biased narrator, then Jordan is an unreliable one. He has several kinds of brain damage, and occasionally forgets people or events.

**** It's short and sweet. A scifi webnovel about an AI trying to become self-sufficient and rebuild humanity after an apocalypse has ended it. There's a fair amount of introspection, and the whole thing is well-written, but I don't feel like it has as much of a cohesive theme beyond examining the question of what really /defines/ humanity. Threaded through it is a story about the AI's human past, that doesn't feel to me like it connects with the rest of the story well. Regardless, it won't take more than a few days' worth of your time and it's worth reading.

** Are you interested in space, complex simulations and 5+ hour boardgames? Meet [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172737/high-frontier-third-edition][High Frontier]].

Assemble a working rocket with [[https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580360/high-frontier-third-edition][components based on real patents]], paying mind to mass, thrust, fuel efficiency, thermal cooling, market availability, and future space manufacturing. Fly around the [[https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580365/high-frontier-third-edition][solar system]]with its many available routes while tracking your delta V.

Stake a claim with your robonaut; build a factory, and start upgrading your rocket via awesome space manufactured components. Then its time to get /real/ science going: fly out to the gas giant moons or kuiper belt, get a proper Lab and promote your human colonists to their transhumanist counterparts. Maybe you want to shape the future by producing a mini black hole? Or you'd like to emancipe the robots? Or colonize other stars and send out a beehive ark? Send out a gas giant with a fusion candle?

So obviously this is very much rocket science and not for the faint of heart or time; BGG complexity weigth is 4.75/5. You learn it by playing in order: introductory game ->base game->advanced game->full game. If you are the type to get hooked by it it will get you completely.

Once you have mastered space flight, the competitiveness comes from intense bidding on cards and even space combat. It is a physics/solar system simulation after all and the map isn't really balanced since it tracks what we know of the solar system.

There is a Tabletop Simulator module which works surprisingly well; and if you'd like to I can teach it to you there.

In case you'd want to get a physical copy, there will be a kickstarter for 4th edition coming up on 24th of october, during Spiel 2019 in Essen - the biggest boardgame convention in the world (which I will attend).

So in conclusion: I really recommended this game, but you have to be a heavy boardgamer AND spacenerd to enjoy it.

Word of caution, it's written by an author who also writes really awful NSFW fanfic. While this one is "clean" enough for Spacebattles, which is quite restrictive, he still makes people uncomfortable with the topics he touches on, like Taylor's father as a teenager being interested in her, the excessive lesbian shipping, or the entire raid on the Fallen "parahuman breeding" compound, which is where it got too much for me personally

** I started a new series, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni][Palus Somni]], that popped up on RR a few months ago, and it's really good. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. There's something very chilling about the world the author puts out for us. A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. Things are okay at the moment, but you've always got the impression that they're living on borrowed time, that whatever affected the outside world will one day find its way inside their walls. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.

Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

#+begin_quote
  [A handwritten note that hangs on the refectory door, yellowed with age. The delicate, neat lettering is still legible.]

  Beware the walking beasts, my children, for all shall be lost if you are to antagonise them.

  Do not ignore this letter, and make sure all are aware of these rules for I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone who does not follow them. Harriet - I am trusting you to make sure that this news reaches the Nocturnes.

  These are rules that all acolytes must follow, for the safety of everyone in our community, and of our very souls.

  1. Cover all light sources at night, nary a single candle for your work.
  2. Keep away from the windows. They have eyes.
  3. Do not rely on the shutters being closed, act as though any small movement can be seen.
  4. Do not make any loud noises. Or any quiet noises that cannot be helped.
  5. If they see you, stand still and stay silent.
  6. If they see you, pretend to slumber. They do not harm the sleeping.
  7. If they see you, do not run.
  8. If you run, you will perish.

  Follow these instructions, and we shall be safe.

  Do not fret without me my dears, I will return soon once I have gathered the needed help.

  Yours with God,

  Mother Superior

** Need help narrowing down the list of recommended 'rationalist' fiction that is listed on the wiki. I'm primarily looking for books with a heavy emphasis on what I'll call "protagonist vs absurd environment/culture/society". I don't actually care if the book is truly rational, I just like the satisfaction/munchkinry that seems to come along with this style of book. Webnovels/unfinished works are fine to suggest as well.

Examples I've read:

- HPMOR

- Two year emperor

- Harry Potter and the Natural 20

I also find I get some sense of this from isekai/reincarnation novels but it's usually pretty muted.

Books I've read that don't fit the category:

- Friendship is Optimal

- A hero's war

- Worth the candle

** I recommend Moneyball (the movie) and Ookiku Furikabutte (the anime) as very munchkinny rationalist fiction although much of the effort of the characters of each goes into the narrow context of trying to win baseball games. I think they work less well the more you know about baseball, but if you're not a huge baseball fan then they should work well to scratch the ratfic/munchkin/optimisation itch. Both heavily feature trying to think their way through how to leverage lesser tools to compete with much more well-resourced competition, with Oofuri having much more time to go into a lot more depth on the actual thinking.

If you know of other sports fiction that functions in a similar way I'd be very interested, they're probably a bit underrated by ratfic fans despite them often being a good fit. Because the goals and rules are often reliably clearly defined and consistent (win and whatever the rules of the sport are + mundane physics, respectively), there's a lot of room leftover to focus on reasoning and problem solving to get to those goals within those rules. Not all sportsfic are interested in that but it can be great, pure ratfic when it is.

Fun in a different, bombastic way rather than rather than particularly ratficcy. It might scratch similar itches though for sure, depending on what things people are actually trying to get out of ratfic. Thanks for offering the rec.

*** To add a few suggestions to my own question...

Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. It chronicles the training and early life of Vaelin Al Sorn, who is a member of a religious militant order. It's a prime example of what I call "interesting competent people doing interesting things competently". The best part of this story is just reading in growing up and making his mark on the world. There are two squeals which aren't nearly as good and turn the story into a bog standard fantasy epic. While perhaps not technically a magic school, the protagonist does have a magic power he learns to use.

The Magicians by Lev Grossman. Pretty much Harry Potter as literally fiction, where the big bad isn't Voldemort but ennui. I rather liked the first book. The second and third were okay but I didn't enjoy them as much.

Red Sister by Mark Lawrence. Take thee to a nunnery! This story is a weird mix of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting is a distant planet, currently undergoing an ice age. But some rare people also have magic powers. The main character is a girl who is sold to a convent, except this convent in addition to training actual nuns, trains church assassins, warriors and holy witches. More down to earth than my description seems. Has two squeals. Again the first is the best but the second is also pretty good. Third was rather bad honestly and read like the author just wanted the series over.

**** I just read the first part of Micro Gates, and I feel that the engine design is way overcomplicated if I understand the gates correctly (I don't understand the described engine at all, I just accepted it as mostly meaningless technobabble). Another thing that wasn't answered, was how does the other side of a gate look like while there is a solid (or partially solid) opaque (or even transparent) thing inside the other side of the portal. Is it just black? White? A perfect mirror?

Simpler reactionless engine design: You can insert a heavy spring through each side of the portal, rotate the gate so each spring has both ends pointed in the same direction. When you put the spring against a wall, the spring exerts a force on the wall, but the gates don't feel that force, therefore reactionless drives. You can put this spring-contraption into a box. Now you can control the strength and direction of the thrust by moving the gates from the centre of the box to one side via any mechanism. This doesn't break the spacecraft's rotation in any way, no elements act like a gyroscope.

Another issue that was skipped over in the story was that as described, the gates should transfer sound, as that is just pressure waves in a medium. This would lead to some interesting design problems/secrecy issues. I also feel that the second side exploding once the ring is destroyed is downplayed too much, how can you provide a service using those rings if your entire "data center" explodes in a chain reaction once some guy accidentally breaks your device?

***** iirc, the gates are actually two-sided. The A and B side of one gate exit out to an A' and B' of the other. It's been a while since I read it tho so I might be wrong.

I can try to explain the original engine's design, hopefully a bit clearer. The principle is similar to your typical [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1pfeheZ74][Lenz's Law demonstration]] running in reverse. In words: passing a magnet through a copper coil induces a current through that coil, turning mechanical energy into electrical energy. Therefore, it follows that by passing a current through a coil with a magnet in it, the induced magnetic field will exert a force on the magnet. Due to Newton's Third Law, this also exerts a force in the opposite direction acting on the coil. Because physics is breaking due to the mass of the magnet teleporting from end to end of the coil, only the force on the coil "leaves" the system. Thus, you have reactionless thrusters.

And yes, one of the problems with microgates as a story is that the mechanics of the microgates are described very deeply... but in shallow breadth. Physical interactions with objects partway through a microgate, the transfer of vibrations through a gate, the terrorism potential of accelerating an object to 0.9c within two gates oriented vertically in a vacuum, and others are all glossed over.

****** I did assume the engine worked sort of like a railgun, using a magnetic field to accelerate a mass. I'm still not 100% sure where the momentum is coming from. That's why I came up with the springs idea, because it's clear where the momentum comes from, and it's simple (and requires zero fuel/power!).

I'm now partway through part 3, and I believe that portals that don't have a fixed orientation relative to each other completely break physics, and there isn't any real way to solve this issue in a story.

Going back to the spring-based reactionless drive idea, you can easily weaponize that by switching the spring to a big steel rod. You have two ends of the same rod facing the same wall, and when you push on the portals, you get little (if any) reaction, but the steel rod is being compressed to insane pressures, and will either punch through the wall and become a supersonic projectile, or explode due to the internal pressure.

There is also the issue of angular momentum. What happens if I insert a steel rod into the portal, and spin/rotate the other end? Can I use this to rotate a dynamo to generate net electricity?

If you tried to fix this "issue" by making the portal react to net forces pushed through the portal pair... That fixes only some issues but you need to define what a force "pushed through" a portal actually is. (this seems to fix obvious loopholes at first glance, except for things involving gravity... Or in fact any electromagnetic force that goes through the portal... or rather doesn't).

WAIT! Just had a sudden thought! You can create magnetic monopoles! We know electromagnetic forces go through the gates if given a solid medium (like a solid magnet, or an electromagnet with a core). This also completely breaks physics, and is somewhat documented in various sci-fi works.

Spoiler - FTL: I felt that the FTL travel/hyperspace was just extremely out-of-place. I feel that the author doesn't understand relativity at all. For example, there being one "true" reference frame, and that galaxy+solar system+planet spin and gravity wells add up to a meaningful time dilation factor, even if there was.

Spoiler - Flooded surface gravity: I found the claim that adding water to a planet would lower the surface gravity extremely counter-intuitive, so I did some of my own calculations... And I might have calculated the wrong derivative. I did it by hand, which took a good 15 minutes, so I didn't bother going back to correct the issue. I'd appreciate some /correct/ calculations with the GM/R^{2} formula, where M models a flooded planet of radius R

Yes, this becomes a big problem when applied creatively haha. For another fun application to think of, imagine a long steel rod affixed to some base. Drop a gate down the end so that all but the base of the gate is coming out of the other gate. Since all forces acting on the bar transfer to its base, you can move the entire thing as if it had only the inertia of the gate attached to it. Handle an arbitrary heavy rod like a whiffle bat! Anime sword physics! Reduce the effective weight of any simple body to zero without reduction to strength! Lots of wonkiness abounds.

I agree, the entire hyperspace part felt extremely forced in order to fit in future plot developments you will likely find to be even more forced lol.

******* Just after I posted the above I realized I missed the obvious.

Spoiler - Flooded surface gravity: I realized that you can model the dense core as an additional point mass (with mass reduced equivalent to density lowered by 1), which adds a force proportional to 1/R^{2,} to the pull of a sphere of radius R, which at the surface is proportional to R. This is much simpler to reason about, if we plug in a density of 3.39, then by flooding the planet with water we will LOWER gravity until we reach a radius 1.6845192 larger than the original. After that the gravity will start increasing again. Gravity will only surpass the original surface gravity when you increase the radius to 3.14898 of the original

****** I don't think you can actually accelerate an object with two gates oriented in that way. The object would feel an equally strong attraction from the top gate that it just fell through, making gravity between two portals very weak because it has to respect continuous boundary conditions. The resulting overall field strength might fuck up their planet's orbit though. Also a gravity vacuum cleaner is like the coolest thing ever.

Edit: There might be a workaround using 4 portals, but it would lower efficiency considerably.

Edit2: Also, even assuming 100 % efficiency with 1g acceleration at all times, you'll probably take around 2 years to reach 0.9 c

****** You're essentially trapping a particle in an increasingly small box with periodic boundary conditions. Assuming there's no resistance against bringing the things closer together, the thing goes boom due to infinite momentum. Possibly even forming a black hole if you're unlucky and have more than one particle or something to dump the excess momentum to allow for invariant mass.

I think my answer would probably have to be that you'd find it harder and harder to press the two together, until you overcome a certain point then it'd just collapse into a black hole and you never actually get to reach the point where they touch.
