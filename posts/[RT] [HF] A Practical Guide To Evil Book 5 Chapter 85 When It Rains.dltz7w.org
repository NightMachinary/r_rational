** Well, looks like Malicia set off her *Rule* bombs. I'm surprised that the Army of Callow's been subverted to such an extent, though I suppose I shouldn't be. Juniper was a given, and the core of them are Praesi; there are probably spies among them too. Considering the mass confusion and conflicting orders that such an event would generate, I suppose a third of the Army's officers being under suspicion would be expected.

*** Or Black and Scribe took back command of their Legion to prepare for the civil war in Praes, and Juniper tacitly allowed it. This would go against Cat's wishes, hence the self arrest.

**** I suppose that's plausible. The Legions leaving would mean that a change of plans is likely needed, and if Juniper allowed it, then she clearly can't be trusted to oversee it.

*** Citation from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/closure/][Closure]], for the others who (like me) had forgotten about this:

#+begin_quote
  “I have hooks in the minds of every officer of legate or above in the Wasteland,” the Empress said. “Your attempts to turn them were doomed from inception.”

  The other woman smiled.

  “A precaution to check me or the Carrion Lord, I wonder?” she said.

  Amadeus was not aware that she'd surpassed the limitations of Speaking, that much was true. By feeding her aspect of *Rule* into the act she could plant commands without ever saying them out loud, something not even Wekesa could reproduce. Maddie would be furious if he knew, but there were risks Alaya was not willing to take and twelve thousand men in Praes she did not control directly was one of them.

**** "Speaking" has always seemed to me like an incredibly broken and underused ability---I guess to make sense of things I've decided to assume that Amadeus and Cat almost never use it for fear of some sort of narrative backlash, because otherwise there's no explaining their behavior. Malicia's version is of course even more absurd.

***** "Speaking" only works on people who would already follow your commands. It just shortcuts the time spent convincing or intimidating them. It's not general-purpose mind-control. Whereas Malicia's seems to work on anyone she rules over.

**** Juniper and Malicia were both in Laure(?) at the end of Book 2. It's practically guaranteed that she'd have implanted orders. Hell, she might have even done it between Books 1 and 2, when they were both in Ater. Squire, who is already known to not be terribly loyal to the Empire, is given command over a Legion? Better put in contingencies, in case she starts getting ideas.
