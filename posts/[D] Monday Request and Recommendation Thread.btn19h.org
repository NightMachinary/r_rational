Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** It was recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b5bs7a/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ejctgpv/][a couple of months ago]] and it stayed in my backlog until recently, after reading the first book of *[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][Oh this has not gone well]]*, I feel like I have to strongly recommend /against/ reading it. I hope I reached any potential readers in time.

This is the worst case of narrative enforced sunk cost fallacy I've ever read.

The story always makes you think the slog you're currently reading is the prelude to the actually good part up ahead, i.e. first reaching the magic school, then claiming the old guild hall, and finally the war, but once you get there it's all over in a couple scenes with noticeable worse writing. It makes this story more harmful than it would otherwise be, since the day-to-day writing is godawful, with some of the most generic and flat characters I've ever read, but there was always the dangling carrot of interesting plot developments hanging ahead to make me keep reading, until I reached the end of the first book and realized it was all for nothing.

In retrospect, the author seems to solely use those parts of the plot as an excuse to write his self insert banging a bunch of fantasy girls, in fact I'm pretty sure he's been in five sexual relationships by the end of book 1. The fanbase encourages it, I've seen more comments about the shipping and encouraging sex scenes than I've ever seen about the munchkinry epic the story advertised itself as.

The munchkinry is another poorly handled area. It started out alright, with the protagonist merely introducing some modern metalworking techniques, and using mathematics and physics to measure spell efficiency, but soon you get the classic isekai trademark of a smartphone with conveniently infinite knowledge, and he introduces modern guns, explosives, even home appliances (he keeps the tech private though, so you don't even get to see the uplifting). In the end, magic munchkinry falls by the wayside.

I could /really/ go on, but this is still a recommendation thread so I guess I'll leave it there. To make this post somewhat productive I will mention the excellent and recommendable Mother of Learning/Worm/Naruto/Homestuck crossover [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.682117/][Conference Call]] just updated.

****** I had almost no prior knowledge of Homestuck before reading Conference Call. Mostly I knew that it has some level of absurdly advanced tech but not any details except a vague sense of dimensional shenanigans.

Not really spoilers but kinda: The Homestuck portion of Conference Call follows, as I understand it, a minor character who appears in one segment of the story who was popular with fans. It pretty much tells you what you need to know as the story goes, but you would probably /get/ it more if you're familiar.

Admittedly, the Homestuck parts are the least well explained / described because of both the viewpoint character and the complexity of that universe. This does produce the right /feeling/; that the Homestuck universe seems bizarre from the outside.

********* I assume you're familiar with [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] already since you're on this subreddit, but if not, that might be a good place to start. It's got a lot of 'applying rational-ish approaches to very odd magical/theological phenomena' stuff. Some more stuff that may or may not scratch the same itch:

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/13/chametz/][Chametz]] is a short story about a Jewish vampire.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20180101160950/http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html][The Last Temptation of Christ]], where the Devil tries a novel approach.

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/][The Study of Anglophysics]] is a short-ish story about a world that runs on anagrams. I'm throwing this in because it has a similar feel to the other two.

[[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/the-sword-of-good][The Sword of Good]] is a kind of deconstruction/inversion of classic fantasy settings through the lens of Effective Altruism. It's a lot more fun than it sounds.

[[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EKu66pFKDHFYPaZ6q/the-hero-with-a-thousand-chances][The Hero with a Thousand Chances]] - this is another fantasy-ish setting with a human main character and some rather unusual other characters that he deals with.

All of these, except for Unsong, are short stories. I hope you find at least some of them entertaining.

*********** The Hero with a Thousand Chances is about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle][Anthropic Principle]] (which is what the counterforce really is). Essentially, since the hero will only be summoned to a world which was not destroyed by the Dust, any world in which he is summoned will have survived past encounters with the Dust (but also not defeated it forever, since in that case he would not need to be summoned). A lot of the hero's quotes make a lot more sense in this context, especially this one:

#+begin_quote
  You are the walking dead, and this is a dead world spinning, and /many other worlds like this one are already destroyed./
#+end_quote

As such, the exact form of the Dust is irrelevant to the story, since it concerns itself more with the summoning of the hero than with anything that the hero actually /does/. Per Word of God, he originally intended for it to be some meta-level bias towards disorder that affected the future probability tree of the world (or something along those lines; I saw the comment about half a year ago). He did concede that that wasn't necessary in order for the story to work.

It's been a while since I've read some of these, so I'm not sure what you mean by the Jeni's Oil link.

*** Yudkowsky's book, Rationality from A-Z is probably the best starting point, and Philip Tetlock's Superforecasting is probably the best book on actually making good predictions. Thinking Fast & Slow is a classic, but also a lot of the results it cites have since failed to replicate, so a companion piece like Re-Thinking Fast & Slow is recommended.

I find game theory quite informative as well. I think there are a few high quality college courses on it that have been put on YouTube. Thomas Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict is good for going being the introductory stuff.

Beyond that, I feel like getting more rational is more about front better domain specific knowledge than it is about better understanding belief formation and decision making. Duhigg's Smarter, Faster, Better is more pop self help than hard science but it's reasonably well researched.

80,000 Hours Career Guide has a lot, lot of stuff that's generally applicable not just in professional life. Of particular value for me at least was Cal Newport's So Good They Can't Ignore You.

So far, the fic hasn't involved the Worm parts overly much, remaining almost an entirely original work, but it does spoil the end of Worm.

*** Here are some that are perhaps not explicitly progression fantasy, but where the protagonist is still actively learning magic, improving, and growing as a person.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30344847][Masters and Mages]] series - The MC is a second year student at The University at the center of the world, learning magic (and the sword, as a hobby). The last book is coming out later this year, so that's a bonus. The only bad part of these books is the trash-tier world map.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/257869-a-thousand-li][One Thousand Li]] series - This one is explicitly a progression fantasy, written by an author known for litrpg. I thought this guy's other books were barely mediocre, but this book is really good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Book of the Ancestor]] - A girl on a brutal, dying world is being taught martial arts, magic and spycraft. A great, tightly-paced trilogy.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49673-lightbringer][The Lightbringer Series]] - One of the two main storylines is about a teenager who finds out he's a type of mage that can create certain effects from light. Highly recommended.

Edit one more:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] - A man finds himself in a world where humanity is surrounded and constantly beset by dark, powerful creatures. This story is different from the others as the MC is a grown man trying to get powerful enough to get home, and the book is less about personal progression and more of a kingdom builder. The latest book was fantastic.

** I've recently finished the WormFic Tabloid and I feel deeply bittersweet. The Fic itself is well written, interesting, and well rounded. The portrayal of office life and politics is a high point. The characters are eminently believable, complex, with tight snappy diologue.

It is bittersweet because the story ends, and ends conclusively. Worm itself creates an amazingly potent world, with a ton of depth and breadth. Tabloid does a great job of filling out it's particular corner of the Wormiverse.

Worm was one of the first serial fics I ever read, before I discovered this site. I believe I made it through Arc 17 before throwing in the towel. I gave up because I found the story too angsty, too negative, too depressing. Every plan made, every step forward, seemed to be stomped into the mud and laughed at, while the helpless civilians die by the score. While the story was prolific, the writing proficient (or better), I simply didn't enjoy the pain and suffering depicted in the story.

It pains me to finish quality WormFics because I know that they are over, and that the main corpus is soooo much larger yet so much less enjoyable.

Is it worth it giving Worm another try? How about any of Woldbow's other fics? Are there any essential WormFics outside of Tabloid or A Bad Name?

*** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/][Glassmaker]] is something everyone who has tried Worm should read. The prose is something special, and the tone is way lighter. Also it's complete.

The [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]] trilogy is often regarded as an "essential" fic, because it is very true to the tone of canon, which might turn you personally off of it. I feel it has several more decisive wins for Taylor, though; you might find it more bearable.

Taylor's distorted perception colored the world darker than it actually needed to be, in my opinion. When Ward's main character looks back at her life in those days, it's way less dour. One interlude taking place in 2013 is downright sweet for a bit.\\
[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] has the opposite effect; objectively the world is even more of a hope-deserted shithole than Bet, but the main character is having /so much fun/ scheming and fighting and betraying and strategizing, it actually becomes enjoyable.

** I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost /designed/ to mainly have all those qualities, /sigh/. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate.

Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.

Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-/Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure/.

This self-insert is mainly slice of life which I tend to avoid in naruto fanfics because they are oversaturated, cliche, and a dime a dozen. But, with Pulling The Strings, it's a breath of fresh air because its a well-done slice of life in the sand village with the grand goal of liberating Gaara's madness. It woulda probably evolve into more but it died before getting anywhere. Dead.

There isn't really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body.

This is the most engaging and well-written DBZ self insert I found. The author does yearly time skips that gets the plot into the nitty gritty and skips the boring repetitive buildup a lot of self-inserts tend to have. You would need to make a NSFW questionable questing forum account but the funny thing is there is only one NSFW scene(suprising for this site) which is entirely skippable. Sadly Dead.

*Bleach Self Inserts.*

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psychopomp-bleach-si.747151/][Psychopomp (Bleach SI)]] Male SI, reincarnated as a hollow millennia before canon. I was really suprised of the quality of this fanfiction especially coming from a bleach SI. The SI is reborn as a hollow where he struggles to find his purpose in this world as the anime already set the story's fate in stone. One of my major grip in self insert fanfiction in general is that every author ignores the golden question of whether to needle into the story and change the threads of fate. Most mediums with seemingly happy endings IE Naruto/bleach/harry potter seem to ignore this and still needlessly ingratiate themselves into the story where survival is iminent and their interference is not needed. The author of psychopomp does an amazing job answering this question and tells an amazing story with their SI defining it. Slow updates.

SI as the bastard son of Stannis with a member of the Tyrell family. Personally my favourite ASOIAF SI (having tried your suggestions and some others), it focuses on a character who tries to do his best to save the world, deal with the problems that accompanies these attempts, all without setting him as an infallible god. The character makes mistakes and people call him out on them. Regularly updating, and with a pretty large backlog already built up.

I don't know if you've watched MHA (if you haven't you should, I think it's amazing) but this SI does a great job of integrating the main character into the world, creating a realistic progression, whilst still allowing her to have flaws and problems she needs to solve. SI as the younger sister of one of the top ten pro-heroes in the world, and features significant development of, and interaction with, the case of side-characters in the world.

I... don't know what to think of Daedalus. It's competently written, and the power at least is interesting so far (though it is quite early days), but... The author doesn't shy away from showing that the SI (it's kind of not really an SI? Based on the author, but as an in-universe character) is a huge asshole. It's intentionally presented in this way, but half the enjoyment of this fic is cathartically hating someone you don't know.

A big favourite of mine. SI as a character in Gotham with the ability to summon fictional items from books - but it's set years into the future, with the SI as an established member of Batman's rogues gallery. Features attempts from the SI to go legit, creative use of a pretty powerful ability, great character interaction, and unorthodox challenges. Possibly dead, possibly just has really long breaks between updates.

Male SI with DC comics knowledge discovers he's The Calculator. The story doesn't follow any particular arc from comics (that I recognize). Checks off the boxes for taking itself seriously, having a reason to exist instead of trolling canon characters, and the sort of mindset that types the words "interdimensional survival guide."

We can debate over whether it is wish-fulfillment. (Although, per quoted framing, that just makes it one of the best ones.)

Also, it's complete! Loosely-related sequel pending.

Bonus for anyone else reading: you do not need a terribly deep familiarity with the source. The pop-culture osmosis has done the work, unless you have no idea who Batman is or why you might not want his attention.

****** Hey, looking at that list I'm curious about "his re-write makes for a decent story " in regards to Shinobi act 1.

I read the original version, which I liked until he got to the Chunin exams and really didn't like the turn the plot took there>! with Daisuke going nuts when he got almost perfect and abandoning Konoha, up until that point it was a pretty standard SI solves the main Naruto plot as a loyal Konoha ninja, which is what I wanted to read, not an SI becomes and enemy of Konoha and tries to revolutionize the whole ninja system fic, I just felt bait and switched by that, as that wasn't what I was looking to read and there were very few indications it was going to go in that directon before then.!<The author then rewrote this sequence, possibly a couple times(so the current rewrite is actually the third or forth one I guess), but I didn't immediately read the new version. However a few months later I checked back in with it, and skimmed the last chapter just to see if the story got back on a track I was interested in, and it apparently took another turn, which I really really didn't like, >!where they introduced the ROB as the cause of everything, which imo is one of the dumbest immersion breaking tropes ever, even in premises that are themselves difficult to accept like SIs or gamer powers, something about a ROB just makes the whole fic seem cringy as fuck to me.!< When this happened basically everyone on space battles hated it, and the author said they had it in mind from the beginning and it was the main point of their fic so they weren't going to change it. So anyway I am wondering if the currtent rewrite might avoid those things, or if those things will still bother me if I attempt to read the rewrite.

******* I actually didn't read the original 1 or 2 drafts, just noticed that what he ended up with was OK.

I think if you don't want to read a story that has a ROB or where he is out to change the world, you are going to be disappointed. There is still a ROB, though basically only hinted at at this point. And he does change his tune a lot and mature and want to work with people rather than it being him against the world. But you will have to read a bit to get to that point.

And the author also makes another two twists in his story telling at this time, changing tone of the story pretty drastically... not sure how permanent that change will be.

In all, it's feels very much the author is writing what he feels like at the time and less of a... cohesive & well-planned story. MC is also rather too OP with not enough foibles.
