As soon as a time machine exists in a single-timeline universe then there is /already/ a secret society of time travelers with rules and traditions that have somehow sustained the history we know and love and protected it from looking any different than it does the moment you gain access to the theoretical opportunity to change it. Even if you've only just invented it.

Everybody who comes after you can still act before you... and have. You are already in opposition to them, and working against their entire society and millions of years of experience.

If you're not the only person with a time machine, and it's possible to change the past, then the time machine will never be invented... because para-eventually someone will undo the invention of the time machine every time it's invented. This applies to any organization dedicated to maintaining the course of history, no matter how good they are.

Basically, only a timeline in which the time machine is never invented is a steady state condition. The timeline will keep changing until such a state is reached, and then stop changing. From the point of view of people anchored in the timeline, that's how it always was.

So this question kind of implies either that you're the only person with a time machine, or the time machine can't go back before its own creation.

If an apparent change ever gets corrected, it's not actually a change. It's just the way things always were. The timeline never changes at all.

That's not a stable state. The butterfly effect means that it is literally mathematically impossible, even with infinite time, to create a stable timeline that contains any loops. All You Zombies is great science fiction but it's not actually science.

This needs justifying. It seems to me that there could be stable states with time travel. Chaos theory / "for want of a nail" means it's ludicrously difficult to change the past without changing the circumstances that led to you changing the past, but not literally impossible. (Or things might infinitely converge towards a stable state, which amounts to the same thing.)

***** The timeline is incredibly fragile once you insert actual physics into the analysis. If you make any change in the past significantly before your birth, down to even scaring an animal near you when you appear, you will pretty much guarantee you're never going to be born.

The reason is hydrodynamics of seminal fluid.

This is a massive amplifier of change. You scare an animal, it behaves slightly differently, a few animals nearby change THEIR behaviour very slightly as a result, and the next time one of them mates that happens slightly differently, even if it's just a fraction of a second later, and completely different sperm reach the egg.

SO in that area, a different set of animals is born in the next generation. Over their lives they behave differently, and the changes grow.

If this is before humanity evolved, if that even happens it'll happen completely differently. The new history will be completely different from the get go. If it's only a few centuries ago, maybe it'll take twenty or thirty years before a hunter catches or doesn't catch an animal, and ends up making out with her husband a fraction of a second later the next night, and now all their children are different.

And humans are an amplifier of entropy. Within a generation the very slight changes have spread all over the planet, completely different people are born, and the timeline is completely different. All from a snap of a twig as your time machine touched down.

MAYBE if it was before Lief Erikson, the new world gets a few generations repreive, but even then... migrating animals and fish also spread changes across the globe.

The idea of going back and making a deliberate, limited change is nonsense. It can't be done.

Converging on a stable state, sure, but the most likely stable state to converge on is one in which the time machine is never invented. There's no /mechanism/ directing the creation of almost closed loops that converge over multiple iterations. It would have to happen all at once, by sheer chance, and there still would have to be no time travel ever outside that one unlikely loop. SO even if there's a loop, it's one in which the time machine gets used once and prevents itself from ever being used again... and that is just so much less likely than it simply undoing itself I can't believe in any other result.

True. But you can have a stable state over multiple loops. I.e. Kevin goes back in time and causes his mother to instead have a daughter named Laura, then Laura goes back in time and causes her mother to instead have a son named Kevin. (Add a billion steps to make this remotely plausible.)

I don't disagree. But while a /specific/ multiple-loops stable state is highly unlikely, accounting for the possibility of multiple-loops stable states in general noticeably increases the probability of falling into a stable state.

As a toy example, let's say that the only thing time travel can change is the name of the protagonist.

First they're named Bob. If, after time travel, they're still Bob, we have a stable state.

But say instead that they become Laura. Now, after Laura time-travels, there are /two/ names that result in a stable state, Bob and Laura.

And so on and so forth. Assuming that names must have finite lengths, this actually /guarantees/ a stable state eventually, even if we can't predict its number of loops.

(In a non-toy example, as you said, there will be many more states in which time travel doesn't get discovered.)

*** This is one of my favorite aspects of Haddix as an author (author of the /Shadow Children/ series). Even if she's not rational at all, or even particularly historically accurate, the protagonists in her time-travel series aren't the only time-travelers. In fact, there exist two competing factions of time travelers, that only recently diverged (but have, in effect, been competing throughout the whole of history).

I especially like the way it goes about paradoxes - the natural form of the universe /without/ time travel is predestined, and any changes from the norm will generally revert, unless they are too large. It's really weird and not too consistent, but it was a nice brain-bender for me as a young adult.

** Haven't thought about total domination, but I definitely have some ideas for easy improvements.

- Kill St. Paul before he invents Christianity, preventing the ensuing genocides it brought about. This is probably the one I'd do if I actually had a time machine.
- Kill Duncan Campbell Scott, who planned out most of the holocaust, preventing any of his copycats including Hitler.
- Kill Ferdinand and Isabella in the mid 1400s before they start any of their multiple genocides.
- Introduce Benamin Franklin (who would regiignize it as math ans not just superstition) to the fundamentals of Game Theory and Population dynamics so he can introduce those ideas to the English and French speaking parts of the world a few centuries early. To avoid a bootstrap paradox, don't teach him directly take but introduce him to someone in the Midewiwin Society, which has already discovered those branches of math.

*** You realise of course that you couldn't do all of those - if killing St Paul had the effect you hoped the rest of history would be VERY different...

**** Of course: each one of these was a separate idea. Most of the others seem to be mainly dealing with the mess Paul left and so would be unnecessary if plan 1 worked. It's really too bad the time machine in the prompt doesn't go back before 1000BC, otherwise I'd try to prevent Leviticus from becoming a thing.
