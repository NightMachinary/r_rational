** I chose to post this link because it's a very good explanation of current findings by scientists and I think it's an example we should learn from to avoid bias when presenting something new. The Original Poster only presented what is currently known and explained the purposes of the tests without any distortion of people's motivations or facts.

*** Good job finding it!

** The experiment seems fairly strait forward. Microwaves and an enclosed copper cone. There is also a lot of excitement around it. I wonder if anyone (with a really well tooled garage) hasn't just taken apart a microwave oven to see if they could also create the same effect... although experimenter's bias...

I guess my question is if the scientists think that (if it works) they may be able to make it more effective, why some engineer hasn't made one effective enough to not ignore?

Although if I take a few different fictional futures with the various possible outcomes all being present, it seems either very silly/stupid to try, or very brilliant. If it is stupid, no one needs to know you even tried...

Edit: if this does work, would anyone with more knowledge than me (someone who has read more than just a few old papers on quantum physics, etc) point out why one couldn't try this /in/ one's own microwave oven?

*** I imagine the hard part would be measuring 50 micronewtons of thrust.

*** Quite a number of engineers have repeated the original experiment in their own time and their results concur with the current results online. Probably the biggest reason nobody has made it better is that nobody knows why exactly it works - also one of the reasons many 'big' science groups haven't bothered testing it. (they'll probably just assume it's a crackpot's fabricated idea)

Until the Eagleworks experiment, nobody really cared. Due to not knowing how it functions - the best current hypothesis being microwaves 'pushing' against quantum bubbles - it would be very difficult for one to make it 'better'. I'm guessing that the scientists who think they could make it more effective are working on the premise that, by figuring out how it works in the first place, they'll be able to improve upon it.
