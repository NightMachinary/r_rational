Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I finished reading my way through Seanan McGuire's InCryptid series and I've gotta say it's definitely the first time I've gotten heroic action-scientist protagonists in urban fantasy. Recommended! Every time they solved a problem with things like "communication skills" and "basic empathy" I un-died a little inside.

Also worth noting that in general, the villains / antagonists of each book have consistent, reasonable plans and coherent implied internal narratives.

**** I think Toby is comparable, rationality-wise, to Verity.

My greater enjoyment of InCryptid is in at least some part due to the fact that I am an absolute sucker for families being kickass /as a family/, which the Prices absolutely are. Toby's family-of-choice is amazing, of course, but her mom is just the absolute worst.

(Not that I would want the Prices as my family. Perish the thought. I do not want pit traps involved in my Hide & Seek.)

***** Yeah, comparing Toby and Verity works, but Verity has the backing of a much more organized and preppy family - Aeslin Mice, interdimensional Grandma, ghostly Aunts etc. That allows for more error tolerance, whereas Toby's (chosen) family is more of the "lets find her and stop the bleeding" reactive variety, which works because Toby is so enormously resilient, but it makes for a less rational tinge in a few ways, I think.

Haha, this made me think of the Yozakura Family from the eponymous Jump manga. Not the most rational of stories (far from it, in fact, it mostly runs on Rule of Cool/Funny), but the protagonist family is one of the most ridiculously overcompetent ones I can think of in fiction. They're all also pretty loving and caring towards the MC... with /one/ notable exception.

** Any SI/OC munchkin fics? I'm on a binge for stories where someone actually takes practical advantage of their universe/abilities.

With this ring - he cleaned up the oceans then got weirdly possessive of superboy kinda dropped it then felt a little creepy.

12 steps to godhood - was fun at first now its basically a TV show style crisis of the week

Anything by dogbertcarrol - he tends to do the munchkin really well and his rational character based commentary is fantastic. Too bad he can keep a story for more than 20k words.

Perspective is Ki - SI saiyan in the DC vs. Quick access to gravity training. Not sure where its going hopefully somewhere neat?

Tales of blood and steel - illuvar SI. I love illuvar as an author and no one writes fight scenes/ large scale battles better than this guy. However, his plot progression is glacial.

Misc genre savy inserts/cyoa into worm. My general problem with worm verse is that everybody and I mean inserts/OCs/cannon full grabs the idiot ball like its the last life jacket on the titanic. So many promising tinker stories where the mc will jump right into heroing. Just fucking why? Sure you have a conflict driver, but still a few months to quietly build up a tinker base? Prepping for leviathan? All of this. Celestial forge is both enjoyable and infuriating. Mc knows endbringers are a thing and is very aware of the threat simuragh poses. Does he start working on a counter to them? No. No he doesn't.

A few naruto SIs that are enjoyable, but they always start strong and get stuck in the academy for 100k words or get dropped during the wave mission. Why people get hung up on that story ill never know.

Edit: Harry Potter SIs are 99% you were reborn as lord Alexander Dantes black illegitimate child of Bellatrix and lord Dantes. Your family is dead, but your rich and in the same year as Harry squee. Or some variation of Lady Rebecca Shamthana Black and only I can heal Harry's wounds. Just no. Whole loosely defined world and everybody rides the HP train to hogwarts. I've found a few where the MC will travel the world and actually explore tombs, different magical cities/countries, etc.

Anyway I'm starting to rant any suggestion would be great thank you!

*** It's not a munchkin SI, but I've been finding Somebody That I Used Tahno enjoyable. It's a Legend of Korra SI into Tahno, except the SI has a real character that isn't just being sarcastic and self deprecating with a heart of gold. It starts with some of the more annoying tropes but slowly turns into a genuinely good story later on.

Some things it does well:

- Republic City really feels like a 1920s shithole with incompetent/malicious politicians and a thriving criminal underground.

- The SI's an unreliable narrator, but it's actually done decently? The story starts off with the SI telling his autobiography to Toph, and slowly he starts saying the truth instead of omitting the details. There's a nice development with it too.

- Dialogue is done pretty well for a fanfiction, but not amazing. The author does do a good job of capturing the personalities of the various characters.

- There's a good amount of original plot. Tahno's actions put a big wrench into the original plot, and the new plotline actually feels coherent.

  An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he has a longer and stranger past than they can imagine.
#+end_quote

A better synopsis (from wiki, a mild spoiler)

The plot focuses on "John Oldman", a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cro-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.

*** In the world of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192725-masters-mages][Masters and Mages]] trilogy the popularization of simple magic--allowing one to clean water, start a fire, and birth control for women--greatly changed the course of society in a byzantine empire analogue, and inevitably spread throughout the world. The story is set 1000 years after this seminal and celebrated event, which features prominently in the plot.

In [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] every person holds a morsel of 'tael' in their brains. Gathering enough tael would allow one to 'level up' their magic, whether it be alchemy, martial skills, or wizardry. The magic system follows a kind modified DnD 1.5e rules, which allows you to see the 'moral alignment' of every person and also for clerics(exclusively people in the highest alignment) to resurrect people from the dead. These things all feature prominently in the plot.

The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/291662-lightbringer][Lightbringer Series]] features a world where magic practitioners have a limited amount of magic they can do, and then they must be put down or risk insanity.

** Finished reading Mother of Learning and now craving for more. Looking for something that has MoL's strengths while preferably is free of its weaknesses.

What I *liked* about MoL: magic system, MC gradually getting better, world building, gripping plot, interesting mysteries which get explained.

What I *disliked* about MoL: most characters feel like NPCs, which can be described in a single short line (which is kind of understandable given that almost all of them get reset every few weeks, but I still think it could have been done better); battles, in my opinion, have a very detached feel to them -- they are described in such a way that I never felt like I was participating in them, more like reading historic accounts after the fact.

Other than that I have a couple of requirements: no slash for MC and preferably a single main pov with other characters getting interludes here and there.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/2354/equestria-total-war][/Equestira: Total War/]]

#+begin_quote
  War comes to Equestria: with despair, with starvation, with suffering and with sacrifice. And the ponies must learn how to keep true to their values while surviving not just the rigors of battle, but the desolation of total war.
#+end_quote

This fic is worth reading for three reasons:

1. The first is the way the author seamlessly combines the MLP:FiM setting with Napoleonic weapons and tactics; the battles /make sense/, and you can easily understand how Dash controls the skies by destroying one griffon formation with her lancers and pinning two others in place with the threat of the same, or how Twilight uses her artillery as a means of area denial to prevent the lions from getting reinforcements at a critical moment.

2. The second is the amount of attention paid to supplies and logistics. In lesser works of military fiction, all the focus is on the fighting. In better works, there is some consideration to the strategy that leads to those battles taking place to begin with. But only in the truly best works is there a focus on the food and cloth and munitions and all the other stuff that actually lets an army stay alive, let alone move, let alone fight. And /Equestira: Total War/ is definitely in the latter category. Rarity's full-time job is logistics, and you get to see everything from the importance of a simple blanket in keeping ponies from freezing to death to the ugly realities of foraging.

3. The third is the level of introspection it brings to the whole enterprise of war and what it means to be a solder and an officer. Ponies die because of their leaders' decisions, officers get court-martialed for their actions, disagreements over the proper scope of the war, or if there should even /be/ a war, take place. I would say that it rivals /Starship Troopers/ and /Ender's Game/ as a classic of thoughtful military fiction.

Sadly, the work was never finished. But, fortunately, the author left a series of speeches in [[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/261081468/2223725867][a comment]] on DeviantArt before starting the novel, as something of a teaser. While three of those speeches had already been incorporated into the story by the time it stopped updating, the fourth, which was almost certainly meant to be in the epilogue, wasn't. Although this last speech does not explain everything and leaves many, many open threads, it gives us more or less an idea of ​​how the story was supposed to end and provides us with some closure.

/Vision/

Book 1: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87120/siren-song][/Siren Song/]]

#+begin_quote
  Bioshock meets MLP in this psychological thriller, where Celestia's new faithful student, Siren Song, must discover the truth behind the city beneath the waves.

  Beautiful, gifted, and faithful student of the Princess of the Sun, Siren Song has very nearly everything a pony could want. Sometimes though, in the twilight hours, Siren can see the sadness in her mentor's eyes. Once, ponies whisper, the Princess had another student named Twilight Sparkle, but she left Equestria, never to return. The pony who has a perfect life just needs one more thing---to convince Twilight Sparkle to come home so the Princess will smile again. But when Siren arrives in pursuit of Twilight, she soon finds herself trapped in a city of horrors, with only its monstrous denizens for help.
#+end_quote

Book 2: [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/175220/daring-do][/Daring Do/]]

#+begin_quote
  Since arriving in Vision, Siren has done things she never thought she was capable of---all in the name of survival. But now she abandons safety to gallop back into the darkness. Determined to do the right thing in a city gone mad, Siren must face the horrors she once fled from. But all is not as it seems in the vast and dark ocean, and Siren's greatest foe may yet lie within herself.
#+end_quote

A /Bioshock/ crossover, /Vision/ stars the sociopathic and manipulative, but charming and talented Siren Song as the personal student of Princess Celestia. Wanting to find out what happened to her predecessor, Twilight Sparkle, Siren Song follows her trail to a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, but gets more than she bargained for when her ship is attacked and sunk by mutants the likes of which she has never seen before. Waking up in a deserted harbor, which mysteriously appears to be underwater, Siren Song must now tread very carefully if she intends to escape back to the surface with her life.

Unlike the video game, where the city of Rapture is almost deserted except for the Splicers, Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and a handful of intelligent survivors, Vision is a fully populated and mostly functional city, albeit one that has clearly seen better days. The Elements rule with an iron hoof, "parasites" get hanged, the infrastructure is falling apart, money can buy anything, and, most importantly of all, large sections of the population are addicted to a combination of Poison Joke and Heart's Desire called mantles which give them extra cutie marks on demand. Problem is, they slowly build tolerance to the mantles and require ever larger doses, until eventually they can't get enough and end up as the crazy mutants that sank Siren's ship.

The fic gets a lot of mileage of of exploring the lives and philosophies of the characters in Vision and contrasting them to those of Equestria. Siren's first ally, Green Apple, is a fervent believer in the ideals of Vision even as she is trapped in a cycle of living in poverty and doing dirty jobs for Trixie in exchange for the money she needs to pay for her mantles. Another one, Echo the soldier, is an alcoholic and a whoremonger who patronizes underage prostitutes, but he is good at his job and has his own code of honor, abstains from mantles altogether, and is an invaluable asset to the party. And then there is Siren herself, who after a lifetime of privilege and looking out for number one has to come terms with who she is and whether she is really willing to throw her allies under the bus for the sake of her own interests.

Sadly, this fic is also unfinished; GaPJaxie [[https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/509830/a-major-announcement][decided]] that he would rather write [[https://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][earthfic]] that lots of people would read than ponyfic which is inherently limited to a niche audience. But he had the decency to post an outline for how the plot was supposed to end, as well as several scenes and fragments that he had already written, so at least we know how the story ends.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/77470/the-lunar-rebellion][/The Lunar Rebellion/]]

#+begin_quote
  It has been more than one hundred years since Celestia banished Nightmare Moon. While Equestria has enjoyed a century of relative peace and prosperity, there are still lingering tensions between the three pony tribes.

  Shadow Kicker, a proud warrior of Pegasopolis, must navigate the treacherous noble court of Canterlot and address the concerns and wounded pride of her own tribe in a desperate effort to prevent matters from coming to open warfare.
#+end_quote

This is part of the Winningverse, a setting focused on a random background pony named Cloud Kicker. In this verse, Cloudy is one of Rainbow Dash's best friends, a member of a military family called the Kicker clan, a deserter who went AWOL from the Royal Guard after graduating from West Hoof (the verse's equivalent of West Point; her dad, who is a high-ranking officer in the Guard, had to pull strings to keep her out of prison), a disappointment to her mother, and a fun-loving nymphomaniac who is always looking for ponies to "bang". The setting is deliberately constructed to be compatible with the show's canon; everything that happens is something that /could/ have happened just offscreen, and events are carefully choreographed around actual scenes from the show.

/The Lunar Rebellion/ is a prequel to the main work of the Winnningverse, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/28239/the-life-and-times-of-a-winning-pony][/The Life and Times of a Winning Pony/]]. Although the Winningverse as a whole is darker than the show, the present era is limited by the need to be consistent with the show. The past era, which is free of such constrains, is even darker and bloodier; /The Lunar Rebellion/ reads like a fairly realistic, low fantasy military fiction novel (think /Game of Thrones/) that just happens to have ponies in it. It deals with Cloud Kicker's legendary ancestor, Shadow Kicker, who led the armies of Equestria during the civil war against the rebel clans of Pegasopolis.

It might be best if you have some familiarity with the verse before reading it, though. Ignoring branching AUs the early stories of the Winningverse are, in order of publication, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25698/the-incredibly-dense-mind-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Dense Mind of Rainbow Dash"]], /The Life and Times of a Winning Pony/ (direct sequel to "Dense Mind"), [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/59373/the-incredibly-troubled-mind-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Troubled Mind of Rainbow Dash"]] (set after chapter 10 of /Winning Pony/), [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/73631/the-incredibly-apologetic-letters-of-rainbow-dash]["The Incredibly Apologetic Letters of Rainbow Dash"]] (prequel to /Winning Pony/), and then /The Lunar Rebellion/ (distant prequel to /Winning Pony/).

**** I'd read more of this. The protagonist has potential for some interesting character reflection and I have a weakness for uplift fics. I could see the protagonist's negativity towards the game be further spurred on by why real life players get sick of the game (poor formats, ratio of good:bad cards in sets).

Interesting choice with Necrovalley. I'm guessing anti-Chaos? Perhaps budget limitations on part of the protagonist, since Gatekeepers were cheap at the time and reasonably decent. Time period would put it around Chaos/Goat era, broaching on post-Goat, though that depends on the ban list.

I'm guessing it'll be rational!SI in an irrational setting? (Given the tone of what's written so far.) Will you be using rules/rulings/cards from the time period, from now, from the anime...?

***** This was intended to be more of a classically rational, "reconstruct yugioh" plot actually, along the lines of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25209853][my other yugioh project]]. Where the main character with their outside-context knowledge has a massive advantage, but there are still fundamental reasons for why the Yugioh world is structured why it is, outside of just "people are bad at card games." I was planning to start at a given banlist and then move forward with new cards from there, with real life cards and rules but anime lifepoints/summoning in faceup defense to trim down duel length. I actually have two other chapters written including a duel where she shows off her Gravekeeper deck against an Armed Dragon deck that establishes the time period.

Good comment on the potential to make this an "uplift" fic though; I wasn't really considering that as an option, but now I can see how it could fit into a character arc.

(For example, if Duel Monsters was mega-popular, it would reason that set releases would be far more frequent, and because of that, there'd probably be a lot more legacy support for older archetypes, and the meta would change too often for people to pick up the "best decks". I'd also reason power creep could be stifled due to overwhelming popularity not necessitating incentives for people to pick up more recent sets.)

Goof in Chapter 3, Syrus sets a face-down, targets it with Megaroid City, then chains it (an MST); when a Quick-Play Spell is set, it can't be activated for the rest of the turn (like a Trap). Unless this is an anime rules thing.

Syrus Giant Trunades after, which clears the backrow anyway (...silly he'd not just Giant Trunade straightaway, in that case, since that'd avoid Megaroid City getting popped by ST). You could have Nick comment on it being risky taking a -1 and getting rid of ST removal when opponents have backrow rather than it being a 2-2.

There's also a writing goof when Syrus explains Mixerroid "allowing me to tribute summon a" rather than "allowing me to tribute a".

*** Have you tried [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo][/1632/]] by Eric Flint? The premise is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats][alien space bats]] transport a mining town from 2000 West Virginia to Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years' War. There is no magic, there is a language barrier, downtimer values are believably alien, and everything is backed up by historical and technological research. It was so realistic that defense analyst Stuart Slade (of /The Salvation War/ fame) [[http://web.archive.org/web/20031120165443/http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html][wrote]]:

#+begin_quote
  I originally bought 1632 precisely because I was interested in how Eric's thoughts would fit with the studies that I knew had been done. The parallelism was very close indeed. 1632 quickly identified the crucial problem - the need to get population levels up so that there is enough of a workforce to do everything that needs to be done... In many ways, the situation described in 1632 is a lot closer to a post-nuclear attack scenario than the novels that purport to describe such situations directly... 1632 has another lesson for the post-nuclear environment; the critical importance of getting a working society up and running and getting trade links established. The normal run of post-holocaust novels forget that yet it was the thing most people studying the situation spent most time looking at. Mike Stearns got the point straight away - if he presented himself at a think-tank we'd hire him on the spot. I suspect he'd fit in quite well.

I get a real thirst for some trap and design munchkinning. I want some real clever designs that just obliterate dungeon delvers in brilliant and efficient ways, but whenever I do find a rare dungeon core story, half the time it turns out they're pacifistic, which really ruins the premise of the genre for me.

In other genres the novels are stuffed with murderhobo MCs, is it wrong to have a single good dungeon core rational murderhobo MC? I'm always on the lookout for more good dungeon core novels too.

I'm a bit divided on this, but one of the better ones I read was the JP WN/LN Lazy Dungeon Master. It's admittedly not rational at all, but it does have an occasional interesting moment. Ignoring it having a lot of really trashy JP themes like slaves and perverts, the story has some really clever moments. There's quite a few dungeon v. dungeon battles, where the masters make their own competition dungeons and try to defeat the opponent's dungeons with a certain amount of points. It has some interesting ideas, like using a bunch of rats, which are really cheap, to rush through the traps, and then defeating the bosses by literally suffocating their throats with the rats. There's some other cool moments that utilizes certain rooms, terrain, traps, and decor in these dungeon competitions.

Again, it's a pretty trashy dungeon core novel, and it's also one of the city-building/pacifist dungeon novels I really despise, but there's occasionally a flash of brilliance. Most likely not worth reading, but I found it to occasionally do something really clever.

*** Zombie Knight Saga. Has some really unique combat. It's basically like hunter x hunter in text form (in terms of power interactions). MC gets unique advantages over the normal power user but everyone else around him is so much more powerful than him that he usually doesn't get his way like he wants to.

Magik Online. The power system is kinda like DnD, with higher level magic being exponentially more powerful. There are some twists which were nice imo, and some that weren't. Recommend checking it out. Story does somewhat lose its way later on, but at least it ends on a definite (if unfinished) note.

** People here might like [[https://www.mywuxiaworld.com/book/The_Oracle_Paths/][The Oracle Paths]]. It's a sci-fi deconstruction of System Apocalypse LitRPGs set in Earth's early 22nd century. The "system" in this one works through these alien-tech armband devices whose main ability is to show you the steps to take in order to achieve some goal you specify, if it's possible (similar to Path to Victory from Worm).

Unlike in Worm though you can't get free information, just the physical actions you'd need to take to find it out, you don't know all the steps from the start, and you don't automatically perform the steps, instead being guided by a "shadow" performing the actions a little before you. This and the fact that everyone has the same thing limits the havoc this causes quite a bit. I think it's more intended to mimic "Skill" guidance that these stories often have, and there's another component which is like a quest system. (The rewards don't come out of nowhere though, it just tells you what you actually get in real life from doing the "quest.")

The "apocalypse" part is the monsters that start continually spawning as Earth is demolished and reconstructed as part of a much larger world. Standard stuff for this genre.

The main thing I like is that the author has a decent grasp of the biomechanics behind "improving stats," and spends some effort on realism. By which I mean, some thought has been put into "what would actually happen," and things that would realistically be problems aren't just ignored, such as the MC not instantly turning into a grinding machine as soon as he gets the armband. (By "realism" I don't mean "(grim)dark and gritty.")

The writing is kind of weird in that the vocabulary is much better than your Royal Road popcorn but the grammar and style is closer to a translated novel (which is not a good thing; it doesn't seem intentional). Thankfully it's much better quality than most translations though.

Overall, would recommend giving it a try.

***** Without anything more specific, I'm going to take a high level view and give you recommendations on what I do to find content.

Find a group that shares your fetishes, and lurk for content. [[/r/transformation][r/transformation]] tags written works, and if you sort by upvotes you'll filter out the trash, for example.

Questionable Questing is a great website to dig through. If you sort by +first post likes+ number of replies, you'll be spared the trash, and if you filter out threads with less than 20k words, you can reasonably expect to find a thread with both plot and lewds.

It's not worth digging through webfiction sites like AO3 or [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], unless you're looking for a particularly niche paring, or lewds based off of a niche fandom.

This is probably the wrong place to ask, imo. Good erotica really focuses on the emotional connection between the characters, and most of what's recommended here doesn't tend to do that. The only lewd stuff I've seen recommended here explore the ramifications of a porn setting, like the Erogamer.

********* Theatrum Alchemicm is pretty good.

Pretty much everything Chibi-Reaper puts out is worth a look, though they have trouble keeping to one idea.

If you liked Devourer of Worlds, by X50413, they've posted Just as Planed, which is a waifu catalog SI. X50413 excels at writing inhuman characters, and continues to do so in Just as Planed, because the first waifu is the Simurgh from Worm.

Stuff by Klassekatze is pretty great, I recommend checking out Transient.

Sauce Quest is a fun take on Naruto from the POV of Sasuke, who's gone a little insane from having everyone he knew murdered by his sibling.

Rounding things off, My life as a Castle Core, is a fun exploration of what a conflict between a lewd games units and a strategy games units would look like.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/enthusiastic-consent-very-very-nsfw.51532/][Enthusiastic Consent]] Is great. Fair amount of worldbuilding with the smut, but very well written and quite hot. Tags: BDSM.

** Looking for something with a magic system similar to the sort in Mother of Learning. Something that includes several magic types such as scripting, teleportation, trans-dimensionalism, cloning, mind-magic (if possible).

Not looking for a time loop story +at all+ per se. I primary want something with as diverse a magic system while still maintaining that healthy dose of a traditional high fantasy setting.

Goes without saying, but rational MCs who shun the idiot ball as often as they can manage. I'll accept Munchkinery with open arms so long as it doesn't require everyone else but the exploiter to be stupid or unobservant. I can do without it all together though.

TL;DR

A sturdy, well crafted magic system with a healthy array of magics, and MCs who are adept at several of them or are learning to be adept.

Main focus: Magic system similar to MOL's. Emphasis on the magic system.

Oh and I love Worth the Candle by AW.
