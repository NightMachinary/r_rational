Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost /designed/ to mainly have all those qualities, /sigh/. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate.

Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.

Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-/Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure/.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wilted-irises-naruto-si.52403/][Wilted Irises-]] Male SI, reincarnated as the hyuga heir. It is very new with only 20k words but so far it is well-written with a constant goal in mind. Reading this you feel like you yourself are a hyuga in the self-insert's shoes. Fast updates.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/][Sleight Advantage-]] Male SI, reincarnated as an average civilian. Joining the ninja academy he must make due with his below average chakra coils so he specializes in magic misdirection. Dead.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][Whats Her Name in Hufflepuff]] Female SI transmigrated into a 10 year old version herself in the HP universe. There isn't really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body. Slow updates.

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]] is an amazing Naruto SI, that I recommend whenever SI recs are mentioned. Definitely the best Naruto SI I've read, and I've read a lot of them (though many come close). It's the only hurt/comfort fic that I've ever liked, and does it well.

Kyo, the main character, is reincarnated. While she does remember some Naruto, she remembers far from all of it. Except that that fact doesn't really even matter, because she's born way before canon (before Kakashi even), and it's clear that the world is way scarier and deadly than the one she knows from the Naruto manga.

Although a prodigy, she acts like and /is/ an actual kid, unlike almost all Naruto reincarnation SIs who are miniature adults who remember birth and yadayada. This fic is much better than that.

The original characters and canon characters are perfectly balanced in this fic: very few canon characters come into play, and the way all the characters get developed feel like it could've been a quality novel (fitting for this subreddit) all on its own. No hamfisting OCs or canon characters in; it's all natural and makes sense. (It's like we're in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] or something, huh.)

There was more compliments for it, that I probably forgot to put here, but whatever. Definitely put it on your list.

I know I've made comments like this before, so I'll dig through and find some of the other SI fics that I like in a bit. There is another recent Naruto SI that I like a lot (that I also put in a similar rec within the past few months), and another amazing Naruto SI that was especially notable because in that fic, Naruto the manga never existed, and it treated the SI differently in what it meant to be reincarnated (also balanced/underdog, despite being shippuden level powerful). I'll get those for you soon, plus a few others.

Also, some of those Naruto SIs are not like the others in quality. Sanitize is far above in quality than the others, and although Wilted Irises is good for a Hyuuga SI, it's not nearly as good as a few others on your list. The only one on your list that I haven't read is Son of Gato, for reasons you put right in its description. There is only one true Gamer Naruto SI (for me), and it's the one by Fulcon. All others I've tried are trash in some manner, even if they are readable (sometimes).

I'll get you some more in a bit, including a few non Naruto ones (since there are fewer non Naruto ones and consequently few amazing ones). At some point, I really need to make a huge rec list of all the SIs I've read, so that I can post a link to it on every rec thread...

***** I disagree that it reads like the typical saturated female SI. Kyo's a kid, so there is /zero/ gushing and Minato is really more of a friend/side character. It is /far/ from focusing on him; it's really more about OCs and Kyo's relationship with everybody in Konoha and how bad the war is.

It is less actiony than some other fics, but for me, it's just balanced. There is still a ton of action, even though Kyo's not throwing around tons of giant jutsu. The Uzushio arc was full of action, but terrifying at the same time.

While there is some slice of life, it's definitely not the boring shit I usually think of when I think about that genre. Slice of life to me is everyday boring shit. Slice of life, here, is character development, so that you feel awful when people die or get hurt, or even when they're simply in danger.

#+begin_quote
  Slice of life and gushing how hot minato is gets very old especially *when you are a guy and can't relate*.
#+end_quote

I am a guy. The point of this fic is that it's an inversion of tons of bad cliches you see in bad female Naruto fanfiction. It's not focusing on sexy characters or romance. It's not focusing on how nice people are, or how powerful the SI is. It's not focusing on the SI changing shit.

This fic is more like an OC living in a brutal terrible world, with family and friends under the constant threat of death. Nobody cares she's been reincarnated, Kyo's trying to make sure she doesn't fucking die.

Tbh, you might be remembering a different fic than I am. I hate romance, so I'm ecstatic there's none of that here. Whatever you just mentioned or are thinking of, that's not this fic.

This fic is more in line with Sanitize -- but with more character development -- in how it subverts the typical female SI.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multi-cross-worm-naruto-homestuck-mother-of-learning.682117/][Conference Call]] is a very interesting Mother of Learning/Worm/Homestuck/Naruto crossover fic. Yeah, you read those right.

Great characterization, very unique concept, literally unique crossover and some interesting applications of them. The only flaws I can find are a somewhat slow update rate (at least before recently) and a lack of crossover conflict as of yet.

The premise is simple. Certain side characters of those properties (and the main character of MoL) get connected by a mysterious interdimensional chat run by a moderator who goes by "Thunder". The chat eventually branches out into deeper connections between universes, like being able to use each other's magic systems, and the more the worlds cross over the better synergies they get. They also quickly figure out ways to munchkin the chat system so they can replicate mental abilities like an eidetic memory.

Highly recommended to anyone even vaguely interested in crossover fiction experiments, munchkinry and character development. Knowledge of the source materials is probably not required, though I think someone who hasn't read Worm would be pretty confused.

** *Request:*

Stories about humanity in a losing war against an outside threat, or, alternatively, about humanity trying to survive in an especially deadly world. Clarifications:

1. Preferably without infighting among the humans. /Definitely/ without dumb infighting which ends up overshadowing the outside threat itself.

2. There should be no possibility of negotiation with the threat --- or, at least, no /obvious/ one. (The threat shouldn't consists of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zkzzjg3h7hW5Z36hK/humans-in-funny-suits][humans in funny suits]] pretending to be aliens. If they're aliens, they should be too alien for conventional diplomacy.)

3. Any medium: books, web serials, anime, video games, fanfiction, films, TV series...

I've consumed several stories based around this concept, but most fail either Point 1 or Point 2 (e. g., [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaywardPines][/Wayward Pines/]], [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan][/Attack on Titan/]], [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KabaneriOfTheIronFortress][/Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress/]]). Honestly, the best examples I know of are probably Wells' /The War of the Worlds/, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][/Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest/]] (don't mind the name), which probably says something.

--------------

*Recommendation:*

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontypool_(film)][/Pontypool/]] is a very interesting horror film. It follows a group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town, who start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts.

This is one of these rare horror movies where the characters aren't complete idiots, and it features one of the best examples of a memetic threat I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

*** Ender's Game pretty much fits the description.

Bloom, by Wil McCarthy - the titular Bloom is grey goo, basically, nanotechnology that makes more of itself, and it's capable of adapting to survive attempts to destroy or contain it, and has devoured most of the inner planets. The remaining human civilization lives in the outer solar system, where it doesn't spread as easily since there's less available energy. It's been quite a while since I read it, but I think there was some infighting but it the plot didn't center around it. It was a pretty good book, as I recall (although not half as good as his later novels).

Uprooted, by Naomi Novik, is set in a nation bordering the Wood - a magical forest that is sapient, totally hostile to humans, and gradually expanding. There are monsters in the Wood, and people who spend too long there, or eat anything from inside, may be controlled by the Wood. The protagonist is from a small village not far outside it, and is sent to be a servant of one of the wizards whose job it is to keep the Wood from spreading. It certainly feels like the kind of story you mean, though it doesn't /quite/ fit on either count. There is a significant amount of conflict between humans, but nearly all of it is due to the Wood influencing people, Simurgh-style.

The first few chapters are fairly cliched, but I enjoyed it quite a bit over all.

None of these are perfect examples, but I think there all at least as close to what you want as War of the Worlds is, if not closer. I think I've read some others like this, but can't remember what right now. Might be back with more recommendations later.

*** Would 40k fit your criteria? The Imperium of Man is beset on all sides by monstrous creatures that are either radically non-human (tyranid, demons) or have been horrifically mutated away from the baseline standard (Chaos Space Marines). Bonus points for the "civilized" races of the galaxy having declared an unofficial truce at the current time in the setting to avoid being overwhelmed by all the monsters.

There's The Day of the Triffids, in which humanity is beset by giant carnivorous plants that move.

There's season 5 of Angel (the TV show), which is about the sheer impossibility of human beings standing up to the absurd number of extra-dimensional monsters waiting to gobble us all up. I don't want to spoil the finale, but it's probably the single best resolution to any TV show I've ever seen. Also [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WufQYZYzJk][the previous season contains my all time favourite TV speech]]

Mass Effect is about the species of the galaxy uniting to fight off the eldritch horror of the reapers.

Dragon Age Origins is about uniting the species of the land against the blight, a mutating corruption that warps anyone it touches into twisted freaks.

*** The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson - very rational protagonist and antagonists. This story gripped me from the first page. I found the prose amazing.

A story about a gifted girl of a small island nation that is taken over by a massive empire. Imagine a pre-gunpowder empire that is supremely competent, that builds free schools in neighboring nations as the first step before invasion/assimilation, for indoctrination and recruitment of geniuses. It also worships a twisted version of science that studies psychology and genetics and eugenics with a religious fervor.

Master Assassins by Roberts VS Reddick - the main protagonist is pretty rational, and the world feels very well crafted.

Great fantasy with a terribly mismatched title and cover. A story of two brothers trying to desert from a theocratic army, but with more layers beneath that than an onion. The worldbuilding and characterization are the real treats in the story. It starts slow, but it just keeps building more and more momentum until you're knocked over by the quality.

For example, if an edgy protagonist gets isekaied from the 21st century United States to a generic fantasy world, and he's informed that the servant girl who's waiting on him is actually a slave, rather than instantly erupting in abolitionist fury*, he asks his host about the details of thise particular fantasy world's peculiar institution. After further study, he may eventually come to the conclusion that this world's slavery is wasteful and he wants to abolish it after taking over the world---but he'll come to a conclusion after checking the economics, rather than instantly discarding it as an option. Even if he thinks it's bad in the long term, he may exploit it in the short term as a tool in his rise to power.

*I most recently saw this happen in /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53546][The Reluctant Swordsman]]/, but I'm pretty sure I've seen it many times before (though I can't recall any other examples at this time). See also Harry's reaction to Draco's rape comment in /HPMoR/.

There are more chapters in the alternate history forum version but it requires a login. I haven't read recent updates but many chapters are written as history books.

Expect the Spanish Inquisition to be involved. The SI comes across as competent and introduces/exploits some modern inventions but also creates secret police, oppresses subjects, starts burning people who rebel against him alive. Maybe historical since during Spanish inquisition but still seems unnecessary. Actually this might fit both your alternate history and edgy/amoral requests...

**** To be fair having an account for AH.com is pretty useful, a lot of good fic gets posted in Fandom and ASB forums, especially if you like SIs.

Many xianxia characters are like this, although less about researching the local cultural background and more about just not being driven by empathy, compassion, or humanitarian moral code or principles.

You can try ones of these as a starter:

- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/reverend-insanity/][/Reverend Insanity/]] (AKA /Daoist Gu/)

Maybe also take a look at this thread, see if there's anything new mentioned inside:

** I'm in the middle of reading "Dread Nation", a story where people started turning into zombies during the american civil war. I would highly reccommend it; it's not an apocalypse story, and does its best to examine the kind of society we e'd see afterwards. (With some concessions to the fact that it's YA, of course.)

** This is not particularly rational, but strongly recommend the movie "Kamera o tomeru na!" ("One Cut of the Dead"). It's, I think, the kind of horror comedy people around here would enjoy - smart, and rewarding you for paying attention.

** A couple of recommendations that I haven't seen on here recently, along with brief reviews. Both by the same author:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/][Hope And Silence In The Hive]]: A 40k speculative fic about a warp creature who represents a very.... /different/ sort of emotion. Complete, illustrated. Not /particularly/ rational, but pretty reasonable for 40k fic. The author does an amazing job of conveying alien perspectives while staying pretty true to the general grimdark tone of 40k. The actual writing could be a little bit hard to follow at times- it's unclear if the author is an ESL speaker or just not much of an editor. But I found that the point always got communicated in the end, and the concepts underlying the story were interesting enough to keep me reading to the extremely over-the-top end. There is a sequel in the works, currently incomplete.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][Onward To Providence]]: An original sci-fi story, set in an astonishingly complex and intricate universe. The author clearly loves playing with unconventional physics and depicting unusual alien biology/psychology, and it really shows- some of the most high-concept creative fiction I've read in the last couple years. At times /too/ creative, alien and "spirit" segments can be extremely hard to follow and I found myself reading and re-reading sections like they were dense prose just to try and catch what the author was getting at. Handily illustrated which helped to clear up some confusion, and the author notes also proved invaluable. Ongoing and probably nowhere near complete. It's just such a treat to read an author who isn't afraid to tackle a world where the aliens are weird to /each other/ as well as to the humans.
