** I'm very interested in reading more of Scott's writing (this immediately got added to my RSS reader) but I'm a little iffy on the premise.

*** I'll admit that I personally feel Ted Chiang has mined out the [[#s][]] but I'd love to be proved wrong.

**** I think plenty remains to do -- both of Chiang's stories are about [[#s][]] but there's plenty to say about the social effects of finding out that you live in one.

*** Agreed! Scott's past stuff is up with with Yudkowsky's best, so I'm as hyped for this as I'd be for PBDATB.

**** I'm not gonna get bothered looking for specific posts, but it's hard to call saying that calling a conservative movement racist also means you're a potential murderer, or believing the ess-jay-double-yoos are infiltrating geek culture to make fun of twue nerds, anything else than paranoid reactionary crap.

***** If you cannot produce three specific examples, then we have no reason to believe you're not just bullshitting and taking shit out of context.

Which, from what you said, you do appear to be.
