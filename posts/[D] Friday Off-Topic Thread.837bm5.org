Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** I'm uh, in a bit of a slump. I seem to go through phases, alternating between months of huge daily progress balanced out by weeks of not being able to convince myself to so much as open the code.

Doesn't help that I'm usually loathe to admit it when it happens, since that feels a lot like admitting defeat.

I've gone back and forth on whether or not the weekly threads actually help; when I'm firing on all cylinders I feel like they're a huge boost to my momentum, but when I'm on the down slide they're a rather stressful regular reminder that I've gotten nothing constructive done. And that's not hyperbole; outside of this project I tend to be in a state of work-play-sleep that is great at maintaining the status quo and not much else.

I am however always on the [[/r/rational]] discord server and will always respond to queries on the #pokengineering channel there. If I had to guess, I'd say that the current slump will last no more than about three more weeks, possibly less, but I guess we'll see.

Personally speaking, I've given up on regular updates. I think the added stress and complications on my schedule aren't worth it. I just try to be as productive as I can all the time, and budget my time on a week-by-week basis.

On the one hand, it means I haven't worked on my game project for a while. On the other hand, I'm getting things done faster on average and being less worried about them.

** Anyone [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zg][remember]] my long-winded [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7c1mov/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dpmmoj7][updates]] about working my way through the anime JoJo's Bizarre Adventure? Well I finally finished Stardust Crusaders after 3 sporadic months and feel like talking about it. It's definitely the most hit or miss arc so far, which made the 48 episode run harder to get through than the first two arcs (26 episodes combined). I like episodic monster of the week series, but this one lacks the engaging myth arc and developing character drama that I enjoy about those shows.

At the same time though, the story of JoJo has really only been an excuse for goofy set pieces and this arc has more of that than ever. The Stand battles may be formulaic and vary in quality, but I can't say they're boring to watch. The series is clinging to the plot structure established by the first two arcs where the mentor/rival figure(s) get removed from the fight, the hero pulls something out of their ass, and the useless character(s) yell in shock. Even if the characters alternate who takes which role and some episodes break the mold, my favorite being the hysterical Oingo Boingo brothers, the length and repetitiveness of the story make it harder to stay invested.

The characters could compensate for that, but I never cared much about the tour group. The plot's fixation with one-on-one fights prevents a team dynamic from forming, not that Stand powers are consistent enough for that anyway, and I had a hard time pinning down their personalities. I don't even know why Joseph was here since he rarely acts like he did last arc. Jotaro is easily my least favorite JoJo so far, no matter how much I like his cathartic “ora ora” beatdowns. I'm also sad to admit that fan favorite Polnareff never got a laugh out of me.

The comedy was a reoccurring problem in this arc for me. Listening to voice actors chew the scenery with cheesy lines isn't as funny in Japanese and the hilariously awful pronunciation of English words didn't make up for it. This was the first time I could tell characters were telling jokes instead of just acting weird, so it was disappointing that I only laughed at the slapstick gags (particularly the fight with Mariah) when the comedy was dominated by toilet humor. Case in point, I hated Iggy farting in people's faces but loved the contrived coincidences where he saved people.

With all that baggage going into the fight with Dio, who I had loved in Phantom Blood but had done nothing this whole arc, I didn't think it'd be possible for the climax to satisfy me. However, despite having the power of The World spoiled for me and not finding Dio's new appearance menacing, I still managed to get invested in the final battle and have a good time. It probably helped that I marathoned everything after entering the mansion in one sitting, so the plot's momentum and the scale of the fight distracted me from how badly I wanted the arc to end already.

I can't say Stardust Crusaders is bad or even all that disappointing by the standards set by JoJo, it just isn't as consistently good as I want it to be and that keeps me from enjoying it as much as before. It's hard to figure out what I want from JoJo since I fell in love with it for the same reasons as So Bad It's Good media, which makes its appeal hard to analyze when it isn't actually ironic. Still, even if I can't claim they were better executed I felt a lot more from the Zeppeli deaths than I did with Avdol and Kakyoin. I've spent way more time with them but feel like I know even less about them.

I'm torn over whether to recommend Stardust Crusaders as a starting point for newcomers. In many ways it does represent what JoJo is all about, has the “first season” feel of experimenting with concepts and characters, and even the lack of context for things that have been explained would prime people for how many things are never explained. On the other hand, I don't think I would've made it through the low points of this arc or accepted when the plot ran on the logic of magical martial arts if the prequels hadn't won me over first.

I don't know if it would be better to judge each arc as individual stories that just happen to take place in the same nonsensical universe because so far none of the conclusions have been as satisfying as I would've liked and that craving for more is what keeps me wanting to continue. I'll definitely be watching Diamond is Unbreakable when I get the chance, it sounds like the arc will experiment with the novel concept of character development and focus more on teamwork.

** How would you go about creating a (believable) primitive society with equality between genders? At the very least, a society that lets women have some independence, agency.

I read a long time ago that early humans transitioned from matriarchies to patriarchies when they realized the connection between intercourse and conception. Before this idea, pregnancies were maybe seen as a sort of natural phenomena. That realization of cause and effect then led inexorably to the concept of paternity.

If that's true, then seen through that lens a lot of how men came to treat women was to ensure paternity of their children. Woman are property of their father, kept 'unspoiled' until they're fertile, then 'sold' to a husband, where they're kept mostly segregated from every other male to ensure that any child is the husband's. The reason they can't own property, can't get an educations, and can't have proper careers is just a logistical problem; women would have to mingle with non-husband, non-relative men and possibly become 'contaminated'.

So. My idea of the simplest way to have a primitive society with organic gender equality would would be to have a 'magical', sure-proof paternity test, and a simple and effective contraceptive for women. Both would have to be extremely common and cheap.

If a society had both, then perhaps it wouldn't feel the need to enforce gender segregation of children starting at puberty. Adolescents having sex would no longer be a big deal. If a paternity test were customary at birth (maybe even mandatory, if a man wanted to claim parental rights?) then its possible that marriage as a social construct would no longer even be necessary.

Thoughts?

*** I read about a tribe somewhere that eats a natural abortifacient as part of their regular diet, so they never worked out the sex-pregnancy connection and had a really liberated sexual society. I don't know if this translated to more general equality or just promiscuity.

I also remember reading about "plow societies" versus "something else" societies - it was saying that once farming was invented, the work that was needed was mostly plowing which was men's work and there was enough food that the woman didn't need to work, and a man could have several wives, whereas before, hunting and gathering required more equal investments from both men and women. But I could be entirely misremembering it.

I think paternity is kind of a red herring: while pregnancy is a thing, the most relevant difference is going to be upper body strength.

I remember reading an article or essay saying that it was a pity that all the "matriarchal societies" shown in fiction simply showed women doing the "men's chores" - so they'd go fight in wars, hunt, etc while the men looked after the children. Instead, the author argued, why not invent a society where the men still hunt and fight in wars but this is considered to be dirty or disgusting or shameful, it is given less prestige (maybe hunting is dirty because of the blood, or because of the act of killing). And the act of looking after children or gathering berries is high prestige (after all, raising the next generation is pretty important; gathering berries requires a lot of observational skills/etc).

So I think if I were to do it, I'd uncouple sex from procreation, and I'd change the /prestige/ of the actions - I'd probably mix up the men's work / women's work a little, but I'd give men some low-prestige jobs (e.g. hunting) and some high prestige jobs (e.g. building), and do the same for women (low prestige: washing? high prestige: gathering).

I also remember reading about a town in Nepal or something where everyone lives in family houses that consist of sisters and brothers. The sisters go off and sleep with whoever they want to from outside the household, and then when they get pregnant, all the brothers and sisters raise the children together and the biological father has no idea.

Another society where it is believed that a baby is made from the combination of menstrual fluid and semen, kind of like a big clay sculpture: so the mother puts in some raw material and /all the men she sleeps with/ also put in raw material - so in their culture they believe the child has one mother and, say, 3 or 4 fathers depending on how many people the mother sleeps with while she's pregnant. I always thought that was interesting.

**** I had always thought hunters had higher prestige because they're the most politically relevant faction(s) in a tribal society. Since control of the majority of the men of fighting age is necessary and sufficient for control of the tribe, the majority of the spoils (including status) will go to them. In any society in which the majority of the spoils do not go to them, the opposition faction (the chief's second son, the second-largest voting bloc, whatever) could seize power by bribing the hunters with more spoils, so MOLOCH dictates that all societies must allocate all available resources to the hunters unless some active pressure prevents this from being so.

Consider a society in which the gatherers are all high status and the hunters are all low status. Wouldn't it only take one hunter uprising to flip that upside-down? And since the hunters have the weapons and the will to use them, the gatherers can do nothing to unseat them, so it would remain like that indefinitely.

I think history shows that there are PLENTY of societies where the low class could/should uprise over the high class but didn't, or didn't for a long, long time.

And the hypothetical wasn't for a matriarchal society where women are queens and men are scum; it's for one where everyone's equal. So if there's plenty of food and everyone has equal access, why have an uprising? Or, at the very least, why not wait to have the uprising until after the events of OP's story are written? ;)

**** You could have it where the men do the normal thing with hunting and building, but have the women be the ones who get good at making tools, cooking/selecting good food, and strategizing to advance over their neighbors. An organization that hoards knowledge on how to make effective tools, how to make nutritious food from surrounding material, and can undetectably poison anyone they think challenges them would be quite powerful. For example, any tribe that discovers pickling first would have an enormous advantage over any other that has to subsist on the food that can be found fresh in the winter. Or that boiling water means that you don't get sick from it, something women would be better placed to notice, and which would be difficult to reverse engineering the effect simply from the finished product.

**** I think you're on the right track, but you got lost with "prestige". It doesn't matter how people view an activity. It's about "impact". A hunter who brings in a single deer or bear provides more food than a woman harvesting berries. Yes, a diverse diet is necessary to keep people healthy, but even more important is having enough to eat in the first place.

I think in order to reach egalitarianism, the society needs to have decoupled strength and utility. If a strong child is more important to society than an intelligent child, irrespective of sex, then the sexes aren't equal.

Maybe there is an equilibrium where social pressures provide feedback to counteract the disparate impact of gender-specific differences, but I can't see what it is. Part of the problem is that such social pressures can be abused, leading to non-egalitarian outcomes. I think it would be a lot easier to come up with a matriarchal society, but even then... maybe if the rules made men a liability to the society as a whole? I can imagine a few ways, but I'd have to put more brain time on this.

Yeah, but a woman teaching a child to walk, talk, hunt, cooking, making clothing, etc does more than a hunter who brings in a single deer; something can be vital and yet undervalued (just look at our society).

Besides, a hunter-gatherer "hunter" is probably not one guy with a bow bringing down several deer in a day; it's probably several men working together like a wolf pack. Realistically you're looking at several men going on a hunting expedition for several days and bringing back one or two deer. Which might be providing a good percentage of the calories, but in the meantime they're neglecting the camp.

Easy to justify it as being undervalued - I mean, we're all familiar with the stereotype of fathers who work all day and never see their children, and then try to "buy their love" with expensive gifts when really all the kid wants is quality time.

That just amplifies the impact. As the food reserves dwindle, they do so everywhere. You can't go to your neighbor and borrow anything, because everyone's bellies are tightening. Either the hunters return with food, or everyone continues to starve. In such a situation, the effective hunters will easily be able to convert their skill into social status.

Compare with someone who is really good at domestic chores. It's like... in today's world, having a good manager. Everything just runs smoothly and you don't even notice how much their work affects you. These people, while valuable, have a much harder time getting recognized for their work.

** Just wondering how would you "optimize" a rational fiction character? What type of personality traits, general skill set, career path etc. should one have to survive and thrive despite being transplanted across a variety of different rational fiction settings?

I suppose what I'm asking for are commonalities across successful viewpoint-characters in rational fiction, before they grow into the setting.

The best I could come up with is an optimistic chemical engineer-turned-used car salesman in his 30s, with excellent memory for details. The sort of natural down-on-his-luck appeal to the writer/audience into treating him favourably, optimistic enough to take some hopeful risks, old enough to avoid unnecessary ones, an engineering background for creative problem-solving, and sufficient people skills to make friends or pull off some funny business.

*** I agree that "chemical engineer" is probably the best background to have. In individual settings, depending on magic system, physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians might have an advantage, but for pure utility, you can't beat chemical engineering.

Mech or electrical engineering is strictly dominated because in any situation, either you need to build your tech base from scratch (so you need a working knowledge of chemical processes) or you already have a working tech/magic base, in which case a purer field is likely more helpful for learning an advanced, but divergent technology base.

***** For rational fics set somewhere less advanced than earth, You need to build the tools to build the tools to build the tools to uplift society. And in order to do that, you need to have a decent knowledge of a number of chemical processes, e.g., the bessemer process, smelting pig iron, how to alloy to make stainless steel chemicals to make electric reactions, etcetera. Mech or electrical engineers will know some of that stuff, but not as much of it as a chemical engineer.

Alternatively, in a rationalfic setting that has roughly equal technology level to ours, but different setting rules (i.e., magic or divergent physics), what matters is the mindset a career path puts you in. "Purer" fields (mathematics, physics, computer science) tend to provide the best backing for working under constrained rulesets. The engineering disciplines are on the same general tier, which means chemical engineering is still better.

And for a mostly real-world setting, chemical engineers have a median wage of about $98,000, which is all you really need to know.
