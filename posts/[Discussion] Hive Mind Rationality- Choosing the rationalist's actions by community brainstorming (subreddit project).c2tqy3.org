Hello [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

*Disclaimer*

I have no idea if people will actually be interested in this idea and it might die in new with 3 upvotes and a comment. But please try to at least read the first few paragraphs to see what I'm talking about before you dismiss the idea.

*Edit- about similarities to "questing"*

As many have pointed out in the comments (special thanks to [[/u/Adeen_Dragon][u/Adeen_Dragon]]), this is highly similar to a quest, like Naruto Marked for Death. I did not know those things were common or that they have a name, otherwise I would have used it.

The key difference between my idea and quests is that this "game" will be PvP. Different rational characters in the story will have different motivations and will be from different sides, and will be controlled by different teams of players. I'm still working on the logistics of making plans secret etc', but I truly believe this can work.

*Hive mind rationality*

I am fairly new to knowing the term rational fiction and actively seeking stories of this type, but I've always liked intelligent characters who act rationally in literature. Finding out Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality was probably one of the best experiences in my life.

What got me thinking was chapter 113 (I'll avoid spoilers, if you read it you know what I mean). Eliezer acknowledged the fact that he is just a single person, and that Harry at that point of the novel was already more intelligent than him. Therefore, he could not simulate Harry's actions the way he wanted to. Instead of hand waving a solution that might not be optimal, he reached out to the community and asked for possible solutions. Combining some of the best ideas people gave, Eliezer created a fitting solution that felt very very smart, and didn't miss any detail.

The power of a hive mind, a community thinking together how to solve a problem, is significantly higher than that of a single author, no matter how smart.

So why don't we take this to the next level?

*Rational Fiction Community Project*

My idea was creating a community project, where the rational characters are "played" by a team of readers that give ideas on what they would do in place of the character, with the character's knowledge and motivations.

At the beginning of the project, the lead author will create the setting, the characters and their initial motivations. Those motivations need to be realistic, but the characters' knowledge of the world should not be perfect. For example, the lead author will know since the beginning the true nature of magic in HPMOR, but Harry (and the Harry team, brainstorming his actions) will not.

For a period of time between chapters, readers that are part of the team will post ideas (maybe on a subreddit, maybe in private messages, I haven't decided yet and open to ideas). When the period is over, the lead author will read the ideas and decide what the character will do, in a way that is rational but also helps advance the plot he has in mind.

Basically, the novel will be some kind of a roleplay game, where every character is played by multiple people trying to think of the best course of action.

I have no idea if this will work, or if the result will be fun to read, but I would really like to try.

*Pilot Project- Avatar the Last Airbender*

My proposal in this thread is to create a pilot project, where we can test the idea and see if its working.

If enough people are interested (like at least 5 per character team), I will open private subreddits for each character (for example [[/r/RationalSokka][r/RationalSokka]] for team Sokka). We will have maybe 3 days discussion periods and then I will take 4 days writing period and we will have a chapter every week.

I chose the world of A:TLA because I wanted a setting that people are familiar with, or at least can be familiarized with quickly. Instead of worldbuilding myself. Also, because the characters in A:TLA are already pretty smart and I think the series written in a rational form would do it justice without ruining the existing charm of the characters.

However, I have changed some things in the setting, especially inconsistencies. I have also planned a big twist that actually could have made sense in the original series, but its supposed to be a secret so I will not write here what it is.

*The setting*

Note that some things here are slightly changed from the series, especially the capabilities of bending which I made more consistent and in my opinion balanced. Also, the information here is the in-world consensus. Perhaps some things here are actually false (like the fact that partial transfiguration in Harry Potter is impossible but in HPMOR it turned out to be possible).

This is gonna be a long section, a good tl;dr is the [A:TLA wiki page ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender]])

The world is divided to 4 nations- the fire nation, the water tribes, the earth kingdom and the air nomads, the latter being mostly extinct. People inside the nations can be non-benders, who are just regular folk, and benders- special people who are able to control one of the classical elements at will.

In the fire nation, people can bend fire. They can create flames around and in front of them in shapes and intensity they control. The flames are the temperature of a basic campfire, which means they will cause significant burns if they touch skin or even come close to it. Some advanced fire benders are also able to create lightnings and direct them at targets.

In the water nation, people can bend water. They can control bodies of water, lifting and throwing them or reshaping them.

In the earth nation, people can bend earth. They can lift rocks and pieces of the ground up and manipulate them, or throw them.

In the air nation, people can bend air. They can create streams and gusts of air and manipulate air in different ways.

The strength of a bender's bending, that is, how strong the Newtonian forces he can apply on material are, is determined by exercise. Lifting the same water blob up multiple times every day will increase the strength of the bender's bending for every technique he uses. This is like training a muscle.

The control of a bender's bending, that is, how precisely the bender can manipulate materials, is determined by practice. Practicing creating a small ring from a rock will not improve bending strength much (its not a lot of bending strain) but it will improve the bender's skill in creating better rings in the future.

The energy of a bender's bending, that is, how much change they are able to make in the world, cannot be changed. It depends on where they drain their bending from. Fire benders can only create heat from heat near them. Air earth and water benders need to eat a lot to be able to bend a lot (they have evolved biologically to be able to eat about 100 times more than the average non bender per day, but don't require it if they don't bend).

A special bender exists at all times, the Avatar, the only person in the world who can bend all 4 elements. When he dies, another one is born in the next nation according to the cycle water -> earth -> fire -> air -> water.

​

100 years before the story begins, the fire nations decided to attack the other nations. They knew the next Avatar should be an air nomad so they committed genocide on the air nomads, killing them all (or so they thought). The actual Avatar has managed to escape, and was frozen in an iceberg for 100 years. The story begins when Sokka and Katara, brother and sister from the southern water tribe, find Aang's iceberg and break him free. The 3 go on a quest to defeat the fire lord Ozai and restore peace and balance to the world.

​

We will have 5 rational characters in the novel. The rest will be realistic, but not as intelligent. I have chosen some of the characters because they already were intelligent in the original series, and some because it helps move the general plot I have in mind. Also note- the motivations are detailed here as they are in the beginning of the novel. They might (and probably will) change.

- Sokka- Katara's non-bender brother. His motivations- defeat fire lord Ozai to restore peace and balance to the world.
- Iroh- the brother of Fire Lord Ozai and uncle of Zuko. His motivations- mainly for Zuko to grow up a good person, but also he has some loyalty to his brother and his nation.
- Zuko- the banished son of Fire Lord Ozai. His motivations- find the Avatar and bring him to his father, to restore his honor.
- Azula- Fire Lord Ozai's daughter. Her motivations- hidden. Team Azula will know them, but the rest won't.
- Long Fang- the Dai Li (a secret police) in Ba Sing Se (Earth kingdom city, the largest in the world). His motivations- also hidden.

​

*Final Words*

I hope this idea interests at least a few of you. I will kindly ask you to reflect your opinions on two matters:

1. What do you think about the hive mind rationality idea in general? Even if you don't plan on taking part in the pilot, do you think it can work, do you have suggestions, etc'?
2. Would you like to take part in the A:TLA pilot project? If you do, that's awesome! Please comment here and make sure to mention which team of the 5 rational characters do you want to be on. Also, if you are *really* interested to the point you want to be co-lead author with me, that would be really great because by no means do I claim to be a good writer. In that case, PM me and we will see if we can maybe work together.

Thank you so much for reading this long post!

  You really can't just drop this fact in there like it wasn't anything. Considering we're already going with magical wuxia physics, there's no need to mix in mundane reality like this because that makes the worldbuilding go donkeyfuck. If you still want it to be rationalist after that, you need to account for it and that would end up with a wildly divergent setting.
#+end_quote

I didn't intend to drop it like it wasn't anything. Yes, there are big differences between this AU and the canon A:TLA. The reason for this specific detail was to avoid very quick world-breaking ideas I had while watching the show regarding what can be done with bending.

#+begin_quote
  If you absolutely need to explain this for whatever reason, just say benders and chi using non-benders draw their energy from the spirit world.
#+end_quote

This is going to be a spoiler for some of the plot I had in mind, but the spirit world is not actually real, its psychological, and the characters are supposed to understand this at some point of the story.

This is for the same reason I inserted the anecdote about the exact amount of food benders can eat. My own personal preference is for hard-scifi. From point A in the universe you can predict what point B will look like in 10 seconds, if you know the rules. And I want the rules to be as close to real life rules so its easier to understand the physics.

Hence, conservation of energy is still a thing in this AU. Bending energy comes from food. I calculated how much calories are needed to produce about 5 short lightnings per day.

​

I realize this may come from a personal bias I have towards physics system as close as possible to real life. If this is not something the community wants, I can change it. If it breaks the game in some way, I'll definitely change it.

Thanks for your input!

**** I mean... the characters actually encounter and fight spirit-world entities in the series. Unless by "it's psychological" you mean "it's a plane created by human thought," which is fine, but still allows magical energy to flow from it to the material plane.

I get wanting to keep conservation of energy, but I agree it's so much neater to say "bender energy comes from this massive external source" than "benders eat their bodyweight in food every day," which breaks the setting way more and might even negate the use of bending. Most benders in the series aren't 100x as wealthy as muggles, and as useful as a bender is to have around, they're not more useful than 100 people.

**** I've gotta agree with others; wanting to keep conservation of energy is one thing, but needing to eat that much food would be a logistical nightmare for any civilization built on bending. But perhaps there's a way to keep both attributes?

For starters, what if there's a rich source of energy in food that normal humans can't digest, but benders can? There's certainly precedent for this; there are many things other species can extract energy from that we don't have the biological ability to do so, although I don't /think/ there's some latent source of energy in our food that would be equivalent to eating 100x as much. But there's no reason there COULDN'T be, there just doesn't happen to ACTUALLY be. It could explain the discrepancy in power without changing the logistics much. As a side effect, benders would probably be much more capable of surviving on very little food as long as they didn't bend (though unless they're getting enough vitamins and such they will eventually have problems), but I don't think that's nearly as huge of a thing as having to eat 100 times as much to be able to bend.

As for why benders are so biologically different from nonbenders, well, that's gonna depend on what your explanation for how bending even works in your setting within the laws of physics. I'm assuming not a simulation run by some entity that arbitrarily cares about what people would do under these conditions, because that's way too easy, and nanotechnology programmed by some entity that arbitrarily wants people to have these specific powers is in a similar boat, so personally I think SOME derivation from the laws of physics would be the best option, though I agree it should be kept as small as possible: ideally one simple new thing that can explain everything you want bending to be able to do (and can make useful predictions useable by your players) while explaining why the things you DON'T want it to be able to do are impossible. Unless you happen to have some really clever-yet-plausible way for bending to make sense within the real laws of physics that is also both satisfying narratively for your players to discover and makes useful predictions that they can utilize, in which case I would be seriously impressed and you should use that. I think it's probably possible, but it'd certainly be a very difficult task.

Alternatively, you could extend the firebenders' mechanic to others, where EVERYONE needs to get their energy from their element. Airbenders would get it from cooling down the air around them, waterbenders from the water (possibly water in the air), earth from geological processes, etc.

SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity are great websites for quests, and Questionable Questing is for all NSFW questing.

Marked for Death comes highly recommended on this forum, being an explicit attempt at a rational quest. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/]]

The Erogamer also comes highly recommended for how it realistically portrays people being forced into ‘Porn Logic' situations. As a heads up, Questionable Questing requires an account to view posts in the nsfw section. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/]]

***** /Erogame/ logic, in story porn logic is something distinct and different, an ero game has to at least have a coherent storyline, with characters, goals, and progression. This is a pretty essential part of the quest, so I feel calling it porn logic is a bit of a downgrade, as literally anything can happen in porn, no matter how absurd, so long as it leads to sex. This isn't the case in eroge, as is expounded on in detail by the Quest.

I might add that the Erogamer is probably one of my favorite things ever, so I'm a bit biased.

I second recommendations of mfd. Oh and also vetch and radvic are going to write a Zelda one soon too.

Also I warn you that people here are likely to munchkin whatever magic system we get our hands on untill it breaks, see mfd ideas like implosion nukes, skywalkers or whipguns.

**** A PvP situation would be rather unique, I'd have to say.

I'd be interested in participating, but I'd suggest some caution. Any direct combat would probably have to be decided by dice rolls (albeit obviously with modifiers). For example: Team Zuko has found team Avatar on the Avatar Island. Team Zuko has decided to launch most of their ship's fuel reserves to the battlefield in order to have something to burn, and is holding the town hostage in order to provoke a fight. Team Avatar has an advantage by having a surplus of water, this being an island, but moving enough water to quench fires will quickly exhaust their food reserves.

Who wins? To me, this kind of combat would a lot of number crunching and back and forth between the players. Does Team Zuko actually burn down the town, or is it just a bluff. When does team Avatar decide to retreat? After team Zuko has left, or do they leave him to burn down the town at his leisure?

How in detail will each team's supply trains be? The fire nation here as a distinct advantage that most things are burnable while most things are not edible.

I'd love to participate though.

My original thoughts were for the lead author to decide what's actually happening during the fight after the players decide their plans, and only if someone objects to the way I made things happen we will have a discussion or perhaps a dice roll.

The decisions will be made by the players. The outcomes will be determined by the lead author probably, based on parameters that should mostly be given beforehand (the shape of the island, how much fuel Zuko has).

You are correct, however the key difference is that Zuko does not have access to the fire nation's economy while Sokka has access to the water and earth nation's resources (at least potentially).

**** That is an interesting idea and I have though about it sometimes though I suspect the reason it doesn't usually happens is that there are lots more "logistical" problems in running a pvp. Especially in the usual formums people do quests on, since you would have to prevent people from voting in the two places, you can't easily keep what one team is doing secret from one another, you need double the people voting for it to work and that kind of stuff.

But it could be really fun if you can actually make it work.

**** No problem. I've experienced far too many quest threads etc. that tried to be too grand and feature-rich yet end up spinning out of control of the DM and burning itself out before it got anywhere interesting. Even Andrew Hussie's MS Paint Adventures and Homestuck end up dragging out far too long (you might want to skim those a bit for some ideas how to run yours).

You might also want to browse a few quest forums or PM some of the more accomplished quest writers on Sufficient Velocity/SpaceBattle for tips on mechanics like dice rolling combat. yrsillar (Forge of Destiny) and Saphrith (Fate Denied) were some of the quest writers recommended to me before on this sub.

I really do think starting small and gradually expanding it up would let you familiarise yourself with how to run one of these quest things. And perhaps the most tricky thing you're doing is trying to run multiple viewpoints at once, FIVE characters which means trawling through FIVE threads full of posts is a huge workload and probably too much for one person. You'll never really know how chaotic it gets until you actually experience it though, so starting a small week/month-long storylet with one viewpoint only is what I suggest until you get yourself in the zone.

  Fire benders can only create heat from heat near them.

Two things jump out at me:

1: Fire bending is still a good source of energy in practice because you can make a temperature gradient and run (e.g.) a Stirling engine off of it.

2: Since campfires are several times hotter than normal air, the region of air cooled should be far larger than the flame, and using it would likely be the main combat ability for fire benders.

** Coming back to this, your team roster is actually well thought out (every character has distinct advantages to draw players), but I do think that if possible, it'd be nice to expand it slightly if there are enough interested players. In particular, it suffers from lack of a waterbender, as well as having only one earthbender, in comparison to three firebenders! One nonbender is probably the right amount, but I think a waterbender and a second earthbender would be good additions.

The waterbender, I'm not sure who would be, but it can't be Katara since access to the avatar is TeamSokka's big advantage to make up for not being a bender.

For the second earthbender, may I suggest Bumi, the "mad genius"?
