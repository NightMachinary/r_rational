Hey everyone. I've been on this sub for a bit and have run into a problem: I seem to have read all of the ratfic that can be easily found from here that is within a fandom I know about/enjoy (also Luminosity and MLP:FIO when those ran out), and need more things to read. So do any of you have lesser recommended but still awesome ratfic, or, at this point, really just anything outside the usual 90% of awful? Thanks so much.


** I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Antropology]]. It's about Hermione Grange being sorted into Slytherin.

I also really love [[http://ttshieronym.tumblr.com/][To the Stars]]. I think it's worth to read even if you aren't into Madoka Magica.

**** Well worth it, To The Stars is fantastic :-)

The series is somewhat decent. I'm not sure my mental image of the incubators would be anywhere near as creepy if I'd not watched the anime.

**** It was last updated in april this year. I haven't given up hope. But it already spans the content of several HP-books, so I think it's worth a read even if it never get finished (but then I seem to mind dead fics less than others do).

*** I usually share your taste but Dreaming of Sunshine completely railroads the plot to canon and abhors changes in the status quo. It's not really a good fic.

**** Matter of taste, I guess. It has excellent characterization, clever use of magic, great fights with plenty of munchkinry in them, and an intelligent protagonist who solves problems with her brain. I'd say it's a good fic.

***** Fair enough, so what I've read thus far is (for the most part) HPMOR, FIO, Luminosity, Bluer Shade of White, Metropolitan Man, Wildbow's stuff, Nat 20, The Arithmancer, Blindness, Pokemon Origin of Species, and most of the MOR meta fic. At present I am looking for fanfic rather than original, and things I have deliberately given a pass include Time Braid and Animorphs the Reckoning due to lack of knowledge of canon, and Branches on the Tree of Time for lack of interest in the premise. Hopefully this helps.

****** From my comment in the linked thread, here are my recommendations minus stuff you've read:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 year emperor]] is great

Oh and also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/][the gamer vs RWBY]] was great; it's long as hell but the main storyline's unfinished.

There's also [[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][Zombie knight]] that's sort of like this, though the powering up is a bit bumpy.

[[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional brain chip]] is worth a mention, though it's not a fantasy setting.

Also, this isn't in that comment but [[http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character.9848/][these]] two [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character-for-real-this-time.20591/][stories]] are pretty good--"no matter what happens, I still won't become an anime character."

** Saga of Soul Not fanfiction, though it is pretty rational, as well as scientific, also deals with people getting powers and how world changes because of them. Word of warning, the author has stopped updating, he said it's not abandoned, just on a long break. But it has plenty to read though.
