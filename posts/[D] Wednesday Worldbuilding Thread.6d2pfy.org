Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** /(previously on: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh6mmoh/?context=3][decunstructing and explaining card games in order to transform them into viable story settings)]]/

What if each card is a separate contract of its own with a demon or somesuch that is not tied to a specific demonologist but, rather, to the person who's currently in possession of the card?

Things that can be explained through this:

- a wide variety of arbitrary rules and restrictions the cards have, including the amount of influence on the real world and the rules by which the cards can be “played” against each other (defined details of the contract);
- cards of singular and multiple usage (respectively demons who are suspectible to dying after being summoned into our world and demons who will just get their physical forms destroyed when they are “killed” in a card fight);
- crafting of new cards (negotiating a new deal with a new demon);

  - discovering rare and completely unique cards and abilities;

- impartiality of the gaming system in general;
- multiple units of the same type being used simultaneously (multiple dimensions, or multiple incarnations of the same demon, or both).

*** Some random thoughts:

There are at least two hard problems with card game stories:

- Lucky draws matter a lot. This is part of what makes real card games fun, but it feels a lot like the author fiating the result of a fight when it happens in fiction. (See: all of Yu-Gi-Oh!.)

- Readers don't want to memorize dozens of cards. This means that they're often seeing cards for the first time when they're played in-universe, which makes it feel kind of random -- "oh, OK, the author made up /that/ power to make the fight arbitrarily harder, I guess that's a thing now". It also means that it's hard to have fights resolved by clever rules interactions and have that feel satisfying, because most readers won't have enough knowledge to feel like they could have seen the interaction beforehand.

Cards as demonic contracts sounds like a super cool idea, but I worry that it would be especially vulnerable to the second problem: the scope of contracts is so large it will start to feel kind of arbitrary. (Pact had this problem, if you've read it.) If you can find a way to solve that then I think the story would be great.

(Actually, I'd probably read a story with this setting even if you /didn't/ solve that problem, so hey.)

** I've been working on a superhero setting with the usual kitchen sink approach, but I want to put my own spin on mutants rather than copy X-Men wholesale. The main reason to include mutants is so I can be lazy with origin stories and not have to explain how some characters got their powers. I'm not as interested in using them as a metaphor for racial minorities, instead I've been using metahumans in general as a metaphor for immigrants.

I want to be more creative than say mutants just have a gene that gives them superpowers, though. Every other power source I've included has a bit more detail in how it works and why it exists. I considered saying mutants are conduits for some extradimensional energy source, but I'm kind of already doing that with the Superman-analog and would at least want to use a different dimension that isn't as picky about who gets powers.

One suggestion I've already heard is that mutants were abducted by aliens at some point in their lives, but I lack an explanation for why aliens would be interested in handing out superpowers to humans seemingly at random. Perhaps some malfunctioning Atlantean technology that was accidentally reactivated and had the job of distributing powers for some reason that benefitted the civilization before it was destroyed.

Another idea I came up with is to rip off Shadowrun and the webcomic Skin Deep. Mutants are really the descendants of magical creatures who bred with or turned into humans and can change back under certain circumstances. If I go this route I'd call them Changelings and could explain them not being common before the 1900s by requiring them to be relatively well-fed in order to awaken and tap into their race's latent magic.

Now that I wrote that last one out, it's definitely my favorite. It provides a unique overarching theme, lends itself to a lot of diversity, adds to the worldbuilding of why magic became myth if it was real, explains why focus can be placed on rich countries, still provides the opportunity to hit the same notes that X-Men did about being born the way they were, and could provide some interesting drama between changelings and "real monsters".

It even ties into another part of the world I was putting a lot of detail in, the Dresden Files-inspired Underground. I originally had governments give magical secret societies jurisdiction over magical affairs just because they saved the world from an apocalyptic threat, but the rising population of changelings would be another great reason to help magical communities expand their control and fund the monster hunting police.

So it would appear I answered my own question while writing it out. Oops. Well, I'll post it anyway since I like what I've come up with and will never object to more people talking to me about this project of mine. I'm writing the setting for the tabletop RPG Base Raiders since I love the premise of the game but wasn't as big a fan of the worldbuilding and backstory. I am open to more crazy ideas and have all day free to answer questions.

This is also interesting.

Another possible explanation: In the comic /The One/, it's suggested that the Cold War and the associated perpetual threat of a nuclear holocaust had a psychological effect on the people of that time. It draws on some IRL psychological theory, if I recall correctly, but in the comic this is the explanation for some of the weird metaphysical stuff.

Anyhow, you could also point to that, or to similar extremes (like the stress of living in massive cities or even the rapid pace of technological change) that have only cropped up relatively recently, to explain why their magic hasn't come to the fore.

**** I had considered tying changelings to the specific event, such as a villain performing a magical ritual, but I prefer the idea that it's something that really couldn't be prevented and can't be undone. There's no person or organization to blame, it just wasn't until recently that the human population was large enough and healthy enough for changelings to start appearing in force.

The Cold War will probably come into play in plenty of other ways, but there's an arms control treaty that prevents nations from creating or conscripting metahumans. After Veit Cong sorcerers inadvertently summoned the devil and governments needed to ask vigilantes and wizards to prevent the apocalypse, everyone agreed things had gotten out of hand.

There's still plenty of other weirdness in this setting: the Gulf War was fought with large-scale teleporters and mind control towers, a cyborg samurai killed Cthulhu after it was summoned by alien invaders, the center of the Earth is a member of the UN, religious orders have been deputized to police monsters, and there's a country-sized refugee camp for Martians.

**** I wouldn't mind including the Atlantean ship for something else, perhaps for my own spin on Marvel's Inhumans, but I can't come up with a rational reason why it would randomly give people powers long after its creators have died. In what way is it malfunctioning and how was it eventually deactivated?

I conceived of Atlantis as a generic precursor civilization that had spanned the globe, if not further, in prehistoric times, but was destroyed by a godlike entity called Nemesis. Some Atlantean magitech remains buried beneath the Earth's surface and is very dangerous. That's about all I came up with.

Since the premise of the game is about all major heroes and villains vanishing a year ago, it would work best for the ship to have been stopped before the game begins. There could even be an adventure hook about reactivating the ship to empower more people or destroying it before someone else uses it.

*** How about this for a change:

All humans are actually born with the potential to develop superpowers when they become adults. However, accidents, injuries, traumas, diseases, etc. all cause this potential to disappear, so it was practically impossible for anyone to still have potential by the time they become an adult.

Until now.

With the development of scientific and medical technologies, more and more youths are being raised in extremely safe conditions, no more child labor, no more violence, no more starvation or illness. These people who have lived in such peace are the ones who develop superpowers.

It would be a nice twist from all the other superpower comics where people get their powers from stress/accidents. Would also greatly shift the plot: e.g., there can't be the standard "kidnapped superchildren in a research lab" story arc, because being kidnapped is a kind of stress that removes the potential for developing superpowers. They can only study adults who have gotten full-blown powers.

**** Cool idea, but it doesn't quite fit with the setting I'm going for. I want things to be goofy and silly. Applying that kind of rule to superpowers could be an awkward constraint on a world designed to be a crazy weird sandbox where anything can happen that exists for the players to do whatever they want with the resources at their disposal.

Testing.

The aliens want to see which (if any) superpowers are safe to apply to themselves, so they find a bunch of barely sapient primitives on some backwater planet that's not on the list of protected intelligent species (thus avoiding all the alien medical ethics committees) and pick out random schmucks to hand out superpowers to so they can see which powers are stable and useful. (One in five of their victims survive the process, on average, though that ratio will get better with time).

--------------

Trolling.

The aliens that hand out powers are the equivalent of a bunch of university students who went off on a holiday and had a bit too much to drink. They hand out a bunch of randomly selected powers to randomly selected planets on a drunken bet. (When the university authorities catch up with them, they will be Not Impressed and might reverse the powers presented to Earth. This could be anytime from 'tomorrow' to 'in seventeen thousand years', depending on exactly how long these aliens consider a suitable time for a holiday.)

--------------

Socio-historic research.

The aliens have long since mastered the handing-out-superpowers technology, but one particular group has recently obtained a research grant to study the long-term effects of superpowers on a primitive society. They picked out their society, carefully handed out superpowers as per experimental protocol, and are now sitting back - well out of sight, and probably cloaked as well - and observing the resultant changes to society. They're taking very good notes, but are unwilling to intervene and mess up their experimental data.

******* Hmmmm... yeah, and I can see how those first two could work together. The earliest aliens would be the researchers, looking to try out bleeding-edge super-power-granting tech... and then a bunch of fully super-powered students out on a bender with the by-then commonly available power-granting tech could pass by a few decades later. The first lot of supers would then have the more buggy powers - strength that's significantly greater than human norm but /fluctuates/ unpredictably, or a form of invulnerability that comes with a crippling weakness to some common or household item, or the ability to generate arbitrary heat by touch without being in any way immune to heat. While the students would have bug-free, somewhat idiot-proofed power-up devices... but probably just fire them at random people walking along the street.

******** That makes even more sense than you realize. In old comics, a character's powers could be really inconsistent and come with really bizarre weaknesses. It'd even justify Silver Age stories where spaceships filled with random magic stuff are constantly crashing on Earth. Turns out the pilots under the influence.

After the heroes and government became more organized around planetary defense, on account of the Veitnam War fiasco, they would've put a stop to alien hooligans. The only ones still empowering humans would be more careful and hand out better-made powers, or maybe some humans got a hold of the tech.

I still need details, though. What do I call metahumans empowered this way? There's no way they wouldn't form some kind of subculture after they discovered this. What are the aliens called and what's their society like? I've already made a couple alien cultures, both from other planets and other universes.

Martians are nomadic shapeshifters with advanced biotechnology who started coming to Earth as refugees in the 50s, Lyutians are imperialists who came to invade Earth during the 80s but many army deserters and defectors still live here, and The Evil Cube Army are /slightly/ less murderous Daleks.

There's also the Celestial Federation, which is a hugely diverse transhumanist society (think Samurai Jack or Gintama) ruled by the DBZ-esque Immortals. It's not too much of a stretch to say these aliens are just rowdy kids and criminals from worlds that look like a cross between Star Wars and the Avatar shows.

In neither case are the aliens /talking/ to their victims/experimental subjects. So I guess people would have to come up with their own names.

"The Empowered" might be an option.

Well... I don't see how it really makes a difference what the aliens are called. I guess if they don't use a universal translator, then you can just go with any jumble of letters, and if they /do/ have a universal translator, then it'll come out as "The True People" or "The Seekers After Knowledge" or something along those lines.

Their society? Well - I guess that by the modern day, they've got devices that give superpowers. So, presumably they've also all got superpowers. If the superpowers are compatible, then they've got /all/ the superpowers - if the powers are not compatible, then they probably have some means of switching them, enabling these aliens to have any power they want as easily as you or I might change a shirt (as long as they retain access to their technological mcguffin - and assuming that they can afford to buy one). And... they've obtained that capability recently, so their society is probably still in a massive state of flux as it tries to adjust for this.

...on top of that, they have casual space travel. They probably never revolt against their leaders, rather simply moving out and starting a new colony somewhere else if they disagree with local policies (their means of colonisation probably involves dropping a small technological device on the planet, then ten minutes later they have a house with all modern conveniences and mutter angrily under their breath about the ten minute wait)

** I've seen a number of stories about protagonists who claw their ways out of hell to seek vengeance upon those who put them there, and I couldn't help but wonder: what if they didn't need to crawl out of hell to get their revenge?

So I've been thinking of a story where one day, the Grim Reaper decides to offer everyone a "Reap One Get One Free" deal. Specifically, whenever you die, the Grim Reaper will offer you the chance to kill any *one* person of your choice. So for example, if you died because someone stabbed you, you can ask the Grim Reaper to have that someone die.

Assume the Grim Reaper is very accommodating, so even if you don't know the person's name, you can say "The person who wished for me to die", and the Grim Reaper will either kill that person, or tell you to try something else if there is zero or more than one person that matches the description.

The problem is that as currently set up, this looks very much like all of humanity will be wiped out in a chain reaction before any story can get started. For example, if someone asks the Grim Reaper to kill someone who is driving a bus, the bus would go out of control and everyone on board or hit by the bus could also die, allowing them to all choose more people for the Grim Reaper to kill.

The Grim Reaper's deal needs some additional restrictions so that this doesn't happen. I still want everyone to be offered the deal, so I'm looking for restrictions on who they are allowed to ask the Grim Reaper to kill, or perhaps how the Grim Reaper's killings occur. I'm looking for suggestions on what kinds of restrictions would allow most people to get their vengeance, while not ending the human race.

They don't have to be perfect: some people may fall through the cracks, never getting their revenge, while others may munchkin the rules, like for example, hiring terminally ill people as assassins, giving their families large amounts of cash if they ask the Grim Reaper to kill a given target.

*** What if it was the exact opposite, and you had to leave /heaven/ to kill somebody?

By default, every natural death (no matter how moral/immoral the person is) sends the person to heaven, but once there you can choose to send yourself and one other person (whether in heaven or on Earth) straight to hell. Because they were never in heaven, the targets never have a chance to perpetuate the chain, leading to a x2 death rate at worst.

This is easily resolved; the Grim Reaper is doing a "Reap One Get /One/ Free" deal, not a "Reap One Get One Plus Collateral Damage Free" deal. So the Reaper personally ensures that there is no /lethal/ collateral damage. Either by waiting for the driver to stop the bus and giving him a heart attack, or by magically ensuring that everyone survives the resultant crash. (Mind you, the Reaper doesn't much care about preventing, say, paralysis from the neck down).

That also allows a way to prevent the chain reaction problem - that people who are reaped 'free' do not get a vengeance target at all. (And those who name a target that's already dead simply lose out).

*** I don't think chain reactions are going to wipe out humanity. People are already given many opportunities to kill other people and civilization doesn't collapse. It's reasonable to suppose most people will simply choose not to exploit the ROGOF offer. Moreover, even a small proportion of nonreapers can dampen reaping chains to a non-civilization-destroying level -- if 10% of people don't reap, then each natural death only results in ~10 reapings, ignoring collateral damage. Collateral damage won't be such a problem since society will adapt to the reapings and ensure nobody is in a position to accidentally kill somebody else if they die. In fact, other than while driving people are rarely in such a position already. If the Grim Reaper introduced this suddenly I expect a major worldwide roadside disaster before people figure to get off the roads, but I don't expect it will wipe out humanity and there's a decent chance it won't destroy civilization.
