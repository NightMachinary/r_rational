In the rational community, most of us value intelligence, to the point where some of us have explored using currently available drugs to increase it, if possible. I suspect most of us, if given the chance to take a pill that made us smarter without any side effects, would jump at the opportunity.

What I'd like to discuss is slightly different. Suppose a pill was developed that could significantly increase human mental capabilities. Intelligence, concentration, memory, reaction time all shoot dramatically upward in a person that ingests it; one of the world's leading physicists tried it for a month shortly after it came out and published a working theory of quantum gravity shortly thereafter, and an ordinary Joe with a hobby of mathematics solved one of the Millennium problems within a year of starting the drug. It's affordable, easy to get, and the only problem is- [X].

Now, my question is: how severe would [X] have to be for you before you decide it would be better not to take it? Addiction? Ance, breaking out all over your body? Death by withdrawal if you miss a dose? What?

** I don't know if their is something that would stop me. With the level of boost you are talking about, even if it killed me I might still take it. I've never considered myself particularly intelligent, but if it could let an average Joe like me jump humanity forward a substantial amount then I would take it. death is bad but since it seems like I will not be alive by the time we figure out immortality, then it is better I try to make us get to that point faster.

The above is my gut reaction answer, but really taking time to think about it... I don't know. I don't know how bad the penalty would have to be, or if I even would have the will power to apply myself and accomplish anything important after taking the drug.

The things that wound give me pause on whether or not to take it...

- A huge diminish in life span (kills you in a year or so)
- Permanent mental disability (dementia or being unable to care for the well being of others)
- Loss of control of body (being unable to move and only able to think)

*** It seems problematic, to me, to assume that the mental boost itself wouldn't qualify here. That subtle shift you suggest seems like a direct consequence, not a side effect, as the boosting effects really would make un-boosted humans more like ants -- programmed automatons. It would definitely make it harder to relate to those who aren't boosted -- social interaction would -not- be on an even basis, and it would become even more imbalanced as the gains compound.

Social interaction becoming purely a too-easy game that the boosted are nonetheless required to play, seems to me a likely outcome, and of course when you're stuck with something too easy you start experimenting to make it more interesting.

I'm not sure if this makes any more sense.

***** .. What? Of course everyone actually are automatons, so what? I regret I have only one downvote to give.

Consider the level of boosting we are talking about. It's specifically significant; it's not just slightly smarter (which can be illusory in a sense that intelligence is made up of multiple skills, you can be bad at some of those and still 'look smart').

This is exactly the same argument that is used in discussion about AI existential risk. When the difference gets large enough, it creates an objective justification for classism. (or in other words, when you are relatively equal in the 'size of the lever' you wield, you don't have any solid reason to consider others as beneath you... but when you have much more power to achieve things, you actually do have a *very* real reason to consider them beneath you. Instead of just being a deluded teenager who thinks their particular talents are more important than they actually are, you and they both could easily see that in an objective sense you actually do outclass them -- perform *systematically* and *cumulatively* better than they do. It's not at all complicated to see why that could turn into a game -- we already have plenty of examples of it : parents vs their kids)

This argument won't occur to all of the boosted. But it would be quite strange if it didn't occur to some of them, and hence, quite strange if it didn't appear to promote sociopathy/psychopathy to some measurable degree.

Assuming that the initial trend illustrated in OP holds up, there will be an abundance of evidence that the boosted "just win" / are "just better" / "advance humanity more". While it remains the case that the population isn't composed entirely of boosted, that's the justification right there.

It would be worst in the beginning, and mildest in the end (increasing proportion of people who can thwart attempts at exploitation with the same facility as the people making those attempts)

****** Mostly all of them currently. The racetams I'm not on currently, but I'm just in an off-cycle.

Nootropics for beginners : there's a couple ways to approach this. Nootropics are generally broken down into pharmaceutical and nutraceutical. I would suggest choosing which angle you are most comfortable with - do your research (I suggest examine.com as the best source of impartial information on supplements period), check out [[/r/nootropics]] and get some ideas. Start slow and try each ingredient by itself before adding it to your stack.

The other option is to buy one of the pre-made stacks that companies sell. There are downsides ; you don't learn nearly as much about nootropics because you never research, measure, change, and create your own stacks, every body is different and will respond optimally to slightly different doses, if you make your own stacks you can personalize it to your biology - you can't do this with pre-mades-, there's also the possibility of quality changes, fake ingredients, or scummy businesses in the "natural health market" (there are many issues here). Despite that, I do use one pre-made stack right now for a couple reasons: I know the owners of the company, and am relatively confident that it's all high quality ingredients, it saves me time and money making my own stack (involves 10+ good nootropics, which are a pain to source, measure, and cap myself), and it's also an affiliate company, so I can make a bit of $ from referrals. I still add additional nootropics to the pre-made, as it's not a perfect product yet.

Lots of it can be placebo (and what's wrong with that if it works?), but there are a ton of studies that show quantitative increases in many cognitive functions from a slew of different nootropics, again check out [[http://www.examine.com][www.examine.com]] and look up any of the things I posted before - look at the human effect matrix, it's awesome. I of course have a ton of anecdotal stories from people who have taken nootropics, but I prefer the research side as weight.

Actual effect? Increased cognitive functions across the board (depends what you're taking!) attention, memory, reaction time, learning, comprehension, alertness, anxiety decrease, stress decrease, depression decrease. Plus, you can get physical effects from them as well - increased endurance, decreased heat & cold sensitivity, increased oxygen absorption, etc. Anywhere from a 1-15% increase if I were to generalize (the pre-made I'm on has shown a 7.52% increase in memory, attention, and learning speed, for example). Enough that you can notice a difference in your life (absolutely!) but not enough that you're suddenly a polyglot photographic memory genius - unfortunately.

Things that would prevent me from taking it...

- Particularly bad withdrawl symptoms, combined with the drug not staying 'fresh' very long, and uncertainty regarding future availability

- High risk of long term mental problems (EG: Dementia, depression, etc), combined with the drug itself being not very popular. (If a large number of people are taking it, then the market for solutions to problems it generates will be large, and the problems are likely to be solved)

- Aggressively shortened lifespan. I'd probably be willing to lose 20-25 years in exchange for a miracle drug of that nature, but much more then that and I'd begin second guessing this.

** There is actually a rock opera that sort of addresses this. It is about an autistic kid who takes a drug to become functional. I highly recommend it.

** Maybe as price for getting smarter, you later get dumber. The drug temporarily, but extremely raises your cognitive capabilities, but as an aftereffect your average value of intelligence permanently drops. So basically in-short term it makes you super-smart, but in long term your mind gets more and more dull.

TL:DR The higher you fly, the harder you fall.

** Cost versus benefit. Being smarter wouldn't necessarily mean I made more money or was happier. So the price of the drug would matter a lot.

** In a world where this drug exists and is common, there is less motivation to take it - if I don't take it, somebody else will, and they will solve whichever problem I wanted to solve. So, let's assume only a really small number of people (including me) get any benefits from it. What would stop me? X= horrible levels of depression and suicidal urges or X = complete paralysis and blindness. Something like that.

***** I'd be really interested in the other 5% then. But yes, a 95% chance to make you mentally unstable and suicidal would be one of those side effects that would prevent me from taking the drug. Just like I wouldn't take it if it were to "merely" poison and kill me within a year.

I don't see how that is relevant to not wanting to take an intelligence enhancing rug merely /because/ it makes you smarter and/or reveals additional knowledge to you.

**** Oh, but it is. Is it more rational to have an faith derived viewpoint and live happier or to take the pill and gain higher intelligence, making you abandon the viewpoint and therefore abandon some enjoyment of life.

Take the argument of free will. Imagine that you're a person who believes in it. You take pride in this, you're happy. Then you take the pill. Suddenly, you're so intelligent that the truth is clear (just assuming this is) there is no free will. Suddenly, you're a lot less happy. See, there's no real difference with the two, deterministic and free will. If they were switched each day, nobody would actually notice. You can do what you will, but not will what you will. Seeing that the distinction is useless really, as well as 99% of information about anything outside of your ordinary world. Assuming you're an atheist, it would be better to go on believing a slightly foolish thing that makes you much happier than to spend your limited life years less happy because of a significant but ultimately futile truth.

If you took a pill that would make you know everything, chances are you would be depressed. The universe is entropic, biased toward negativity, either that or your brain is, since your brain is the only thing with a concept of negativity.

***** Sorry but I just can't empathize with your viewpoint. Maybe it is because I am already pretty sure that free will as many people imagine it is probably not only not real, but doesn't make any logical sense to begin with. And yet this doesn't make me any less happy as far as I can discern. After all you yourself said "there's no real difference with the two, deterministic and free will. If they were switched each day, nobody would actually notice." so why would it matter to know for sure one way or the other? Except that such a clarity may have at least some potential to model other people's behaviors and desires in "my ordinary world" thus maybe leading me towards better serving the happiness of myself and those I care about.

But these are things I , and most other people moderately versed in naturalistic cosmology, already know. Yet I seem to be happy enough on an average day. Why would understanding these things even better make me unhappy?

I don't think that OP's hypothetical pill is supposed to give instant omniscience or anything of the like. We are just talking about a general increase in mental faculties that, even if it is by a factor of ten, would still be very far from omniscience.

But even if the pill contained the knowledge and truth about everything and anything it would also contain the knowledge of how to fix my own unhappiness, along with all kinds of things that could improve the human condition by levels that may well be worth my sacrifice of happiness even if the truth turns out to be that I can never make myself happy again.

In any case such an omniscience pill would have to rewire my brain so much just to comprehend it that I am not even sure that concepts such as happiness/unhappiness would even still apply to me. I would essentially be one-third God after all.

Oh, this foolishness. Look, sound utility functions are over /world-states/, not mental-states (that's why hedonic utilitarianism is such bullshit in the first place). Decoupling my mental state from the state of the real world /doesn't help anything, ever./

Well, negativity bias in human minds is definitely a thing. We do use utility-weighted sampling to imagine things, after all. But also, if I knew /everything/, I'd probably try to rig myself a new Big Bang.
