** I'm just wrapping up the characters bit and I don't agree completely with your self assessment... I think you're being too critical - not wrong, exactly, it's just that some of it was a non-issue in my opinion... I'll elaborate more when I'm not tired. Although that might change my opinion, too...

Also, you could ask people things if you get stuck figuring things out... How to go from having a name to finding a person in this society? Shit, run it like a story/rpg campaign hybrid with a few people playing Jess. Give them an objective, let them ask questions about the specifics of the setting, and they could propose a plan of action.

I'd have been down to do something like that.

Also, I really liked the setting. Got any worldbuilding notes you would share? Love to run a tabletop rpg in it.

I'll look forward to hearing it.

Could do. When I write it's generally with the intention of publishing, though. Last time I published something that I'd asked for suggestions on I caught a lot of flack. I'm already writing for one quest ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/#post-4925222][Marked for Death]]), so I don't have time to do a second one and still do anything else.

Cool! Yes, I do. Let me look through it.

** *Characterization*

Ok, for Jesse, I'd rate her as 435 (or maybe 445) character. Her competence level is quite clear in that she's very competent for her age (as befit a daughter taught by her father who is 5 on the competence ladder) and so her hacking the museum protection while not being competent enough to recreate a golem like Rob from the grounds up isn't surprising. As the main view point character she's very sympathetic. In term of proactivity, Rob also comes up with quite a few suggestions so she's not the only person leading the story.

The main thing though is that this didn't feel like half of the book, it felt the first quarter of the book and it's totally ok for the antagonist not to appear within the first quarter. It wouldn't really have been a problem to have an increased presence of Brianne after. As an antagonist, she could have been quite interesting since from her point of view she would have seen herself preventing a catastrophe while from the point of view of Rob and Jess, she would have been seen as an evil jealous person. I'm also not sure that the relationship character needs to be clearly defined by chapter 2.

The only thing I really think wouldn't work at all with the story as told to Jess's grand niece was your plan to have Jess spend a quarter of the story or so in prison. This would have made the flow of the story difficult I feel.

*Things that I think went well*

I agree with you on most of your points. I believe that to date, this is your best work in term of characters. They were all differentiated, and very likable. In term of world building, this was also your best work I feel.

In term of the rule of cool, I don't completely agree with you. There are a lot of startups or companies that become big and successful because they used an arbitrage opportunity that they discovered. Of course, it can't be too simple or else it's unrealistic but with both Jess and Rob, they could have found a plausible business model.

As said, I also don't think your primary viewpoint character was mismanaged since I really thought she was perfect for the role.

In the end, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed since it was the first work you did since the Two Year Emperor that I really enjoyed (I liked Anko at the beginning but found the plot too messy in the end). I didn't read the Change Storms series beyond the first two chapters though. Will have to do that one day.

Good, sounds like I did what I set out to do.

Not sure I agree with you on that one. I'm looking at the published books on my shelves:

- Ender's Game: Strange book from a narrative structure. More of a connected series of short stories than a novel. Each segment has a separate antagonist -- Bonzo, Rackman, the buggers. In every case they show up very early.
- Changes: Duchess Arianna shows up very early, and the Escobars even earlier.
- Live Free or Die: Actually, this one supports your point. The Horvath don't appear on screen until the very end.

Okay, valid point.

Maybe. Seems like sooner is better, though.

I don't know that it would have been a quarter of the story -- once Rob started improving things would have gone very quickly. I'm not sure it would have been more than a chapter or two.

Thank you! Much appreciated. There was a crazy huge amount of stuff that never got shown. I might reuse that in the future.

Oh, they definitely could have. It's just that the one I thought of first would have required RoC to work.

Yeah, the second act of Team Anko wasn't ideal. What made you stop with the Change Storms?

**** Actually, the more I think about it, in that first part of the book, the antagonist is the environment. The fact that Jess and Rob need to fend for themselves generates tension and this also helps with making all the exposition flow quite nicely. Brianne is not introduced quickly but the reader still knows that there's someone who killed Jess and Rob's father and who might kill them (which is why Jess and Rob try to stay undercover). So, really, I think that not having an antagonist is a problem for this story.

For Change Storms, I read the first few two chapters, I wasn't that captivated and I started reading Excession from Banks around that time (I'm a big fan of Banks so it's hard for any piece of fiction to compete with that :-))... I'll give it a try again.

** Thank you for your critical analysis. It's helpful to read the behind the scenes from the writer's perspective. I loved the setting and the unique worldbuilding which was a character on its own right -- in a city full of hungry tinkers and greedy makers, it's brimming with potential energy in the sense that a powder keg is set to explode.

In my uninformed opinion, on its face I'd say that Jess was the protagonist, Rob was the relationship character, and... before we delved too deeply into the whodunit, I was pretty certain that someone from the battlebots arena who was friendly and sympathetic would turn out to be the murderer.

Re: the antagonist: I suspected that the murderer would have have values and skills similar to Jess, either as an HPMOR!Quirrell subverting mentor, or as an HPMOR!Dumbledore repentant manipulator. /The story requires a Lex Luthor level evil genius if a Rob/existential threat is the driver./ Even if they aren't present in the story early on, their impacts should be felt. Perhaps Brienne runs the power company, the academy, or. the entire city-state? I don't think you had the initial plot in mind, of x-threat vs sub-AI killer... and lacking the choking pressure of a level 20 villian is probably the reason why it didn't get the traction early on that you wanted. When was Quirrell introduced into HPMOR though? I don't think he was there in chapter two... Harry wasn't even introduced to Voldemort until Diagon Alley, IIRC.

Jess was the "student" who had a lot of disparate atypical skills in magic from helping out her mad scientist dad, so it didn't bother me that her magic/rune-scribing skills varied as the story progressed. Rob was shaping up to be the "mentor" to his younger sister... starting off clumsy, reliable, and slow, but every time he gets upgraded, he provides the exact level of skills training that Jess needs to level up too. I really liked the potential inherent in that, because it strengthens their co-dependence on each other. Rob's ability to self-improve seemed like a great way for him to provide lessons in rationality while still remaining limited by mana resources, processing speed, and ...hexabits(?)

Speaking of hexabits, it wasn't clear to me if the inscribed runes all needed to be on a single "sheet" in order to be executed, or if it was just a sequential process and the runes could be all buried in different parts of the rotating magesteel cluster at different orientations and faces. The method by which they spun around also boggled my mind because I was thinking of a gear-like system rather than some sort of expanding/contracting/rotating levitation system instead. It seemed mechanically intensive for its purposes and in my mind, probably burned mana inefficiently to spin physical objects around. Why not invent a liquigel system similar to digital clocks or highway traffic signs with a series of interconnected lines or dots that light up when needed? If the runes could be drawn from such a cruder low-res display, Rob would basically be a jar of magesteel beads that flicker on and off rapidly and he could even inscribe 3D runes that way. (Perhaps Rob's intelligence jumps when Jess starts makes the upgrade from mechanical to digital later in the story, if you return to it.)With the Singularity/God-eating-Paperclipper ending, a scintillating, calculating mass of Rob-magedust simulating Jess' idealized world would make for a possible vision of the future.

Re: the "Just So" ending. my biggest beef with it, aside from the style and tone change associated with a bedtime story by Rudyard Kipling about the terrifying ending of the world enacted by your best friend.... it seems to turn Jess from the "435" character you wrote before into a "111" background character. Sure, she'd be overshadowed by the all-consuming Rob-beast, but Jess is his highest priority.
