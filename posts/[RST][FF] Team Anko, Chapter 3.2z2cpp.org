** Nice chapter. You explained the differences of the Shadow Clone technique from canon, as well as begun exploring the various ways each teammate has different abilities and what they can do. Having Shino use his bugs as a mapping tool is quite a smart idea.

EDIT: Can we post comments on the page the chapter's posted on your website?

** And suddenly Naruto is a walking suicidal holocaust.

This is horrifying.

Even worse, the clones are aware of their eminent deaths.

Fuck, this is nightmare fuel.

Kind of tempted to stop reading and never pick up another of your stories just because of this.

/Fuck/.

I didn't think I would ever read something darker than /I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream/, but it turns out that a protagonist that knowingly condemns dozens of copies of himself to a gutwrenchingly short lifespan every single day and doesn't even /care/ is still capable of tripping my internal "nope" sensor.

First thing they should do upon popping into existence is scream something to the effect of "NEVER USE THAT JUTSU AGAIN!" then explain in excruciating detail why this version of Kage Bunshin is horrifying. If they don't then they're condemning future generations of shadow clones to the same fate.

Who in their right mind would pull a drill sergeant "unite against me, use lethal force" ploy on their own team of assasins? I mean, maybe Orochimaru could afford to do this, but he has a survivability of a cockroach in plot armour and only one student.

Consciously or not, they will learn to treat Anko as an enemy at least a little bit. Hopefully there will be consequences.

*** I just read that; thanks for the link. I enjoyed the story and I think it's pretty original, but it does require some suspension of disbelief. Kakashi is one of the best jonin in Konoha. He was an ANBU captain when he was...8? I forget exactly. The idea that three fresh graduates could take him down is thin -- he's fought plenty of other jonin, is it actually the case that none of them have ever tried toxic smoke?

He noticed the piles of trash, and he noticed Sasuke lighting them up. Surely he should have realized "I don't know what these are, but my enemies put them here, so they are unlikely to be good for me. I think I'll move the fight away from them and stay away from the piles and their smoke."

**** You're quite welcome. And it's definitely hard to accept Kakashi falling for that kind of trap. My point is that it's impossible to predict every strategy someone may try against you, and taking unnecessary risks is stupid. Granted, the team will surely interpret this situation as "don't hold back when sparring" rather then "I'm now your enemy, do your best to kill me when I least expect it", still the risk just does not seem worth the reward here.

I'm more worried about the bias she will introduce into their minds. Sure she talks about helping one's teammates regardless of personal feelings, but, as we well know, human brain does not care what pretty ideas you spout. Training your team to subconsciously consider their team leader an enemy is not a good idea. Any kind of "unite against me" style training should be carried out by someone other than a commanding officer who leads the team on missions.

No argument from me. When I worked out her background I asked her what she would be like as a team lead, and this is what she told me. Based on how she was trained she's actually doing a fairly good job -- Orochimaru is a complete psycho and he messed her up pretty badly.

  "Hate you so much," Naruto mumbled under his breath. After a minute he cocked his head. "Hang on, you said you wouldn't tell us any direct lies, and you said to me 'it was on the spoons'. Were you lying when you said you wouldn't lie to us?" he asked accusingly.

  She laughed and bounced to her feet, stretching luxuriously. "Nice catch. Yes, it was on the spoons. So, now that you've figured that out, O Grand High Mission Commander Guy, what's your plan for the day?"
#+end_quote

She didn't actually answer the question about directly lying to them. Also she changed the topic straight after while distracting Naruto with stretching and the mocking title. Fits right in with her speech about deception training earlier.

About what happens next my guess would be that the slippers won't work out and that Naruto creates and transforms two clones which will carry his teammates to the city under some pretense.

** I'm missing a plot-hook. We're 26k words into the story, which is a third of a novel already and nothing much has happened yet.

The story is boring. If I had just stumbled on the story on ff.net I'd probably have stopped reading in chapter 3. We spent the whole chapter, over 8k words, in one night camping. We learned a bit more about the characters and the world, but not nearly enough to justify the length.

What was the point of spending over a sixth of this long chapter on how to estimate the probability of being caught? To be that thorough, you had to be trying to teach the audience. The problem with that, is that the thought experiment is about a magical ninja-world about which we don't know nearly enough to know what assumptions are plausible.

The interactions between the characters - which could carry such a long scene absent plot - are not as fun or interesting as a well written canon Team 7 usually is. Shino, Hinata and even your Anko and Naruto just don't seem terribly interesting or engaging.

There is also a lot of repetition in the character interaction. Anko goes back and forth between challenging the genin and praising them /constantly/. Compare that to other similar stories that do the drill-instructor as a sensei bit. They usually have the jounin be a dick for chapters at a time until the genin are completely exhausted or lose it and only /then/ the teacher goes back to explaining what s/he was doing and praising them for how far they've come. That cycle is done once or twice. In your story, Anko goes back and forth between those two 'modes' all the time.

The thing being taught, there, is the way to estimate things you don't actually have hard facts about. Not the input facts (and whether they're trustworthy or not), but the function they're inputs to and how it /preserves/ the truth-value of its inputs.
