** Oh, these just keep on coming, and they're all so good! I really, really like them!

(Sharing them on FB right now)

I love how they all take place in the same universe, and we have an overarching plot at play.

Do you have plans for a full resolution of the deeper plot?

*** Thanks! It's a nice motivational bonus if other people enjoy my stories as well. I don't have an overarching plot planned in advance, but I do intend to keep making up stories as I go along until the deeper plot can be 'resolved'.

These aren't meant to be rational (or even rationalist), just stories wrapped around fun mathematical ideas.
