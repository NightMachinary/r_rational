Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Slay the Spire is a wonderful deck-builder roguelike game (and as it's exiting early access with a price hike next month, I can highly recommend getting it now or during the winter sale before then). Some time ago, the devs decided that they wanted to include a "beta art" mode to allow players to use the shitty mspaint placeholders that the devs had used, but there was a problem: some art was unusable due to copyright concerns, some art had been misplaced, and some cards had never had shitty art to begin with.

So the devs held an open contest and let people submit shitty mspaint art for any cards that needed it. I made some eight submissions, and six of them made it in.

Here are the submissions I made ("real" art on the left, beta art on the right) :

I have to say, it's pretty fuggin cool to see something I made be immortalized into an actual game like this.

/sideways glance/ Uh... yeah... Good thing that never happens... /coughs/

Five or six hours is extreme, but I've definitely had runs terminate in some bullshit that incensed me enough to start a new one and at least get back to where I was. I clearly lack discipline, and once I beat Ascension 15 on everyone and checked out Act 4 I decided to uninstall. Super fun game though.

** Only 7 chapters in so far, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][RE: Trailer Trash]] is pretty good. (Congratulations to the author for making the best rated page on RR! Well earned.)

The title pretty much says it all as far as the plot, and like many redo stories it could be considered a little Mary Sue like, but it's well done and doesn't go for the silly/comedic feel that you might think it would.

** Anyone else have literary pet peeves? Parts or styles of literature that you understand but hate?

Two for me are: too many points of view and non-linear stories.

Too many points of view: stories with a large number of characters is absolutely fine with me but I tend to highly prefer books with one point of view character and actively avoid any with more than five. Something about the constant character swapping, usually during cliffhanger moments, makes me go through phases of "I'm really interested in this character/part why leave?" and "I don't care about or enjoy this character, do I really want to read their part?" Books that have multiple points of view but don't swap back and forth don't bother me as much but can still get into this.

Nonlinear stories: This one kills me with Kurt Vonnegut specifically. I understand the point of it but this really makes me want to sit down and try to create a timeline to place each of the stories on but I'm not going to do this and I think looking one up shouldn't be needed to better enjoy the story. Even for nonlinear stories I enjoy this ranges from "Huh this must be before/after this other part" to "Ugh this doesn't seem to make sense based on this other part?!"

Having written this out I think the common denominator is that I believe these styles detract from the reading experience itself in order to enhance post reading enjoyment. These styles are also commonly used to create cheap shocking moments and tension, but I don't think that's an inherent part of them.

*** My problem is almost never with the fact that there are too many characters, it's that one of them is boring, unlikeable, or just not my thing. /Normally/ if I ran into a problem like that, I would just put the book down and move on to something else, but in the case of a book with multiple viewpoints, I feel compelled to slog through the thing that I don't like so that I can understand the thing that I'm reading for.

I think my biggest pet peeve with books is when they take too long to get going. I'm fine with a slow burn, at least to some extent, but that's somewhat distinct from spending too much time on setting things up, or just a stylistic choice to be slice-of-life for eight chapters before the plot actually gets moving.

Opposite this, I also tend to hate action prologues, especially if they're followed by a flashback to the actual start of the story. To me, that just smacks of bad pacing and a lack of faith in the reader. (Much more common in movies than books though.)

*** I have several pet peeves with Heinlein. mostly his approach to military discipline being shoved into stories where it makes little or no sense...

the 'moral anvil' where the author hits you over the head about how their viewpoint is the only right one. hate that, and it was too common in the sword of truth series (one novel can be summarized as 'communism bad')

in regards to multiple viewpoints, i think the biggest problem is when every chapter switches between them in order... why not just break the book into sections about each character instead? because when it happens, you almost never see them cross aside from the very beginning and the end, which may be different books. so a good chunk of the novel is a B-story that isnt very important or interesting on its own (and may target a different demographic than the rest of the work). its filler in an already long series.

*** I'd like to un-recommend Shield Hero, personally. It feels like the setting is designed purely to justify the main character's hatred/fear of women, to the point where it's unreadable without making me wonder what the hell happened to the author. Everything bad that happens to the MC is either directly done by a woman or caused by a woman (in extreme ways to boot), and it's just... gross the way the story deals with that.

Especially bad but more subtle is when the slave the MC has purchased is freed by the people who hate him because they think he's mistreating her. Her response is to tell them off because he isn't, which is fine... but instead of going on to experience character development where the two of them can interact without the control of slavery, she GOES BACK TO BEING HIS SLAVE, and it's presented as a good thing.

*** The shield hero manga is pretty solid, although not spectactular.

Amateur translated LNs almost always piss me off because the authors try to stick really close to the original work, and sacrafice entertainment for accuraccy. Pretty much the only amateur translation I've seen done well is for Kumo Desu Ga. In all honesty most manga translators aren't that much better, but the visual humor carries more of the story's weight.

I agree that it is not spectactular but so far it is the best out of the five I have read. That is why I praised it so highly. I also honestly think if it had a good editor it could be as good as full metal alchemist. But I doubt it will ever reach that high. The ideas are there the execution is lacking.

*** I liked it. It was kind of ridiculous, making characters exaggeratedly cruel just for the purpose of making his revenge more justified, but fine, I can tolerate that given how good the story is most of the time. I like stories with main characters who have clear and consistent character flaws that skews their perceptions in ridiculous and funny ways. I liked "The Seventh Horcrux" Harry Potter fanfic for similar reasons.

If you haven't already read it, I recommend Mushoku Tensei, as it kind of felt similar to the Shield Hero story, though without all the revenge stuff, and is less gamified.

**** Hmmm, it's a bit of a genre bait-and-switch, and also a short story, so it's actually surprisingly hard to summarize without spoilers.

In their work, the authors like to use settings that initially look like fantasy, but turn out to be sufficiently advanced something else, then put rational characters in those worlds and give them strong incentive to try to make sense of what is happening around them.
