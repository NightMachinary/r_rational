Trigger warning for discussion of mental illness.

I'm writing a story involving a kid who suddenly sees labels on things, and has stats that functionally describe his body and mind. The only game mechanic is the descriptions, and that stats change via instant feedback, i.e. strength goes up immediately after exercise with enough energy in the system, instead of going down steadily during exercise, and intermittently rising over the course of 48 hours' recovery.

I can't resolve how the kid would definitively prove to themselves they're not insane. If they're insane, then the labels, stats, etc. are imagined. The system does not communicate to them, so it doesn't tell them to do things, and one of their stats is a word the kid doesn't think they know. However, if, say, the kid raises their intelligence or strength, and notices improved depth of thinking or ability to do more repetitions, the kid may just be imagining the improvements.

The solution I came up with was to have the kid go to a gym and do a weight-bearing exercise with maximum weight for two repetitions, under the instruction and supervision of a trainer. They'd then tell the trainer they would exercise for two hours, and ask how much weight lifted would constitute an impossible degree of improvement, considering they might have been holding back during the previous, baseline lift. If they succeed, they'd be able to do the lift, and would see disbelief on the face of the trainer (assuming the trainer doesn't lie). If they fail, they wouldn't be able to do the lift, and the trainer would have to step in to prevent injury. The game system wouldn't have the power to hack the body into doing a feat of which it's bio-mechanically incapable.

However, I thought of a snag. What if the kid /imagines/ succeeding, when in reality they're on the ground writhing in pain? Or more realistically, they think they put the impossible amount of weight on the bar, when it's really only a smidgeon more, and the look of disbelief on the face of the trainer is really a look of bemusement. Any attempt at carefully verifying the amount of weight on the bar would similarly be subject to the kid's insanity altering his perception.

My current solution is for the character to submit their query in the form of a narrative question to their favorite online forum, as their search for mental illnesses related to not being able to perceive what is real and what is imagined yielded only delusional schizophrenia. Online results associate with the illness a muddiness of thoughts and convictions that don't follow grounded reason, and as the character finds their reasoning unaffected (or at least needs to operate under that assumption to do anything productive), discounts the probability that what they're experiencing is a schizophrenic episode. They recognize that if they can't trust their own perceptions, they need opinions outside themselves - even though their potential insanity might distort the words.

Since I can't come up with a solution myself, or rather, need confirmation regarding whether schizophrenia could manifest in such a way, I decided to do as the kid does and post a narrative brainstorming request to my favorite online forum.

So, in the face of such a system, how could one definitely, or beyond reasonable doubt, prove to one's self they are or are not insane?


** If the possibility is full insanity, it's impossible to prove either way because of Solipsism (ie. you can't be sure that anything is real because we may be in the Matrix imagining everything). The character has to trust implicitly that everything he's seeing (outside of the game elements) is real because what exists in reality doesn't matter, only what he observes.

Let's say the character decides that this is a mental illness. What does he do? Turn himself into a mental hospital? He might just be imagining turning himself in to the hospital.

He could prove that he has a mental illness by getting someone he trusts that has expertise to tell him so - either he's imagining that he's being told it, in which case mental illness, or he's actually being told it, in which case mental illness. However, it's not falsifiable; there is no way that he can prove that he doesn't have a mental illness.

EDIT: There are three major possibilities:

1. It's real
2. It's imaginary, but that's the only thing he's hallucinating.
3. It's imaginary, the whole world is imaginary.

If 1 or 3, impossible to prove real or imaginary. If 2, then he can prove that he's not in 1 (by using the methods you discussed), but he can't prove that he's not actually in 3, since the fake world could be lying to him about what happened. Therefore, he can distinguish between 1 and 2, but he can't prove that he's not in 3, so he has to go forward assuming that he may be hallucinating everything. If the experiments show that 2/3 is the case, he should go to a mental hospital. If 1/3 is shown to be the case, he should go forward assuming that everything is real, because there is no downside to assuming that and because there's no discernible difference between "everything is real" and "I am imagining that everything is real"

*** Falsifiability! Perfect. Thank you for that, and for the clear explication of the problem. I'll have search for how to solve problems, find falsifiability, and then go from there.

**** One piece of "perfect" rationality is thinking about everything like you are trying to logically prove it. Think about all one possibility and see if you could prove that it's true. If you can't prove that it's true, try seeing if you can prove that it's false. Try looking at alternate possibilities.

Using the example from above, we want to prove that it's real. Well, we can't do that because everything could be imaginary. Can we prove that it's imaginary? Well, we need to do tests like trying out what happens. Suppose the power works successfully; then we know that there is a possibility it is real. However, since that would be proving it is real, we know there must be an alternative - everything is imaginary. Suppose the power doesn't work successfully; then we know there is a possibility that everything is real except for the game windows. However, it's possible that everything is imaginary. There are more possibilities, (for example, everything is real except for something insignificant and the game windows), but for his purposes, they fold into the possibility that everything is imaginary.

(Note, I probably messed up some with the logic here, but it's the general idea)

Proving something by trying it a lot is infinitely less valuable than proving that thing logically, since trying it a lot could just mean that you're being very lucky or that there's something fudging the data. But if you prove something logically, then you know that the only way it could be false is if logic is false, and then you have bigger problems.

You're probably better off starting with 'prove it false.' It's very hard to prove a statement is absolutely true with no possibility of mistake or alternate explanation, but it's comparatively easy to prove something is false if it is. That's why scientists work to reject the null hypothesis instead of confirm their research hypothesis.

*** The labels are inconsistent. It will be a function of how much attention the kid has given or gives to a particular thing or things of its set, but he won't think to test for that for a while yet.

The labels are also not so obviously useful. Sometimes it might say what something is objectively, other times it will explain its significance or what it meant to the person that created it, e.g. 'Uppity Failure' or 'Initial Impetus'.

Those are good ideas, though, and I'll keep them in mind.

***** No, the knowledge base wouldn't work, because ID games don't tell you what you don't already know. Besides that, any reasonable experiment of history tracking would require that you become uncertain of which item is which, and that's exactly the sort of thing I would want to lose information on in a game.

You're assuming that the details of the effect follow a distribution similar to what games have been released by now, when you can't actually say how this particular effect has come about. The effect having some details reminiscent of one pattern of games, or of extant games, doesn't actually imply reminiscence of other details. You don't have any real priors for this, besides the probability that you have gone insane.

I would say the only way to determine whether or not you're insane is with safety-prioritized experimentation to determine the effect's behavior, investigating the source of this effect, and then seeking confirmation by independent experimenters, with whatever evidence you can produce from the first two paths. You can't actually disconfirm insanity through your own sensory experience.

Without research, I think the weightiest evidence against insanity would be a continuing ability to feel surprise at elements of your experience that seem the most insane, but I don't know much about delusional ideation.

******* ID games are an essential part of the roguelike Nethack, and many other roguelikes, as well as other games. Essentially they only give you the information that your character has detected with their senses. So, instead of a potion of healing, you see an ominously black potion.

With an ID game, it would be a playing card, and three bottles of clear fluid, some of which smell funny.

  Next, I'd check if it has better memory/history tracking. Is a certain screw a "computer screw", while another is a "toaster screw" despite the fact that they're physically indistinguishable? Is one envelope an "envelope containing $0" while another is "envelope containing no letters"?
#+end_quote

This experiment would require becoming uncertain with the items in question. Most games don't have this mechanic, but for example, in Nethack you can forget the entire dungeon map and your entire inventory by drinking a potion of amnesia. In a finer-grained Nethack (or Dwarf Fortress in ten years or so), I might imagine you would be able to have someone switch two items identical in appearance behind your back, and when you turn back you would no longer be able to identify them.

ID games are a small part of games essentially keeping track of the character's mental state and displaying only that which the character knows, essentially making the game interface an organized interface to the character's mind.

#+begin_quote
  After that, I'd check its knowledge base. Can it tell that this oil filter is a PS 789465312, despite me never studying part numbers?
#+end_quote

With an ID game, you would not be able to glean the model number of an oil filter without examining the object yourself. Essentially, these experiments only tell you if the game-like effect, whether sane or insane, is one that gives you information that you yourself don't have. And if you were insane, your memory could lie to you, so not even positive confirmation of greater knowledge would mean anything without experiments run by an independent observer. In other words, the results of those experiments, at least on your own, tell you nothing of your own sanity.

If you find that the effect /is/ appearing to give you greater information (the probability of which as compared to other effects is indeterminable without information of the effect's source), then you would have something to test with an independent observer, and that would give you information on your sanity. If you don't find that you gain greater knowledge, you don't have anything to test, and only gain information on the limitations of the effect's abilities.

******** I'd say that the most useful experiment in determining sanity is that which distinguishes between game interface having information you don't have, and game interface behaving like Nethack interface.

Also, if you get close enough to full solipsism (and having significantly unreliable memory is close enough) there is no useful experiments at all.

It seems I completely agree with you on this. Thanks for clarification.

** He can't prove his sanity, as Solipsism can't be proven wrong. But, with enough testing with third-party observers (which can work for intelligence too) insanity ceases to be practical position. If you can't discern them, it's simpler and more convenient to think about "real word with strange ability behaving consistently" than "insanity making me see real world with strange ability behaving consistently".

On the other hand, there is an illness which makes blind person believe that he can't see, and it's very difficult to argue him out of it. So, perhaps he could from time to time ponder on that, while usually trying to solve his problems and save the world.

That said: How young would he be when this starts? Because if he's young enough, he might just roll with it. From there the real issue is other's figuring out and then thinking he has a mental condition (Temporal lobe epilepsy? Autism? IDK.)

If he's old enough for it to be notable: He could just look at someone he's never met before, write down their name, and then Google them, look on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Find a matching picture.

if he's paranoid enough to think he imagined that: He's fucked, there's no objective way to definitively prove he isn't hallucinating this. If he's willing to talk to someone they could let him know, but that could also just be part of the delusion.

He could jump off a building after buffing VIT/STR and then having himself looked over to prove he has no injuries, but that could be imagined.

When they see they're also labeled, they fall back against the wall, think for a bit, then start their testing. They refuse to just wait until they can go to the city to test the veracity of the labeling of others' names, as they need to find out whether the thing is real or they're insane.

The labels on inanimates give supplementary information that relate more to the how or why of the thing, rather than the what of it.

All people all have labels regardless of whether the character attends to them, because faces are important to the human brain. Someone with a completely covered head would be without a label until such a time as the character comes to view that someone as a person.

If the label loses information when he loses track of the information himself, that's "there's no scenario where the game mechanic provides unknowable information". If the label doesn't lose information, then this is an easy way to test the game mechanic.

Get a crowd of psychologists. Explain them the situation and /prove/ it by making stuff disappear by putting stuff to the inventory, or knowing info about everyone by observing them (The Gamer), or such feats.

If they agree it at least looks real, and you can get Penn and Teller there too to check you are not cheating while you are at it, you can be pretty sure you are not just insane.

OFC there is the possibility you are just imagining the psychologists and Penn and teller too, but there is not much you can do at that point.

You can't prove anyone you are seeing stuff. (without some cool brain scans) You can prove how the thing affects the world you all share.

TL;DR: Prove it to others and see how they react.

  The labels are inconsistent. It will be a function of how much attention the kid has given or gives to a particular thing or things of its set, but he won't think to test for that for a while yet. The labels are also not so obviously useful. Sometimes it might say what something is objectively, other times it will explain its significance or what it meant to the person that created it, e.g. 'Uppity Failure' or 'Initial Impetus'.

  So far, no thing has a label that the character couldn't have subconsciously or have consciously noticed. So those opaque containers would either not have labels, or have labels reflecting the containers themselves, depending on how much attention the character gives or has given each jar. The labels on inanimates give supplementary information that relate more to the how or why of the thing, rather than the what of it. All people all have labels regardless of whether the character attends to them, because faces are important to the human brain. Someone with a completely covered head would be without a label until such a time as the character comes to view that someone as a person.

  My current solution is for the character to submit their query in the form of a narrative question to their favorite online forum
