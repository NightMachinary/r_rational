** If the plan was to start a firestorm with 3 days warning, why did people get caught in the firestorm

*** Because they set off the mines before the zombies walked on them to start the firestorm before they evacuated, since the flames were immediately going out as soon as deployed b/c of new zombie magic. If they waited until after they evacuated, too many mines would have gone off and immediately gone out off and they wouldn't have achieved critical mass to start the firestorm

**** Not the 20, the city, the horses and the cannons and battlements. Why did people near those burn. The first nuke was tested in Nevada, why didn't they set off the fire strom so far away from everything that it didn't kill the city.

***** It didn't hit a city? Just all non-knight soldiers since the knights had horses to get back to the command lines

*** Standard fantasy setting under federation of standard good kingdoms are under attack by standard fantasy zombies (though later on all these gain more depth) and do the standard fantasy thing of summoning a hero from another world to theirs to retrieve the standard fantasy magic sword and save the day.

They get him, but also accidentally grab a materials engineer. Uplift ensues as steel is developed, magic is quantified, and the might of a 21st century society is weighted against that of the ever more dangerous zombie hordes in this ever-expanding war in a complex web of politics, magic, and economics.

** Well. Um. Now they know that it works, I guess?

Whether it was a disaster or a worthwhile sacrifice remains to be seen.

** That "attack" seems like it was just a huge suicide. Now they have no spell cannons, I'll be quite surprised if the zombies are significantly depleted, and it sounds like the firestorm is just going to wash back and wreck their base as well..

A little worried about the A/N as well, but I guess I'll just have to trust since he's obviously a better writer than me.
