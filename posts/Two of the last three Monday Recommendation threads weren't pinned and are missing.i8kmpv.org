** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/i76hsw/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][Here]] is this weeks thread. It appears to be pinned. Do you, perhaps, have the "don't show me submissions after I've upvoted them" setting turned on in your [[https://old.reddit.com/prefs/][preferences]]?

No, I don't have that setting turned on.

But if you're seeing it pinned then I guess it's just something with my account rather than something wrong with the sub.
