** I was very tempted to go on an utter tangent about the souls idea. I've stopped typing that up because I am too tired for it at the moment and also it is an utter tangent.

Somewhat more on topic, I personally feel that there entirely a point to both writing, and in my experience reading magic system write ups. Obviously, no formal critical culture really exists for fictional technical descriptions (that I am aware of, though I get the inkling that there is a place for it in the context of, say, space ships), but I know that I can enjoy a very writer-ish enjoyment from describing a magic system, and that I've derived a very reader-ish enjoyment from perusing some of the write-ups I've found, even the ones mostly devoid of non-magic world-building tidbits or story fragments.

Then again, I've also experienced aesthetic enjoyment of color palettes, without an associated form or arrangment, so maybe my senses on this matter are just skewed?

I agree with you here. For me, it's mostly manifested in reading the (magic-related parts especially) rulesets of various tabletop RPGs.

** Good discussion. You may want to add a link to the Runelords, since that was discussed but I don't see a link to it.

Another interesting example would be Mother of Learning. The magic system is very heavily D&D influenced, but with more granular progress than just gaining levels. Also, there are Naruto-style bloodline abilities and training exercises.

The reason I find this particular example so interesting is that the story is very focused on exploring the magic system, but the system has so much breadth that there's still a tremendous amount of room for surprises.

This could be good or bad; I think it would be very unsatisfying if one of the protagonists solved a major problem with a spell we didn't see them learn (or even hint at studying), but the magic system is expansive enough that we could easily see antagonists or side characters pull off impressive things that haven't even been hinted at previously.

I'll be very curious to see if Mother of Learning gets a satisfactory ending.

Mother of Learning is a great example, yeah. I'm hoping the writer continues to show the care and attention that they have so far.

** As someone who is not a materialist, I can answer your question as "Eh, not really." There's still plenty of stories that include supernatural elements that don't make sense to me. It's only when they conform to belief systems I already follow that I automatically suspend disbelief, though discussing my beliefs here has made them more rational.

I might also have some unique disbelief reactions for when a story touches on ideas that my belief system covers. For instance, I have a certain conception of the afterlife that I think makes sense given reality as I understand it, so for some stories that feature the afterlife I'll think, "Wait, that's what it's like? Seriously? How does that work?".

This is particularly amusing to me because that's the exact reaction I have to almost every afterlife concept I encounter :) My earliest memory of pushing back against my religious upbringing was questioning my rabbi/teacher's description of heaven and how to get there back in middle school. I stayed a believer for years afterward, but that was my first major moment of "Wait, what? Surely it can't work that way..."

**** I had a similar experience with Catholicism, though I continued to believe in the basic premises of Christian religion, so I converted to New Age and still try to follow it while avoiding the pseudoscience (like I said, you've made me more rational). I think Buddhism's view of death and afterlife is closest to my own.

***** Gotcha. Have you read [[http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal][Talking to God]]? It made so much sense and aligned with my values of what I wanted God and the afterlife to be so much that it transitioned me from a theist to a deist in high school.

****** Well, now I've read it and it was terrific. I'm happy to say that my views on God were already VERY similar to those present here. The only remarkable difference is that I believe the "path to godhood" occurs on an individual level as well as a collective one, which is where my belief in reincarnation and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mda32/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d3umkmc][communication with spirits]] comes in.

******* What a fascinating conversation, especially since your perspective was so similar to mine (in the sense of, "I know this isn't rational but it helps me to believe it") back when I was in undergrad and was shifting from deist to agnostic. I didn't believe I could talk to spirits from the afterlife, but the belief in an all-knowing-and-just God, or at least a cosmos-wide narrative pushed forth by minor god-level intelligences and powers, helped me through many rough patches. I read a lot of Stephen King books, and I loved the multiverse he and other writers imagined, thinking it obviously true and just as obvious that I could do great things if I continued to believe in it and hold myself to the standards of the heroes in such stories.

I can't really describe what it was like to leave that belief system behind, because part of me still feels like I haven't. But for the most part, I definitely did feel "spiritual" moments that I don't anymore, and I definitely did occasionally think about my life as a minor narrative in a wider "fate" of the universe, which I don't really anymore.

I can't tell you if I'm /happier/ believing that the universe is (probably) completely impersonal and random and "cold." But I have gained great value in grounding myself in reason as much as possible, and the humanism that has always been just under the surface of my thoughts and feelings was able to really only flourish once I completely rejected the supernatural, and believed fully that the light in the universe, if there is any, is in us, and it's up to use to bring justice and heaven to earth (or beyond).

In any case, I hope your beliefs and worldview continue to make you happy and rational, whatever it takes to get there :) As long as you strive to do good and strive to do it in an intelligent fashion, I mostly don't care what you believe or don't believe, and am happy to call you my brother/sister.
