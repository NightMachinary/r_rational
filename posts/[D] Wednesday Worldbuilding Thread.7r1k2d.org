Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So a while back, I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4etflz/d_what_do_you_do_in_a_foreign_world/][this]] thread. tl;dr, it proposes a portal fantasy scenario where you have a few gimmes (you speak/read/write the language, you get a free multitool plus whatever's usually in your pockets, and existing debilitating injuries/sicknesses/syndromes are cured), but where you notably /don't/ get the gimme of immediately having something to do and people to do it with; there's no grand destiny, no mission from the king, no summoned-hero shenanigans, no coincidental run-in into loyal companions, no easy-entry adventurer's guild, no chance to save a mysterious woman from being assaulted, no farmer immediately willing to take in some random stranger, etcetera.

Basically, a sandbox Isekai set to <Homeless> difficulty.

But this is the worldbuilding thread, so I'm going to go in a slightly different direction. Namely, *How can a world be created such that, despite the previous constraints, people looking for adventure are still likely to find it?*

That is to say, how can a world be set up where the protagonist can achieve most of the trappings of Isekai (adventure, companions, abilities, waifus) through character action, rather than narrative fiat?

This is of course a very broad question, so if you want, you can think up a specific example of an Isekai setting having those qualities.

As an additional gimme (the previous thread was just /slightly/ too hard) the Isekai process also makes you pretty fit. Not like, bench press 500 pounds fit (unless you could already do that), but like, "run a seven minute mile" or "work all day in construction" fit.

*** You need a few key factors for adventure:

- *Low population density:* When there aren't many people around, the odds that you're the right person for the job tend to go way up. Additionally, the odds of there being threats to people (wolves, bears, big cats, etc.) tend to increase when there's fewer people to deal with said threats.

- *Young civilization/new world:* An area of unexplored wilderness is an area of untapped resources. You might literally discover a gold mine in your travels if the area hasn't been previously explored.

- *Disaster aftermath:* Following some massive apocalypse (disease, climate, war, etc.), many places may be left abandoned, potentially with valuables left unclaimed.

- *Equality or low tech/magic level:* Technology and magic tend to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy, creating a caste of elites who solve the world's problems - for a price. With low tech/magic, the world's elites don't have much more to offer than anyone else. Alternatively, if the elites are kept relatively equal with everyone else (perhaps by law, or by culture), they still won't be able to offer more than an average person can.

A good historical example would be the American pioneers following the revolutionary war. The New World had relatively untapped resources and the combination of disease and war had wiped out large swaths of the population. The tech level was comparatively low, equality was comparatively high, and the frontier was virtually uninhabited. There was hardly a better time and place for adventuring.

*** I recommend the [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][Wandering Inn]], which does this really well. The main character, Erin, arrives in another world, with just the items she had on herself (no multitool). She barely manages to stumble into an abandoned building, and becomes an [Innkeeper]. That would be in brackets because it's a class; the story has a leveling system which also handled really well. As in, not only the main character has this but everybody in the world, and grinding doesn't really work since you mainly seem to level when you go beyond your normal limits somehow. You get levels based on what you are doing.

And there are monsters, which she fights to survive. Or invites into her inn, in the case of goblins. Her inn is close to a city populated by Gnoll (hyena-people), Drakes and Antinium (ant-people), so those make up most of her other customers. Well, that and a [Necromancer].

There is still plenty of adventure. Some of it she goes looking for (sometimes because she has to in order to find food), and some of it finds her and is really more of an attack than an adventure.

And she isn't the only one from our world who has been transported there. All over the world, people are appearing. Depending on where they are, some do follow more traditional tropes, but a lot go off the traditional rails for Isekai, such as becoming a [Runner], delivering items between cities on foot. [[#s][Or]]

There is a lot more to this story, because it is very long, and I can't really talk about much of the really awesome things because spoilers. Anyway, to answer your question... make the world dangerous, and there will be adventure to find. Make it even more dangerous, and it will find people regardless of whether or not they are looking.

Unfortunately no. I had banned backpacks in the previous thread, and the ban still holds. You wouldn't be too far behind-- wallet-phone-keys are all that most men carry anyways, and you do get a multitool, but it still is a disadvantage you'd need to take account of in your personal story. (If you want to cheat a little, though, "pockets" includes stuff like coat and sweater pockets.)

It's mainly just me in this case :P You'll find Isekai protagonists taking along all sorts of random shit. But my restriction basically comes down to what people have on their persons for the majority of the day. I carry my backpack around a lot, but only wear it for probably an hour total each day. Meanwhile, my pockets have my wallet-keys-phone combo from when I wake up to when I go to bed. You probably have your purse near you a very high proportion of the time, but don't literally wear for the majority of that time.

There's one potential bonus you have-- if you wear any jewelry consistently, it would probably fetch a fair price.

*** ... For most fantasy worlds, the average first worlder gated in is going to very rapidly turn into a 12th century communist rabble rouser, because the entire social structure is anathema to everything you believe in. Yes, even if you are very conservative. That is a potent plot engine, and also very hard to survive doing.

Heck, one of my favorite plot-hooks is that your main character is not such a portal victim... but a native who finds the /writings/ of one, who had enough grasp of the risks involved to realize they were almost certainly going to die before they managed to overthrow feudalism. "The comprehensive manual of Syndicalism and the industrial mode of Production." or something similar.

*** I think that Mother of Learning's setting solves this fairly elegantly, although most fantasy worlds that are at least semi-rational seem to handle it as well.

I think it's sufficient to make a world with self-serving adventure with only 3 rules -

- Dungeons naturally generate or attract monsters (eg in MoL, mana wells both draw and evolve monsters with ambient magic).\\
- Dungeons/Monsters are a source for valuable resources (eg, mana crystals or monster parts)
- Dungeons are inhospitable enough to sapients that they cannot be tamed. (eg, the lowest levels constantly draw/spawn deadly enough monsters to push out homesteaders)

IIRC, many universes have this. Mother of Learning, Recettear, Danmachi, Made in Abyss, any of the MMO Isekais like Sword Art Online or Log Horizon, and lots more. It seems like any world with these sort of dungeons would end up creating permanent gold rush towns, except instead of mining things you're stabbing monsters. To link TV tropes, any world with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBasedEconomy][dungeon based economy]] seems to roughly follow this pattern if it's at all rational.

**** The main problem isn't simply making an adventurous world, however. It's making an adventurous world that [protagonist] can have adventurers in, without giving them gimmes like most isekais. Because people are still going to need to work for their daily bread, and if killing monsters is easy, then it's not going to make a whole lot of "money." (gold dropped from corpses, being in such high supply, couldn't really be used as a useful currency.)

***** First, killing monsters doesn't need to be dangerous on an absolute scale in order to be profitable. It only needs to be marginally more difficult or uncomfortable than baking bread for a living (for example) in order for it to be a profitable job.

As a real world comparison, remember back to the Iraq war when security consultants could pull >$1000 a day. Closer to home, oil field work in North Dakota averaged $100k a year with low education requirements, yet the median working Americans ($35k) didn't go drive those wages down. Monster killing is both unsafe and uncomfortable, so it would have high wages.

--------------

Second, killing monsters can be 'Isekai easy' while still being really /really/ dangerous comparatively.

In a story, a 20% yearly death rate would be dramatically low for active adventurers. In real life, a 20% casualty rate job would 1) result in 999/1000 workers dying during a 30 year career, 2) be multiple orders of magnitude more dangerous than the most dangerous jobs in America, and 3) be 5-10x more lethal than being an active soldier in Rome during wartime.

Seriously, there would have to be insane rates for adventurers. If skilled consultancies could pay $150-300k a year in Iraq, then adventurers could easily pull the gold equivalent to >$1,000,000 a year.

** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][The Masquerade]] is trope that I've always found interesting and sought to rationalize despite how increasingly implausible the Information Age has made it, but now that fake news, conspiracy theories, and anti-intellectualism have become social problems I can't ignore I've been thinking it's time to retire the trope altogether from fiction that isn't horror or social commentary.

However, I did manage to find an interesting take on it while listening to /The Orpheus Protocol/ RPG Podcast. The game takes place in a world of Lovecraftian horror, where the explanation for why no one knows about the Mythos is because some psychics ascended into the collective consciousness and are erasing knowledge of the supernatural to protect humanity from memetic hazards. That doesn't stop evil cults from forming to summon alien monsters, but it keeps them a secret.

The only other example I've seen of something like this is the information-consuming Voidfish from the more lighthearted /The Adventure Zone/, which also just happens to be an RPG Actual Play podcast, that created a global mental block to keep people from fighting over the Macguffins. I think this is an idea that has untapped potential and want to hear about other interesting things can be done with it, without making me feel uncomfortable in ways the story doesn't intend.

*** Some of the most thoughtful examples I've seen of supernatural masquerades actually come from semi-comedic urban fantasy novels, oddly enough. In [[https://smile.amazon.com/Monster-A-Novel/dp/B004W5KGXU/][Monster]] and [[https://smile.amazon.com/Chasing-the-Moon/dp/B0052HLPZU][Chasing the Moon]] by A. Lee Martinez, and in the [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787845MC][Freelance Familiar series]] by Daniel Potter, magic in the modern world exists in the open and is incredibly common, but most people hallucinate natural explanations for supernatural experiences, and can't form long-term memories of anything that contradicts the hallucinations. So, for example, you might have a friend who's an elvish wizard, but think of them as just slightly odd and new-agey. And if the wizard accidentally summons a demon, you might run away or call the police, but remember it afterward as "that time a bear wondered into the neighborhood".

A couple of ideas I've had in this vein:

- Before the year 1666, nobody doubted the existence of the supernatural. Every town had a hedge witch and pixie grove, dwarves ruled most of Scandinavia, and the devastation of the 30 Years War was the product of a rapidly escalating magical arms race. When the hellish legions of the Black Death broke into our reality through a London portal in 1665, a cabal of wizards including Isaac Newton barely managed to hold them off. This event, however, convinced Newton that the only hope for humanity would be fundamentally alter the nature of reality- to make it predictable, systematic, and unresponsive to the whims of individuals.

  So, the Royal Society captured and dissipated the energy of a dark god to cast a spell over the entire solar system- a spell that rippled both forward and backward in time, which they called The Enlightenment. The world and it's history became far simpler; dwarves and elves became human, wizards became doctors and scholars, and the dragons fled to hidden dimensions. For three centuries, the suddenly predictable nature of reality has led to an incredible flourishing of technology. Recent experiments in quantum physics, however, have begun to find cracks in the spell, and threaten to shatter it entirely.

- Magic is an integral part of modern civilization. Computers and cellphones work through a combination of circuitry and tame spirits, vampire rights are a hot-button issue in every election, and the annual hippogriff migration draws huge crowds.

  However, there's a rare psychological condition that causes sufferers to be unable to consciously perceive or accept the paranormal. They may avoid running into the horse half of a centaur, but if you ask them to describe what they see, they'll always describe the centaur as a member of their own species.

  With the right luck charms, these unfortunate people can live full and independent lives, but until recently, there hasn't been a treatment. Now, however, a new drug has entered pan-human trials that may offer hope...

**** This setting is intriguing but I'm confused on how this enlightenment spell works. Is it some kind of perception filter that overlays the real magical reality with a matieralistic mundane one? What about the fantasy races who I'm assuming appear as human. Do they know they're nonhuman or has the perception filter also changed how they view themselves?

It sounds a bit like the Mist from Percy Jackson which is also a weird perception filter/layer of reality that obscures the real one.

***** Not exactly. The idea is that the spell fundamentally transformed reality to make it more amenable to science. So, for example, Newton didn't so much discover the laws of motion as take something that had been incredibly malleable and unreliable and make it universal, certain, and part of a greater system.

Magic can still exist in this setting, but only in places and for people out of reach of the spell. A wizard powerful enough to shield themselves from the spell might break the laws of physics in public, and ordinary people will be able to see it- but the laws of physics would push back, gradually altering both memories and physical objects to conform to the Royal Society's grand paradigm.

An elf living in a sacred grove might be terrified to ever visit civilization, since they'd risk not only becoming human, but remembering the grove as nothing more than a backwoods cult. And in some sense, that cult might really exist- an alternate universe, somehow brought into superposition by the spell. A universe that perhaps intrudes into the dreams of the elves, some of whom spend their days researching entanglement and wave functions in the desperate hope of destroying science.

****** That Enlightenment spell sounds really evil then. Not necessarily for destroying magic or whatever, but for basically committing magical genocide. All these nonhuman races are basically brainwashed into forgetting their culture and transformed into humans. If I were a magical creature I would be totally pissed.

It would be a great idea for the protagonist to be one of those magical creatures (perhaps a troll to be original) who recently regained his nonhuman heritage. Then the story could follow him trying to tear down the masquerade and destroy the Enlightenment spell to bring back his people.

*** Personally, I'm still looking for works about the time directly after the masquerade finally shatters. Where the world is uneasily coming to terms with the mystical and bizzare, when magic can finally be put under the microscope, when everyday life is rapidly, irrevocably changed.

I wrote Horizon Breach (see: my flair) as a partial exploration of that concept (Earth learns about Log Horizon magic) but as a novice author, I made sure the "shock" of the event was intentionally blunted, both by my own conceits (very few magical people on the planet at one time, confined to a specific geographic region, with clear-cut goals), and the established setting (the "magic society", so to speak, already knew all about the non-magical society, so only one had to adjust).

I'm also reading [[https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/prologue/][Should the Sun not Rise]] which, aside from being good on its own merits, has a magic society that is imminently expecting the masquerade to break and therefore not stringently enforcing it as much as they used to, but still operate under it for now. It's fairly close to what I want, but still not quite on target.

If anyone has any rec's, please reply with them!

*** I was thinking of a way to justify this for a story of mind. The basic premise is that humanity only has psychic abilities when they have a corresponding madness. Most forms of magic take the form of creatures like werewolves and vampires, infectious mimetic structures. The other primary way to gain powers is to be exposed to the use of psychic abilities for a while which causes damage to the soul. That is where hunters came from. They were people who survived being attacked. Anyway, a while back in history it was decided that these spread too easily so the veil of Lethe was created to slow it down. This is inside the human collective conscience and thus affects every human from childhood. The effect has multiple parts. This encourages monsters to avoid humans most protected by it and go after the humans least protected. This means those who are isolated from the rest of humanity. The corresponding madness is that any memory containing true supernatural events is thrown out as a corrupted file. This is not perfect but most people who encounter monsters will be unable to remember it and will accept the official explanation. The second option is that the person will remember and be brought into the secret. This is the state that children of monsters exist in even if they never become one themselves(This relies on them being raised around magic so doesn't always). This tends to happen with people becoming monsters but there is not a perfect overlap. Some people survive monster attacks and become hunters, and some people become monsters and don't remember so they become things like traditional werewolves. This can persist even after they find out about the truth, which splinters their mind. Thirdly they might retain the memory but suppress it becoming a antipsychic who suppresses magic in their area. It also introduces a slight effect which counts as a glitch in every video software on the planet crashing and deleting all footage. This was added when computers became a thing so while not technically inherent is based on some pretty fundamental code. The final effect of the veil of Lethe is that it cribs note from a previous secret keeping system which I based off the fidelius charm but with a different principle. Basically any systemic attempt to break the veil on a large scale( or any knowledge of the other secrets they keep) will call the guardians of Lethe. These are knowledge eaters. and will devour knowledge of the secret and how to breech it based on a variety of factors. A number of people a found with no memories after each attack. Some of them will leave soon after and it is said they went to fill the void by devouring the memories of others, becoming a Guardian. No one is quite sure what specifically calls them but no one wants to experiment. no one is sure how to stop them either as all notes on them are erased in the event of an attack. It was originally designed to prevent runaway infection scenarios and large scale group minds such as the tower of Babel. That was a mental virus that lived in the language centres of brain that persuaded the infected to build a tower to rope in construction workers. At least that's what the head of the hunters guild says happened through no one knows how they know details of events that happened thousands of years ago. The Church claims they're the angel of death sent down to protect humanity. They refuse to confirm or deny this question. In summary, the veil of Lethe reduces attacks on humans, directs attacks to people that no one cares about, reduces infections that result from those attacks by the sanitation of mental inputs to the point where the werewolf packs mostly grow by their own children and has a final unpredictable defensive measure in case someone tries to experiment with it. It however doesn't affect nonhumans such as dogs. So what do you think.

** Given at least a few people here seem to actually have a good understanding of quantum physics hopefully someone answers this question. Anyway the question is, in a universe with physics is the same except parity (and only parity) is flipped how would things be different?

The one thing I do know from research is that the weak force is the only force [[https://goo.gl/igJ89r][which breaks parity]] however the effect the weak force behaving slightly differently would have on the rest of the universe I can't begin to guess at.

Still even if the effect is small common sense would tell me you can't change /even one seemingly tiny thing in physics/ without it drastically altering phenomenon at the macroscopic level. After all even if the difference in the weak force due to different parity is tiny it's still going to be vastly greater an effect in size than say /gravity/.
