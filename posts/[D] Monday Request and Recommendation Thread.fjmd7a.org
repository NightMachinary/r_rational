Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Some one recommended the loyal ones([[https://thralls.weebly.com/]]) to me last week and I really enjoyed it. The thralls feel alien without being entirely inhuman, which is makes sense in context. It does not have a bunch of chapters yet so you might want to wait a while.

** I enjoy reading fanfics which focus on a villain and portray him as more intelligent, competent and charismatic than cannon. For example, I've read the vast majority of the sane!Voldemort fics out there, as well as the protagonist!Lex Luthor fics.

Are there any other fandoms (besides Superman and Harry Potter) with villains that lend themselves to that sort of portrayal? I'd love to see any fanfic recommendations for rational!villain protagonists outside those fandoms.

*** Worm's Skidmark is basically a racist stereotype. In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]], it's portrayed as a deliberate act he puts on, while actually being rather cunning and smart. Not like Quirrelmort-rational, but definitely someone capable of founding and holding a gang in a city with a dragon and superpowered Nazis.

Not a villain, but definitely an antagonist: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pondering-internally-and-goading-godlings-over-things-piggot-pov-worm.815144][Pondering Internally and Goading Godlings Over Things]] makes Piggot a genre-savy, slightly paranoid main character:

  Now, I have no delusions that I'm important. I'm a minor character at best in the grand scheme of things. I at least hoped to be the stern no nonsense mentor character (or at least let Armsmaster be that, if it means I can avoid death by teaching), but since last year, I've come to terms with the fact that the PRT and Protectorate ENE were not the A Team. We're almost definitely antagonists.

  Well, at least an obstacle to overcome. How am I so sure? It's simple really: Triumph and Gallant. Triumph is the mayor's son, and Gallant is a billionaire. It reeks of privilege so hard we're clearly the asshole rival baseball team the underdogs will have to beat for the state championship.

**** The Lex Luthor fics:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17356310/][The Metropolitan Man]] - Probably the most well known rational!Lex Luthor fic.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant][Lex Luthor Triumphant]] - rational!Lex Luthor, but more selfish and vindictive than in "Metropolitan Man".
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] - This rational!Lex Luthor fic tends to get recommended on this sub, but it's not to my taste.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7370077/][It Doesn't Do Well To Dream]] - A decently written rational-adjacent fic focused on Lex and an OC set in the Smallville canon.

I have over a hundred sane!Voldemort fics in my favorites list, but here are the ones I think are most likely to appeal to this sub:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - rational!Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and kidnaps Harry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]] - rational!Voldemort is more cautious about the prophecy and kidnaps baby Harry rather than kill him.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/][Birds of a Feather]] - (occasionally recommended on this sub) Hermione is born in Tom Riddle's generation. They become friends before they get their Hogwarts letters.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - After his death, Voldemort awakens in the body of his teenage self. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat his past mistakes.

** Reviews of things I've read recently:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning/chapter/301778/1-good-morning-brother][Mother Of Learning]]: Time loop story with a month-long loop, main character is studying magic in a very well-realized version of a D&D-esque world. Does a satisfying job of having a main character grow in power over time, but also grow into a more well-adjusted and kinder person. Feels pretty low-stakes all the time, so it's a good break from other well-written serials; usually anything this good will consistently drag their characters through hell. The magics the main character develops are specific, and unpopular for main characters, so they feel fresh. Story is greatly improved by the introduction of giant telepathic spiders. Would recommend; there's a reason it had threads here for five years.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/threadmarks][I Just Love Killing]]: Worm / Rick & Morty crossover. You'd need to have read Worm to enjoy this, but for Rick & Morty you could get away with just the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDr9axb7X7E][two]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFA1UQ2UOVQ][scenes]] that Krombopulous Michael appears in (also interplanetary portals exist). Taylor gets her power replaced with a cheerful alien assassin stuck in her head, who gives her advice about killing. It's not incredibly rational, but it's light, easy to read, and pretty well-written. It also focuses on planning and practice paying off, which is an itch that's popular around here. Not completed, incredibly sporadic update schedule. I don't think being complete is particularly important to this one though.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] (not quite done reading yet): Dumb adolescent power fantasy, but like the best possible version of that. The writing does a great job of stringing together new ideas, new problems, new possibilities, new bits of world building, and dumb jokes so there's always something to anticipate, and it goes by fast. Main character lucks into a completely busted pile of abilities in their LitRPG-esque world and rapidly gains power (and a harem).

** Tentative recommendation for the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/34561/Re_Creators][Re:Creators]]. It's a reverse Isekai where characters from games and stories start showing up in the real world. At it's best it reminds me of PGtE with it's focus on tropes and stories as strategic plot elements. It also does a good job of showing a range of reactions to characters finding out they're stories and meeting their authors. It's also interesting watching characters evolve from their archetype origins to become 3D characters.

Full disclosure, I am only half way into the season, so it's possible my opinion will change by the end. I also wouldn't call it rational, since plenty of characters make objectively stupid decisions, but no one behaves particularly out of character.

This likely won't be new to many people, but the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)][Expanse novels]] are pretty good. I found the first two decent, but flat at times. The third one took the series in an unexpected and really interesting direction and now I'm eager to read the rest of them. If you haven't heard of it, it's fairly hard sci-fi in the near future, and it goes to great lengths to justify as much of the world as it can with realistic science.

It falls off in the second half, but I still enjoyed it at the time. Some people in this community would like certain aspects of it for sure. /a/ was obsessed with Magane and her 'uso-no-uso' power that season, it was pretty funny at the time, half the threads turned into Magane generals. Her power has such specific trigger conditions anyone being rational about it would simply not talk to her but people kept falling for it again and again.

**** The main problem with Magane is that, as far as I can tell, there was nothing stopping her from approaching a random person on the street, saying "I'm omnipotent", goading them into calling her out on the lie, and thereby becoming omnipotent. I /had been/ willing to grant that her power has some upper limit --- that is, until it was used as a Deux Ex Machina in the endgame, to change a variable that was presumably impossible to manipulate via any other demonstrated power.

They were all relatively well-informed and competent, compared to an average civilian, which would've made her ascension at least minimally challenging.

It could've also served as a source of interesting tension. She isn't affiliated with any other faction and is Chaotic Evil, but if she managed to ally with /anyone at all/, they'd instantly win... if any of them could trust her, that is, if she could only stop being chaotic long enough to earn anyone's trust.

** Hi, posted this last week, but it was Friday, so it missed peek viewership.

I've really been enjoying "My Hero School Adventure Is Wrong, As Expected" and I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would like it a lot too!

([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/]])

It is an Oregairu, My Hero Academia fusion fanfic. Both stories are combined very well with lots of interesting quirks (powers). The main character uses his complex quirk 108 skills very intelligently. It gives him the power to copy 108 other quirks at 1/108th of the power (and only use 1 at a time). There is good character development and it feels like there have been entertaining divergences from a the canon plot line (though much of the plot is out of the students control).

Also, Does anyone have any other My Hero Academia fanfiction that they like? I've been having trouble finding other good MHA fanfic.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11808918/chapters/26640231][Conversations with a Cryptid]]*. This fic takes place after the Overhaul arc, and contains spoilers past that. All For One is captured, and after months of getting absolutely nothing out of him from interrogation, Izuku is allowed weekly visits to see if he can get anything out of him. The result is a carefully paced plot that slowly peels back the layers of a very old and crafty criminal mastermind, as Izuku learns more than he expected about how his world became what it is today. I was pretty captivated the whole way through, and it easily gets my rec. Keep in mind a couple of things. This fic has a sequel, in addition to a planned third installment, buuuuuut that one kinda jumps off the rails very quickly and never gets back on. I don't like it nearly as much. And in addition to having several spoilers for MHA, this fic also has a few major plot points (including the finale of /Conversations/) that actually aren't true in canon, and afterwards I had to ask a few questions to someone who was caught up with the manga to figure out which were which.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11088315/chapters/24735288][Erased Potential]]*. This one is near and dear to my heart. One of my big problems with canon's opening is that it feels like it is setting up a premise where Midoriya is perpetually told he's worthless and that his dreams are impossible without a quirk, and he would go on to prove them wrong through grit and intelligence. Instead, he trips over the strongest quirk in the setting, challenging exactly none of these ideas. This fic, however, is exactly what I wanted from MHA's opening. In this AU, a young Midoriya takes a more proactive and thoughtful approach towards his goal of becoming a hero, realizes that the Hero Eraserhead basically fights people quirkless after neutralizing their special advantages, reasons that he could train his talent for quirk analysis into something that could function similarly, tracks Eraserhead down to his apartment, and begs him to teach him how to become a hero. This is an Aizawa apprentice fic, and it is what I wish canon would've been.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11847156/chapters/26745675][an education in interruption]]*. This is a very interesting one, as it is technically a reader-insert romance story with All Might's secret identity, but that is not the focus. The reader-insert character is a kind of Special Needs teacher for children with dangerous or unstable quirks, and the look into that world is easily the most interesting part of the fic. They are on the receiving end of a very deep cultural stigma that thinks they're one step away from turning into horrible Villains, and they have to struggle against that prejudice. On top of their actual quirks, some of which are /horrifying/; disabilities at best, "kill everyone nearby" buttons at worst. They are the ultimate Problem Children, but they have each other and teachers who would die for them.

If you're interested in a story that actually runs with these ideas, I'd recommend Brandon Sanderson's Steelheart - in fact, when I started watching MHA, my first thought was "wow this is like someone decided to make an anime out of Steelheart after reading the first half of the book".

The author changed the obstacle race to better reflect the different quirks introduced through oreigaru characters (particularly the flying characters who would have invalidated the original obstacles), gave a strong motive for the protagonist to succeed in the festival when normally he wouldn't care, changed how the students approached the events, had a character antagonize the league of villains + stain on national tv and gave new character moments to mha characters that will change the results of the festival (because ultimately it is a character development and introduction arc).

Also not sure how you can view the protagonist as passive when he is constantly working to improve his quirk. Directly addresses the league of villans and stain. And has a strong motive to succeed that he is following through with.

One suggestion could be to scrab or drastically reduce the screen time of the sports festival. The media of writing lends itself much less to pointless fighting than manga/anime/other visual media. This fic was started in Nov 2018 and the sports festival started in Aug 2019 which means that about half the story at this point have been filled with stuff I've basically seen before and stuff that has little to no impact on the rest of the story. Maybe this wouldn't be as big of a problem if this was my first MHA fanfic but almost every single MHA fanfic retells the sports festival with only minor changes.

None of the actions you described is moving the story. The story happens to the MC rather than being driven by him. One easy way of having this MC be active is to research powerful quirkusers and actively seek to acquire those. That would introduce new conflicts by having to convince(or cheat) heroes, hunting villains down, trying to gain access to villain prisons for juicy stuff, making deals with neutrals etc. Imagine him learning about Gran Torino and realizing that extra speed can often be useful, seeking him out, and having to convince him to share his quirk which the grumpy old man is reluctant to do.

** I've read two novels last week that might be interesting to folks here:

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0851HYMXV/][/Grog/]]: unlike most characters in rational fiction, Grog is pretty dumb. However, he understands that he's not smart, and so spends half his time thinking and asking questions about why things are the way they are. The other half of his time is spent disassembling the enemies of the adventuring party that has (reluctantly) bought this massive half-orc from the gladiator pits.

(as a side note: you might also like [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074W7P6MB][Another Stupid Spell]], which is about an Orc who bootstraps himself into wizardry using intelligence spells)

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J6HWLPR][/Gideon the Ninth/]]: Harrow would be a classic rationalist protagonist (super smart, hard working, great at magic), but what makes this book interesting is that you get to see it from the other side - Gideon, her companion, is the main character. They hate each other, but have to at least pretend to work together to get through what amounts to a death game.

The only problem with this book is that it's /so expensive/. It's good but I don't know if I can really recommend spending $12 on an ebook copy.

*** Thanks for the book recommendations! Nice to see them here.

I can't second Gideon the Ninth, though. My main problem is that it is a pretty difficult book to read. That would be okay, if the world-building, characters etc. justify the complexity (think Dune) but in this case this isn't the case, in my opinion. I think the complexity obfuscates large plot holes, inconsistent world-building and character issues. If this is the case it'll become more obvious with sequels.

My rec instead would be ‚ÄúThe Traitor Baru Cormorant‚Äù. It has some of the same themes, but the complexity of the themes + plot justify the complexity of the presentation. See e.g. [[https://www.sethdickinson.com/2015/10/01/the-traitor-baru-cormorant-read-along-chapter-1/][here]] about what kind of thought process the author went through for each sentence.

**** Eh it's not quite rational - it's more munchkiny / intellect bootstrappy.

The basic plot is that the main character is an Orc Wizard in a world that works very much like older versions of D&D, where your spells per day is based on your Intelligence. As a fairly dumb Orc Wizard, he can cast about one spell per day. He quickly discovers an Intelligence boosting spell, which allows him to cast something like /three/ spells per day - a net gain of one spell.

I have no idea what the target age is, but it didn't feel like a YA book at least.

*** This one is very popular so you may have read it, but in case not: World War Z is by far the best zombie story I have ever read, to the point that I still re-read it on occasion.

Its written as a collection of stories being recorded by a historian tracking the experiences people had during the zombie outbreak.

Also, if you like audio-books, I can't recommend the audio-book version enough. I usually hate audio-books, the narration grates on me and just never works, but World War Z was done incredibly well. They got actual voice actors to do different characters and it works so well. I wouldn't say it's /better/ than reading the book on your own (but again, I'm biased against listening to books mostly), but if you feel like listening to something instead of reading, this is a case where I can heartily endorse the audio version.

Also, it has essentially no connection to the movie.

The low level survival stuff is not a focus, and is mostly elided in favor of more violent, political, or magical threats.

Fullmetal Alchemist (especially brotherhood, but somewhat 2003 version) is great and rational adjacent; it does so while still being Shonen, too, which is rare.

In terms of anime I expect people on r/r to like, A Young Girl's Military Record / Saga of Tanya the evil, Tenga Toppa Gurren Lagann, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, A certain Scientific Railgun (season one is solid, arc 1 of season 2 is /amazing/, arc 2 of s1 is meh), Unlimited Blade Works are all good.

My general recommendations would be Code Geass (IK it's popular here but I can't reccomend the end of S1/anything beyond), KonoSuba, Kara no Kyoukai, OreGairu, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and My hero Academia.

Nevertheless, yeah, the first part is not that representative; ToAru is at its worst when it tries to do slice of life.

Some of the parts I think would appeal to r/r are things like the powers getting their physics due; rather than electricity control just being shooting lightning, it's also manipulating ferromagnetic materials, up to a fucking Railgun, decomposing water, EWar, controlling plasma, manual muscle contraction for movement, etc. This extends beyond just Mikoto as well, such as when one of the sisters effects accelerator through his whitelist reflection power by turning the oxygen to ozone Another is the aesthetic; while espeed powers may not always be fully /understood/ by everyone, the setting always tries to show them as fundamentally /understandable/ and receptive to scientific inquiry.

********* It depends. The ToAru franchise (Index/Railgun/Accelerator) are 3 interconnected stories. Events that happen in one, also happen at the same time in another.

The watch order varies on how you want to watch. Also, since I have only seen up to S2 of Railgun and Index so far, I can only give you a good watch order for those 4 seasons. If you want to watch Railgun, you can just watch the first 2 seasons of Railgun. The third season apparently has some things in it that would be better understood if you watch Index. If you want to watch the entire franchise, there are a few ways, but I'll just show you two. My suggested way of watching is Index S1 Episodes 1-9, Railgun S1 and S2, then the rest of Index, then however you wanna watch the other seasons. I suggest this way because watching a bit of Index is helpful in understanding what is going on a bit better, and up to ep 9, because the next arc after is much more better in Railgun. If you want to watch in seasons, you should watch Railgun S1 and S2, then Index S1 and S2, then the rest.
