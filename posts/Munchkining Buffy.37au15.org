In S2E10 they found out that being technically dead for a minute awakened another slayer. Shouldn't doing that on purpose with doctors for every awakened slayer asap be the winning move?


** Nope. She ... um, spoilers I guess if you're just now watching the series ... dies /again/ later, and no new Slayer is called. WoG is only the most-recent Slayer "counts", Buffy is now just a person who happens to have Slayer powers.

With that said, I've always felt that the existence of a "curse" that basically /cures vampirism/ was criminally underused by the cast. And I mean criminal as in "you just *killed* /more people than I can count/ who could easily have been saved and added to your baddass good!vampire army".

*** That's why I said for every awakened slayer. When the new slayer died, another came from that, so you have to medically kill the newest one, and undo that. Slayer powers is all you need for people, Buffy doesn't miss anything else than having already used her death makes new slayer thingy, but all the new ones can do that once.

Bending some steel beams: Yes, only the newest one counts. But you can just /temporarily/ kill the newest one to create a new slayer. Do that until you get thousand slayers.

** Canonically, Buffyverse has at least two real, functional afterlives.

That. Changes. /Everything/.

In one, you get tortured for all eternity. That's your failure state right there. It seems like even people who don't "deserve" it can get dragged into that one. Not. Good.

Another is so great, literally so /perfect/, that being removed from it and having to return to Earth is like being shoved into hell. It isn't clear if that one is just for certain people, but it seems not.

In any case, that sounds a lot like something worth exploring, at least to visit. I'd be at worst cautiously optimistic about that.

Certain holy artifacts work, so at least some of Christian religious doctrine works. And some of the value judgments regarding good and evil seem to be metaphysically enforced. Need to test to see if Pascal's wager has some teeth in the Buffyverse. Suicide just to get to heaven, for example, is out until you've got some really concrete seance results under your belt or you're literally being dragged into hell already. Which seems to be a pretty common thing.

Seems like high-priority is reading up on soul magic and ways to use mystic technobabble to enbiggen yours while ensuring a ticket to the right afterlife. Wish machines capable of warping all of space/time exist in canon, so maybe get smart and find one of those.

In fact, I'm not sure staying on Earth in the Buffyverse is min-maxiable. Lots of chances to get dragged into hell, not a lot of power multipliers that don't risk that very same fate. But if you figure out a way you can pimp your soul and rule in heaven...

Not actually what was said there. Reads more like a reduced or downgraded mind forced into a worse sensory suite, more than anything else. See, she never said what she actually experienced there on an ongoing basis. She also didn't say she did nothing or achieved nothing. Just that her Slayer duties were finished, time had a different meaning, and she knew everyone she cared about was safe (that her dramatic sacrifice that dumped her there had worked).

Now here she's talking to Spike, so why would she blab on about all the great heaven things she did that are now lost to her? Just to give him even more emotional hooks to use against her? Nah.

Nothing suggested it was a pointless or goalless place to be. One can always explain away something like that as being a pleasure simulation, a consequence-free VR trap, or a enhanced and enticing sensory experience with no ultimate point, unless the protagonist comes out the other end with functional Heaven Guns or some such.

But I think from context that the point of this wasn't that she was tricked by the Powers That Be or some Slayer Heaven lie and was detoxing hard, but that she was paying a deep cost, having lost something that was real and good to such an extent that it was almost indescribable.

The only possible occasion where someone died and returned with purpose (implying active thought and interaction with surroundings as a soul) is Joyce in Conversations with Dead People, which may or may not have just been a convoluted First Evil scheme, or else something weirder.

On the subject of Buffy!Halloween, if you read [[http://schlockmercenary.com][Schlock Mercenary]] and like Buffy, then this story is a lot of fun: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6928/kevinm+Xander+Mercenary.htm][Xander Mercenary]] It's very much a cotton-candy / guilty pleasure fic -- the spag is a bit flaky and the main characters aren't ever particularly challenged, but it's a blast while you're reading it. It starts as a SM/Buffy cross, then pulls in SG-1 to good effect. Later on (in the sequel? I forget) the author starts pulling in absolutely everything, including PowerRangers and Ghostbusters. Stop reading when you get there.

** Yes, that should work, although SPOILERS FOR SEASON 7

In Season 7 they delve into the mechanics a bit (or rather, make them up). Supposedly there is a proportion of the female population (size unstated, but fairly small) who have the potential to become a slayer. If all of them die, the Slayer line ends and no more Slayers will be created.

Also, at the end of Season 2 we discover that to curse a vampire with their soul all you need is an orb of thessela and Willow. Said orbs are common enough that Giles has one as a paperweight. So why not do that to every vampire, or at least as many as you have orbs?

Also, you can knock them out by hitting them on the head (I think I remember this happening at least once to spike). Which implies that the brain still functions mostly normally and can black out when trauma occurs.

The problem with medicating to avoid it, is that even he isn't "quite sure" how the curse works. So if you make an incorrect guess based on incomplete knowledge, you would lose your identity. So it's a huge risk.
