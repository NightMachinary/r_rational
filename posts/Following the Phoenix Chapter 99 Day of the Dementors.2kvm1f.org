Either way, interesting chapter. Shorter than usual, but hey it was earlier than usual too. Not complaining.

What's Quirrell's game? How can he benefit from this? I'm kinda wondering if he'll do something later, to further exploit the Time Turner weaknesses.

*** The obvious motive is that as a result of todays events, Dementors will go extinct. Who knows what he knows about what happens if Death casts no more shadows into this world? Maybe he thinks immortality for everyone will also stop the "disease" that would presumably kill HPMOR-Quirrel at the end of the year?

**** That... seems a bit too easy. I suspect that Dementors are caused by Death, rather than being the cause of Death. I mean, we already know about the physiological causes of Death, or at least that in most cases Dying Is Caused By Physical Things. Removing Dementors from the equation won't change the physics of being stabbed by a knife, or the reproductive tendencies of microbes, or anything.

***** If nothing else, this will probably increase the number of True Patronus casters and noncasters who want Death dead. /That/ benefits him, at least.

*** He seems to want to set up potter as the hero of magical Briton. After harry stopped his prior suggestions to do so, he is having to force him. This is that plan.

*** Quirrell cannot cast the Patronus charm.

He has been shown to be seriously weak to Dementation in the past.

He learned the truth about Dementors, and he fears death.

He wants Harry Potter to become a Hero, worshiped by the masses.

So, with all these facts, why /wouldn't/ he arrange a situation in which every Dementor on the planet is destroyed by Harry Potter and those who he taught?

It eliminates one of his most glaring weaknesses (One which Harry Potter and Dumbledore both know about), removes the one creature that Avada Kedavra doesn't work on from the world, spreads terror in the name of Voldemort making his eventual defeat even more prestigious, and gives Harry the chance to be the hero.

It hits all the points.

Where else was it posted? I don't see a second copy between here and the ch98 post. I'd be interested to read the rest of the discussion.

*** It exterminates one of his greatest weaknesses, massively strengthens Harry's political position, and potentially significantly increases the number of people who take Harry's view of Death, which benefits him in the long run.

Also, he gets to mindfuck and terrify the entire planet in a couple of sentences, which is just hilarious.

Personally, I think this is the real motive. Voldemort is evil for its own sake; this is his idea of /fun/.
