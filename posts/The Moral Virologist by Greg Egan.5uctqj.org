*** The web serial Twig has a cool one, which makes sense given the bio-punk setting. There's a bunch more smaller examples of bio-warfare throughout the serial too, though they slip my mind at the moment.

** There are lots of Greg Egan shorts to read [[http://www.gregegan.net/BIBLIOGRAPHY/Online.html][online]], my favorites are [[http://eidolon.net/?story=The%20Demons%20Passage&pagetitle=The+Demon%27s+Passage&section=fiction][Demon's Passage]], [[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/worth.htm][Worthless]] and [[http://will.tip.dhappy.org/blog/Compression%20Trees/.../book/by/Greg%20Egan/Learning%20To%20Be%20Me/][Learning to be Me]]. If you read them in chronological order, you can see the evolution of his writing. The ones I like most are disturbing and evocative as well as clever, the ones I like least are the pure, undiluted science porn.

** This was enlightening to read, in that I misinterpreted a major (thought short) paragraph when reading it several years before, and this time untied my misunderstanding (while reviewing it with the intention of commenting on why it made little sense to me). (In retrospect, I must have been reading too quickly or too tiredly the first time.) Pleasing!
