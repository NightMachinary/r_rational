Have you guys ever read First flight? It's a rather nice and well thought out KSP fic


** Bookmarked, thanks.

Speaking of KSP fanfics, does the first part of Seveneves come across as a KSP fanfic to you?

*** If KSP were more about resource management and ISRU in the stock game then I remember it being, Seveneves might be a KSP fic. But as it stands, Seveneves is more like ... a dating sim? None of the major tech work is done by the protagonists, as I recall.

****** What do you see as a viable population to maintain enough of an industrial civilization in space to reach self-reliance? I suspect you'd need a population of six or seven figures, minimum, to support the resource extraction and manufacturing pipelines.

******* You are confusing the economically efficient scales used today with the minimum viable set. Also our society has an absurd amount of inefficiency that would be dropped in a survival scenario. No days off, less intelligent kids would receive only enough schooling to work their entire lives, no care for the elderly, and so on.

******** I don't think I am. six figures is already assuming a massive improvement in labor efficiency over the billions that directly and indirectly support our infrastructure now.

I'm not talking about a short-term survival scenario where you're depending on pre-manufactured precision components from valves to electronic automation modules.

Longer term, like getting to the point that you're growing beyond survival and you don't need planets any more, in a situation where you have /zero/ support from a surrounding ecosystem, you have to have the production lines to manufacture pipes and valves and batteries and switches and the high quality steel you need for pressure vessels and power converters. Even getting electricity is going to be hard. If you want to make high efficiency solar cells you need a whole microelectronic production line and all the production lines to feed into that, so you're probably going to use a big hot panel on one side, a radiator in the shade on the other, and a sterling engine in the middle driving a generator. And you need to be able to build that from scratch. So you need to be refining copper and a bunch of different grades of steel and all the stuff you use to polish the radiator and darken the heat collector and run your working fluid through all that. And you need to be able to make these things on a routine basis.

Let's just look at SevenEves. They're building their survival strategy around these robots with machine learning processor cores. So they need to build a whole microelectronics industry from scratch, and they don't even have tooling to build precision micrometers to start with. They need to have basically all the different types of factories that feed into the microelectronics industry on Earth, from refining rare earths to building the fabs... and even if your fab is small scale, you still need all the parts that go into the production line even if you don't need many of them.

That's even /harder/ than just building a colony that uses humans for automation, and even that requires a serious infrastructure, and /more/ humans than modern factories because humans are cheap and computers are probably vacuum tube based because that requires fewer humans to build.

********* I somewhat agree. The main thing is I don't know what the actual minimum sets look like because I don't know if you could get centuries out of a stockpile of electronics- space is hard on them and you could bring along a lot - and use lower density electronics as well. And the other side of your argument is that 1700s lathes were known as machines that could make almost everything they had then.

I do agree that 7 people isn't enough but 7000 might be. Not 70k or 7 million. You could possibly have just a small number of materials processing pipelines and make everything from just a single type of aluminum alloy for instance. Sintered with 3d printers and refined with a single kind of cnc machine. Less optimal but it might work, allowing you to reach a closed loop industrial infrastructure with less people and complexity.

********** I'm looking for the number of people you need once that stockpile of electronics is gone, and you don't have any 3d printers or CNC machines, and you literally have to manufacture your air and water and build pressure-tight greenhouses and pump air around with electrical power that you're not generating by burning anything.

However many people and machines you start with, they have to be able to grow the population and the living space up to that point, while also doing everything else they need to survive, and they've got maybe a hundred years to do it.

Start with 7000 people, get them breeding as fast as possible, say doubling the population in 20 years (which is pretty good, human population on Earth takes about 65 years to double) that gives them a population of 200k after 100 years. That might be viable... if nothing goes wrong, they don't have a major depressurization incident, they've got teachers, and they can build a habitat 30 times the original size of their 7000 person colony fleet to hold all those people.

That's a super-optimistic scenario though.

(TBH I'm not sure that 7000 people could maintain a machine civilization even /on/ Earth, where you don't have to manufacture air from rocks.)

*********** One thing we can't fully model is this novel takes place several decades in the future. Machine learning driven robots have the potential to hugely increase the density of a manufacturing facility. The reason is a set of waldos don't need to be taught. Anything the host cloud system knows how to make and the materials and specialized tools are present for they can craft. Also machine learning promises to abstract the process of making something from the actual physical waldos you happen to have available. And ubiquitous 3d printer can make jigs and things as well.

You can't build new machine learning driven robots, though. You can't build new 3d printers. You can't build new /anything/ that requires microelectronics, because you can't make microelectronics, because you can't make fabs, because you can't make litho masks, and electron guns, and so on... because you have no supply of pure crystalline silicon and dopants and rare earths, unless you build the factories that make these things, and the factories that make the things you need to make the factories that make these things.

You need factories because you need to build these things to scale, because you're trying to grow your population to the point where you CAN make these factories, because it's WAY easier to make humans than microelectronics.

************* These are good points. Modern equipment heavily uses not only a ton of microelectronics but accurate motor control (needed for any sort of robotics to both mine rocks outside the habitat and to do any sort of sophisticated automation) also needs power control silicon, which are much larger components. (known as mosfets and igbt transistors and there are other methods)

And yeah, you need acres of chip area in the form of gpus and tpus to make anything resembling a smart-ish robot like in seveneves. You apparently cannot succeed in machine learning without thousands of processing cores and gigabytes of memory. (I say apparently because this isn't obvious and is an empirical finding from the last few years)

*************** Quite interesting. I will say that the primary conflict in seveneves was from a politician manipulating vulnerable humans into a plan incompatible with the laws of nature. Sort of how in our real timeline we allow the elderly to develop dementia by the millions instead of doing the obvious thing and flash freeze their brains before they are destroyed. We have convinced ourselves as a society of various bullshit ideas that support all this instead of the only ideas compatible with how physics actually work. (I know there are serious technical challenges with flash freezing but it is likely possible, especially if you use magnetic heating to disrupt ice crystal formation, and assuming you believe that the brain is a physical machine that stores information in physical reality there is no other valid conclusion you can reach as to what you should do about this problem)
