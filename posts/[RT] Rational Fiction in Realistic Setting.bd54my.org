I'm sorry that i can only point at pretty much one film director. On which, the film i like. I can't find another example, so bear with me in a moment. So here it is the film that i thought has element of rational fiction within it, it was made by Iranian Film Director, Asghar Farhadi. Particularly this four films.

1. A Separation
2. The Past
3. About Elly
4. The Salesman

One thing that i'd like to point out is, this is not exactly a fair-play whodunnit. not only because it is not about finding a suspect of murder (still mistery though), but plainly because there were many hint that is being held back and become ambiguous. It is done so off course, purposely, so it can lead to continuity of feeling that you are getting nearer at a satisfied conclusion. The great things though, this element of ambiguity is used to reflect reality or prejudice people have or highlight the general feelings that we don't know much. Take The Past for example, spoiler.

The girl that we suspect is having a usual teenage depression, run away from her home. We come to a point where we thought this is totally obvious, shes depressed because of her parent's married. But then SNAP, our entire prejudice is being questioned, because off course THAT is not the entire story. We then confronted with a moral dilemma, the writer like many realistic fiction never give us an easy answer. You should've just watched it really to get my point.

I can't help but feeling, that this film can extend what rational fictions means. Not only we can have rational fiction in realistic settings, but each element of rational fiction tropes can be used to express reality, I'm excited of knowing what this idea could become.


** For the past two years I've been writing a rational scifi series of novellas which takes place in a realistic alternate earth very similar to our own in the very near future. Its targeted towards a more general audience, and the setting and characterization are designed to be self consistent and plausible. Also for bonus points, includes a realistic same sex relationship between two men who are not effeminate and who also happen to be POV protagonists, and the relationship is a part of the plot and not just grafted on, and the fact that their relationship is same sex is not treated as a special important or defining part of their characters, and certainly not the only important thing about them -- all of these obvious common sense things together are unheard of in fiction.

Also includes a fairly nonpartisan approach/perspective on contemporary politics. The story is fairly critical of literally every single human faction in the world. It basically is intended to hold up a mirror to the world and let humanity glimpse it's own reflection. And it does so pretty concisely, since its a series of novellas rather than novels, for readers with shorter attention spans who are hesitant to commit to reading longer works.

I figured were basically talking about rational earthfics, so might as well talk about mine lol

*** If you are going to talk about how good something is, maybe you should put a link to it?

Edit: On reread, my comment comes off a lot ruder than I meant to be. What I was trying to say is, is there a reason that you aren't including a link to the story with your recommendation? Such as not being ready to post to the Internet or it's going to be a published story?

**** By "rational fiction tropes" do you mean tropes which are central to all rational fiction, or tropes which are common in rational fiction?

Basically the story takes place in a world where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere due to technologically assisted public deception, while meanwhile the threat of human extinction from x-risks (such as AI gone wrong) is drawing near. There are heavy transhumanist themes but the reader is kinda eased into it and it isn't obnoxiously in their face. The protagonist of part 1 and part 5 is a rationalist. Aside from that I don't want to spoil the story.
