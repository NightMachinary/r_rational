** And there we go, that's the conclusion of this act! I hope you guys like it. I ended up editing it and tweaking it quite a lot to try and account for the criticisms I received so far, but in the end, this is how it was supposed to go. On a meta-level, this is the part of the story where the villains have the initiative, where the heroes lose and it gives them the motivation to go "oh shit, we have to get serious", and it just doesn't work to try and spin that in a happy and positive way.

At the same time, I do get why some readers think there are not enough uplifting moments in this story. There tends to be a lot of grey, which is realistic, but... I can't help but think back to when I was reading stories as a kid, and I'd go "I wish I could write so I could make this story go the way it is /supposed/ to." It was so obvious to me that everything could be made 10 times cooler just by having more awesome things happen, and I wonder if maybe young me had a point. That maybe there's this artistic urge to make your stuff deep and complicated and to kind of sniff your nose going "well obviously you can't just give your readers what they /want/, only a pleb would do /that."/ I dunno.

​

Anyway, I'm officially through all of my pre-written stuff now. There is one last epilogue-type chapter coming and then there'll have to be a bit longer wait again as I get the new act together. I'm really excited to get this story completely off the canon rails and see where that takes us.

In the meantime - please read and enjoy!

​

Edit: Oh btw, if anyone has any ideas for Patreon rewards that I could do, or if anyone has any special requests, please let me know!

*** This is basically over the Despair Event Horizon for me. The Sand people seem so utterly psychopathically fucked up that I can't imagine any happy ending that doesn't involve them dead as an end in itself. Making peace with a rabid dog isn't rational, it's just delusional.

Some of the Konoha people are decent enough, but everyone else should be given the treatment HPMOR Dumbledore urged for Voldemort - kill them asap, then forget they ever existed, because even their memory is pure poison.

**** Well, I mean, that was basically Danzo's argument in both canon and in this story. But everyone hates Danzo and thinks he's evil when he says stuff like that, and yet I get the feeling that many of the readers who want Naruto to just unleash hell and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_60Jfwsylb8][kill all the sand people]] also think Danzo is a monster for thinking the same way. Heck, in this very chapter, Rasa and Chiyo explicitly mock the Third and say he is a fool for not killing them. So are they wrong to think so, or should the MC try to be more like them? Because I do think you can't have it both ways.

***** It's not about "being more like the sand". It's not like they're just murderers, or treacherous or anything /mundane/. You're portraying them as almost a relentless train of horror for the sake of horror. There seems to be /nothing/ redeemable about them, they don't even seem to have actual /self-interest/ as a lever to pull on. It comes off like it would be more reasonable to ally with the /kyuubi/.

****** I am really not sure where this perspective is coming from. The actions of Suna seem to be well within the limits of what rational actors would decide to do on both a personal and grand strategic level.

It is perfectly rational from a grand strategic perspective for Suna to preemptively attack Konoha in order to counter their efforts to steal clients in Sand and to generally damage Konoha enough to ensure that the balance of power between Sand and Konoha does not shift in such a way as to overtly favor Konoha. Attacking another nation when they pursue a course of action that is damaging to your nation is a course of action that almost every country in the real world has pursued.

It is perfectly rational from a personal perspective for the Kazekage, Chiyo, and the Kazekage's children to support this attack on Konoha as they all possess a very strong motivation to avenge their loved ones. This is not a particularly nice motivation, but is perfectly rational for them to possess it and allow it to strongly influence their behavior.

I find it really disturbing for someone to consider the actions of Suna to be at "kill them all" levels of evil when everything that Suna has done is well within the bounds of what states and individuals in the real world have done. Do you really consider a preemptive attack on an enemy to be an offense worthy of Genocide? Is it really so hard to understand that people may want to avenge their murdered family?

I would also like to add that Naruto basically use two ideas (1: In order to protect my precious people I must preemptively destroy my enemy before he can strike, 2: It is okay for me to violate the rules in order to protect those that threaten or harm my precious people) to justify his murder of Gaara. These ideas are essentially the same as the ideas used by the Kazekage and Suna to justify their attack on Konoha.

******* A pre-emptive strike can be reasonable and rational. Turning people into flesh-puppets ensconced in a nightmare torture cage, and then cackling about how much the sight must torment their friends is Hellraiser-tier horror-for-the-sake-of-horror. It would help if ay any point the sister, purportedly the saner of the siblings, ever tried to rein in her brother's hammy, try-hard Exemplar of Evil schtick. Instead she acts like this is all perfectly normal for a day that ends in 'y', and even a good thing because someone killed the insane serial killer brother who scared the shit out of her with his relentless, deranged psychopathy. Even the care for Gaara feels like informed ability, or just playing a role.

The grand strategic level also seems like it wasn't emphasized enough, if that's the rationale we're going with. My impression was that Sand attacked Konoha specifically to avenge Gaara, but really so the old lady could avenge her children. And again, the care isn't really developed, it comes across like disutility monsters pantomiming human emotions.

The net effect is that the Konoha characters feel like actual humans, while the named Sand characters are demons in human guise.

  An analogy would be how a military can use napalm to kill many people without actually being comprised of monstrous serial killers who like to burn people to death.
#+end_quote

Napalm and /animated iron maiden torture suits/ are nothing alike, /especially/ from a point of view of warfare. Napalm is generally used to cause damage to objects in the area, and incidentally also happens to get the people, too. If your enemies are hiding in dense underbrush or buildings and don't care about collateral damage, or you want to bomb a place and ensure that it catches fire and does more damage to the area around it (in which case collateral damage is the whole point), then napalm is a great solution to your problem.

What possible military purpose does it serve to put a person inside a suit filled with 300 poisoned metal spikes and throw them against their loved ones? Would you /honestly/ claim this was OK in the real world, if a nations military did that to another nation? You would actively support such a thing?

#+begin_quote
  The general idea is that using Monstrous tools should not necessarily make their user a Monster.
#+end_quote

Tell that to the people who actually used the napalm or other monstrous things in the /real world/ and were psychologically affected by it. Now compare them to this version of Kankuro and tell me that he is perfectly sane and not a sadist.

#+begin_quote
  He could have quite easily killed all of his hostages in a horrific manner at any point.
#+end_quote

Ah, so the fact that he /didn't kill them in horrific fashion/ makes him a good person, and/or him hideously torturing his enemies and using them as pawns makes him a /better person/ than not torturing them to death, and so it's all good?

How about, instead, he has a specific mission to get revenge on the guy who killed his brother (Naruto), and instead of being a torture happy psychopath who delights in making the other Leaf ninjas suffer instead concentrates on his goals and either kills or incapacitates his foes instead of acting like a monster?

See, I don't mind him being written as he is in the story, but don't try and claim he's not a monster because he /could/ have been /more/ monsterous, and therefore it's OK.

****** Hah, Naruto certainly wouldn't want to be speciest when it comes to the prospect of allying with the Kyuubi (though he does have a tiny amount of common sense standing in the way), but either way I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes, Gaara was a literal psychopath, and Kankuro is more of a psychopath wannabe poser, but Temari and Rasa at least are both acting out of genuine grief. That doesn't justify their actions, certainly, but you can't say they have *no* redeemable qualities. Rasa also had a certain sense of honour in not wanting to go to war until Chiyo swayed him, refusing to go after the Third's son, and wondering briefly about the chunin/jonin in the guesthouse he had just killed.

Also an odd thing I've noticed: Characters who do evil things for irrational reasons tend to be much more hated than those who do evil purely for the sake of evil. Heck, Bonesaw and the Joker both have fans even though I see them as horrifically evil, and I still don't really get why the former was accepted as redeemable.

Anyway, all of that is ignoring the more important point that even if all of the named Sand characters are evil, that doesn't mean that the shinobi fighting for them are. You can see at the end of this chapter that the others seem to be afraid of Rasa and Chiyo, and for good reason. So even if you think these specific people are pure poison, that doesn't justify a genocidal war against the entire Sand.

Yeah, but see, the biggest problem is that until those high-ranking Evil Overlords are put down, the soldiers are just going to do their jobs and fight. Especially if they fear their masters more than you. So unless you have a strategy that avoids all normal warfare and instead targets the leaders by specific groups of highly experienced individuals trained and selected for the task (ie: What I assume warfare would be like in a world full of Ninja, warfare "Salarian style"), you're invariably going to have to harvest a lot of regular soldier guys on your way to the top.

While pure genocide should be off the table, there's no way their /nation/ should be allowed to survive in its current form.

I mean more people who do evil knowing it's evil. Card carrying villain types tend to be more well-liked, for some reason - perhaps just because they're more obviously a fantasy and so don't register as a threat. People are much more likely to have personal bad experiences with irrational idiots than with hammy supervillains, so the latter is seen as harmless, or something like that. It's always been interesting to me how some people can write apparently sincere articles about how Thanos or Killmonger or Scar is actually the hero of their story, while at the same time thinking of their own politicians as unforgivable monsters. It's an odd quirk of human psychology.

At the risk of bringing politics into this... didn't we learn from recent history that regime change is usually a terrible idea? If you think of the Sand as fantasy Iran, assassinating their leadership doesn't seem like nearly as good of an idea. The Third in this story has basically been doing the only thing he can do - try to improve relations with the current ruler to prevent the whole situation from becoming seriously worse.

I'd say it's probably because readers/viewers can feel alright hating them or enjoying when they suffer. Since the character crossed a line into a territory where they aren't realistic /people/ anymore, it's OK to hate them, whereas in the real world that might not be morally acceptable.

That, and the hero's "goodness" is a mirror of the "evilness" of the villain. The nastier the villain, the more you root for the hero.

  how Thanos is actually the hero of their story
#+end_quote

That's honestly how Infinity War /actually went/. Thanos was a villain protagonist with a goal he honestly believed in. The fact that he retired to a farm at the end instead of doing more murderdeathkill shows that he honestly believed what he said. The other two examples don't fit as well, as Scar was simply selfish, and Killmonger was all about destruction and not working out a better system.

/Looks at post-WWII Germany and Japan./

No. Regime change, properly done, can improve upon an otherwise hostile and belligerent nation.

What your describing is the more modern, lazy method where chopping off the head of the snake and then leaving while saying "Victory!" is the standard operating procedure. Of course, all it really does is create a power vacuum that causes even /more/ ruthless people to take over what's left and the process has to continue again.

Really makes you wonder if it's on purpose. But that's enough politics.

Allowing an enemy to completely screw you over and murder your people, as has been done here, will make the situation much worse. Absolutely nobody's view of the Leaf will improve from this except a few high-minded idealists, and absolutely everything will be harder from them. Furthermore, the /people/ of the Leaf are always going to wonder when it will be OK for someone else to raid and murder them and get away from it without repercussion.

Then they get thrown in with other kids who just had the exact same thing happen to them, and get ordered to commit war crimes or else. Did you know what war crimes were at 8 years old? I sure as fuck didn't, and you're gonna tell me after it happens over and over again, and gets normalized, because that's how BRAINS WORK, that when they get captured or free or whatever, you would look at them and say, "yep, that 12 year old with Stockholm's Syndrome on steroids, yep completely irredeemable monster."? There's a reason we draw the line at adulthood when it comes to "how much agency does someone have." Is she completely blameless?

I get that you don't want to go over long periods of psychological treatment in a story like that, but it just feels... wrong. It wasn't just bonesaw either. The story was constantly going "hey remember that villain from 2 pages back? yeah we're on the same side now." Then again, the central premise was already that heroes and literal nazis were playing a game of cops and robbers with each other so they can team up to fight Godzilla, so I guess it's just one of those things you're supposed to roll with.

And even after that, she was only as far as admitting she was broken, not "yes this person is perfectly fine and good now they're 100% heroic and everything is fine." And yes some of the horrible villians were cooperating on Gold Morning, because the threat of complete global annihilation tends to do that to people. And they STILL weren't actually all that great at cooperating until Khephri- aka "Finally, everyone was working together."

The Endbringers also were explicitly NOT human, and were basically wrangled in by the Simurgh to help, and with her we don't even KNOW her motivations, for all we know she had something further down the line she was/is planning for. I would say they're a reasonable exception considering their role in the story as "forces of nature."

I'm sorry if I come off as confrontational here, it just really bothers me how a lot of people in this community REALLY don't seem to "get" Worm- It's not a story about optimizing superpowers and saving the world. It's an exploration in trauma, conflict, and communication and the lack thereof, in a world where the consequences are turned up to 11. You aren't supposed to take Taylor's narration at face value, Khephri isn't a crowning moment of awesome, it's a tragic ending to a complicated character who gave in to her worst impulses at a pivotal moment, and just because it worked doesn't mean it was the best path to achieving that victory. Amy using her powers the way she does ("suboptomally") isn't a strike against the story; if you gave most people superpowers at the same time they experienced trauma, their first thought don't going to be to bootstrap that power to infinite energy- which is ironic, because that's the whole goal of the cycle in the first place. This sub especially seems to go into it expecting it to be like HPMOR, and end up missing a lot of the nuance. Hell, some people in this sub miss the nuance of that too, since it's ALSO supposed to be a cautionary tale of assuming you're right about everything.

*************** Oh no, I totally agree with that last paragraph. There is a lot of good character stuff in there, the world building is great, the escalation of drama is fantastic, all of that is true. And I certainly agree that rationality does not replace the need for a character-driven plot. HPMOR was written with the same philosophy, in fact.

But, that doesn't change the fact that in Worm things sometimes happen for no reason. There are a lot of "because path to victory says so" moments, which is just as stupid as when that happened in HPMOR, and things like "a Simurgh did it" is no better than the wizard version of the same. Yes, it's fine to sometimes have things happen without the POV characters understanding why, but things like the endbringers changing sides did not feel like it was properly set up to me, it just seemed like it happened because it was cool.

And the story does struggle a bit with constantly wanting to move on to the next cool thing. I remember being excited for the upcoming confrontation with Kaiser, but then Leviathan showed up and it was just dropped. I remember speculating excitedly about how they might counter Coil's power, but then he just drops his guard and dies. A lot of the time, I had this sense of immense potential that wasn't really explored because there always had to be new cool things going on, and by the end there were 10 new characters introduced for each old character that disappeared, to the point where it just wasn't a character-driven story anymore because they're all fighting to stop a prophesy because some character said so and now the SH9 are being mass produced so we have to fight them and wait that person is a bad guy now so I guess we have to change sides again...

Awesomeness is great, but a story also needs to have room to breathe. Worm didn't always get that, which was a pity.

**************** 100% agree on the pacing, and I'd say that's probably the biggest flaw of the story. He definitely fleshed out a lot more of the world than he showed, and there were moments that could have been focused on for longer. Pact had this problem but on steroids, but Twig and now Ward are definitely slowed down, and I think better for it.

Also agree on the Path to Victory thing, although I think it works for what it is. I suspect we could probably talk in circles around that point for hours and not really get anywhere, so I'll just leave it at that.

The Simurgh I think works though, because when we do see inside her head we find out she's not quite as omniscient as people seem to think, and it works by showing how the "threat" of Simurgh influence, and people's subsequent reaction tends up being more dangerous than the influence itself.

I wouldn't say anything quite happens "for no reason," I can't think of any moment in the story where someone does something or something happens that isn't a result of people acting in their own best interest based on whatever information and perspective they had at the time, however flawed it may be.

Kaiser works precisely BECAUSE it's so sudden and unexpected, him and other characters getting demolished in that fight works to really ramp up the stakes and show just how dangerous this world is. Remember, these things are attacking a major city once every few months, and we really see the impact of that first hand. And it's not like his whole crew just disappears, the remnants of the EEE stick around and still have an impact on the story.

The whole Coil thing is subtle enough that I didn't actually catch it on my first couple read-throughs, but he didn't just grab the idiot ball, they defeated him exactly how you'd counter someone with that power in real life- they built up resources, slowly and subtly enough that he wouldn't notice until it was too late, and then get him in a position where he's forced to use his power with the safety off or risk losing long-term. It's also heavily implied he tried to kill Taylor many, many times without his power, and failed each time- the attack on the Mayor, when Tattletale's power suddenly gave her completely different info? It means that there was a whole timeline where he DID try to kill her, failed, and she went after him, so he had to hold off and try again. That entire fight sequence from the moment he kidnaps Taylor until his death is basically him using his power non-stop, and we only see the timelines where it goes least bad for him. Remember "don't use grenades, whatever you do?" The whole convoluted sequence with the barn and the fire isn't him cartoon villaining, it's plan Z after plans A-Y have failed over and over again. It's honestly one of my favorite parts of the book, and clever narrative structures like that are probably Wildbows biggest strengths.

All nonsense aside though, the implications of his power were never really explored, and saying "he used it off screen for off-screen reasons really doesn't work from a story-perspective. The point is that there is buildup, you raise audience expectations... and then the thing simply doesn't happen. That doesn't mean that what does happen can't still be awesome, but you still end up disappointing some readers by never doing the thing you had effectively promised you would do. It's like Chekhov's gun: If you show the reader a cool railgun at the beginning of the story, it should be fired on-screen - not mentioned between lines how it couldn't be used in the final fight because it was already used off-screen.

****************** Okay, so while that link was very pithy and very amusing, I'm going to have to hard disagree on basically all of it.

For one, Tattletale didn't just wave a stack of cash and magically convince the mercs- she worked with them them most closely out of any of the Undersiders even before the betrayal, and is shown on-sceen to have a somewhat close and trusting relationship to them. You're telling me someone who's whole power is being able to figure things out about people, wouldn't be able to convince a coworker that they interact with favorably over a long period of time that their boss is losing touch, and maybe it's time for a change in management? We don't actually know the extent of Claverts relationship with the mercenaries, we don't know precisely what was said, but there's definitely more to it than "hey look more money."

The fact that he failed to kill her while using his power to stay safe, WAS shown on-sceen at least once, that was the point of the "he's going to kill you" subplot in the Mayor attack. We ALSO know that he HAD to use his power without a safe timeline, because time still moves normally forward, he just gets two shots at things. The debate was only going to happen once, he basically had to make his move then or else he risks the city getting condemned, and he didn't want to leave that up to chance, since if he fails it doesn't matter how many safe timelines he has, his whole enterprise crumbles.

So he's made this agreement about Dinah with the Undersiders, and he doesn't want to give her up because she's too valuable. If he goes back on it directly, they have enough dirt/firepower to be a serious problem. However, Taylor is the only one who REALLY has a problem with it (I'll get to that), and they all back her, so if he just gets rid of Taylor it's likely he can just convince the rest of them to play nice. Which is why he stages the whole "fake betrayal."

So he needs to kill Taylor (something he's been expicitly trying to do and failing multiple times with safe timelines up) without tipping off the rest of the Undersiders that he's doing it, since if they find out they'll go thermonuclear on him. But like I said, he needed to use both timelines already, and he needs to disappear as Calvert asap since he just faked his death, and if he gives up Dinah now it will be very hard to keep trying to get her away from Taylor. So if he leaves a safe timeline and resets to it, he loses Dinah for good. Was it worth him risking everything? No, but it's absolutely in character given how he's acted towards her the whole story.

Also, don't know if you have seen this, but WoG is that his power isn't actually parallel universe creation (which doesn't really jive with the rest of the setting), it's basically a precog power with a weird interface. Which isn't stated but it is implied, based on how his power interacts with Dinah's and the feedback being something that expicitly happens when precog powers interact.

As far as how Taylor's reaction to Dinah's condition and lack thereof for all the other messed up shit, yes, that's true, it's also the point. She's basically using her as a rationalization for everything she's doing. It's the same as her "oh it's okay because it's just cover so I can bust these guys later." She's trying to rationalize her bad decisions but digging herself deeper.

Sure, her power can justify it, but her power could justify /anything/. That's part of the problem. Her power is a black box that sometimes tells her things and sometimes doesn't. It isn't satisfying to have her do stuff like that offscreen and have it work based on what essentially boils down to "a precog did it". There was not enough set-up for her bribing his mercs, and so it wasn't a satisfying resolution for me.

But all of that is just an in-story justification designed to give Tailor a chance. There is no way, absolutely empathically /no way/ that someone like you or I would actually go "Huh, looks like my super-secret simulated attempts to kill this one superpowered individual all keep failing for some weird reason. I guess I have no choice but to do it again except for real this time, despite having no reason to think the outcome will be any different. Oh, and since just shooting her apparently doesn't work, I guess I'll instead use a convoluted scheme involving a perfect body double meant to trick her friends into thinking she betrayed her, and at the same time teleport her into a burning building that she can't escape out of unless she happens to have a gun or something, and I'll just stake my entire life on that. Yeah, sounds good."

The whole sequence is a comic book plot. And that would be fine, in principle, if it were that kind of story. But Wildbow generally tried to have things make sense. Coil was presented as a dangerously smart, rational villain. A ridiculous plot like this, where he ditches his best defence on a ploy that hinges on using new technology to copy her powers, her friends not catching on, her not being able to escape a building etc. when he *knows* that he already failed to kill her several times in the past... it makes zero sense.

Taking the in story reason as given, it makes sense. If there was foreshadowing for the whole Eidolon thing I missed it.

He was never aware of that being one of his powers, and the other powers in the work didn't have that much of a surprise to their holder.)

****** Oh, I don't think Danzo is the good guy actually - not canon Danzo, certainly. But a big part of what I'm trying to do with this story is show how the exact same actions can either seem horribly evil or totally fine depending on who does it to whom, and from whose perspective it is shown.

- Canon Danzo argued that the other nations are evil and that the Leaf should do a pre-emptive strike, and he was called a monster for it. In NTBS, he says the same thing... except he kind of ends up being right.
- Canon Sarutobi was all about tolerating horrific evil in the name of peace. And yet, everyone saw him as the good guy, even when the Head Torturer was standing right there next to him, because he was the Good Guy (TM)
- Canon Naruto was all about forgiving seemingly irredeemable enemies, such as Gaara. But when he does a much less extreme version of that in this story (not killing Temari and Kankuro) it doesn't feel so right. It feels like injustice.
- Canon Itachi slaughtered his entire clan, and most of the readership still see him as a hero, because he was cool.
- Canon Temari casually tossed Tenten onto a pile of her own knives and Shuriken after she was already unconscious and defeated, because... she wanted to show how superior she was, I guess. But it's okay, because she turned good later.
- Canon Kankuro trapped his opponent in an Iron Maiden and impaled him from every side at once with spikes, and he never stopped grinning and taunting even as his victim screamed and begged to be released. And we were *okay* with that because hey, Kankuro was on *our* side now, and he was doing it to one of the bad guys.

That's the point of this. I wanted to show what it looks like to argue for canon Naruto's philosophy of forgiveness in a world that isn't specifically tailored to make that worldview look good. That was the idea, anyway. That doesn't mean Naruto can't still find a way to make it work, somehow - but it can't be as easy as him forgiving Gaara in canon. That simply would not work in a rational story.

******* I wasn't saying he was good. I simply said he was a militaristic pragmatic rationalist. From his point of view, that's the best thing to do.

And honestly, he's still right either way. Even aside the fact that he's actually 'right' due to the plans of the other nations, he exists in a world where standing armies aren't a thing as much as /every army is composed of tiers of various levels of special forces/. Pre-emptive strikes are the /only/ real way to wage war in such scenarios.

Sarutobi may be the 'designated good guy', in which case people will tend to see him as much. That's more of a storytelling trope. But, being rational here, that doesn't stop them from being horribly wrong or outright stupid. If "Peace" is your goal above all costs, you will either force everyone to stop warfare entirely if you are powerful enough, or you will quite peacefully lead yourself and your people to the noose if you are /not/ powerful enough.

Oh no, when Naruto does it in the series, it feels like injustice too. I mean, maybe it's different for other people, but I find it hard to believe. The difference is that in the show he's one of the protagonists that does their best to /befriend the villains/ and show them a better way through his own actions (Tenchi Muyo comes to mind as being one of the archetypal anime that pioneered this approach). Now, realistically, this is /not going to work on hardened killers who grew up being child soldiers/, but nothing else in the world seems to run on logic anyway, so that's just one of the powers of the protagonist, I suppose. Still, it doesn't have to be /justice/, it just has to be /reasonable/. I can see him letting Temari off the hook here, as she was blinded for 'justice' for her brother. But I can't see Naruto, the guy who cares about his friends more than anything else, letting this version of Kankuro off the hook. If anything, he'd come to rightly believe that the man has at least a sizable portion of his brother's madness.

I hate Itachi and Sasuke. And like this version of Naruto, I see absolutely no reason why anyone would be falling and fawning over them in admiration. Even the guy that wrote Sasuke started with him being a "calm cool kung fu genius" type and reverse-engineered his flimsy 'personality' from there. Their characters are some of the /most irrational/ in the original series, and that's saying a /lot/.

The Canon Kankuro example seems more like the previous bit about the enemies being dehumanized. If they're so over-the-top evilbad, then we cease to see them as humans. I'd find his actions disgusting and unproductive either way. Emotions aside, it's impractical to do such a thing, because either the enemy is too weak to be a threat to you anyway, or the enemy is strong enough to be a threat and you are /just giving them more time to escape or survive/. If the latter, just knife them and be done.

But he didn't let him off. He was actively trying to kill him and Temari until he revealed Shikamaru, and then he was in a position where he had to bargain for Shikamaru's life.

Technically, he could have attacked Kankuro immediately after he released Shikamaru, but A) this would be out of character for Naruto and B) the rest of the Sand's army was rapidly approaching, so that wouldn't have been a good idea at all.

He did the sensible thing in cutting his losses, IMO. But I get the impression that some people think Naruto just doesn't care - because he tries very hard to make his decisions based on logic rather than emotion - and that isn't true at all.

For a meta-perspective, sure, you can think "we haven't seen the last of that guy", but from Naruto's perspective Kankuro is just one potential enemy among hundreds, and one way or another the guy is not likely to be in Konoha for long, which hugely decreases the chances of them running into each other.

Either way, Naruto definitely wouldn't go around assassinating people just because they know something about how ninjutsu works. I don't think defaulting to murder is rational at all.

Considering how Kankuro and Temari were actively falling back towards the bulk of the Sand's forces, and considering how Naruto's orders were to evacuate himself and Sasuke, retreat makes perfect sense. Yes, he has agency, but he also knows how badly things can go wrong when you try to take matters in your own hands - especially in an uncertain and dangerous situation like that.

And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS. There are no hitpoints or power levels. Literally any genin could have a forbidden technique that just so happens to perfectly counter your own. Or they could be Uchiha Itachi in disguise. You just don't know.

We've had battles where things are determined in /seconds/. I'm pretty sure he's got time to make the attempt. I mean, it's not like they don't just wander off on foot afterward slowly while Naruto, Sasuke, and Shino all decide to have a chat and perform some battlefield triage on the fallen. Naruto and Co didn't really retreat, they just sat there and let the sand leave. I'd agree that if the Sand ninja were like /right over there/ making a commotion and flashes of light and sounds of battle were getting closer, they might have some urgency.

The only /real/ argument for him not trying to kill at least one of them is whether or not his rather rational rant toward them was heartfelt and he was thinking it reasonably likely he could convince them that they shouldn't fight because they were being played. In that case, it's more him making a gamble on being merciful helping convince them he's serious.

#+begin_quote
  And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS.

That was painfully obvious with the "Hokage killed during a training exercise" bit, which I appreciated. But you've also had scenes where it's pointed out the low tier genin and chunin just got /mulched/ by their vastly more experienced opponents, so I find that strictness of this rule rather questionable.

There aren't power levels in the conventional sense, but there are certainly 'tiers' of threat, and most of those common dudes aren't anywhere in Naruto's weight class, just like he's not in the division of the leaders or sanin. In any event, those threats aren't even visible or anything to him, and there's as much odds that Leaf ninja are in the retreat path as Sand.

#+begin_quote
  And as you could see from Kabuto's fight with Sakura, that kind of attitude could get you killed.
#+end_quote

Yes, but I'm referring to /running away/ prudently when you're obviously outmatched by a visible threat. You're referring to /trying to solo someone/ arrogantly because you think you are better than they are in every way. That's not a character flaw this Naruto has.

At best, his story (initially) seems like it's trying to say, hey, maybe if you train someone to kill from birth, and don't treat them well, in a world that's a little short on clear right and wrong, they might a) go crazy and kill you, b) they might decide they don't like the side they're on and slaughter basically everyone they know, c) defect/go rogue and stop following orders. Why should you do something because someone tells you to, if they're obviously evil? In this light he killed because they were the best, so they were the ones who'd have gone/been sent after him. (Him defeating them /all/ in person is a little overboard - bombs, poison, etc. seem more reasonable/likely.)

Later this turned into >! "if they'll kill /anyone/ if they're ordered to do so, that includes their family/friends/clan". Would have been interesting to see how it'd have gone if the order had been to kill the Hokage. !<

*** I feel like this move by the Hokage comes off as irrationally stupid because there's absolutely /no/ punishment here. Even the part were Gaara was killed was still within the established ninja rules, and Sand broke the rules when they started the attack, and now they've gotten away with it completely scot-free.

This move is a military and diplomatic blunder by the Hokage, since none of the main assets of the Sand (other than Gaara) have been neutralized, they and whoever else can twist this into making Konoha look very /very/ weak. I can estimate the ripple effect this will have on the different forces at play -

- For the other villages : (Akatsuki/Enemy sponsored) Headlines to the tune of "Leaf village elder assassinated, perpetrators escape from right under the Anbu's nose.". Konoha viewed as weak, naive, an easier target. Sand village more respected/feared for pulling off this massive assassination on the head of state of the most powerful country and getting away with it.
- For Konoha's enemies : Have more of a reason to come together, cooperate, be more aggressive, be much more demanding of Konoha. Impression of Konoha becomes that of "weaker village" Overall, more confidence to enemies.
- For Konoha's remaining allies : Shows weakness, taboo in ninja world, shows that even if you betray them they're gonna be fine with it. More likely for some countries to become neutral or lose trust of Konoha's capabilities as a result of this.
- For Konoha's shinobi population : Blue balls their vengeance, no thought given to what they might think about the whole situation. Makes all the powerful people gathered there look like fools, why did they even come there, if they were just going to let the Sand go? They were retreating anyway, so why the whole theatre? Many prominent clans have lost their children, when they find out that the Hokage simply let their killers leave, I'm not sure they will trust the village leadership anymore. Quite a lot of them could become more drawn to Danzo and his "kill them all" mentality. The village unity will be either be broken into a thousand pieces, or become united in revenge.
- For Sand village : Shows that Konoha needs them as allies, even after they pulled off things that would've made them enemies for generations in the ninja world. Shows them that there's a bigger enemy that Konoha is fighting, but (what a wonderful blunder) doesn't convince them that this is Sand's enemy as well. Shows them that they are willing to let them get away with pretty much anything as long as they help fight this greater threat, giving the Kazekage leverage akin to a leash on Konoha.
- For Akatsuki/The Enemy : Great news! Konoha is regarded as an absolute weak/naive nation on the world stage. Our subverted ally Sand has not lost any significant force (except Ichibi, which we have the means to recover). Much easier to convince some of the more neutral villages to side against Konoha, as they want to survive, and our protection became much more valuable than that of Konoha.

Trusting the Sand village to act in the interest of a better world, after they have been fooled twice (or possibly more) by the Akatsuki is absolutely not rational, it's just plain naivety. It's akin to acting like a person with normal values in the middle ages.

Alternate Konoha move -

- Capture all sand forces, kill those who resist. Try to convince Kazekage about akatsuki in prison, if agreeable, release them a little later --> now you have two villages that can cooperate against Akatsuki! Also let the news spread that Konoha didn't let the perpetrators get away. (Likely to fail, as Akatsuki is simply going to assassinate the Kazekage and try to subvert the next one).
- If convincing the Sand elders fails (which is likely, as they have already been fooled twice) keep the entire leadership in prison (or kill them idk, your choice), take over sand village yourself or install a puppet ruler (easier). Now you have a whole new village infrastructure and resources to use against the Akatsuki/Enemy!

After this chapter I'm actually very surprised that the other villages aren't sharing information with each other. My assumption was that each village would want to keep it's failures (Akatsuki's victories) hidden to the others, and so communication regarding that was impossible. But here the Hokage apparently doesn't care about any of that, and is willing to, idk, meet the Sand halfway regarding Akatsuki involvement? Strange, because not once were the Akatsuki mentioned by the Hokage...

I can guess that you, perhaps, wanted to show the audience that this is where the change starts, this is where the inter-village violence starts its decline, where the unification against Akatsuki starts, and a new age of world peace will eventually dawn because of this one move. But you decided to do it at the absolute worst time and place, and with such a drastic action. The sand has broken a treaty, betrayed an alliance, murdered your civilians and /children/ in cold blood. And you just let them go? In a feudal environment? It's the wrong move on so many different levels.

Change comes from slow steps, years of effort. It's never going to be doing or saying one thing, the other villages going "GASP!" and everything becoming sunshine and roses.

#+end_quote

No explicit punishment, no, but as Baki noted, they have lost half of their fighting force in this attack. They sustained far worse casualties than the Leaf (it is implied), Chiyo lost her arm as well as half of her puppets, they expended every last one of their explosive tags, and Rasa's son is still dead. It's simply not true that this attack did not cost them anything.

Are you right that this move makes the Leaf look weak? Of course! That's what Danzo has been saying right from the start - that the Third has made the Leaf soft. The Leaf has had that reputation for ages now, much to his chagrin (this is true in canon as well). The Third doesn't care about this because he *wants* to spread a message of forgiveness, and more to the point, he simply doesn't see the Sand as his real enemy.

Here is the Third's (apparent) reasoning: There is only one fight that truly matters, and that is the one of good vs evil, of light vs dark, and The Enemy appears to be actively trying to pull the world towards the latter. He has realized at this point that the Enemy *wants* the Leaf and the Sand to fight, that all of this was engineered just so that the two allies would kill each other... and so he simply chooses not to do that. It makes sense, in a way.

Now, as Rasa points out, what he *should* be doing is asking for hostages. Rasa would never permit himself to be captured, but the standard feudal thing to do in this situation is to hold his children hostage in Konoha while he goes back to the Sand. Thus ensuring loyalty. And perhaps the Third would have done that, except... he knows that even if the enemy is not literally right there in the village, they've still been actively manipulating things, and there's no guarantee that they couldn't kill Rasa's children to start the war all over again. And since the Third appears to be dying and things are slipping out of his control, he just wants the Sand out of the Leaf before someone like Danzo goes ahead and takes matters in his own hands. There's no time to discuss, no time to think, just do this one thing that he knows for sure his enemy doesn't want him to do.

You're answering the wrong question man, they lost all of this because of Konoha defending itself, not because Hokage told his ninjas to punish the Sand. Then only AFTER all the fighting ends, does the trial and punishment phase begin, but that never happened. There was no visible /punishment/ for this act of betrayal, murder and destruction. Horrible optics and an extremely negative hit to the morale of Konoha's prominent shinobi, who watched all this happen live.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is, once again, extreme naivety on his part. How much do you allow yourselves to be rolled over and still forgive those who do so? Is there no limit to this forgiveness? Isn't this an open invitation for Leaf's enemies to attack and do whatever they want without repercussions? Also, from what I can see, this mentality is not shared by the majority of the city. And now the Hokage is dying, and in his last breath, he has performed an action that would piss off every single one of the families that had someone die to this attack. Who do you think they would follow as the next leader of the Village? Someone who talks about peace with the killers of their family? Or someone who preaches about strength and vengeance against this treachery?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You see, here's the problem with that. By attacking the leaf, they are /aiding/ the real enemy. And from the text, Sand doesn't know it yet. Even in these last moments, The Hokage makes absolutely no mention of a real enemy that they both know about, that are hurting them both, and so the Sand goes back to their lands, still ignorant, still a tool of the enemy.

#+begin_quote

This helps me understand a little bit more, BUUUT again, it is completely wrecked by the fact that the Hokage does not even SAY that The Enemy is involved. He just offhandedly mentions that this could've been engineered by "one of their enemies" which doesn't really inform the Sand about the gravity of the threat.

As far as the Hokage knows, the Sand still think of Akatsuki as either neutral or on their side. Naruto telling Temari and Temari telling her father about them is, as far as I can tell, not known to the Hokage.

And even if he did know, the Hokage simply namedropping them and reinforcing that he understands what is going on, might allow the Kazekage to at least understand that they had been played. But the Hokage didn't say /anything/. Even though we know he was thinking it, and was making a huge decision based on that knowledge. Why hold back this knowledge from the Sand if he thinks they are not the real enemy?

I re-read the chapter again, and this stood out -

#+begin_quote
  “Order everyone to stand down. If anybody so much as touches the Sand ninjas they will answer to me -- understood?”
#+end_quote

The people around him, Ibiki in particular, are holding back so much anger at this decision that I'm actually surprised they're still following the order, considering that the Hokage is dying and won't be around to be answered to anymore. But I guess they still have respect for the office, if not the person holding it. But do you really think they will simply let the Sand get back to their village in peace, with the alliance intact? How much distrust would there be, between the Sand and Leaf villagers? How would the alliance even continue, when Sand traders and shinobi will be viewed with suspicion in the leaf?

Also, even for the Hokage's own goals (peace, I guess), this move seems stupid. Once he dies, Danzo will rally the entire village with the promise of strength and vengeance, and the cycle will continue. As far as I have read, the Hokage doesn't really have a plan in place to counter Danzo's influence.

Yes, all of that is true. Like you said, you can tell how furious this makes Ibiki - but the Hokage is Hokage and his will is law, while he's still alive at least. He's part of the loyalist anbu faction after all. Regardless, this decision will be a major plot point / point of discussion in the next act, so this isn't just some random weird thing that happened for no reason.

This is not the first conversation the Third and Rasa had together. In [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/chapter-30/][Sarutobi's POV chapter]], he and the Kazekage discussed the threat of Anbu together, and Rasa very definitely saw them as the enemy:

/“Mercenary?” Rasa turned his head and spat onto the ground. “Call them what they are: Criminals and traitors. They staged a coup in the Hidden Mist and killed the Mizukage -- one of us, Hiruzen! Now, never let it be said that I was a great admirer of Yagura-” In fact, this had never been said by anyone. “-but it still sets a precedent. With Yagura gone, which of us shall be the next to fall? For all that we speak of our Lineage and you of your Will of Fire, those concepts only hold power for as long as people believe in them. If the world starts to see us as mortal...”/

Sarutobi might not have told Rasa about the Enemy (for the same reason that Naruto never talks about it - they're ninjas, and you never know who's listening in) but he's effectively using Akatsuki as a proxy here to alert the Kazekage of the threat. Rasa knows they're both being targeted, and the Third is obliquely referring to that.

I've edited his dialogue in the new chapter a bit to make that more clear. He now refers to "our mutual enemy", and the strategic necessity of allying against them.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It was only ever an alliance of convenience, so that doesn't change much. They're ninjas: Nobody ever trusts each other. The point is that The Third needs there to be another Kage who is in the know and willing to fight against Akatsuki when it comes down to it, and his own death only increases that need. Especially after Mist effectively had a puppet ruler installed by Itachi, and considering how Stone was funding Akatsuki:

/“As Yūra was saying... we are starting to get an impression of Akatsuki's organization. We count their inner circle at nine so far, plus whatever assistance they may be getting from other countries.” Left unsaid was that the Hidden Stone was almost certainly supporting the Akatsuki by hiring them as mercenaries, if not worse./

Well, bear in mind that you're seeing this from Rasa's point of view, not the Third's. Certainly it looks like naivety to /him/, but an equally valid explanation for the Third's actions is that he's just really really desperate. Just because you attempt something with a low chance of success doesn't necessarily mean you don't understand probability.

Appeasement doesn't work in the real world, and it shouldn't work here, either.

Honestly, I could only see this working if the Sand pulled off its plan but was then *immediately* betrayed by the Akatsuki in such a way that they lost something of importance or great value. Then the Leaf could point out how they were both betrayed, and they could make the excuse that it was another group, and then these two 'enemies' who had this conflict choose to visibly unite against a common foe, which begins a start of a long road toward village and national unification.

Except that this didn't happen, and the Kazekage even /laughs/ at how naive the Hokage is being by going this route. I have to agree with the guy.

** My perception of this chapter will, ultimately, depend almost completely on what comes next.

Konoha is in shambles. They just got betrayed invaded, and lost a lot of important characters. Almost every main character introduced so far has just sustained some serious trauma, or is going to when they find out what happened to their friends. Gai is going to come back from whatever he was doing to discover that both Lee and Ten-Ten are dead. The same can be said for Naruto and Sasuke; Sakura and Kakashi are both gone. And Kiba and Shikamaru and the rest just spent the majority of that invasion being tormented - I can only imagine how they are gong to react to all the horror they just endured.

And then the Third went and did what is probably going to go down in history as the most stupid move in his entire political career. He didn't punish the Sand ninja. Sure, the Sand lost stuff in their attack; but that would be like arguing its not right to press charges against the person who tried to murder you because you broke their arm during the attack. The Sand accomplished their goal (making the Leaf look weak so that they stop stealing their clients) and then made their escape - their overall plan went off without a hitch. They assassinated the leader of the 'strongest village in the world', and in return all the Third did was, basically, tell them to go away.

The Third just pulled a Jon Snow. He's so focused on the big picture that he's forgetting the people around him (especially his subordinates) are human beings with thoughts and feelings. Jon Snow was so focused on facing the Others and saving the Wildlings that he forgot the Night's Watch had been fighting the wildlings for generations, and many of his men had lost brothers to the people he was protecting (say what you will about the character, Olly was justified in his rage). The Third is so focused on facing the Enemy that he seems to have forgotten that his ninja just went through literal hell; just had their homes attacked and their friends butchered by a supposed ally... and then he just let them all go. This is going to blow up in his face spectacularly, and I can't wait to see it; the only sad thing is that the Third probably won't live to see how monumentally catastrophic the consequences of his blunder are going to be.

I could not see an easier way to make everyone support Danzo, than for the Third to let the Sand go without forcing any reparations. He's put the Leaf in a position where they need to be aggressive; they need to reestablish themselves as a force to be reckoned with, and they need to do it soon. I can only imagine what Cloud, or Stone are thinking, watching Sand get away with such a blatant attack on their most hated rival. Konoha is in such a precarious position right now that I'm honestly worried for the Village.

But anyways, to get back on track.; I'm fine with characters like The Third having flaws. I just hope this actually gets portrayed as just that; a flaw in his judgement, analogous to Jon Snow thinking he could just let all the Wildlings through the Wall without any consequences whatsoever. This may be the kind of move that might be good for The World/bad for the Enemy, but that doesn't mean that it's the right move for Konoha, and ultimately the Village should be the Third's first priority. He seems to have forgotten that mercy is a privilege of the strong; you can only afford to be merciful if you look/are strong - otherwise its just called weakness. The Third hear doesn't look strong to his own populace, much less the world.

This is why I prefer binge-reading. The fallout from all of this is going to be incredible, and having to wait to read it is going to kill me :(

And one last thing- When Sasuke talked about keeping it in the family, was he talking about some obscure canon fact that I've forgotten, or is this fic actually going somewhere different with Naruto's heritage/what Sasuke thinks Naruto's heritage is?

And possibly some foreshadowing about Anbu infiltration. Which would help explain that dude that blew himself up.
