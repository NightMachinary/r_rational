** I very much question Cat's answer to both for the Pilgrim and the Saint. Making artifact of pure darkness is classic villainy and those tend to fail the villain during the hero's darkest hour for the heroic comeback.

Those would probably be better suited against the Tyrant and the Hierarch since they are villains as well.

*** I think that was alluded to with Akua's line about "opposing their miracles directly". The plan goes something like this, I think:

1. Cat starts a fight at night, because that's when the drow function.

2. The Pilgrim invokes the Holy Light, creating a magical Dawn, which strips Cat's Evil Army of it's power.

3. Cat unleashes the well, not to suppress the Dawn, but to cloak the drow in Dusk.

Using it to protect her own army is much more story-allowed than trying to oppose a Hero move like Dawn. The Hero army gets the Dawn just fine. But the drow still get to fight in the shade.

**** Yessssss. The pun will be glorious. I hope Vivian is involved, somehow, so she can have an opportunity to one-up Yoink.

King Leonidas : It's an honor to have lived at yours. Persian : A thousand nations of the Persian empire will descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun! Stelios : Then we will fight in the shade.

*** Not relying on artifacts is a tricky rule. When foreshadowed properly, they are guaranteed to work at least once - which, for continuously used tools like swords and armor, means they are indeed ticking time bombs after the initial reveal.

However, the artifacts with discrete uses allow to actually keep track of those, meaning that one-shot trinkets like the blackwood wistle or the Stairway are essentially guaranteed to succeed unless the opposition catches the wind of them too early and turns it into a race to prevent their activation. Stuff like Akua's flying hellgate generator falls int the middle: the first deployment will go smoothly as planned by Akua/Malicia, but after that it has a giant target painted on it.

On that scale the "silver bullet' type of artifact looks rather formidable: both of those are meant for one specific occasion, so they will do the damage should Cat be in a position for it, though she'll have to come up with another workaround if the dawn-related miracles are easily accesssible.

*** Cat thinks in stories. Theres no way in hell that shes just planning to hit them really hard with a big dark stick. They're going to fit into her plans in a very specific way.

As always, it all depends on who uses their Bankai first.

*** Ok so as the people on the other thread said, and while I dont believe this theory it would be glorious, is that they use the well to make the enemy army invincible at dawn and forcing the pilgrim to join them via narrative. It's making yourself helms deep to steal Gandalf, as another guy said

** So I'm kinda sloppy at keeping track of details in this story (in my defense, stuff often takes literally months or years to resolve and involves complicated narrative/magical triggers) but why is Cat no longer bound to kill Akua? Is it just cause she let go of Winter and is no longer magically compulsed? Did Akua's chase in here metaphysical basis for existence somehow void the oath? It seems to me Cat still has a duty based on principle to hold to the oath to off Akua once she's no longer useful, but I may have missed something.

*** She's simply saying that as a mortal, she's capable of breaking oaths, unlike when she was a fae.

*** You basically have it. Cat is not magically bound to enforce the kill oath. She is duty-bound of course but that is the distinction she is making.

**** Wait, shit. She is not bound anymore. This means she can break any oaths she gave to enemies if needed. Damn, I need to read a lot of stuff again.

*** I think its clear that Cat's casual word or oath without specific moment, like her blood oath no longer has magical significance, since winter was stripped from her.

Weather her agreement to thief has narrative significance, especially with Vivian Dartwick likely transitioning to a regent or ruling name has Narrative significance, is not a trick I think Cat missed judging by her discussion of prices.
