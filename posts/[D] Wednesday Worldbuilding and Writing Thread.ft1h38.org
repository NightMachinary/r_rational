Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** You know the "x, but with y instead of z" game?

What do you think of feudalism, but with bureaucrats and managers instead of knights and men-at-arms?

Or Christianity, but with actual cannibalism instead of ritualized pseudo-cannibalism?

Or litrpg, but people get xp only from roleplaying instead of only from killing shit.

*** - Sounds very capitalism
- Whose blood do they drink? Whose flesh do they eat? Does it turn into literal (or even metaphorical) wine and bread in some sort of inverse transubstantiation?
- What role are they playing? Their own? Does that mean you can only level up by being true to yourself?

That sounds a bit like the mechanics of gaining power in Forge of Destiny, in that the result is deeply personal. It's the one good spin of the typical Xianxia setting, in the sense that it's a kind of story it would be hard to tell elsewhere.

** there are a lot of gamer fics out there now. is there any good source for most of the systems they have in common? because that seems like the sort of system that would be fun to take a rational look at.

*** There are quite a few that follow the original "The Gamer" manhwa. Common tropes pull from whatever videogame the author likes best or has seen in other gamer fics, but include:

- Attribute stats that can be increased on level up
- Health in the form of HP, which only matters if you lose the last point
- Text boxes that hang in mid-air
- Skills that increase in level with use
- Skills that evolve, fork, or change with use
- Explicit character classes
- Magical power as MP, with explicit casting costs
- Player inventory that can store lots and lots of things to be pulled out later
- Analysis or something similar that gives vital stats of monsters and "players"

But it varies a lot, and they rarely work off a stock system, at least that I've seen (though I haven't read an endless number of them).

** I would be interested in seeing an essay or article from anyone who is in a rationalist co-op or group. Does anyone know of one?

** Are there examples of magic being finicky and out there, removed from more typical for this sub depiction of a "technology that doesn't work in real life", and still deeply impacting the society? I'm looking for abstract, even unsystematic phenomena or powers that are still widely known and incorporated into everyday life.

*** I'm not sure if this is what you're getting at, but i really like "the astral plane/collective (un)consciousness/platonic idea-realm is a real place that you can access or even go to". This lets you get right down to the nature of what magic actually is while still having it work like an occult practice rather than just fictional physics. The implication is usually that magic amounts to control over perception. It meshes particularly well with a kind of panpsychist cosmology because then matter is downstream from consciousness and perception is reality. Although, it plays reasonably nice with materialism too, but usually there's some kind of multiverse thing going on. I can think of a few examples:

- Control (2019 video game): A shady government organization researches and interacts directly with entities from the astral plane. These beings are essentially manifested jungian archetypes. One consequence of this is that objects with dense symbolic connotations will take on qualities of the concept they signify. Myths and urban legends become mass summoning rituals. You can find a notice at a security checkpoint in the first level that bans "Any objects considered iconic representations of an archetypal concept (e.g. rubber ducks or ketchup bottles)."
- Neil Stephenson - Anathem: A lot of the story takes place in what is basically a secular monastery which is undergoing a schism centered around platonism vs. a kind of phenomenological empiricism (idk exactly what to call it). I don't want to go into this one too much because figuring out what's actually going on with the "paranormal" stuff is part of the fun.
- Charles Stross - Accelerando and Singularity Sky: These ones are more straight up sci fi where the tech in question is "smart matter" (which facilitates mind uploads, seamless neural interfaces, and the ability to imbue pretty much anything with consciousness). It's probably the most credible treatment I've seen of this idea, and really sells the various absurdities that it would entail. There's a gestalt consciousness cult, a refugee AI made from uploading a lobster's neural lattice and then letting it get out of its box, a soda can-sized spaceship crewed by the uploaded neural vectors of long-dead humans living in a simulated reality, a cellular-automata-like nanobot cluster, a sentient 419 scam virus... and a lot more I don't want to spoil.
