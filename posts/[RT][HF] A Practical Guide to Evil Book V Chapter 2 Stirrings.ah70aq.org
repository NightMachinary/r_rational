Yeah, that's the way to foster discussion. When someone who has been following the story for years and [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a43vsv/pgte_on_genocides_of_catherine_foundling/ebbgml1/][defended it at length]] dares have the slightest issue with it just label their concerns dumb.

**** I'm more referring to the "how dares the author take a break and leave a cliffhanger at the point that was originally supposed to be the /middle/ of the book" position.

Also, it's not actually a personal attack since you're far from the only person that holds this point of view - just the one arguing longest and most reasonably. Besides, I don't think we should make a measuring contest of who is the biggest fan: the story having its own sub shouldn't stop people from, say, calling me an annoyance or calling out the protagonist/villain circlejerk.

#+end_quote

Frankly the author should probably take /more/ breaks. At least they take better care of themself then Wildbow and pirateaba, I suppose.

For a serial, the question of where to take breaks is an incredibly important one. So much so that /the/ most successful serial author (Wildbow) elects not to do so at all. The Wandering Inn did a much better job of placing the break within the story this year than the Guide did. I was looking forward to the resumption, but not impatiently and didn't feel that I needed information the author had yet to provide.

As with basically every other serial, The Guide still overuses and misuses cliffhangers. Just look at the most recent chapters of Ward for a perfect example.

It doesn't need to be a personal attack to be unproductive shit-stirring.

This is the main thing I don't get about your line of argument. Why do you keep talking about this information like it's something you /must/ have ASAP? It's not like you have, I don't know, life decisions or work responsibilities riding on it. Presumably any reader who's invested in the story is excited to learn this information, maybe even impatient to learn it, but we don't /urgently need/ it--certainly not to the extent of feeling wronged by the author taking a few weeks' break between raising these questions and answering them.

I also honestly, just in general, don't understand any level of impatience with the author's output. Regardless of /when/ he takes his breaks, this is a web serial--we're getting new chapters at a ridiculous pace. Considering that the break took place between books, if PGTE were a traditional book series, you'd have had to wait at least a year to have your end-of-book-4 questions answered.

Nothing in my /actual/ life depends on it but *my investment in the story does*. The more time that goes past without an explanation the more my investment suffers. If it goes too long it will wither entirely.

This is your biggest misconception. I /don't/ feel wronged, ultimately it is just a story. I do, however, feel that it weakened the story. That's all I have been saying. Not that EE has some....deranged obligation to write until they pass out.

#+end_quote

Were this a traditional book series, the editor would have insisted on a more conclusive ending.

It isn't the authors output I was objecting to. As i complained last thread

#+begin_quote
  We have had: One interlude, one epilogue, one prologue, one bonus chapter and one regular chapter. That is a hell of a lot of content spent dancing around the issue.
#+end_quote

The issue is very clearly not output, it is about focus.

Okay, so just don't be invested. If it seriously affects you *that* much, then it might be better for your health if you stop being so heavily invested.

Plus, if you have such a lack of patience that you can't wait then you have bigger problems than investment.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that investment is bad, no. What I am saying is that if you're so invested that you can't control your patience and get into hateful spats with the community then maybe, /just maybe,/ you're entering unhealthy obsession territory.

~sigh~

Again, I am not complaining about having waited. I am saying the wait fucked the pacing and had a negative impact on the story.

** I had some fairly strong reservations about the Drow arc but i'm really liking the direction this Book is heading. The author of the Malazan series has a term he uses to describe the showdowns at the ends of his novels where his 20 odd POV characters end up together in one huge conflict - 'Convergence'.

"/Convergence. Power ever draws other power/"

That's what it feels like we're heading towards. It's going to be great seeing all these disparate characters we've slowly become invested in all interact with each other. The Tyrant is one of my very favourite characters and seeing Cat (hopefully) interact with him should be hilarious, seeing how the Heroes react to !reformed Akua should be interesting and you just know the Bard will be involved in a conflict of this scale. I think we're going to get a lot of payoff in the not too distant future.
