** Is fanfic okay? [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-going-native.337325/][Going Native]] is a Worm SI - no, don't run just yet! - about a guy who was already working as an engineer, was then put back into his teenager body and sent to Earth Bet, just in time to be displaced by an Endbringer attack, and resettled to Brockton Bay. He's living in constant fear of accidently fucking up the events from Worm canon and thereby destroying the world.

It's seriously well-written, and one of maybe three SI stories I actually recommend consistently. The main character's motives /make sense/ to a degree where even if I don't agree with what he does, I can follow his reasoning process.\\
Character voices are well done, and I can't see any of the usual shortcomings in Worm fanfic, like bashing on characters or making them less intelligent than the main work.
