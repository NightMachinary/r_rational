You are the Inquisitor, alleged Herald of Andraste and last, best hope for the people of Thedas. However, it occurs to you that while the plans of your subordinates might work, you might do things more.. sensibly.

That's right, it's rational Inquisition! Assume in character knowledge only - that is, no "real world" knowledge. Use what's in the setting only. And have fun!


** This might be an interesting post if you gave any sort of context for it. In addition, even when referencing an outside work, it's best to give an overview of the more critical elements like the setting and characters involved. With a canon to reference and sufficient background to describe our character's ends and means, we have enough to work with. The post as it is is like throwing a two-week-old kitten into a pool and saying "Have fun!" with roughly the same tone as the end of your post.

******* Seconded with the below

Assuming we have credible authors and reasonable rules. (I'll accept anyone in rational's top 20 arbitrating rules < or top ten barring transfutirist saying a story credibly does the same allready) ) I'll second you and put up $20 for a discussion of how a cannon inquisition crushes a rational one or a rational one overcomes the traditional one (no ooc and ceritus parabus assumed & no-one more rational than say than Baru.)

** If you're familiar with the setting, the post makes sense. If you're not, I can't see you getting much out of it in any case. v0v

That said, you should definitely check out DA:I if you haven't already. You're missing out, friends.

Edit: that said, I should still probably flesh out the OP more. Serves me right for posting before breakfast. :p Edits inbound!

**** Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's third in a trilogy, but I ~think~ it holds up well enough on its own. Naturally I can't be entirely sure on that.

As for buying it, it's often on sale on Amazon. Legit sorry this turned out so weirdly, I had assumed (incorrectly) that people here would have played it. Still going to expand the OP when I find time.
