I think it would be more rational for Naruto to wait till he get more chakra factories online, but it is understandable that he doesn't want Jiriya to die.

*** See, when I first read chapter sixteen I thought his regen was 6.5 /million/ per second, not 6,500.

There's no way stopping there was a good idea - if you've got potentially-infinite regen, there's no sense in stopping before you're at least two orders of magnitude above the theoretical maximum expenditure rate (also uncapped via shadow clones?).

*** The trouble with that is that, while rational, it's very rarely a good plot point to give your protagonist literally limitless power. Afterwards, there's no tension. If Naruto were currently regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together, the story would be over.

As an aside, it's likely that he'll be regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together by the time the story is over.

I disagree - especially with the final arc starting. That kind of power isn't a "fix everything" button - simply power. What do you do with it? What are the unintended effects? Would it have been better to simply talk things over?

There's still an interesting story to be told, when an imperfect character gets grand but still limited power...

*** Considering it had been hinted at already (and the fact no "realistic" ninja fiction can ever get by without at least passing mention of rape) I was actually more surprised that it took until this deep in the fic for Naruto to explicitly point out that civilians were /slaves/ with /owners/.

I guess he just doesn't see it as unusual, having grown up in the society.

**** I don't think it's the rape itself as much as the casual conversation about on the way to the shop that's skeezing me out. And the fact that it happened /in/ Leaf. I guess I'd always thought of wartime rapes as the sort of thing that happens along with the looting that follows a successful invasion in foreign territory, away from the restraints of the centralized institution.

This says more about how authority and institution have skewed my own sense of what's okay than it does about the relative immorality of raping someone versus talking about it. "Such things are 'uncontrollable deviances of base human nature' as long as they occur away from me and not under the auspices of the institutions that protect me. Or at least, if they are under their auspices, they don't do it /here/"

Reminds me of the debates about torture in Guantanamo Bay. I wonder how that would have shifted if it was happening in the continental US. Probably not that much if we had been promised that torture was only happening in "special zones" and would surely not happen in the protected zones where human rights were actually a thing and /real/ people lived.

***** Note the sarcastic quotation marks. Rape is /grossly/ overused used in fiction (written by lazy authors) to show how bad a person or society is ie [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil][Rape is a Special Kind of Evil]] - think about why Law and Order SVU exists for a prime example, or think about why Irreversible was so much more controversial than Inglorious Barsterds.

TVtropes also has [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama][this to say]] :

#+begin_quote
  (Rape as Drama) is horrifically overused in Fan Fic, for a number of reasons. Most often, it's just as a cheap shock in backstory without bothering to explain it any further than a sentence. Sometimes it's used in a case of Die for Our Ship, in which the character the writer hates is the rapist, and the rape is used as a device to get the two desired characters together (usually after the character the writer wants to "win" the ship war kills the perpetrator). Sometimes it's just used to make a Woobie out of the writer's desired Canon Sue, or to pair the author's Mary Sue or Marty Stu with the victim in a Hurt/Comfort Fic. It's arguable that less than 1% of Fan Fic actually uses Rape as Drama effectively, as most of the 10% of "good fics" that Sturgeon's Law claims there to be avoid using rape entirely.
#+end_quote

I could go on for days about why it is a /bad thing/ beyond just being horribly lazy, but that discussion has been had many times here and in the hpmor sub.
