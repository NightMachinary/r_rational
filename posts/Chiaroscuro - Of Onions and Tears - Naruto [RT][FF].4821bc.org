*** Huh, I guess I assumed that this story had been linked here before. It's certainly good enough to have been.

Edit: Well, might as well explain it then. The premise it that Shikamaru isn't a lazy ass, and instead turns his sizable intellect towards being a ninja. The writing is proficient and the world seems very consistent. It's solid rational fiction.

**** I ended up losing interest in this one after a while. The problem I have with it is that, despite Shikamaru being heralded as the second coming of Itachi Uchiha from the very first chapter, I never saw him do anything impressive enough to justify that claim.

***** Well it seems to follow Naruto canon except for some small changes to make it more rational and make the premise. Many of the rational Naruto fics tend to change things enough that there are rather implausible power leaps very early on whereas all Shikamura has learned is what would be reasonably expected of him in these circumstances if he wasn't lazy.

Basically, the author didn't make him any more intelligent or munchkiny, just more willing to put what he has to good use.

***** It does sometimes seem to lack that certain spark that means greatness, though it's certainly not a /bad/ story by any means. It's solid, well written, decent dialogue and so on.

Better than most but worse than some.

As for the Itachi comparison, they were similar in intelligence, not in strength. Also cheatigan eyes make leveraging that increased intelligence much more effective.

** Oh a chiaroscuro update.

Spoiler: The Kabuto death was unexpcted. At a certain point I thought Kabuto killed and replaced Ibiki.

Would have loved more stuff about Sand nins, really curios about how they were treated.
