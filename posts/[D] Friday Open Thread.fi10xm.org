Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So last Saturday [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep In Pact]], the podcast analysis of [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], recorded their final episode covering Pact's epilogue, and to celebrate the occasion, they did a 24 hour livestream on [[https://www.twitch.tv/doofmedia][Twitch]]. They had fun activities like taking donations for charity in exchange for doing drinks or "Tarot readings" for listeners, Musical brainstorming, or roleplaying games. Special guests were Matt and Scott from We've Got Worm, JayManiac the author of Worm's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFvV0BvPtkg][Entities as Audience surrogates]] theory, and the man Wildbow himself.

Memorable moments were the two Aussies getting drunker and drunker because fans kept making them drink disgusting mixtures, their attempts at drawing fanart within 60 seconds, [[https://twitter.com/mediamdpodcast/status/1236801837631557632?s=21][Elliot's Barbered face]], the two of them fighting to stay awake after 24 hours of talking and drinking, and, of course, Wildbow's live interview. I didn't get to watch the whole thing live, but I'll be watching chunks of it here and there, and I think they're planning on doing a highlight reel on Youtube, as well as uploading their last episode to podcast apps sometime this week.

It was great fun, but I already miss the two to three weekly podcasts which I listened to on my way to work.

I shall note as a personal failure that I failed to call people not in this close group that are at risk or have immediate family thats at risk. Like my 70+ godmother or those friends I only talk to on a monthly basis with their parents. Best of luck to you all in the month to come, internet friends. Glad to have your company.

** Are there any actions or precautions a rationalist should take during this coronavirus pandemic that your average person likely isn't taking?

Personally I don't see it as something worth panicking over. Let's say the chance of getting it is 10% and 2% of victims die. That's 0.2% risk of death. Probably less if young and healthy. Scary, but not much more than dying in a car crash or from cancer. Do you think my numbers are totally off?

Edit: my numbers were way too low.

*** I wouldn't take Death as the only significant threat. Despite some countries deciding they'll just let 70% of their population get it eventually (IIRC, that's Germany & UK's plan), it really really sucks to get.

People talk about the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) as though you get it and then either die or recover. Of the patients released from Hong Kong, some had a [[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3074988/coronavirus-some-recovered-patients-may-have][20-30% drop in lunge function]].

#+begin_quote
  A review of lung scans of nine infected patients at Princess Margaret found patterns similar to frosted glass in all of them, suggesting there was organ damage.
#+end_quote

We don't know how often it causes permanent damage although 9/9 seems very frequent, and we don't know how long term that damage is, but so far I still haven't heard of anyone who's fully recovered with zero lung damage. The closest we can compare to is SARS. [[https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2010/09/02/sars_survivors_struggle_with_symptoms_years_later.html][One article]] said SARS resulted in permanent effects for 88% of its survivors 4 years down the road. Imagine just getting a disease, getting sick, and then never quite getting 100% better ever again for the rest of your life.

--------------

Aside from just a permanent lung tax for the rest of your life, keep in mind that's just for the average 81% of cases that are mild. If you're part of the 19% that have a worse case, you /need/ oxygen. That means you already went a sustained period with lowered oxygen unless you've gotten really lucky on diagnosis. If you're slow to get onto oxygen or the hospitals are too slammed for you to get oxygen (and all hospitals in the affected countries have been slammed, the only question is how much), you're maybe looking at some permanent damage to your brain, kidneys, and heart among other organs. On top of more lung damage.

Then there's also the unlucky 5% chance to need a ventilator. As best I was able to find, anyone on a ventilator long term has a >50% rate of mortality within a year, although that's other causes.

--------------

So to combine these-

- 81% likely permanent lung damage\\
- 11% likely permanent lung damage, chance for brain, kidney, heart damage
- 5% go on a ventilator, 50-50 chance you die later, plus all the other organ damage\\
- 2% jackpot you die\\

That's quite a bit worse than just saying 'ah, 98% chance to be fine!'

--------------

I would focus 100% on not getting it.

As for what you can do, I'd say that you should take social distancing seriously and make sure the people you live/interact with frequently do so as well.

Also be willing to look stupid for a better chance at avoiding the virus, like wearing a mask and being fastidious with sanitation, even if the people around you aren't.

You don't want to be saying two years from now, "I can't jog more than 50 feet without being winded for the rest of my life, but at least I didn't /look silly/ by taking the supervirus more serious than my friends did."

**** First-year respiratory student here. I heartily concur that trying to get a disease more quickly is a terrible idea, but I'm less convinced where the scarring is concerned. As the article notes, it's not clear to what extent this condition will be permanent, and SARS was a notably more brutal germ than this--which is part of the reason why it spread less effectively. Also, it says two or three of a dozen Hong Kong patients showed decreased function--and doesn't mention how jacked up any of these patients' lungs were beforehand. The disease is more likely to hospitalize people with existing conditions, and I could see coronavirus tearing up an already weak pair of lungs.

Any protracted illness of the lungs can cause "anatomical alteration," as my textbooks put it. They react to continual stress by deforming. That's how COPD gets you. However, we're not talking about a truly long-term stress here, so my barely-educated guess would be that at least some of that function might be restored by therapy. But, y'know, first year student. I've got a lot to learn.

**** I think you're neglecting some selection effects here, as in the people tested for lung damage are going to be ones whose symptoms were bad enough to get into hospital care.

The part about hospital capacity overload is the more relevant, I think, besides the need to delay the infection until better treatment is developed for vulnerable populations.

TLDR; Mask use is effective but people just don't wear them. When you actually wear the mask, you're significantly protected. N95's are basically identical protection to surgical masks.

--------------

Also, fuck the CDC for saying to the public that face masks don't work, when their own guidelines say that it provides significant protection.

Check the chart near the bottom of the page. If a CDC worker comes in close contact with a patient while they don't have a mask they're are at medium infection risk and must take 14 days off work; if they have a mask they're at low infection risk and fine to keep working.

Also, masks definitely provide little protection when they get wet, and the general public isn't going to replace their mask every time they contact a new person. So those masks are better used in the hands of people who know how to use them anyway.

If you get Corona you have a 0.2% chance (again number for the young) of dying in a month (rough duration estimate from incubation to recovery). It's like increasing your risk of death by +25+12x in that month (i.e. the 0.1% base risk is for the year, it's much smaller per month).

Not sure where you are getting the 10% guesstimate. Without social distancing the chance of getting it is close 100% with exponential growth of infection. With adequate isolation that can be arbitrarily low. If you are young and healthy the main concern is passing it on your elderly family members.

*** Let's instead say the chance of getting it is 75% and the death rate is 4%.

That's 3% of everyone.

In other words the statistical expected value of how many people will die in your top 33.3 is 1 person in that case.

At 0.2 that's 1 in your top 500.

So yeah, even at the too low estimate chances are someone you went to school with will be dead from coronavirus when it's all said and done (or someone you know about that well)

And that's for everyone who is within the 0.2% population so even if you're lucky and nobody you know gets sick, most people you know will have e had someone they know to that degree die of it.

That said, mortality rates are heavily skewed toward the elderly (80+ range) so for the most part it's likely to be someone in that range.
