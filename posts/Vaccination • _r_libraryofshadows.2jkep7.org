** Hmm. The opening was strong, but I think it really fell apart when [[/u/Aquareon]] chickened out of the "vaccination" and decided to just make it Xianity.

*** Different religion. This was a way to get rid of a sizable chunk of the rapidly dwindling immune population, but also loads of hosts for a competing replicator. She is able to recite the vaccine without trouble for the reasons alluded to when the story talks about antibiotic abuse creating resistant viral strains. Although it wouldn't be especially effective anyway as "it needs to be administered prior to infection". I did not spell all of this out in the story because I could find no seamless way to integrate it into the narrative and it wasn't necessary for the story's impact.

** That sub has truly beautiful CSS. And the story is a pretty humorous take on the idea of a philosophical zombie. Good find, [[/u/traverseda]]!

*** Pretty sure it was a satirical comparison of a zombie-esque apocalyptic virus to viral memeplexes such as fundamental Christianity, not anything related to philosophical zombies.

**** Thanks, was severely tempted to post the definition of philosophical zombie but was afraid of looking like a huge autist. (Still deeply appreciate the praise!)

**** I know my definitions; I was using the term literally. Zombies of philosophy. People who are zombies because of their philosophies or beliefs.

*** Fairly sure that that's not what a philosophical zombie is. I thought it was just poking fun at Christianity
