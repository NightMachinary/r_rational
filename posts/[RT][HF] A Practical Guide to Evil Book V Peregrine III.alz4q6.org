** that was... slightly disappointing. I guess even from his early years, the Pilgrim had the "my way or the highway" attitude.

It's interesting that the Ophanim support him with this way though. A lot of the things he does will have far reaching consequences on people who don't know better, so what does "mercy" constitute of anyway?
