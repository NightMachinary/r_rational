Here we are again. Another 'episode' of Onward to Providence wrapped up.

Check the thread marks for Touring if you are just catching up from last time.

Otherwise reading from the start is the best choice.

Xenofiction and althistory/physics.

I'm a little surprised no one has guessed at one of the pretty glaringly obvious diversions from conventional physics I'm running with.

Ah well.

Also during this chapter a fan made a plushie of one of the characters. it's adorable, check the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][Space Battles link]] for that.

You can also read it on [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926/][Sufficient Velocity]], where people seem to like to be more personable (I blame the hug tag).


** Tiny Tunie is adorable. Big Tunie as well, for that matter.

I strongly recommend this story as something that promises to be a fascinating sort-of hard scifi (alt-physics scifi?) story. I especially enjoy how [[/u/nighzmarquls]] manages to create characters that combine being utterly alien, relatable and believable.

If OtP seems somewhat interesting, you might also want to check out their previous similar work [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150421102920/http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure][Deep Rise]]. It is one of my favourite fictions of all time. Sadly, the original version was lost and I did not find it on one of the proper archives.

*** I've sort of got a vague idea I want to go back and remaster deeprise. It was done as a kind of text version of nanowrimo. I did daily illustrated updates for almost two and a half years and the quality sort of suffered for it. But the exercise taught me how to produce consistently and is part of the reason why I can manage the pace of writing and illustration at the quality I have now.
