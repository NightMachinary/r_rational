****** The reason why Cordelia refused to become a hero is because how heroes operate. It's like that Captain America quote from the comics in civil war that goes something like, if the whole world and it's governments decide that something wrong is right and tell you to move, you tell /them/ to move.

Olivier saw a way that he could have prevented all of this death and destruction and all it would have cost was his own selfish desires. Once you get to that thought it isn't a "degree of goodness" anymore, a person can't take the (perfectly reasonable) view that they held no responsibility and still be a hero.

While some stories explore heroes of other varieties, the mainstream and classic (not classical like greek) heroes work this way. It's why Spider-Man holds great responsibility, it's why heroes don't tell their loved ones because continuing to save people is put before their own happiness.

*** The final charlatan chapter is great, somewhat expected (named stories tend to), and nevertheless very satisfying.

Oliver-cum-Roland deserves the attention, the backstory.

*** Anyone else seeing parallels with how Catherine has brought in Named under the T&T and the mage collective that Rogue built? Similar tension of having power that normal forces can't control leading to tension. Uncomfortable compromises with temporal authority etc.

And potentially ominous foreshadowing with how Rogue's version failed because of members of it who wanted more power, and the inability to restrain them.

** I wonder what would have happened in the alternate timeline where Cat just straight-up tells Hanno what she's going to do, treating him as an accomplice instead of an obstacle.

Because see, I think the reason why he's mad isn't so much that he hates what she did; it's that she didn't trust him.

**** Or he just... didn't think of that option. I don't think we have any reason to believe that Hanno's Name would preclude this solution; in fact, I think that Hanno's reaction - specifically, that she should have trusted him instead of treating him as an obstacle - is meant to imply that he didn't have a real problem with it as a solution.

***** I like him and I wish it was possible for them keep working together closely because I like the White/Black interaction, but the difference between their names means when Cat finds an "innovative" solution like this not only is her name not getting in the way she's actually being true to her nature, but with Hanno I don't think it would be possible for him to ever agree to this under any circumstances. It's like when you play a paladin in a RPG and some dialog options are grayed out or just don't even show up.

****** You say that with such apparent firmness, but the textual evidence says otherwise. Hanno doesn't say that Cat has lost trust because her solution was offensive; he says that she lost trust because she treated him like an obstacle.

I see no reason to think that the option is, so to speak, grayed out.

** I liked the extra chapter, but I'm still sorting my feelings on it. Random thoughts:

- I had mentally been calling Olivier as "Oliver" the whole time. Anyone else?

- The ending seemed rushed to me. Would have liked to have seen Roland's side of things and mental process. Also curious how he learned about Alisanne's plans, and specifically about how they involved Olivier. Who told him or how did he learn of them?

- Wondering why the raiders had live horses ( presumably, since they were drinking from a stream). I wouldn't have expected them to be able to ride, since they seem fairly rudimentary and inattentive. At first I thought it was just Roland and his teacher who had them, but it sounds like they fought before he left to start the raid, so only one would have been needed.

- I expected the name swap at the end, but I had expected Roland to live and become the Wicked Enchanter. Would have set up an interesting arc when Rogue Sorcerer discovered the murdered Damned was his long-lost brother. Oh well...

- That being said, I think Olivier's crafted story was a bit too convoluted. He added a Praesi warlock to take blame off Morgaine and Roland, but then swapped himself for Roland to avoid giving the truth away. Because Roland usesagic and Olivier didn't, right? But making the story that Olivier came into his magic by becoming Chosen to avenge his brother solves the issue without the need for a face-swap. The Heavens bestowed him the Talent; who'd question that? And then there's no chance at ever worrying if he meets someone who knew the brothers, or from someone who can see through illusions.

- Looking forward to seeing what Alisanne has been up to since this backstory!
