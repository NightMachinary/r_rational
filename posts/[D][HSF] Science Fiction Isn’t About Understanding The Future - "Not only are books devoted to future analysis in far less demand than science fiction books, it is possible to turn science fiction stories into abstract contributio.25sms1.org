**** Having actually read the blog entry, this is getting outright removed. Hanson presumes /way/ too much, merely for the sake of enabling himself to appear intelligent by cynically knocking over a series of blatant strawmen.

Okay, this blog post wasn't very good, that's given. It was short on substance. But it seems a bit like you're letting your personal dislike of him affect your modding. I didn't get that wanting-to-appear-intelligent vibe at all. I actually thought he was making not so much factual statements, but just merely announcing his opinions about sci-fi stories and sharing different ways to think about sci-fi. I mean, he probably intended to make factual statements, but I took them to be just his opinions. That way I don't have to pull my hair.

I posted it because the "turning science fiction stories into abstract contributions" and focusing more on settings are interesting ideas that could have sparked good discussion.

What if he's arrogant and cynical? That doesn't mean he can't have useful ideas.

It is, but... well, basically, I can't help but agree with what [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] said about the particular blog entry. Probably, "trying to appear smart" /is/ my personal dislike talking.

However, that doesn't excuse Hanson for asking wrong questions, coming to informationally /empty/ answers, and then claiming to have found something.

The right way to do this would have been to ask, "Is science fiction about understanding the future?" and then continue by asking the very first question that would occur: "Does anyone /speak or act as if/ science-fiction is about understanding the future?" To which the plain answer is, well, /no/.

Well, actually, I tell a lie: Margaret Atwood seems to sincerely believe that her speculative fiction reflects reasonably probable futures. But most other scifi authors basically don't believe that in the first place.

He wrote that because he'd personally like to see more that kind of fiction. Yeah, almost all science fiction is like that, but that doesn't mean that science fiction could never be about understanding the future, that it /shouldn't/ never be about understanding the future. I mean, there isn't much rationalist fiction. That doesn't mean that it /should/ be like this - that there are no people who would like to read rationalist fiction despite the status quo - like the existence of this sub implies.

I share Hanson's opinion and would like to see more sci-fi that's focused on settings and plausibility of those settings.

Ok, but the divergence between your opinion and current-day reality isn't really that surprising. Opinions are usually not accurate descriptions of reality.

Did I just miss the part where Hanson said he was expressing a wish or opinion?

  Alas, because I would love to just read setting summaries, especially with compare and contrast commentary, and educated critiques of their plausibility.

*** My reaction is basically 'well, duh'. It's an article with a blatant stretch in the premise, which robs any conclusion of any power it might otherwise have had. It would, after all, make much more sense to say 'clearly SF readers aren't after "abstract analysis" of the future, so what /is/ so interesting?'... but nope.

I read science fiction because it (hopefully) consists of good story/characters/setting, and when great explores something out of the ordinary - for example /The Dispossessed/ could only have been published as SF, or /Surface Detail/ which to get the appropriate impact cant afford dry analysis.

It can be 'true' in the sense that it reveals something about the reader, the writer, and the context and expectations they live in (though not always what you think it does); but it's not a prediction of the future.

100% agreed.

Yeah, science fiction is usually about the present. /Really good/ science-fiction can manage to function as a manifesto for what sort of thing someone in the present thinks about how the future /should/ go.
