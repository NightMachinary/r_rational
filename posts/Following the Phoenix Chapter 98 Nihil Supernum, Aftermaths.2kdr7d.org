** I have to say, I'm really enjoying this story the most out of all the HPMOR spinoffs.

The characterization is close, the plot is good, and I like the use of the True Patronus Charm and the Interdict.

** I don't know, Draco seems too easily convinced in this chapter.

It seems he become better rationalist than Harry, and his only flaw is being too gullible towards Harry.
