** I eagerly wait for the new chapter every week. I really like this magic system. It's so well put together and thought out.

But man, the writing is not very good. All the characters have the same voice and the same personality. And the dialogue is so cringey and juvenile.

But damn that magic system is so good.

***** When I said webnovels I meant the Korean or Chinese or Japanese ones. I don't disagree with you on the western ones completely but they have higher highs and that's good enough for me. There are, however, writers on par with the ones you mentioned and they mold my opinion of westerns into being good.

At one point there were more names on this list.

**** Come on, it the "more Zork than Unix" line more than made up for it. It's the best line in the book so far

I really liked the way the obelisk did the work for him, clearly it has to work hard to adapt to everyone's unique interface. I think that made a lot more sense than him building a terminal all by himself

**** I wonder how he's going to handle the soul fragmentation and paling integrity once he's in the state of mind to tackle that. Will the terminal be able to direct him, or is going to basically have to use it as a check while makes his own ad hoc defragmenter? Plus that whole Core Level: 18 Error Threshold thing proves he's not actually level 18. But whether him displaying as 18 is due to his own preexisting assumptions about how all this works or due to something inherent to the world is still up in the air. Personally I would find it hilarious if this entire time all he had to was "Free his mind" and make some alternative leveling macros to bypass the blue restriction

***** I'm pretty certain the Core Level: 18 Error Threshold just means level 18 isn't high enough to safely use the terminal. After all, in the very next line it says "Core threshold not met."

***** Do we have any indication what soul fragmentation means yet? The paling integrity is clear, but it could be the fragmentation which is causing the problems with his entry into his soul

****** Computers have an issue with drive fragmentation. Every so often, a hard drive or other storage device needs to be defragmented, or else errors and poor running performance result. This becomes more and more of an issue when the drive fills up.

Working from this analogy, Rain has a core level 18 soul which is nearly capped on skills, on top of which Rain has heavily modified the UI and greatly improved his synchronization. Presumably, upgrading his core will get him a new container to accommodate all the features of his current core, as well as his customizations.

This is obvious. The question is, what does soul fragmentation mean in real-world delve terms? I don't think this is answered, but in my opinion, it is likely related to rain's inability to access his soul.

#+end_quote

Given the nature of your question, it wasn't clear how obvious.

I suspect Rain's inability to access his soul is separate from his fragmentation issue. Most people in Delveworld don't access their souls outside of their interface.

What Rain does have a problem with is binding and using additional Accolades. These are apparently external to his soul, and interface - at least initially - through the paling. His attunement to objects such as his armor have not yet shown an impact, but it's possible that his ability to attune to additional objects has been damaged. The terminal's ability to communicate with him has certainly been affected.

#+end_quote

Possible. I'm guessing that the soul fragmentation is the "chaotic energy" which pushes him out, and that if his soul was not fragmented, he would be able to access more easily. This guess is based on some assumptoin that clarity/focus facilitates the soul access process, which is a very weak assumption given current evidence. In general, I find it odd that very few people try to access their souls, desipte their presence appearing to be common knowledge. But many people in Delve are stupid so there!

You're probably right on all accounts.

Actually, the terminal only quoted the paling integrity as a warning, whereas several other values were errors. If I was going to guess, it is those values which drove the issues. We know from other text that it is expected that low-level individuals are not expected to be able to interface with the device (is this because of low clarity? low focus? low soul level? something else? unknown). This has been shown with both the barrier and the DKE Link.
