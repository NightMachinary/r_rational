*** To be fair...he is risking a lot. He exited the loop, so now he has no way to influence what is happening inside of it. He has no way to turn it off either-as far as timeloop is concerned, he froze in time at the exit. So now he may very well end up in a situation where he exited the loop, expecting to be the last one remaining...

...and finds out that Zach and Zorian exited it too, and not only that, but they are also WAY more powerful now.

Then he'd realize at some point they'll figure out only one of them can escape and everything will go FUBAR if even one of them leaves before the others.

******* What was he supposed to do, stay behind and increase his chances of failure on the off-chance that the code is bugged? He thought he was fighting multiple time loopers, at least one who was a better mind mage than he and one who could beat him in single combat half the time. And he thought there were more than two of them. Running is completely sensible under those circumstances. In order to get better odds from staying he needs to beat down and successfully mind-wipe a whole lot of people without them committing suicide or losing even once.

Running has better odds. The fact that random chance conspired to make the 10% chance crop up instead of the 90% chance does not mean that he made the wrong choice with the information he had.

********* Maybe he thought he was stronger than Zach? If he won without Zach committing suicide then he'd know exactly how many enemies he has to face and be able to remove one of them from play (by wiping Zach's memories and thus crippling his magical ability for a long time). He could then make decisions based on knowing how many others there are and who they are.

Alternatively, if Zach was the centrepiece going around re-implanting people's memories into them every loop like what was happening with Spear of Resolve, then removing him would basically remove the other loopers as a threat.

Attacking Zach isn't a terrible move in certain world-states, though it's one hell of a risk in others.

******* That really depends on how the time-loop works. The soul-killed aranea showed us that souls are necessary for life, so everyone in the loop definitely has a soul. So, does the loop recreate the souls at the beginning of the loop and then let the souls drift into the ether afterward? Does the loop grab all the souls from the real world, use them in the loop, wiping them clean each restart so no one maintains memories/abilities?

One definite possibility is that when Red Robe left the loop, his soul left the loop. Now, whenever his body is recreated, he is just a soulless husk.

***** There's probably a way to identify him in the time loop anyway.

There was something off about the current chapter. In the real world the sovereign gate was successfully activated. In the parallel world, the researcher was saying that "I had high hopes that the upcoming planetary alignment and the resulting amplification of dimensional magic might be the key to getting it work, but no such luck."

So they think it's impossible to activate the gate, even though it happened in the real world. What changed? One possibility is that RR is missing and was the person who provided the missing pieces in the real world.

Even if it is something else, there is probably a lot of information to be gained here about the start of the time loop.

Although that would still mean that most of the people they know will die in the real world in the invasion, if Red Robes participates. Added to that is the fact that the invaders would actually be able to summon a lot of nasty creatures like they originally intended, and which is impossible for them to do during the time loop.

******* That's a terrible plan. Don't get me wrong: it's a creative solution and mechanically might be viable, but if plan A is "dimension hop through a primordial's pocket dimension into the late stages of an invasion which is supported by a time traveller" it might be time for a new plan.

The idea that the primordial could be permanently destroyed by trapping it in the Sovereign Gate's pocket dimension is interesting. That might be viable even if the primordial's dimension isn't used as the exit point. Even with both Zorian and Zach acting together it may still be difficult, perhaps verging on impossible, to prevent the primordial summoning in the real world with Red Robe acting in opposition. In that case it would be quite valuable to be able to render the primordial unable to be released even if the ritual is completed.

I wonder, too, why exactly it appears the pocket dimension resets when the primordial summoning completes. One explanation is that the Sovereign Gate's original activation was somehow tied to that event, that it was activated specifically to stop the summoning and if the summoning occurs in simulation, that loop is of no further value and is terminated. Alternatively, the primordial may trigger some sort of failsafe in the gate and it will always reset rather than allowing the primordial to enter. Such a failsafe could be due to either the primordial threatening the stability of the Gate's pocket dimension or for the risk posed to the Gate's controller by the primordial. If this is the case then such a safety mechanism would have to be disabled before your plan in any form could be implemented.

There is another factor to consider: if the gate was activated in the real world in response to the primordial summoning (perhaps by Zach), then Zach and Zorian exiting the gate through the normal mechanism would put them in a destroyed Cyoria with a primordial on the loose a mere instant after the Gate's activation relative to the real world's timestream. It may be that the primordial is no longer in its pocket dimension and can't be summoned into the Gate's dimension even if the time loop did not reset.

******** There are other explanations for why the time loop shut down when the primordial was summoned. At that time there was another point of contact between the (accelerated) pocket dimension and some outside world. Maybe this interfered with the time dilation? It's mentioned repeatedly that in order to achieve high time dilation you have to isolate a part of space from the outside world.

What if each month is allocated a slice of real time, and with this additional point of contact time accelerated to the point that the time slice ended within seconds instead of weeks?

******** I find it more likely that the Gate was activated at the beginning of the month. That way, it was a copy of the world exactly as it was upon activation. Also, Zorian talked about how this time loop is essentially an extremely accelerated pocket dimension, in which fraction of seconds will have passed in the real world while decades and centuries could have passed in the dimension. This would make no sense if the Gate was activated at the end of the month. (Although I will admit that this explanation was mostly informed speculation on Zorian's part.)

********* On the basis of observations from within the loop, such as its timing, I agree that it is most likely the Gate was activated at the time the loop begins: the Gate takes a snapshot of the material plane upon its activation and uses that as a template for each reset.

However, in this scenario the Gate was activated before the invasion was visibly underway or the imminent primordial summoning known, so it apparently merely a coincidence that the activation of the gate is timed to effectively counter theses events.

The alternative is that there is a causal link between the invasion and primordial summoning and the activation of the Gate, that the Gate was activated specifically to counter these events. This seems less plausible on the basis of most of the evidence, but the likeliness of a causal linik is evidence all of its own.

Regardless of which scenario is correct, I think Zorian's speculation that the Gate would appear to be activated only for an instant is likely correct.

********** I think you're onto something when you say that they got lucky with the Gate timing - although it wasn't coincidence, either, because the same planetary alignment powers the two phenomena.

This sheds more light on the legend about living '11 lifetimes'. Ordinarily, I think you're supposed to get more than a month in the simulation. But just like there's a failsafe to restart it if the Controller gets killed, I'd say that it auto-restarts if anything tries to connect the pocket dimension to another one. So the Primordial summoning trips the reset switch.

Maybe, if they can prevent the summoning (since Red Robe is now absent!), then they will have a much longer restart, with enough time to travel overseas and hunt down the Key?

*********** Further evidence that stopping the summoning will extend the restart:

In chapter 6, where Zorian is just becoming accustomed to the restarts, he's not making any big ripples and Zach is out of the picture (presumably unconscious), and Zorian repeatedly confirms that the restart ends at "2 past midnight" (probably 0:02am, although theoretically it could mean 2:00am). Yet in chapter 40, when Red Robe has abandoned the invaders and Zorian is helping to defend against them, it lasts until 2:39am.

So, the reset time is not a fixed point. And from chapter 52, we know that summoning the primordial triggers a reset, and that with no help from Red Robe, no demon support, plans thrown out of whack, not at the peak of the planar alignment, and the city being somewhat prepared, the invaders were still powerful enough to complete the summoning. So we can presume that, if Zach and Zorian don't interfere, then the summoning will succeed every time, which would explain why the reset is so consistent.

********** The causal link would be the planar alignment. Major acts of dimensional magic---summoning a primordial, using the Gate---are most likely to occur during this period.

The only issue with this concept is that I would expect the Gate to be activated at the end of the month rather than at the beginning because presumably, it's the end of the month when the planar alignment occurs. However, it may be that the entire period surrounding the planar alignment allows these kinds of dimensional feats, rather than only the last night of the month.

***** Keeping it locked up is still dealing with it. The original commenter was wondering if it was a red herring, but my point was that it's obviously plot relevant no matter what occurs.

My guess is that all of the mana wells hold primordials. Either the primordials generate the excess mana coming out of them, or the naturally occurring wells (from the dragon below?) are needed to power the dimensional prison containing them. As the early Sarokian Highlands ward question told us, ambient mana is needed for more extensive wards. I can only imagine what a dimensional prison costs in terms of mana--I suppose it's possible that their own mana fuels it, or the gods themselves supply it.

Either mana origin would explain why you can't just absorb ambient mana directly--it basically comes from demons either way, and will corrupt you if you don't carefully purify it first.

It's possible Zorian will prevent the primordial from being released, but with the reveal of the massive mana battery/weapon as Iasku Manor, and all the focus Zorian has been putting into dimensional magic, he might figure out a way to re-imprison it.

Five treasures, five equally important parts of the key. It is quite obvious they aren't in order-it would be unlikely if they were.

Dagger. Likely a ceremonial blade-a mage has little need for weapons. A thing of beauty. Perhaps a magical implement. Basically, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athame][Athame]]

Crown. Either a literal crown, or just something that goes on your head. Likely something delicate, with masterful craftsmanship, so it might be better to call it a Diadem.

Staff. Likely the first thing one thinks of when they hear "wizard"(that or the hat). A masterful item, crafted by the best spell formula craftsmen you can think of. A symbol of Magic.

Orb. A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_cruciger][globus-cruciger]], an item that is useless in it's own right, but serves as a symbol of royalty, an Insignia of sorts.

Ring. Too small to be of any actual value-magical powerhouse is the Staff. No, ring is not an item of magical power, it is instead a symbol of political influence, of Nobility.

  So my first thought to the problem of only one person leaving is that we might already have the answer to that- much like the Cyorian matriarch did, Zorian could bring Zach's memories with him, or at least put a packet in his head, etc.
#+end_quote

This wouldn't be a complete solution, ideally you would want the soul, not just memories to be preserved. Knowledge is power, but there's a great deal to be said for a powerful magical core as well.

This brings up an interesting point: it appears the sovereign gate not only recreates the material world from a snapshot, but souls too, with the sole exception of those with the marker. This, along with the soul trap, implies that souls aren't quite extra-dimensional, but are tied to a specific material dimension or plane. Appropriate application of soul magic could perhaps be used to manually extricate a soul from the Gate's dimension and insert it in the real world.

If the copy of Zorian's soul from the Gate dimension were either sent back to the real world through some dimensional shenanigans or carried there physically in a soul trap, I think it would be reasonable for it to try to attach to his original body and successfully merge with his original soul. As Zorian did not enter the gate through the normal means this may be the only way for him to effectively "exit" the loop.

Soul magic may be a vital component of the solution in addition to dimensionalism. Even if dimensionalism proved successful, it could potentially lead to an interesting situation with two Zorians running around in the real world. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if the younger Zorian had already died due to the invasion.

There's another solution that's pretty interesting. I looked up that one priest's discussion with Zorian about souls and found this bit from [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/51/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 51]], emphasis mine.

#+begin_quote
  *"According to some stories, [using the soul, the gods] could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."*

  "Copies of people?" Zorian frowned.

  "It is not that strange," Batak said, waving his hand dismissively. *"The simulacrum spell does something very similar.* While simulacrums are in no way f awless, they are suffi ciently real that some people have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical. They believe that every time a simulacrum disperses, a person dies."

  "Do you?" Zorian asked.

  "No," Batak shook his head. *"Naturally, I follow my Church's dogma, and it states that only things with souls are considered people. Simulacrums do not have them."*
#+end_quote

Note that nothing in the above is said about using souls to create a duplicate soul, and yet exact copies of a person can be made that are utterly identical to the original. This suggests that people's bodies don't necessarily need to /contain/ a soul. This could mean that souls could exist in the spiritual dimension like a lens. "Mana" shines through the souls, projecting a hologram/shadow onto the material realm and this is what creates consciousness.

The simulacrum spell is a secondary reproduction from the hologram, so does not appear to have a soul. The SGate, however, simply requests the hologram to shine into a looping version of the material plane, but does not feed any new data back to the souls except for souls that bear the mark.

This means souls don't need to be created or destroyed and there doesn't need to be any conundrum between original and time-loop Zorian. This solution is also more energy efficient than creating souls every loop then discarding them afterwards.

******* I read your post, and perhaps it is a misunderstanding on my part, but I do not belive you addressed the principal issue of how the marked souls are treated differently from the unmarked.

Zorian comments on this in Chapter 27:

#+begin_quote
  Zorian was quite sure that the time loop didn't pull back every soul back in time -- if that was the case, every mage would feel the difference after a dozen or so restarts as their shaping skills miraculously increased overnight. Plus, there are 'normal' necromantic killing spells that forcibly banish the soul from the body to kill people and Zorian had occasionally seen them in use during the invasion. If every person whose soul was banished from their body ended up dead at the start of the time loop, the number of inexplicable corpses showing up at the start of the time loop would have started to pile up quickly and everyone would have realized something was very wrong by the time Zorian was brought in. So all in all, *clearly the souls of regular people who were not time travelers weren't affected by anything that happened to them in previous time loops*.
#+end_quote

For any theory to be plausible it must account for this effect.

We have been given a number of pieces of information on the function of souls and simulacra, though there are still ambiguities:

*Souls cannot be destroyed* (Chapter 27):

#+begin_quote
  Killing a soul was impossible. They could not be destroyed, only modified. Everyone said so -- the teachers, all the books he had read discussing the topic, Kael the amateur necromancer... hell, even the goddamn lich had said so in one of his offhand comments back when Zorian was first brought into the time loop.
#+end_quote

*All entities with a soul possess personal mana; personal mana is used for casting magic* (Chapter 22):

#+begin_quote
  Personal mana was something that all things with a soul possessed in varying amounts, and it was attuned to the person producing it -- it bent easily to its creator's will, and was innately more malleable and controllable than anything else they might use to power their magic, since it never resisted the caster's efforts to shape it
#+end_quote

*Life force is a special type of personal mana that keeps the body living* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.
#+end_quote

*Personal mana turns into ambient mana within minutes of leaving its creator* (Chapter 39):

#+begin_quote
  "Shame it's only useful for powering items," Kael said. "Having some kind of personal mana battery would have been a nice way of side stepping your limited mana reserves. Have you looked into making such a thing? Even if it only lasted a few weeks, that should be enough to be useful in your circumstances."

  "Of course I've looked into it," Zorian scoffed. "It's impossible. Personal mana loses its affinity with its maker rapidly once expended, becoming indistinguishable from ambient mana in a matter of minutes."
#+end_quote

*Souls not only possess mana, but produce it and continue to do so even after death* (Chapter 48):

#+begin_quote
  Souls though... souls continued producing mana, even after death. It was what made them so valuable to spiritual entities like demons and was one of the reasons why undead were so much more convenient to use than golems.
#+end_quote

*Souls act a record for a living entity* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  "...souls are very mysterious things," Batak said seriously. "They have many functions, most of which we can't even understand, much less influence. But their most important function is not, as many mages believe, that they allow one to produce and shape mana. It is the fact they serve as a living, breathing records of everything a particular entity is."
#+end_quote

*Souls record the form of an entity's material body, and can be used as a template to create a new body* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  "The gods originally gave souls to living beings in order to record their thoughts and forms, so that their lives may be preserved after death and their deeds properly judged in the afterlife," Batak said. "For that reason, the gods, who had intimate knowledge of how souls worked, were capable of many miraculous things. So long as they had access to a person's soul, they could bring them back to life, even if their bodies have been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds. They could peer into their soul to examine their entire life from the moment they were born. They could restore a person's youth by regressing their forms to the state they once possessed. According to some stories, they could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."
#+end_quote

The most detailed description of a simulacrum comes from Zorian's observation of Red Robe's attack on the aranea (Chapter 26):

#+begin_quote
  But something was wrong, the sedatives didn't seem to have any effect on the robed man and many spells also failed to have any effect. Even stricken immobile, the man somehow managed to defend himself effectively, exploiting any openings to fire off strange purple beams that slew anyone they hit instantly. They were slow to cast and only targeted single opponents, so their losses were light, but it was still frustrating. Finally, one of the purple beams hit one of the human mercenaries and his companions lost their nerve, responding with a barrage of glowing lances that tore straight through the robed man's shield and impacted his chest.

  For a moment, the matriarch was afraid that they had killed the man, making all her preparations and plotting meaningless... but the reality turned out to be far worse than that. Instead of erupting into a shower of blood and gore, the robed man simply... turned into smoke.

  The opponent they had been fighting hadn't been the third time traveler in person. It had been merely an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic. A simulacrum, meant to test the waters and distract them.
#+end_quote

Note that Red Robe's simulacrum was not physically identical to a human: it was more resistant to certain types of attack and when severly damaged turned to smoke. Zorian describes it as "an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic", and seems to think this synonymous with "simulacrum". In Chapter 51 Batak specifically refers to "the simulacrum spell", strongly suggesting that "simulacrum" refers only to this specific technique, quite distinct from the gods' ability to "bring [a person] back to life, even if their bodies had been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds" (though nonetheless based on the same principle of using the soul as a recording device). Batak further describes the simulacrum spell as "sufficiently real that some have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical", which appears to imply that though a simulacrum is a mere ectoplasmic shell it forms a replica of the original's mind and is capable of acting as an independent intelligent agent.

Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul is not entirely consistent with other evidence. He says "the soul needs a body, even if it's just an ectoplasmic shell... but the body equally needs a soul", asserting that an ectoplasmic shell is an adequate substitute for a body as far as a soul is concerned yet implying that an ectoplasmic shell could not survive without life force from a soul.

That a simulacrum can perform magic strongly suggests it has access to personal mana. One possibility is that the simulacrum is temporary and has a finite reserve of personal mana that it is invested with when created. Zorian's decription of Red Robe's simulacrum as "infused with some of [RR's] skill and magic" supports this, but Zorian is not necessarily reliable and may be biased by the church's dogma. The simulacrum's store of personal mana would lose its affinity "within minutes", and that would dictate the lifetime of the simulacrum. Batak apparently expected Zorian to know of the spell and it is well known enough to be the topic of ethical discussions; if the spell had a lifetime of only a few minutes I think it would be limited to niche applications and be relatively unknown, which is apparently not the case.

If a simulacrum used ambient mana directly it could last longer but would be "harder to control" and "substantial, prolonged use [would result] in sickness and insanity". Red Robe's simulacrum posed a potent threat to the aranea and a force of battlemages; that it could have done so using ambient mana stretches the bounds of credibility.

The other possibility is that the simulacrum remains connected to its creator's soul, which provides it with a supply of personal mana for life force and casting of magic. Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul could be interpreted as a combination of a simulacrum not having its /own/ soul and religious dogma. This would also imply that a soul is not strictly restricted to a single body, but can form connections over a distance. As the simulacrum has its own mind it would not be directly controlled by its creator, but it would share the same mana pool and other characteristics determined by the soul, such as shaping ability.

The Sovereign Gate does not appear to create simulacra (in the sense of an ectoplasmic shell) in its pocket dimension, rather it creates fully realised bodies in a manner more comparable to that described as within the gods' capabilities. Every person in the pocket dimension has a soul whether marked or not, this is observable; yet the unmarked souls reset at the end of the loop. I think the Sovereign Gate either has some mechanism by which it can create copies of souls (though this poses many problems) or it can somehow reset a soul back to an earlier state, which also seems implausible.

******** Good points.

--------------

#+begin_quote

I believe Zorian discussed simulacra with Batak after his confrontation with RR. Zorian gave little weight to the ideas of the religious prior to these discussions, but who knows if that affected his description of RR's simulacrum.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul is not entirely consistent with other evidence.
#+end_quote

I find it more likely that in the history of magic, simulacra have undergone significant research, including the examination of those with soul sight, so I believe Batak when he says simulacra have no soul.

On that note, it would be interesting to learn about the difference between the undead, golems, and simulacra. Clearly magic alone is enough to sustain these constructs, although it seems the simulacrum (imperfectly) uses the caster's soul as a blueprint.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  if the spell had a lifetime of only a few minutes I think it would be limited to niche applications and be relatively unknown
#+end_quote

I disagree here. A decently powerful clone of a competent mage, even short-lived, could be quite useful. Outside of a time loop, dungeon clearing could be done without mortal risk to the mage through divination, arcane eyes, and simulacra for particularly risky fights.

Also, if the simulacrum spell is well-known, the question of whether the spell has a soul /must/ have been answered by a competent soul mage at some point in history. I imagine for the church to not object to the spell's usage, some priest with soul-sight examined a simulacrum and concluded no soul was present.

--------------

Like you, I doubt simulacra rely exclusively on ambient mana. I also agree that it's most likely that the simulacrum links to the caster's soul somehow to make use of their shaping skills and, I would guess, mana reserves.

--------------

Indeed, I don't think simulacra are precisely equivalent to how the gods or the Sovereign Gate read souls to copy an individual. Rather, I think simulacrum is an attempt to replicate that feat, but a poor attempt. I imagine the simulacrum is more like using the blueprints of a car to make a sketch, whereas what the gods and Sovereign Gate do is akin to building a duplicate car from the blueprints.

--------------

Yes, I feel copying souls poses problems, as does "resetting" several million souls every restart except for marked souls.

The solution I mention looks at souls like data on a harddrive. Reality reads data from the soul and /usually/ updates the soul by writing in new data. However, within the timeloop, new data is not rewritten to souls except for souls that have the marker.

Other ramifications of this hypothesis is a clean explanation of simulacra: The spell uses an imperfect soul-read function to create a copy of the mage. Because the read function is imperfect, the simulacrum is imperfect and weaker than the original and needs to be infused with a portion of original caster's mana to operate. Furthermore, the imperfect read function means soul mages cannot look at the simulacrum and see the soul it reads from. Also, since the spell only uses a read function, information from the simulacrum does not update the original soul. Alternatively, the simulacrum reads from the soul only briefly, then stops, and this is why soul mages cannot see the soul that produced the simulacrum. This is a like a brief look through a dirty window and drawing what you see---the image you saw was smudged out and the drawing is anyhow just a facsimile.

By contrast, the Sovereign Gate and the gods read perfectly and continuously from the soul when copies are made. This means soul mages can look at the copy and clearly see the original soul. This is more like looking through a clean window; you can see the actual object beyond the glass.

The lich phylactery is also makes sense in light of this: Unlike the simulacrum, the lich's body reads from the soul continuously. If the body is destroyed, the phylactery acts as a backup device to continue reading from the soul.

Lastly, this soul hologram hypothesis means that souls are indeed neither created nor destroyed by the Sovereign Gate, which fits with the mythos. Remember that priests are connected with spiritual beings, which used to include gods. It's not unlikely that the reason people believe souls cannot be destroyed is because divine beings simply admitted that fact to humans. It's conceivable that every divine being refused to answer such questions or lied, but I doubt divine beings as a whole would act so homogeneously.

However, the soul can be powering up anything else (i.e. a ward scheme). In terms of versatility this is the best option. However, it is unethical.

A golem is a spell-formula-powered physical construct. They can be charged with mana, can use ambient mana and can utilize crystallized mana.

A simulacrum then would be a non-physical construct. The fiery vortices from battle for Sudomir's mansion are similar. As is homing missile: once spell pattern is formed with mana, the effect can go on it's own for some time. Simulacrum, presumably just takes this to the next level. Instead of a simple homing function it has some useful AI. The mana that is pumped into the simulacrum does not dissipate because it is already contained by a spell boundary.

I would agree with this, except that for a construct to cast spells, it usually needs to be covered with complex runework, e.g., Sudomir's dragon. Casting ability is extremely narrow. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, when mana is structured ahead of time, as with spell formulae, the result is that the resulting effects are specific and constrained spellwork.

While I admit it's possible that a simulacrum is just another (likely lesser) version of that dragon construct, I think it's more likely that simulacra utilize soul magic and a tentative link to the caster's soul in the place of runework. I say this assuming that compared with the caster, the simulacrum indeed has shaping skills and similar yet paired-down casting ability.

*********** You're right, but Sudomir's dragon is quite probably an undead. Possibly automated by the original dragon soul, even. That would explain the casting ability.

In any way, the runework is just a complex pre-built spell boundary. (ch 11)

#+begin_quote
  "Tell me, what are spell formulas?" [...]

  "It's the practice of using geometric shapes and various sigils to modify spells, usually in order to strengthen wards or amplify spellcasting," said Zorian.

  "Really? How do they do that?" asked Nora in mock curiosity.

  "Err... they limit mana flow along pre-determined pathways?" tried Zorian.

  "Yes!" agreed Nora. "They limit, that's exactly what they do! I can't tell you how many mages think they're some kind of inherent amplifier or something. Drives me crazy, I tell you. Of course, most modern crafters use special materials that are inherent amplifiers, but that's something else entirely. Anyway, you know the point behind structured spellcasting, right?"

  "The narrower the effect of the spell is, the more mana efficient it becomes. Structured magic creates a spell boundary to forcibly narrow down effect space into something manageable for a human spellcaster."

  "And spell formulas are the exact same thing, only with more pronounced benefits and drawbacks," said Nora.
#+end_quote

The end goal is to make mana flow form a certain geometric shape.

You can implement the mana limiters in your construct on a physical matter and get a golem, or you can use your personal mana for the task to the same effect. Except with golems you can take your time, with simulacrum you have to cram all of it in a single invocation. The end effect will be inflexible in both cases: it won't be able to cast anything you haven't prepared it to cast in advance. It can't do unstructured magic or even supercharge a magic missile.

However, a simulacrum does not need to be infinitely flexible to be useful. After all it's a disposable body double that is meant to be used in a very dangerous situation. It is more useful than a golem in some situations because destruction of a golem is costly and it takes more time and preparation to create. OTOH you can conjure simulacrum with zero cost (other than your mana, ofc), get it killed and then create it again and again.

I'm of the opinion that he simply used the bones of a dragon to make a golem that can be controlled by Sudomir psychically. Again, it's speculation.

On that subject, how do undead work? If you start with a corpse and then reanimate, then how do you have access to the soul? Wouldn't the soul have already "left"?

  On that subject, how do undead work?
#+end_quote

Undead are golems that use souls as a substitute for an animation core. That makes them a lot cheaper and quicker/easier to make than regular golems. The soul has to be from a creature that had similar form to the body it is animating, so you can't use animal souls to animate humans. Likewise, you cannot use human souls to animate animals and other radically-different entities. Obviously, the quality of the animation is the highest if you have a soul that was originally matched to the body in question, but any human soul will do to animate most human bodies.

The soul also serves as a convenient power-source, which makes undead easier to use outside of magic-rich areas.

#+begin_quote
  If you start with a corpse and then reanimate, then how do you have access to the soul?
#+end_quote

The soul stays anchored to the body for a while after death, unless the body is totally/heavily destroyed. After a while, the soul moves on to the spiritual planes and is beyond the reach of necromancers. A necromancer needs access to the recently dead so they can capture their souls before they move on. Getting access to the dying in their last moments can be tricky, so most necromancers resort to producing their own recently deceased corpses (through killing).

#+begin_quote
  If a corpse is risen without being powered by a soul, is that just a flesh golem?

I agree, but that's so uncharacteristic of the stereotypical necromancer who raises undead from the deceased. But nothing says MoL has to be stereotypical, and I think that solution is pretty clean.

To be perfectly clear about the problems with raising corpses using their departed soul, this mechanic would imply the body anchors the soul even after death. In that case, a necromancer could access hundreds of human souls by going to their local graveyard. Necromancy shouldn't be /that/ convenient.

One solution is that undead are generally powered by animal souls, which explains why most undead are feral. On the other extreme, you have undead made with human souls---vampires, liches, etc.

In the context of this series looking back it seems soul magic can be explained in the likes of a coding language developed by this worlds gods. In this case if the creator of the Sovereign gate had accurately deciphered the language then it makes sense how they could do things seemingly impossible through the "normal" brute force attempts to manipulate the code without knowing the underlying structure.

I hope we can get a larger understanding of this underlying structure in the future it would be interesting to see if the gods of this world actually developed the world in the manner of a programmer.

I know the author Domagoj has a new (and largely unpopulated) world-building website that will eventually contain more details of the magic system and hopefully describes the nature of soul magic. I wouldn't be surprised if it works a lot like computer code, as you say. For the sanity of the gods and the creator of the Sovereign Gate, I hope the syntax of soul magic doesn't look like Assembly.

******* I'm not so sure it does. If the most important function of souls is to be a living record of who a person is, then how can you make a copy of the person, attached to the same soul, that does /not/ record changes? I think you have to copy the soul(s) if you want changes to be transient.

Moreover, Batak talks about the soul needing a body, even "just an ectoplasmic shell". That doesn't sound like shining a hologram, but rather like the body does indeed 'contain' the soul. Batak may not have specifically talked about souls being copied, but it stands to reason that the gods could do it (given sufficient power to create souls, full understanding of how they work, and access to the original).

** Wow. What an excellent way to end an arc - just like with the first one, with protagonist being completely, thoroughly outplayed. They didn't even catch a tail of Red Robe - looks like he left looong ago.

My thought is that the solution to their problem would be some kind of brute-forcing. The obvious DragonBall-ish plot of recovering every part of the Key aside - maybe it can unlock the Gate, maybe it can't - they are still in a pocket dimension. Perhaps it is possible to simply break through the anchor point. We already saw an example of breaking a pocket dimension open. With enough power, it's possible to do just about anything, possibly including escaping an extradimensional prison.

At least time to figure things out they have in spades. Or not, if the Guardian will drop another bombshell on them in the next chapter and say that they only have a few restarts till the loop cpllapses automatically (I think the first part of the next chapter will be Zorian and Zach questioning the Guardian for everything it knows).

No it wasn't. The main insight was the fact that one could "leave" the loop early without ending the loop itself. I mean before, we all believed that ending the loop for one person would end it for everyone since that's how "time loops" and not parallel dimensions apparently work. Why was there any reason to believe that one would just "exit" the loop early?

So what I'm trying to say is it wasn't very obvious at all and there's no need to beat yourself up for mistaking parallel dimensions for a time loop. And I totally agree with you about reevaluating everything. ARGH! ;)

***** True that Red Robe leaving the loop would have explained the lack of his soul marker earlier in the story, but what I'm trying to say is that it didn't make sense motive-wise then. Why would anyone leave a time loop early? From everyone's perspectives, there was no such thing as only one person leaving. It was reasonably assumed that everyone would be able to escape and in that scenario, leaving early is a *terrible* move since your enemies will jump to monstrously strong heights in a blink of an eye. Therefore it made the most sense for Red Robe to still be in the loop.

It required a shift in the understanding of the actual nature of the time loop to understand why only one person could leave, from which the deduction that Red Robe left early becomes trivial.

While people could have deducted that he left early, we pride ourselves on reading stories where characters make intelligent decisions and it would have required an amazingly mind-boggling amount of stupidity on Red Robe's part to give up such a huge advantage even with multiple time travelers around. With multiple time traveling enemies, you either end the loop for everyone or keep a very, /very/ low profile.

I figured RR was inferring the time period from the beginning of Zach's absence after Quatach-Ichl soul melded them. He didn't know exactly what happened to create Zach's disappearance, but he knew it was something major, and upon finding out about more time traveler(s), decided that their entry was the cause. At one point early on, Zorian wonders if was actually an even longer period of time for Zach's absence, that he himself wasn't even conscious/aware, which is definitely possible, since most estimates put Zach at a bit under 3 years in the loop during that confrontation with RR.

It's interesting to note that we don't know exactly what was going on with Zach during those first seven loops. Did he truly not exist in the loop, or was he unconscious the whole time and his condition was masked by either RR or his guardian with news of "his disappearance"?

That leads to another question about whether this is Zach's true soul in the loop, and whether Zorian's is just a duplicate, if Zorian's is a duplicate, and gets merged on top of real soul upon leaving the loop, that should have some interesting effects. It would probably raise Zorian's max mana reserves from 32ish to 64ish for one thing, boosting him up to 40ish immediately upon leaving the loop, probably without significantly negatively affecting his shaping skills too.

Although I'm less confident he is using the memory packet method, I'm still not sold on his having a marker. He was sighted the two loops after SoulKill, then gone. He knew during those two there were more time travellers but never did the simple ritual to find Zorian? He contended himself with attacking them both in the settlement, then Zach at home the next loop, then apparently just left?

I stand by my assertion RR is a crappy mage, only his loop override spells are any good, which points to memory packets.

That time he was forced to flee, so he ambushed Zach at the start of SK+2, forcing Zach to flee. Those were the only two times he could face Zach and be certain Zorian couldn't intervene. After that there was always the chance Zach had recruited Zorian during SK+2, so he left the loop.

** Man, what a whammer. Unlike the end of Arc 1 though, this time Zorian isn't completely cornered; there's a clear way forward in the form of the Key that the matriarch spoke of, so it definitely felt more anticipatory than despairing at the conclusion of the Arc.

About the last chapter, did anyone else notice that Zach's curb-stomping of the aranean webs were kinda foreshadowed? Novelty says it in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/23/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 23]] - that "any mage powerful enough to cast [Mind Blank] is also powerful enough to take on the entire aranean Web all on their lonesome". Which is pretty much what ended up happening.

Also...recently I started throwing in my lot with the "Red Robe is Veyers Boranova" theory. While it's true that Daimen is most likely to be Red Robe in terms of opportunity, having found /something/ in Koth that most likely relates to the Sovereign Gate - he has no motive. He's an adventuring archaeologist, what does he gain from burning Cyoria to the ground? And if he wants to improve himself and keep all that skill once the time loop is done, he doesn't need to come all the way to Cyoria to do it.

Veyers, on the other hand, I've come to realize recently fits the psychological profile of Red Robe surprisingly well. Aside from that "possible fallen noble" thing discussed on chapter 50:

- Veyers was "an asshole" and seems to have a short temper; this fits in with his rough, perhaps even reckless personality displayed (that line he shouted at Quatach-Ichl, for example - "Watch it! That could have killed him! I told you I need him alive!").
- Veyers didn't get to move on to third year of the Academy, implying he's not a very good mage; this explains not just the fact that Red Robe isn't all that competent (crude control of mind magic; relatively unimpressive showing vs Zorian, vs Zach, and vs throwaway students in chapter 26; being clearly treated as a grunt by Quatach-Ichl), but that he's desperate to use the time loops to improve himself in a way he never would ordinarily have (probably blood magic, at the very least improving his physical strength, as well as his quick exit as soon as he realized he no longer had control over the course of things).

If Veyers and Zach even failed out "together", before the time loops started, that might even explain why Zach was hanging out with "Red Robe" at first and why he was in such a good position to backstab Zach.

Though of course, there's still a few unexplained bits. Like whether Veyers actually failed the certification exam before being expelled - the story wasn't explicit on that, though that might still make him desperate to gain a future as a mage if he was barred from any other mage academies. And how he even entered the time loop to begin with, since Zorian's entry should be virtually impossible to repeat, and only now did Zorian and Zach learn about the "admin" feature of the Sovereign Gate.

*** I always thought Veyers Boranova theory was mentioned ironically, but you make a good case that it /is/ a possibility. Looking at Soulkill:

- Quatach-Ichl calls RR a whelp, so it's possible RR is young.
- As you said, RR's aegis was overpowered by several students. When Zorian was holding combat training sessions with his classmates, I don't think his aegis would have had that problem, or maybe just barely. If RR were a competent mage in his forties, I can't see that happening.
- After arguing with Quatach-Ichl, RR tries to read Zach's mind, but Zach punches him in the face. RR's response is rather infantile, slamming Zach's head repeatedly into the ground. Even QI comments on it.
- RR seems familiar enough with Zach to call him a fool for not making better use of the time loop. There might be history/a rivalry between the two.
- RR is described as way too strong for his build. This just might mean he's ridiculously strong for a person, or it might mean that RR is a smallish person---Zach and Zorian's age?

Or a competent mage who has been looping (much) longer than Zorian. Yeah, this isn't someone who has been diligently practising their magic in every restart.

Furthermore, this is someone who thinks it's worthwhile to keep optimising the invasion over and over /even though they don't have demon support and even though Zach is changing things and so the real thing will be quite different/, and also even though it's already brilliantly successful, and the primordial summoning will make other property damage irrelevant. Why would he do that, instead of focusing primarily on reconnaisance, or better yet, personal development? Perhaps because he's bitter and twisted and enjoys watching Cyoria burn as thoroughly as possible every month?

And Boranova is a Noble House. Zorian has already discovered that some (not all) Houses might be glad to see Cyoria gone, because it's such a strong supporter of the Crown.

/And/ when RR was directing the artillery spells, he targeted the /empty/ third-year academy residence building (not exactly a tactically important target) /in the first barrage/. Grudge against the academy, perhaps? "You wouldn't let me into this building, so watch what I'll do to it!"

There may be more to it than this. He didn't fail his certification; he was /expelled/, after a /disciplinary hearing/. And Zorian thought to himself things like, "it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova" and "it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner."

Therefore, Veyers Boranova did something reprehensible. And something serious, because political influence and wealth weren't enough to rescue him from expulsion. This could fit with the fact that RR practises both necromancy and mind magic.

I guess I didn't fully explain my thought on that though, since if this actually happened Zach would've needed to somehow be re-admitted to the academy before the school year starts. It'd look unusual, but probably wouldn't be hard with Zach being an archmage at this point.

Not that I know how valid the possibility might be. I just wanted to speculate a possible point of commonality that might have brought on an association between Zach and Veyers, if they didn't have any before.

** I'm going to make a prediction.

The fact that red robe is anonymous, to me, means that he very definitely is someone we have met. That, coupled with the fact that no one is "missing," indicates to me a high likelihood that the time loop has been recreated each time with an "ignorant" version of red robe (whoever he is).

As far as I can tell, there's only one person with whom Zorian has recently started interacting with in-depth. Someone powerful. Someone immune to mind magic (for no discernable plot-based reason). Someone who's expressions would indicate that he seemed to HATE Zorian in the past, but whom had recently, suddenly, and almost inexplicably become friendly. And it happened almost immediately after Red Robe disappeared.

I said it back when I first read the chapter that had Red Robe in it. I had no idea how it would be possible, but it fit the plot structure too perfectly.

"Somehow," I had said, "Red Robe is Xvim."

*** except that xvim never hated zorian. the only reason he was making him do boring shaping exercises every restart was because he couldn't remember making zorian do boring shaping exercises in previous ones. once zorian becomes more skilled at shaping, each new loop after that has xvim trying to find out how skilled zorian actually is, because remember he didn't remember it from the previous loops. Eventually, zorian's shaping skills are so good that xvim ends up thinking that zorian is an imposter, and that's the first time zorian tries to explain the time loop to him. agree that red robe is a prominent character that we already know of. it would probably have had to be someone who had the chance to steal Zach's memories of how he entered the loop and how to use it, as well as getting a soul marker of his own. I doubt it's the caretaker of the novedas, because we haven't even seen that guy yet. early in the story, each loop would start with Zach beating up his caretaker and then running away, or at least that's what i remember being said.

so what recurring character would have a reason to manipulate the ibasan invaders?

#+end_quote

quatach-ichl's spell cast early on seems to be responsible for bringing zorian into the time loop, but we don't see him cast that spell on anyone else with them. whatever happened to bring red robe into the time loop should depend on this spell. maybe red robe is a remote controlled construct of quatach-ichl himself. when he cast the spell, he clearly wasn't aware of the time loop, and probably thought Zach was a soul mage. whatever quatach-ichl did must have

1. included both him and zorian into the time loop with Zach
2. altered Zach's soul, or added something to it.
3. copied Zach's soul marker to both himself and to Zorian
4. without knowing about the time loop

This also would explain red robes connection to the ibasan invaders. he was with them all along, but when he found out the true nature of the loop, he was more concerned with escaping the loop then using it to increase his power, because zorian made him think there were many time travelers, and he had already proven that his invasion plan would work in zorian's first loop, provided that zorian and Zach can't follow him out.

Their best bet is probably to spy on Quatach-Ichl, since Red Robe is likely to approach him with invasion-related information, but that isn't easy at all. If that doesn't work, Red Robe could spend an arbitrary amount of time staying low, commiting unseen atrocities, selling classified information to Eldemar's enemies, building dead man's switches, and so on.

Given the contents of this chapter, activating the gate seems like a deliberate conscious decision. To activate the gate, presumably you have to be nearby or something. The gate takes a snapshot of reality and starts the loop.

So when every loop begins, shouldn't the original looper be standing right outside, excluding Zach as the originator?

Seems like this implies that RR is the original, and Zach accidentally got pulled in somehow. The theory that 'the marker is in his bloodline' sounds odd considering how confident everyone is that there is exactly one controller at a time.

** To be honest, I am really not happy with simulation theory. Specifically because it causes a huge cluster-fuck of clash with substance dualism MoL universe so smoothly runs on. Magically waving hand and saying 'turns out time travel is actually possible' breaks fewer things in comparison.

Oh well.

Now that we know Sovereign Gate was in Noveda's possession explains how Zach got in the loop: by virtue of his bloodline.

How does RR start looping? One hypothesis was via blood magic, when Zach got beaten by non-looping-then RR and got blood-magicked for the marker and mind-magicked for the marker operation manual and then memory-wiped. Bonus points: blood magic actually explains RR's affinity to tacky clothes. With that in mind RR could be basically anyone who was more or less capable before the time loop. That excludes both Boranova (was a silly theory to begin with) and Daimen (he simply won't be hostile to Zach if they had ever met)

Speaking of Daimen, I suspect the theme would be Zorian making peace with /all/ of his family. He started being annoyed with them, now he's changed his opinion on Kirielle, Fortov and his mother (IIRC?). I guess he'll need Daimen's help to find some of those artifacts and in the process they will become friends, ^{and} ^{^{grow}} ^{^{^{a}}} ^{^{^{^{pair}}}} ^{^{^{^{of}}}} ^{^{^{^{wings.}}}} Time travel is powered by the magic of friendship hue hue hue.

*** Now things are really complicated. The primordial may have been a red herring all along since it's the interaction of pocket dimensions that really stop the time loop from going longer. Therefore, it might be that Zach was NOT the original looper but rather got in accidentally via his bloodline interacting with the Gate.

So what if RR was the original looper who activated the Gate? He might have done so for his own purposes (Cyoria invasion).

** The security for the time magic research facility is pretty hilarious. Love to learn abit more about the purpose of the research. Somehow Zorian missed gathering information of the gate from both researcher, i mean they both studied the artifact for a long time prolly would have some knowledge on the artifact.

On the other note, i'm so looking forward to the worldbuilding post coming up. A friendly advise on how to start the ball rolling is with the class -> teachers -> curriculum -> school before expending out. This helps adding flavor to story's characters with will make the character more relatable. It would also give us a clearer view of Cyorian's formal education and how it's cirriculum was being taught.

** Couple things to contemplate: The time loop didn't shut down after the controller left. Was that because the designer didn't bother to shut it down, or that it /couldn't/ be shut down that easily?

The Soul Kill spell - there's a direct link that the creator of the time loop had considered the safety of the controller. Which means very bad things if we consider barring the gate as not something natural but rather /artificially included by the creator as a safety./

Nah, it's just programming stuff: the trigger to shut down the loop is when "there is no Conrtrollers left inside", not when "a Controller leaves". I can actually see a few reasons to make that trigger instead of the other, but in general, they are identical for intended use of the Gate, so there doesn't have to be an actual reason for the choice of a trigger. Consider our protagonists lucky)

**** It's better design because it means it shuts down gracefully if the controller manages to get themselves destroyed while looping.

***** Best guess is that the "leave loop" invokes the normal "end current loop" routine to clean up the pocket universe. That part includes a check for controllers, and sets up a new restart if the controller is still there.
