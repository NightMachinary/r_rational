Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have actual fortune telling abilities, but the universe isn't deterministic.

You can activate any crystal ball to make it show a future that is randomly chosen from all possible futures, under the following restrictions:

- You can specify an exact time for the crystal ball to show, but the time chosen must be at least 1 hour in the future.
- To activate a crystal ball, you must press one of your palms against it for 10 seconds.
- You can adjust the viewpoint of the crystal ball to any direction and anywhere within 2 meters of yourself in the future. It turns completely black if the viewpoint's distance from future you exceeds 2 meters.
- You can have the crystal ball follow someone else's future instead of yourself, by having both you and your target person place a palm against the ball for 10 seconds when activating it. Nothing happens if more than 2 people press a palm against the ball.
- If the target is dead at the future time chosen, the crystal ball turns completely black.
- A crystal ball remains active for 1 minute before returning to normal.
- Once you activate a crystal ball, you must wait 1 hour before you can activate it or any other crystal ball again.
- The visual quality of the crystal ball depends on how transparent and spherical it is. If it is perfectly spherical and transparent, the visuals will be as good as reality.

Note that the future chosen is uniformly random among all possible futures. This means you can somewhat influence it by pre-committing to certain actions. For example, if you pre-commit to cleaning your room in 1 hour, most of the possible futures 1 hour ahead will show you cleaning your room. It can never be absolutely certain however, since sheer random chance can always block you in some way.

*** TL;DR written after the rest of this: Mine your potential future timelines for knowledge from humanity's possible future technological advances by pre-committing yourself to study a technical field of choice and prepare accumulated knowledge for local broadcast at specific times. Use the knowledge gained from the crystal to advance that field and increase your own freedom to act, focusing on changing the probability distribution of the future towards stability and technological advance. Pick a new field and repeat. Continue until dead or until you win.

The distance limitation is fairly straightforward to circumvent for a lot of things. You just set up your environment beforehand so whatever you want to learn about has observable local effects. One example is looking at real-time market data on a computer. You don't need to send the crystal ball out into the world if you arrange to have the world come to you instead.

Only being able to activate it once an hour pretty severely limits how densely you can sample the future, but if needed you could set up a high-density sample of a time significantly into the future, like spending 100 activations on a specific time a week from today. That would be good for a situation where you need to more accurately assess probabilities, but I'm not sure what that would be.

You might think lotteries would be a good thing to scry, but it only works if the winning number is not chosen stochastically. That tumbling cage of ping pong balls could go a lot of ways, you'll only see one of those ways per activation, and if it's designed well a large number of scryings will just confirm that their process is very uniformly random and that all the balls come up with equal probability.

Anything relying on information not being publicly revealed before a certain time is immediately broken, since you can just scry that time for the information. Pre-commit to finding the answer and writing it on a note on the table in front of you. It'll usually work and you can easily verify when the plan failed, since the most likely failure mode is not successfully learning the information, and you can just send messages to yourself about the failure regardless.

Actually, that brings up what might be a really interesting avenue to explore further. Because the universe is not deterministic, pre-committing yourself to writing down information on a sheet of paper on the table doesn't mean you will /actually/ do everything needed to cause that to /actually/ occur. You can steal information from /potential/ timelines and use it to go to a /different/ timeline. The trick is the shift in futures - you have to pre-commit yourself in a way that means you will almost certainly complete the task, as long as you don't /already/ have the information. Then once the scrying is complete of the timeline where you don't have the information and had to go get it, you can /actually/ go into /another/ timeline where you didn't do any of that work because you already had it from the crystal.

Because there is no stated limitation on how far into the future you can look (besides lifespan), you can mine /all of your potential futures/ for information. One where you spend thirty years studying genetics and absorbing the accumulated knowledge of the field, one where you spend thirty years studying robotics, etc. These scrying attempts will generally provide good information because the possibility distribution for human society is likely to be filled with progress more than non-progress. Even if you pessimistically assume that technological civilization only currently has a 10% chance of even existing in thirty years, you can just scry ten times more to find the information from the timeline where it does.

You'll have bandwidth limits to overcome. Maybe you can arrange to have high-density information signals passed between a future computer and a current one over the visual link of the crystal? Laser pulses, etc. Then you could download huge amounts of data from each potential future.

Your effective final limitation in how much you can change the future will be how quickly you can implement the knowledge gained so as to change the range of futures being scried. Mine the future for knowledge, use it to change the future, mine the future again. All before your lifespan runs out and you can't scry into the future anymore. If you're old, recruit someone young so you can borrow their lifespan to look farther by using the crystal together.

*** The ball shows you a random future from all possible futures, eh? So if you scry a point 70 minutes into the future, and you intend to scry again in 60 minutes, you'll be choosing randomly from a squared number of futures--after all, the ball you will view in sixty minutes generates a possible future for each thing it might show you, to the extent that being shown something different affects the future.

Or does it? That's the first thing I'd test.

If so, I can use that to 'cheat'. Let's say I want to find the key to an encryption. I can use a quantum random number generator to generate a key to test. If it doesn't work, I scry ahead 70 minutes and write down the number I find I've written. If my generated number does work, I scry ahead and write down the working number regardless of what I'm shown. Then in sixty minutes, I only scry ahead (to view anything random) if the number I got from the future works. That is, if the future gave me a correct number, I make 'all possible futures' in ten minutes consist mostly of futures descended from this one. That means that in the past, I mostly received the correct number, further increasing the number of futures with the correct number since I'll be scrying a second time in each of those timelines as well. Suddenly, in the overwhelming majority of possible futures, I've got the number that works. I'm basically ratcheting up the fraction of futures in which I'm shown that number.

That makes one wonder...

... can this method generate information from nothing? What if I don't bother with the quantum number generator, instead opting to write whatever number I see I've written in the future? Imagine I don't make any decisions other than "Scry again if the number I received works"--then the ratcheting effect still occurs... even though the numbers have no source?

I suppose I'd need a protocol for 'There was no number', but if that protocol was simply not to scry again, then where would numbers come from?

The chance I break protocol and write a number I shouldn't have is probably nonzero, and of course any random number that I write won't be ratcheted up unless it's correct... or maybe there's a small chance a bystander walks into my room and writes a number on my paper for no reason, which can then be ratcheted. I guess it depends on how finely chopped the future is, but my assumption is that 'all possible futures' includes 'every person on earth experiences all possible brain states, including ones that cause them to randomly walk into rooms and write on papers they find'.

Anyway, the quantum number generator makes relying on such occurrences unnecessary.

**** I didn't understand your ratcheting idea at first, but I think I do now.

Instead of using precommitment merely to constrain the futures you scry to the ones filled with the activity you want to skip ahead of, also try to constrain those futures to ones with /additional scrying/ in them, since the look-ahead advantages will compound.

***** Yeah, it's kind of a hard thing to explain. To add to what you said, any futures that you do additional scrying in are going to be disproportionately weighted in the set of all possible futures.

Now that I think about it more... your scrying can't actually square the number of possible futures, because the number of possible futures is probably far greater than (for example) the number of configurations of the particles in your brain. I'm not sure how to account for that, but I don't think it would prevent my strategy from working. It might be a problem if the intermediate scry event had intermediate scry events of its own... my intuition is telling me something pathological might spring out of that.

This is the part I think I disagree with and I think it's why I was confused at first. As I understand it the crystal doesn't create futures, but instead randomly selects a possible future and shows it. A timeline with scrying in it isn't automatically more likely to be selected by scrying, because all possible futures are equally likely to be selected regardless of their properties. Probabilities show up as shared properties among groups of those futures. For example "what's the probability that the sun will still shine tomorrow" is equivalent to asking what fraction of all possible tomorrows have that property.

If you want to only look at futures with more scrying in them you've got to attempt to eliminate some of the non-scrying futures yourself beforehand by separate means (like precommitment of some kind), and then let the crystal select randomly from that now-more-narrow future.

Say you commit to a plan to setting aside time next week for flipping a coin once an hour for ten hours and using the crystal only if the coin comes up heads, writing down each coin flip result as you go. Then scry ahead to the completed note as many times as you like (or can fit). What distribution of results will you see?

It's my hypothesis that you'll see a binomial distribution centered on 50% heads, rather than something skewed towards heads just because those timelines had more scrying in them.

I think there might be something you had in mind that I'm still missing, but I haven't been able to figure it out.

******* Thank you for taking so much time to try to see how I see!

I'd expect you to see the distribution veering toward "Always flipped heads."

To make this more intuitive, imagine that when you scry after a coin flip, you scry to a point in time where you are rolling a six sided dice (instead of a random future). To simplify, we'll say that there are only six possible futures for that scry--one for each result of the die. Further, you are writing the result of that roll down on your record of whether heads or tails came up. So you'll get a list of results of heads or tails, and if you got heads you'll also write what number you saw when you scryed.

If every possible future is represented, at the end you are looking at a distribution where, at every coin flip, there are six times as many heads results as tails results, because every combination of heads and a number is among possible futures. If you rolled tails and didn't scry, only one future appears. If you rolled heads, six futures appear--one for every result.

But what if you don't write the number down?

It doesn't matter, because just the act of seeing the future affects the state of your brain. Even if two possible futures are indistinguishable from your scrying point of view, if your brain state is different, they are different. That's why I think universes with scrying in them are going to be over-represented. What you saw while scrying affects the future of that world.

I hope this clarifies. Now I wonder if I missed something you were saying, hahah.

I disagree with how you've handled the counting of possible futures.

This universe is probabilistic at a fundamental level, and all possible futures are equally likely to be scried. Rolling a die does not create more futures than not rolling it, it just leads you to think about those futures more separately. The approach I'm using to think of this is the way that statistical thermodynamics produces macrostate probabilities by counting the microstates that constitute them. A gas in a box is unlikely to spontaneously experience large pressure or density fluctuations (like all of the gas atoms briefly being located solely within the left half of the box) not because there's anything physically preventing it, but because the number of microstates belonging to those macrostates are much fewer than those producing equilibrium (equal density and pressure throughout the box). The most likely outcome/macrostate is the one covering the most microstates, each of which is equally likely to occur a priori.

Note that there is no apparent connection between scrying and your reasoning about possibilities, so I think we can drop the crystal entirely, as in this specific case it was only a mechanism for sampling futures. We can /already/ sample futures by running repeated trials of the same experiment.

You're setting up a system where flipping heads will cause a dice roll, and flipping tails will not. The question is what's the probability of flipping heads. You counted all the head + die results (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6) and the tails result (T) as all having /equal/ probability, but that's not right. Those aren't microstates. They're macrostates. The possible futures are not characterized /just/ by these properties, and rolling a die did not increase the entropy (the number of microstates) of the universe either.

If this isn't convincing by itself, you can try flipping coins and rolling dice yourself and recording the results. But when it's phrased /that/ way, I think you already know what the results will be. How would adding the crystal or the supposition that the universe is probabilistic change that?

Scrying on the crystal changes how you behave (in other words your brain state), so it changes the future.

The dice indeed represent macro states. It was just for explaining, but it's clear you've got the gist of what I'm saying.

It seems necessary for the power to have any effect at all. If you can change the distribution by responding to what you see while scrying, then what you see while scrying has implications for the future.

Yes, by eliminating some possible futures. Namely, the ones where you saw anything else in the crystal or didn't use it at all. In that way it's identical to any other action or event. The futures where something else occurred instead are eliminated. I don't view any possibilities as being "created" here. We're traveling down a tree of potential future timelines and the subtree descending from the present is only decreasing in size as we travel down one branch and eliminate all others. All the variations of scrying or not scrying are just some of those branches.

I don't see how this follows. This seems identical to saying "you are very likely to scry in the future" but I can't see the basis for it.

Going back to the coin flipping, planning to scry each time you get heads does /not/ increase the fraction of the future branches that have the property "you got heads on the flip". How could it? Making this plan does not selectively eliminate futures where you get tails.

In that case, if you look forward past a scry, you'll still see all the possible futures that the scry would eliminate--it hasn't eliminated any yet, as of the current scry. And my technique for ratcheting won't work.

If that's how it works, I'd want to find that out as soon as possible. That's the first thing I'd want to test.

I think you could only see things that are still a potential future from your present. I think you're right to focus on the scrying itself - can you see futures where you never used the crystal at all?

My take is "no". Only things that are consistent with your immediate present and past can be potential futures. So if you're currently scrying, you will only see futures that are "downstream" of the scrying you have already done so far. If the scrying you've already done is inconsistent with that possible future, that's the same as saying it /isn't/ a possible future. It's not a possible future result from the starting point of your immediate present.

If the crystal ever showed you anything that /cannot/ happen in /your/ future then it would seem to have violated its own rules. It can show you possible futures where you ate some fish. But it can't show you one where you are and always have been a fish-person, or one where you never used the crystal ball at all. Those aren't possible. What does "possible" mean here if not "part of the set of consequences that can follow from the current state by following the probabilistic rules of the universe?"

So you can't scry things that are inconsistent with scrying them. I think?

*** What did the version of myself that I'm viewing see in the crystal ball? The same thing I'm seeing, or a randomly selected future? I'm assuming the second because otherwise there could be paradoxes.

Don't immediately look into the far future, or I just give whatever AGI wins a way to the present.

I could look one hour ahead and write down what I see for 61 minutes, including the writing I saw in the ball. That way, I could aggregate information from many timelines.

Take care to include an abort chance that is much greater than the chance of coming across information that would maliciously convince me to propagate it.

Include a computer in the loop to acquire amounts of compute exponential in my security. This can be converted into bitcoins at the cost of attention. Looking at day-trading data lets me multiply my money but gets me even more attention.

Precommit to a tiny chance of doing a moderately dangerous experiment to spread that information to many timelines. (If the experiment risks me getting forced to look into the far future, that is beyond moderate.)

*** It does seem pretty trivial to use this to become the richest person alive and then use your wealth to implement tech and discoveries by precommitment to having really important papers on particular topics around you at certain times.

Given the advantages of both your market foresight and prior tech knowledge it seems likely that you can get enough money to build an artificial island and basically form a micronation with the power/resources of a full sized nation.\\
Then once you've done that you can deliberately keep certain tech secret and well contained, letting the researchers working for you have the ability to work on AGI and AI safety without real time constraints (though their future work would be brought back to the past so they'd advance extremely quickly) or competition. So pretty plausibly with this power you can ensure that if there's any chance of FAI you can develop it within at most decades (after all in terms of raw processing power we should already be able to run an efficient AGI) and give it your utility function in particular.

**** I'm not convinced on the processing power and timeline you're suggesting here for an artificial island research station. An adult human brain has about 22 billion neurons and about 220 million synapses, with an estimated 3.88Ã—10^{16} operations per second needed to simulate one in real-time. It's true that supercomputers have been made which are capable of doing that, like the 2016 Sunway TaihuLight at a cost of $273 million, which can perform 9.3Ã—10^{16} operations per second, though it uses 15 MW of power. Using that as a baseline, we'd expect that each simulated brain worth of neurons and synapses would cost about $166 million and require about 9 MW of power.

Presumably, you would want your AI development process to work with brains that are far faster than that. Just considering it takes a human about 25 years (9,125 days) to mature and finish schooling and job training, you'd probably want to be running at about 10,000 times the speed of a human brain. This way, you can try out new methods each day to see if you can get the neural network to match or exceed the functions and performance of a human brain. And, of course, once you can get it learning and functioning independently, but processing 10,000 times faster than a human, you can use it to improve itself and achieve runaway AI development. However, this would cost $1.6 trillion, and you'd need to factor in the cost of building and operating a 90 GW power plant.

For reference, the largest power plant in the United States is the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which has a maximum capacity of about 4 GW. You'll need about 23 of those, and each would cost about $11.3 billion in 2016 dollars, so about $260 billion added to the cost of the supercomputer.

Then, of course, you need to factor in all of the personnel and logistics to run all of this. Palo Verde employs about 2,000 full-time employees, so you'll probably need about 46,000 employees to run your power plant. Most likely, this means you'll need to construct housing for 46,000 families, and then roads and infrastructure to support a likely population of around 138,000 people. Of course, now we need to factor in the costs and building time for power plant for them, as well as your desalination plant, water treatment plant (or dump raw sewage into the surrounding ocean?), shipping container port, airport (seems hard to persuade people to live there without one), grocery stores, restaurants, banks, recycling center (or just dump unprocessed garbage into the ocean?), and supermarkets. You'll then need to work out how much more housing and infrastructure you need for all of the employees for all of those parts of the island.

Just factoring in the construction time alone, Palo Verde took 10 years to build. Chubu Centrair International Airport (an artificial island/airport) took 5 years to build (and $7.3 billion). You need to build the island where you'll put everything, then build the shipping container port, then build your 23 Palo Verdes and all of the other structures. Most likely, you're looking at a minimum of 15-20 years before you can start proper AGI development. You would probably also need a budget of around $5-10 trillion dollars. For reference, Bill Gates has a net worth of about $95 billion. So, you would need to work out how long it would take you achieve about 20 to 100 times as much money. This is quickly sounding like the time needed to get the money, build the island, and work out how to make a functioning AGI may take more than one lifespan.

However, this would cost $1.6 trillion, and you'd need to factor in the cost of building and operating a 90 GW power plant.
#+end_quote

This scenario presumes not only no improvements to computing hardware, but also implicitly assumed that the AGI is developed from an emulated human mind because actual AI would have /many/ advantages that mean it does not need to spend subjective decades to accumulate expertise. Also worth noting with the sort of insane economic domination my divination can afford me (did you notice how I'm literally going to found a city state with massive economic power?) even the cost that you present is totally feasible for me.

#+begin_quote
  Just factoring in the construction time alone, Palo Verde took 10 years to build. Chubu Centrair International Airport (an artificial island/airport) took 5 years to build (and $7.3 billion). You need to build the island where you'll put everything, then build the shipping container port, then build your 23 Palo Verdes and all of the other structures. Most likely, you're looking at a minimum of 15-20 years before you can start proper AGI development. You would probably also need a budget of around $5-10 trillion dollars. For reference, Bill Gates has a net worth of about $95 billion. So, you would need to work out how long it would take you achieve about 20 to 100 times as much money. This is quickly sounding like the time needed to get the money, build the island, and work out how to make a functioning AGI may take more than one lifespan.
#+end_quote

See you're really understating the sort of completely economic dominance this power could afford me. Really the main limitation is how much money and power I can accrue without worrying too much about state intervention. Not only can I consistently outcompete the market to a frankly insane degree, but I'll be pumping out an enormous number of extraordinarily valuable innovations nearly constantly. I effectively expect that a substantial portion of all the largest companies in the world are going to be controlled by me.\\
So I can absolutely afford to spend tens of trillions of dollars here to get this built in a decade (I can also roll out whatever techs I want to just make everything involved orders of magnitude cheaper). Though given construction times I'd be funding R&D for long before that, with this being staggeringly effective since I can just feed my researchers and engineers back the innovations that they would have made decades from now.

Honestly you just really don't seem to be considering the insane scope of this kind of divination abilities utility and power. It basically means that anything which could have a technological solution prior to superintelligent AI I can start using as quickly as I can implement it. Similarly the degree of planning ability and resulting economic control this gives me is staggering and as another commenter pointed out this power can also be used as a probability pump.

*** Hmmm... anything that will be within two metres of me in a possible future. An interesting limit.

So, if I wander past a room, perhaps lean on the wall, at a specific time, then a week before that time I can see what's beyond that wall. That gives me the equivalent of short-range X-ray vision with a time shift.

And then, having seen that information, /I do not need to walk along that corridor/. (Of course, if seeing the information prevents me from walking along that corridor, then there's a chance that I see something entirely different - whatever's two metres from me in the other timeline).

--------------

Using this to make money on the stock market is straightforward. I simply need to sample stock prices a few weeks in advance over several futures, and pick the ones that go up in all or most futures. With a camera and a spreadsheet, this should be possible.

On top of this, the universe may not be deterministic but some things are. I can certainly win scratchcard lotteries with my crystal ball (or at least refrain from losing at them). And then there's the matter of horse-racing - I can observe the results of a horse-racing meeting a month in advance (it's easy enough to print that out after the race and keep the paper in a pretermined place at a predetermined time), several times, and thus get a good estimate of the /real/ odds of certain horses winning or losing. I can compare these odds to the odds offered for betting and with some statistics, make a reasonably consistent profit. (A race that turns up the same way in every possible future has probably been fixed in some way - it's probably a good idea to alert someone official anonymously, in advance, including a prediction of the fixed results - though not saying how I know or giving any means to get back in contact with me. When my prediction turns out to be true, an honest official would probably start a very quick investigation into the race). The same goes for betting on other sporting events.

** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 3: Tin*

Ok then, week three of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For part one and a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][here]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

Up this week is tin. As always I'm interested in what a tin twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic tin enhances your senses. A soon as you start burning tin your eyesight, hearing and sense of smell, taste and touch all improve dramatically. How much those senses improve depends on the allomancer, but at the (very) high end this allows you to do things like see through the tiny gaps in the fabric of a blindfold or feel the grain of the wooden chair you sit on through your pants.

It's worth noting that while your ability to process all this new information does increase, it does not increase proportionally to the amount of extra information coming in and it's very easy for an allomancer to get overwhelmed. You cannot choose which senses to enhance (it's all or nothing), so an allomancer burning tin to keep an eye out for distant enemies can easily get distracted by some footsteps two floors down or the scent of a cooking stove three buildings over. Somewhat ironically, this means people that make good tin allomancers are the kind of people capable of blocking out the world around them and focus intently on one thing.

Another risk with tin allomancy is that you become hypersensitive to stong stimuli, so burning a lot of tin in bright sunlight might blind the allomancer and loud sounds can daze them. On the other hand, this effect can also be used to clear your head from pain or exhaustion by briefly burning a large amount of tin.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic tin also centers around enhanced senses, but unlike allomancers, feruchemists store each individual sense they posses separately. This means, for instance, storing eyesight and hearing at the same time requires two separate metalminds (jargon note: a metalmind is another word for a feruchemically charged piece of metal).

While storing it, that particular sense is numbed; storing eyesight makes your vision go blurry, hearing makes sounds become faded and muffled, taste makes all foods become bland and so on. When tapping a tin metalmind the sense stored in that metalmind becomes vastly more acute.

Another area in which feruchemic tin differs from allomantic tin is in how it enhances your senses. Where allomancy just greatly enhances the amount of raw data coming in, feruchemy makes you more capable of discerning tiny differences in input. This manifests slightly differently for each sense:

For sight, it means the feruchemist is able to 'zoom in' on distant things. This works similarly to binoculars or telescopes in that you sacrifice field of view for a greater ability to discern details on distant objects.

Tapping hearing makes a feruchemist able to pick out individual components of the sounds they are hearing, allowing them to, for instance, follow a conversation taking place on the other side of a busy room or picking out the one badly tuned instrument in an orchestra.

Similarly, tapping taste or smell allows a feruchemist to discern specific tastes or scents even when they are covered up by many others, they do not become more able to pick up faint scents/tastes, that's allomantic tin's thing, so in practice this is of limited use (though keep in mind that we /are/ twinborn in this particular scenario).

Touch works somewhat differently. As far as this magic system is concerned, touch is actually three separate senses that each have to be stored in separate metalminds: somatosensation (pressure), nociception (pain) and thermoception (temperature). For each of these, feruchemy allow you to very precisely locate where each sensation is coming from. For instance, a tin feruchemist tapping somatosensation can place a finger on a coin and, without looking at it, describe the relief stamped into its surface, a feruchemist tapping nociception is able to specifically diagnose which of their bones are broken after a fight and a feruchemist tapping thermoception could find nearby sources of heat by tracking which parts of their body are warmer than the others.

Of course, humans have much more than five senses and a feruchemist is able to store each of them. How useful this is might be questionable, but if you can find a path to godhood that involves knowing very precisely how full your bladder is, then by all means let us know about it.

*** So are tin feruchemists effectively immune to pain as long as they have tin they can store their sense of pain in? That's useful as a cheap kind of anesthetic for medical surgeries, though not so good for dealing with torture since any torturer would just remove your tin before commencing.

What other senses are there?

- Can you turn off your sense of hunger and thus make going on diets easy?
- Can you turn off your sense of fatigue and thus physically push yourself beyond your limits?
- Can you turn off your sense of danger and thus commit acts of heroic bravery?
- Can you turn off your sense of guilt and thus commit unspeakable horrors (when necessary)?
- Can you turn off your sense of disgust/revulsion and thus wade through filth and gore if needed?
- Can you store your artistic senses for a long period and then unleash them to be a super art critic?
- Can you store senses on the level of proteins and enzymes? For example, could you make your brain extra sensitive to dopamine to make yourself happier? Can you make your white blood cells extra sensitive to bacteria, or make them less sensitive to alleviate autoimmune diseases?

*** And that is the third edition in this miniseries. I must confess I've always been especially fond of allomantic/feruchemic tin, it's just such an incredibly varied powerset and it really speaks to the imagination without being over the top powerful.

For this entry, I have take significant liberties expanding on what we've seen in the books in order to make it concrete enough to do some actual munchkinry on it. I do not believe anything I've said directly contradicts canon, but I am speculating a lot on how each sense works when enhanced with feruchemy.

My current plan is to do this for future entries as well, especially once we get to the more esoteric metals, but I'd like to hear what you all think of that. Do you prefer I stick to what we know is the case in canon and accept that some metals just aren't going to be very munchkinable or is it better to extrapolate (read: wildly speculate) on canon in order to get a more concretely defined powerset?

*** Hrm. If allomantic tin can increases the amount of info coming in, and feruchemy lets you better focus on the info you're getting (and so mitigate the danger of flaring tin in a bright or noisy environment). Combining the two should let you some pretty crazy things.

- Sit in a crowd, and track a specific individual's movement via hearing. Or similarly track people through walls.
- Full echolocation might be possible, with allomancy letting you hear faint echoes, and feruchemy letting you focus on and interpret the echoes.
- Do that 'listening to someone's heartbeat to tell if they are nervous' thing that Daredevil likes so much.
- Track down people like a bloodhound.
- If tin allomancy lets you see things that aren't actual quite visible, I wonder if you smell things that can't actually quite be smelled. Like odourless gasses.
- Possibly look at the stars during daytime. Allomancy lets you see through the fog of the atmosphere. Feruchemy lets you not get blinded?

--------------

The other interesting potential source of munchkinry I see is with expanding your sensorium.

I recall that Sanderson confirmed that a hypothetical platypus feruchemist could store electroreception in tin. If we rule out stealing that sense with hemalurgy (because stapling a platypus soul to your own is probs not healthy), it might be possible to hack your way into the sense using body modification.

Some people [[https://www.medicalbag.com/body-modification/magnet-implants/article/472457/][implant]] small neodymium magnets into their fingertip so that they can sense magnetic fields. If you do this and play around with the implant long enough for your brain to adapt, then it might become a part of your spiritweb. (We know that the in the Cosmere, your soul's residual image can change over time, so that magical healing won't remove scars or other injuries which are part of your self-conception.)

Then once your brain is adapted to interpreting this very weak new sense, it might be possible to compound it up to the point of usefulness.

On a physical level, the magnet is absolutely just stimulating touch receptors. But some of the people with the implant report learning to intuitively interpret the sensation as feeling em fields. I would guess that it's similar to the mental phenomenon that occurs when an adult receives a cochlear implant.

The question here is whether that self-conception of the sensation is enough to alter the spiritweb.

For feruchemy, I guess it doesn't really matter whether you sense the fields via your touch-tinmind or via a separate electroreception-tinmind. But for allomancy, which magically provides extra info, it might matter. If it enhances the implant-sense by amplifying the feeling of vibrating metal, then boosting the sense might just make your finger feel shaky. Whereas if it interfaces with your intuitive interpretation of em field strength, then the magic might actually give a more detailed map of the local fields.

This potentially breaks physics. Electromagnetic radiation has a property called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue][conservation of Ã©tendue]], which is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Lenses, and the path photons take through space, have to be time reversible - this is why you can't [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/][set a fire from moonlight]]. If your eye is able to pull out more information from a source despite your cornea having the same refractive index, then you have free energy due to more photons hitting your optic nerve than have left the object via black body radiation. With massively invasive eye surgery, give someone massive "eyes" which are actually just lenses pointed at a solar panel, and then have them constantly use tin. Free power.

Not entirely sure all the consequences of photons no longer being time invariant, but I think it'd be pretty bad. I saw some thought experiment for using vampires being unable to be viewed in mirrors to do time travel, but not sure if that's applicable - it was something like due to photon time symmetry you can detect if a photon will be emitted and hit a vampire off a mirror in the future, even if the vampire is outside your light cone, but if you're already breaking photon time symmetry that probably doesn't hold. There's also something in there about U(1) gauge symmetry.

(If tin only increases your /sensitivity/ then there's a hard limit on how far you can see, since your optic nerve being able to identify single photons doesn't help if you don't have enough rods and cones in the first place, and you'd start running into problems with light inference if it fixed that too.)

Seeing through the threads in a blindfold should also be impossible: You can't see through a blindfold because light is being reflected by the fabric, and light has to be able to /hit/ your eye for you to be able to see. I'm not sure why anyone in-universe wouldn't just use thicker bandages if they know x% of the population is able to see through them. [[https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/s0257-8972(01][This]]01055-6) says that the average distance between cotton threads in a light woven pattern is 100 microns - which is half the average wavelength of visible light - and that's not including the other layer of threads interlacing with it. I'm not sure /any/ rational school of magic would let you see a full picture through that sort of mesh without breaking physics.

#+begin_quote
  Tapping hearing makes a feruchemist able to pick out individual components of the sounds they are hearing
#+end_quote

Hearing anything is based off a Fourier transformation, which is done via tiny hairs in the ear that activate based off different resonant frequencies of sound. For magic to be able to give you a higher range of frequencies, it'd have to stimulate your cochlear nerve directly, since you don't have a physical means of picking up only those new frequencies. Hearing lose in the elderly or by going to too many rock concerts is mediated by damage to those hairs, so using tin should give you your entire hearing range back - even if you're deaf, in fact, since it's the same mechanism Cochlear implants use (direct nerve stimulation).

"Follow a conversation taking place on the other side of a busy room" is a bit weird, since in most cases that's physically impossible - the sound layers up with constructive and destructive interference, so by the time the sound reaches your ears there's no method of recovery no matter how precise your ears are. Depending on how tin magic does this, it might be breaking information theory entropy bounds: Fast Fourier transform is O(n log n) time, which has been the bane of a few "infinite compression breakthroughs" or solving NP problems. If magic is able to give you the FFT of a signal in O(1) time with infinite precision, then you could factor RSA public keys since the main speedup in Shor's algorithm is due to the quantum Fourier transformation of time O(log log n). (I think not really, because you can't physically represent an RSA public key within the universe and would still need O(n log n) inverse Fourier transform to sample from the nerve signals, but it's the thought that counts).

** One day you're eating a hamburger, and it's not very good. You remember a hamburger you had during your 10th birthday party, and fondly recall it being delicious. You say out loud "I wish I could eat that burger again". Unbeknownst to you, you'd rubbed against a magic lamp the night before and a jinn had been listening to you and waiting for you to say the magic words. /poof/ Suddenly you find yourself transported back in time, and find yourself holding the mouth-watering hamburger from your memory in your hands. What do you do?

To clarify how it works a bit more:

You get no other wishes. The jinn wasn't one of the 'three piece' ones like in the movies.

You can stay in the past only as long as the hamburger remains edible in normal hamburger fashion. That means if it goes rotten, you go to the future. If you finish it except for crumbs, you go back to the future. If you /freeze/ the hamburger - the moment the burger ceases being 'edible in the normal hamburger fashion' you go back to the future.

You retain all your knowledge and intelligence, but your body is 10-year-old-you's body.

The Jinn is friendly but not infinitely patient. He'll tolerate a little rules lawyering about the wish, but his beneficence is not infinite so beware.

The next problem is that if you change the past, what happens to present you? The 10 year old you is still a kid and very susceptible to changes in his environment. If you do anything major like tell your parents ways to get filthy rich, that could have significant effects on your upbringing, which butterfly to the future where your entire personality and lifestyle may be reshaped arbitrarily. You could go from the current rational you to a rich spoiled brat who thinks people only exist to serve him. So unless you are willing to risk killing own your personality, you should make changes secretly.

*** I assume this lets you change the past, but only about 2 weeks of it before your refeigerated hamburger becomes unsafe to eat. There are better ways you could preserve it, like putting it in a jar, bombarding both it and the jar with gamma rays, and then remotely sealing the jar before putting it into a refrigerator kept at just above freezing, but a 10yo couldn't get access to that equipment unless their parents worked in a lab. Some kind of UV sterilization might help, but that won't protect it from anything inside the bun. I'm assuming there's lettuce and tomato on the hamburger, so flash-heating it might damage the integrity of the burger too much. Better safe than sorry, and again, you can't access this stuff as a 10yo.

Let's assume you can preserve the burger for 3 weeks with the stuff you have on-hand. What can a 10yo do to improve the lot of humanity? If you've memorized loads of sports stats for some reason, you might be able to convince your parents to make a small bet on long odds, which would provide them with more freedom and hopefully improve your future situation somewhat. This would also get your parents to trust you on more problematic future information. Preventing 9/11 is likely impossible because it would be really hard to get the relevant authorities to trust you in 3 weeks, and I'm unconvinced that is the best use of your time. Having your parents take you to a major pharmaceutical company and tell their researchers about modern advancements might help, especially if you can provide them with answers to easy-to-test, difficult-to-guess questions which have been solved in the present day.

The reason I'm not saying "invest in Google lul" is because only some 10yos will have existed at exactly the right time to convince their parents to do so. I'm young enough that I might be able to get my parents interested in Apple stock at the right time, but I'm still a few years early to do it perfectly. There might not be too many butterflies to change their success, but I couldn't guarantee it.

Unfortunately, a huge amount of your success on this issue is going to be tied to how much your parents trust you, and how large the leaps they will take on their child's advice. Having only 3 weeks is pretty brutal.

*** Put a Patreon link on your blog(s) and make a modest amount of money.

Your fake identities have to have lives outside of the Internet. Details about those lives are convincing to people, including people who live similar lives (same jobs, same hometown, etc.). Depending on how much you post, this may be a way to access information you wouldn't otherwise have about places, job fields, people, and so on.

Is it possible to make people think you know them IRL? Obviously this wouldn't be a good idea, as they might become suspicious as to why you never come to meetups.

*** Given this needs to work for /any/ fake identity and you are able to rapidly accrue respect within those communities (which is only going to be possible if there's not a substantial inferential distance between you and the median member of the community), it seem like this power can also be exploited to grant you expertise on any topic for which a niche online community of experts exists.

So doing this you should be able to become a polymath with minimal effort.

Plus even beyond actual objective knowledge, the inferential distance thing should mean that you're also granted detailed knowledge of what the median participant believes and how they think so that you'll be able to fit in. This latter thing is less obviously useful, but you could use it (along with the newfound rhetorical and writing skills you now have) to shift the overton windows of groups far more effectively than I think you were imagining.

Overall I suspect the best use of this ability is going to be using all the knowledge this power gives you to eventually become multiple highly influential online writers, making yourself a decent living along the way.

*** I might not have any ability to supernaturally manipulate others, but I probably can nudge people who were previously fairly undecided one way or another. Infiltrating plenty of communities with political bias and suggesting that they either make sure to vote or don't bother to vote because what difference does one vote make may be enough to change the outcomes of otherwise close elections.

Of course, that only counts as doing good if I actually know who best to vote for.

** Your super power is you are the agent in a physics problem.

If the situation calls for it you're a perfect spheroid, or perfectly elastic, or frictionless etc. What are some neat tricks you can pull off?
