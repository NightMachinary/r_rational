** The first several thousand words of this is all worldbuilding in report style -- "resources became available", "new volunteers were sent". Does it ever include any dialogue, characters, or plot? If I'm going to read a story where the Nazis are the heroes, I would like there to be an actual story instead of just someone's worldbuilding notes.

**** It can be. Much. As an example, the entire April 1932 section boils down to "the Nazis got the Gate and the DHD." Everything else is wasted words that contribute nothing to plots or characterization. I would suggest cutting that entire section and combining it elsewhere.

** I remember this! I started making an interactive timeline and then abandoned it. A very good story.

** I read a lot of this but ended up skipping large parts of it.

It needs.to be about 10% as long
