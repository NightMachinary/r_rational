The "hardness" of recommendations has sometimes been less than excellent, but there are still plenty of works which sort of fit the intentions behind the rational fic creedo, or just happen to cover subjects which rationalist geeks would enjoy.

I'd like to suggest this place as where to offer up any discovery which fellow readers really enjoyed, even if it would fit better into a traditional genre.

No restrictions, so if you really want to rave about your newfound love for Wildbow, Jim Butcher, or Patrick Rothfuss, I won't stop you, but honestly, most of the avid readers here already know about most of the big names. Plug the small guys who aren't already at the top of the lists, rather than the ones who already have an overflowing readership.

Also, it can be a webcomic, comic book, cartoon, or any other media around, no need to limit there.


** The Magicians by Lev Grossman is the best possible demonstration of some LessWrong posts about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/]['if you demand magic, magic won't help']] and the like. It's got a lot of awfully well written segments to it as well. The protagonist is not ... a good or nice person at many times ... which may dismay some readers, but considering this crowd enjoys e.g. Worm this is likely not to be a dealbreaker. There's a lot of good writing and interesting ideas, but there's also a lot of nihilism.

It's got a good deconstruction of several genres and tropes that might be of interest, especially the Harry Potter Magical School thing, and another that would be spoiling the novel to discuss. A lot of good stuff overall, though. Not really much rationality, but a fair bit of deconstruction and twisting various tropes

--------------

In other works, I've been rereading the Hyperion/Endymion books by Dan Simmons (partway into Endymion now). There's little rationality and logic and all that stuff in these, and the portrayal of AI is severely problematic in many respects but Simmons' use of language and cool ideas/concepts more than make up for this. The best book is still Hyperion, but Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion are still pretty good on their own terms. A word of warning - if you try this series and don't really enjoy Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion a lot, you might want to avoid Endymion/Rise of Endymion - there's several plot twists and revelations that are not very well liked by a lot of the fan base. Overall, I recommend the whole thing almost entirely on the basis of the writing quality, which is astoundingly good.

--------------

Finally, I've been following [[http://markreads.net/reviews/][Mark Reads the Discworld]] recently. This is a community centered around first-time experiencing old series of books and TV shows, with a major emphasis on spoilers. They are just starting Discworld with The Colour of Magic and plan to progress through the entire thing in publication order, at a rate of 20-30 pages per two workweek days (expected finish - about six years away). If you want to discuss stuff on their threads, remember to ROT-13 cipher any spoilers of stuff they haven't got to yet, and also remember that the community over there has an extremely social-justice-warrior slant. If you're looking to get into the Discworld there's worse ways than accompanying a bunch of other newbies who you can discuss plot twists and speculation without getting spoiled. I myself enjoy seeing newcomers reaction to Pratchett's writing - it brings back a lot of the magic I felt when I first read his stuff.

/All/ fictional portrayals of AI are severely problematic. This is one of those things we should probably just forgive for the sake of our suspension of disbelief.

**** But some of the portrayals are less problematic than others. I'd imagine that if you're very vague, you could portray AI somewhat realistically (in this case I take AI to mean a more powerful optimizations process than present AIs).

Personally, I would just take it to be a more /general/ optimization process than present-day decision-making software.

** I'd like to recommend the entire oeuvre of Neil Stephenson. (I'll probably create a separate thread for Anathem.)

The novels tend to feature smart, competent protagonists who have to overcome complex new problems.

Apart from that, each novel teaches you something new. Snow Crash teaches you about Sumerian society and linguistics, Quicksilver teaches you about the dawn of science and how money became a thing, Anathem teaches you about philosophy of science and the Many World Interpretation.

*** Oh, and /The Diamond Age/ teaches you about strategy, politics, a bit of computability theory, nanotechnology, and shitty theories of mind.

** And just two hours later, I got a nice surprise in a new update of [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga Of Soul]]. It's a short one, but a promising sign after a relatively long hiatus.

I discovered it when EY plugged it a while back, but it's still up there in the quality of Science meeting magic. I really like how there's a lot of discussion about how the Crazypowerful magic system (Matter generation of both complex and simple structures, portals, and flight, all at the speed of thought) can disrupt a culture's scientific advancement, and also how said scientific knowledge is often the only real edge against similarly equipped enemies.

** I picked Matter by Iain M Banks back up, probably better known as part of the Culture series, and definitely seems like something this subreddit would enjoy.

The AI are pretty amazing as well. Their names make up part of one of my favorite naming schemes ever.

** I read Diaspora by Greg Egan for the first time recently. It's awesome and fun, not sure how rational it is but I think it'd be liked by other readers here.
