Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** let's break game rules again.

Omniscience.

You will gain ' omniscience ', defined as ability to answer any possible question (but you still retain your language, your thinking speed, and you will be only able to phrase the answers in language you know), but.... you will die in next 3 minutes.

So basically, you have 3 minutes to gain as much answers you want (by asking yourself questions in your toughts) and write answers out somehow.

What do you do? Are you getting answers to ensure your family well being? Are you getting answers for humanity? What kind of questions you ask? Do you care at all, assuming that you have 3 minutse of live left? How do you store out the answers? Writing? Drawing?

PS: also consider that the remaining people might won't trust what you write, so maybe you should focus on smaller questions that are more easily verifiable

*** First ask if there is any feasible way at all to extend the 3 minutes, whether its lifespan prolonging medicine or time dilation or cryogenics or mind uploading or even time leaping. If this succeeds, you are done.

Otherwise, ask what actions you can take within the remaining time to cause butterfly effects that ensure the survival, freedom, and moral goodness of humanity for as long as possible. Omniscience should perfectly predict the vastly different results of every possible action you could take in those 3 minutes. So the amount of 'success' that you can give via butterfly effects should far far far exceed any type or amount of info you leave behind via other methods.

In that case, let's go with the next obvious trick, basically "what is the best answer": "what action or sequence of actions can I take before my death that will maximally increase the sum utility of all moral agents[^1] according to my coherent extrapolated volition?"

It may be debatable whether "you will be only able to phrase the answers in a language you know" precludes being able to phrase the answers nonverbally (i.e. by actually executing an action, if it is not a solely verbal action), but from context it sounds more like "you aren't granted knowledge of all languages in the bargain", not "you are arbitrarily restricted to your own spoken language". But if you can "phrase" the answers by doing them, then whether the correct answer involves the transmission of knowledge or not, you can just do whatever is necessary. And by phrasing it as "before my death", if it is possible to save yourself, it is very likely you will do so (you will unless doing so somehow turns out worse for the world).

On the minus side, depending on how the gift works and whether or not it's possible to save yourself, you may be flooded with the knowledge of an unbounded personal future and the certainty that deviating from it is the wrong thing to do, binding your free will for as long as you can remain moral. (Although maybe the answer will be something like "follow The Plan for 10^100 years, and then erase your knowledge of the specifics of this answer, because then it and you will be the last remnants of suboptimal utility to be optimized".)

[^1]: Replace with something other than total utilitarianism, if you wish.

By that, do you mean that all recursive questions and meta questions will fail? Meta-questions and questions that utilize recursion are your best bet for packing in as much information as possible and getting useful bits of information.

Baring those sorts of questions. I think my next best bet is to ask for AI-related algorithms and example code. A few core algorithms should be the sort of thing you can write out in 3 minutes. I am not sure if any useful example code could be written in 3 minutes. So for best algorithms to ask for (because by your meta restriction I can't just ask for best algorithm I can write in under 3 minutes)... off the top of my head... maybe a modification to reinforcement learning that allows it to generalize over multiple scales? (Reenforcement learning has a scale imposed by how you define states for instance the next move on a game board and is thus limited (requiring either looking an excessive number of states ahead or truncating how many states ahead you look) in the real world where you don't have access to a true and accurate model with which to compare to and you have multiple scales you need to consider simultaneously: for instance your actions in the next second simultaneously with your actions over the next minute/hour/day.)

*** What can I do to minimize subjectively negative experiences?

This question is implying several things by not having bounds. It should encompass all sentient life and all of time and space, and doesn't give my any information that I'm unable to utilize. If there's a way past the 3 minutes, the answer will encompass that.

It's possible that this will prioritize non-human life, but there are workarounds for that, if I feel that it's necessary.

** Wow! You can now create arbitrary material objects!

To do so, you must provide a certain level of specificity. Don't worry, you don't need to know where every atom goes, but the power borrows your intelligence, so that degree is "could you construct this yourself with a box of unlimited resources?"

To put it another way, the power can't generate any sourceless knowledge, it just extrapolates the way you would build something and then skips to the part where it's done.

The whole of your creations must be within 100 meters of your person, take one second to appear, and will only displace air or water of sufficient purity when appearing.

You have a daily mass limit of 100kg, objects coming out partially complete if their creation would exceed the limit. Matter that does not exist in your universe (for the whole of the second it takes to create) comes up empty.

No other limitations. No other supernatural powers exist, and you win the simulation when a minimum of five billion humans vote for you in an election for Supreme Dictator of Earth.

If so, the simplest method might be to construct a doomsday device with a dead man switch and threaten to trigger it if you aren't elected supreme dictator of earth.

Said doomsday device could be a big lump of antimatter, electromagnetically separated from normal matter so it doesn't explode until you turn off the current. It would also be fairly simple to set up the circuit so your death shuts it off.

Your rule will not be safe, as your doomsday device is most likely unstable and will soon explode. But hey, all you wanted was to win the election, not govern afterwards!

**** For the box: counterfactual you can pull cubes of atomic elements from it of any desired size and density. They start with their hands, but can make tools, use those to make better tools, and so on. They don't get bored and don't come up with original ideas, no matters how long it takes. Their utility function is "create any specified object to the best of your ability, then mark it as done." If they don't know how to proceed, you'll receive the incomplete product.

The things you make appear without unusual momentum, if that's what you're asking. That is, you can make a block of steel in midair which will then fall normally, but not a block of steel flying into orbit at immense velocity.

The voting is judged by an outside impartial layman tracking informed consent (they have to have an idea of who you are and that they're voting for you when they do.) You can work under a pseudonym, it can be a figurehead position, for AV only first choices are hits. Other humans are unlikely to be so kind as to host the election for you, so you'll have to do it yourself.

You can't prohibit anyone over ten from running against you, all votes have to be registered within a one year period, and five billion have to press a button on their phones (or mail-in, in-person, etc.) saying they accept you as dictator and consent to your rule.

** With vigorous, forceful, precisely controlled breathing, breath "energy", also called chi/ki, can be generated. This can be used for a variety of effects. (This is basically Ripple from JoJo's bizarre adventure.) Learning time varies, some people have a natural aptitude (generally correlated with good physical condition/aptitude, good lung capacity, and various biometeric ratios). Having someone that has completely mastered breath energy guide your training can speed it up by a factor of close to two with continuous mentoring. Alternatively, less skilled mentors or only occasional guidance from a master might speed up learning by around a factor of only 1.5. A breathing apparatus designed to force your breathing and other helpful equipment might also speed your learning by a factor of 1.5.

At base level of practice (around 1 year with preexisting martial arts training or high aptitude, or 2 years otherwise) * minor physical enhancement, mostly in conjunction with precise martial arts moves and techniques * minor self healing * very limited manipulation of material under favorable conditions (organic material, wet material, with extended direct contact) * Minor improvement of natural healing in others

At mid level (4-6 years with moderate aptitude and continous training, 1-2 years with extreme aptitude and/or esoteric training) * Healing of others via laying on of hands (primarily just regeneration of tissue) * Major self healing * Manipulation of natural elements in direct contact with your body * Heating/retaining heat in cold environments * Sensing breath usage in other at short range (within arms length)

At high level (1-3 decades of training, it varies heavily with aptitude, although individual advanced techniques can be learned faster) * Precise manipulation of water, wood, other natural elements * Fire breath (uses the bodies heat and calories in a way that can be dangerous/exhausting) * Cooling off in hot environments * Temporary immunity to fire * Temporary increase in durability (up to small arms fire) * Extremely brief invulnerability * Sensing breath use in other from long range (tens of meters) * Healing of more complex conditions than just regeneration of tissue (i.e. some types of cancer, bacterial infections, congenital conditions) * Rapid self regeneration * Complete restoration of lost limbs * Life extension (to around a few centuries at maximum)

So munchkin ideas?

- What sort of usage in the modern world might this ability have? Usage in pre-industrial times?

- Most valuable high level technique?

- Any valuable applications besides just fighting/healing?

- Best way of economically exploiting healing/fighting abilities?

- What sort of institution would best support learning these abilities? (A program to search for kids with the aptitude? Sponsorship from a rich hospital? Military grants?)

*** First of all, I'm assuming that the precise breath control needed was only learned recently in evolutionary timescales, so there's no animals that use this.

In a preindustrial setting this would lend itself to a low-power xianxia structure: between the healing and longevity, each master would likely acquire wealth and a network of influence along with apprentices vying for training.

They might form isolated sects, and the effects of high altitude on lung capacity would be a great original explanation for the mountaintop monastery trope, especially in conjunction with the resistance to cold. They could equally slot into existing political structures.

One important cultural effect is that reaching the mastery stage and attaining the lifespan extension is a significant investment of time. This would select for masters who are highly motivated and good at long-term thinking and planning. Because their powers would also help them find themselves in positions of power, one scenario could be a world where most nations are ruled by masters, who have long time horizons and so avoid conquest in favour of long-term growth. This could mean an industrial revolution spreads quickly as they all seize on its potential, or alternatively a master tries to keep it under wraps and contained to their own territory until they have a strong enough advantage.

I don't really know enough to comment on the utility of individual abilities, and their economic applications would have a lot of dependencies. To give just one example, in a world where primary education includes a couple of years' worth of training, the minor healing would be effectively worthless, qualifying you for the equivalent of a barista job healing fatigue from officeworkers. In a society of mostly subsistence farmers, where very few can manage the investment, even that small level of ability could be very valuable, for example helping people work more efficiently at harvest time by recovering from fatigue faster.

If the healing can be adapted into more general biology control, that would be significant. Otherwise the main unexpected use I can think of would be to improve returns on strength training by healing the muscles.

In terms of supporting institutions, I think aptitude would take second place to mindset: living for centuries means the masters will be detached from broader society, and so they would likely prefer apprentices who are receptive to their norms. In such a case, a couple more decades to indoctrinate them might be preferable to a prodigy who could become independent much faster.

Lastly, inevitably someone will leak a full set of manuals which allow anyone to train themselves up to mastery. I think this could be a good opportunity for a story about time horizons and how they're affected by socioeconomic pressures - the rich can afford to add breath training to their routine, and so live longer, while the poor are stuck with baseline lifespans because their 9-5 gives no time for it and the scarcity they're accustomed to detracts from making long-term investments.

I didn't even think about animals evolving the ability, although it is pretty obvious once you point it out. If I was world building from scratch, I would say that the mindfulness and willpower required to actively control it is rare in animals. So maybe a few smarter species might have a few limited tricks using breath? Maybe a few species of dragons with breath explaining their esoteric abilities.

I didn't think of that, you are right, the minor healing would not be economically valuable if everyone learned it. But it would be a boost to the health for everyone that learned it, so any modern industrialized country that puts int the effort for public education and healthcare would also try to develop a system for teaching minor breath ability during primary education.

Well that's dark. I guess economics and class structure can make anything depressing. The extent to which aptitude matters might disrupt this slightly, with poor people born with high-aptitude managing to jump ahead in life, but this just means someone would try developing a eugenics program to breed aptitude, which is even more depressing.

***** The best way to avoid the depressing outcomes, I think, would be for the mid-tier manipulation of natural elements to be sufficiently versatile and valuable to guarantee employment, even if everyone else has it too, because of the diversity of possible skills it unlocks.

Here's a potential route for a more equal society:

- Subsistence farmers everywhere

- Each village ends up with someone trained to low-mid level, because everyone sees the benefit of paying in for someone who can heal their farm accidents

- This reduces child mortality, gradually lowering family sizes

- A mid-tier practitioner works out how to use the natural manipulation to restore the fertility of soil by shuffling the nutrients around, which boosts yields significantly

- Suddenly everyone wants their village practitioners to have this skill, and so the technique spreads quickly

- The bump in productivity happens too fast for the population to catch up and reduce things down to subsistence level. Instead, the villagers have spare time they don't need to spend working the fields to grow enough to survive, and they've all just seen how valuable practitioner training can be, so large numbers start learning from their village practitioner up to the middle level.

- Because the supply of people with mid-level skills has jumped dramatically and exceeds the demand for field fertilisation, they start to experiment with their new abilities, discovering other profitable applications in streamlining existing jobs like carpentry or leatherworking, and opening up new possibilities which were not possible without the natural manipulation

- The surplus of mid-level practitioners flock to the market towns to ply their trade, quickly becoming a middle class in economic terms

- The boom in healthcare means the economic boom isn't accompanied by one in population, maybe mid-tier training can also be used for contraception too?

- Now people everywhere have seen the benefits of this and can justify supporting a child or grandparent through the training, while those at the mid level start wondering what kinds of possibilities the highest level opens up

- The established elders are surprised by how quickly the world has transformed and they've found themselves outnumbered by new amateur high-tiers who've trained themselves up outside their existing power structures

*** Pre modern:

The masters play themselves up as gods or demigods of old, and look down on the untrained. The secrets of breath would be closely guarded to prevent anyone else from gaining an edge on them and in some cases new or exotic ways of utilizing breath might die with the creator.

Masters would wage war against each other and eventually only the most cunningly brutal or brutally cunning would be left to rule. Making petty wars like Naruto ninja.

Modern:

If the ability to utilize breath suddenly appeared in modern times I could see the first manuals popping up on the internet. And videos on YouTube showing that the manuals do indeed work. Militaries starting a new race of breath supremacy. Though that brings up the question of what happens when vets come out of the military. People who may or may not have problems and enhanced human capabilities mingling with a civilian population.

• I think the most valuable high level technique would be life extension. Sure it looks like it's a passive to having trained for decades but I could see it being enhanced with a technique that's made to increase life. Like some form of biofeedback that fixes damaged DNA.

• Useful things might include weather manipulation if enough masters work in concert, growing crops, building infrastructure, perhaps FTL travel if natural elements includes space-time.

• Orphanages, no parents, some show up in the system real young, and a few might not have lots of prospects in life (I have no idea what orphanages are like in real life, forgive me). I see it basically as the Jedi from Star Wars. Funding could come from alumni doing public works, or government contracts to lend out some members. Idk. Maybe what amounts to ninja states in Naruto but with breath users.

*** I think a society would move toward mastery being standard as from how it's described even at the slower side of average the amount of time and resources invested in mastery is less relative to the gains than low level training, I assume there would come a point of diminishing returns eventually though. I imagine a society of elf like peoples with fourty years or so of preparatory "childhood"(I'd hope they don't develop the sort of culture that we have around childhood) education with an expected lifespan of a couple centuries beyond that, it seems like you've implied there'd be some intellectual growth as well which would have it's own implications. You mentioned that it could be divided by 2 with masters teaching and a further 1.5 with good equipment for just 10 years to mastery for even the untalented but I expect it'd still inflate to fourty years or so because the more time one has the more time can be best spent increasing what one can get out of the rest. With generational turnover slower the civilization would move more slowly and methodically. Technology would mostly focus on chi constructs before physical objects, the fact that most "tools" would be mostly non transferable might have interesting social implications. There'd be far more time for leisure and since everyone effectively is heavy landscaping equipment what an individual can get done if they set their mind to it would be immense, regular people IRL have done things like cut through mountains, build castles and carve huge statues given a lifetime and dedication and dedication would be a trait highly encouraged by such a culture. Decadance could be a problem but I doubt it since a great deal of persistence would be needed just to be an average citizen. I expect most of what work there would be would be working to fix the doings of idle hands. Yes I think civilization in such a world would end up incredibly similar to our general idea of elves.

** I watched The Old Guard on Netflix last week. Pretty good movie, Charlize Theron is a total badass and the action sequences weren't as monotonous as I find most to be.

For those who don't know, the movie is about a group of four immortals who for some reason have decided that their best method of helping humanity is by engaging in violent conflict rather than, say, building up enormous fortunes or bodies of scientific knowledge. OK, fair enough, they do all seem to have been soldiers to begin with so maybe that's why they were given their powers in the first place. The movie explores some of the psychological aspects of eternal youth, but didn't really dig into its potential like I know this sub can. Some of the stuff below is not addressed at all in the movie; I made it up based on what feels right.

Spoilers ahead.

You are an *Old Guard*.

- You do not age, and your body maintains the physical condition it was in immediately before your first death.

- You have a rapid healing factor, able to regenerate from a gunshot in a matter of seconds, a shattered limb in a few minutes, and more serious injuries such as bisection or full-body pulverization in a few hours. Any injuries you sustained before dying for the first time would have healed at the normal rate, but upon dying your body is healed up to perfect condition. This also functions as infinite endurance, since your body will constantly heal damage to your joints/muscles etc.

- Your durability and pain tolerance are unenhanced, but as you age and accumulate experience you are able to push yourself farther and deal with higher degrees of pain.

- While separated from any other Old Guards, you have dreams showing flashes of their location and surroundings.

So--assuming you don't take the same path as the folks in the movie & hire yourself out for bloody warfare to whoever you think has the most just cause, what do you do? Priority one is going to be escaping detection & capture, as you have no enhanced ability to escape and eternal imprisonment is a very real threat. How do you make sure that won't happen to you, and what do you do once you're safe?
