After a long time appreciating work associated with this community ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction][“Instruments of Destruction”]] is a favorite), I'm serializing an epic fantasy web novel called [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost][/Dynasty's Ghost/]] that I think the sub might like.

The story grew from the following idea: What if a (difficult) goal of the main characters is to stay out of the politics of the Climactic Battle Between Armies ™ as much as possible?

Stage right is Mai, a princess whose entire world took a plunge with her father out the window, who is now a liability for the factions battling over the carcass of her father's empire.

Stage left is Broken, an arrogant swordsman who becomes Mai's self-appointed bodyguard because he seemingly has nowhere else to be. And he's skilled enough that he /should/ have somewhere else to be, which means he might be on the run for entirely separate reasons.

You can take a look at [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost][/Dynasty's Ghost/]] by clicking on the title, or the following URL. New chapters every Tuesday and Thursday, queued far in advance. Thanks for checking it out!

*** To add to the other comment: it's basically a parody, lamenting the project management failings of the second Death Star, with particular focus on the unrealistic expectations coming from above.

*** "Instruments of Destruction" is /Return of the Jedi/ as reimagined from the perspective of the project manager on Death Star II. It's a relatively short piece from [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s Alexander Wales.

Thanks for taking a look at /Dynasty's Ghost/!

*** I wish you weren't right about that... Climactic is such an ugly word.

*** Typo is changed.

Alternatively, 'climatic' has a secondary definition that is similar to 'pervasive,' so I suppose I could have meant what I wrote.
