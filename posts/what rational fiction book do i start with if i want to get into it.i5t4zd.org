** I would start with the stories in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] is a decent, relatively short one. And by short I mean normal book length rather than epic 10 volume series length like some of the stories on here. It's about treating superman like a villain.

But I don't know if it's a good idea to pick up a hobby just to get someone to notice you. You're better off talking to him and asking him what he would recommend, then going off and reading it so you can discuss it with him.

** Looking over the wiki or [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tvtropes]] page will give you a good idea of what it is, and list a bunch of examples so you can see what strikes your interest, particularly if there are any fandoms that you like that there's rational fanfiction of (Harry Potter, Pokemon, Twilight, Naruto, Animorphs, Superman, Terminator, etc).

Also you should know that the community is small enough that, if your crush likes rational fiction and reads it often, they probably frequent this subreddit and will see this post :P

**** I'd also add that if you're close enough to this person that you get to hear them speak passionately about their love of rationalist fiction you're probably in a good place for pursuing something. So good luck lmao

** If that is your motivation I will reiterate what other's have said: Ask him what he would recommend reading and likes, that way you can discuss stuff in common.

The next answer is that there is a lot of fan-fiction based rationality writing. Go to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][wiki]] or [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tvtropes]] (scroll down to examples and pick fan fiction) and find one from a universe you like. [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Hpmor]] is considered an important work, and is a good choice if you like Harry Potter.

The final answer is my personal favorite: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle][Worth the Candle]] (you can read the first 14 chapters, book 1, and see what you think).

** [[http://hpmor.com][HPMOR]] is the quintessential rationalist work. I read it because someone attempted to /criticize/ it by calling it Harry Potter with the plot of Ender's Game, which obviously meant I was required to read it immediately.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is the genre breaker of superhero fiction. If you've always been bothered by superhero worldbuilding that just doesn't make sense, this one is for you.

[[http://unsongbook.com][UNSONG]] is Bible fanfiction which takes a look at what the world would look like if every single thing in the Bible were true, including and especially the contradictory bits. It manages to be hilarious to both me, an antitheist, and my father, a theologian.

**** Kinda all the same ones, honestly. We have very different worldviews, but he gave me my sense of humor, so we both found the kabbalistic rap battles and insane troll logic pun associations hilarious.

I think it helps that he grew up in a predominately Jewish neighborhood, so he gets all the Hebrew jokes.

Also I think we're both a little spectrum-y, so we appreciated Uriel as a character.

***** Did he have any opinion or insight on the book's solution to the problem of evil and/or Lot? My whole extended family doesn't really do religion, so there's a distinct lack of intelligent theologians in my offline life.

****** It's the only satisfying solution to the Problem of Evil I've ever encountered which allows both evil and an omnibenevolent deity to exist simultaneously. Of course, we have no reason to think it applies to our world. In the UNSONGverse, the dead were /merely/ being tortured horrifically for a time which wound up being finite. In our world, however, we have no reason to think the dead even exist anymore, so they can never have justice.

My father is a tricky situation. Given that he's a theologian, he doesn't see the problem with the Problem of Evil, I don't think. Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever asked him which apologetic he finds satisfying there. My mother (an Episcopal priest, if you'll believe it) is a universalist, and so from her perspective it isn't an issue because everyone is getting saved anyway, much like in UNSONG. But dad is...not quite an annihilationist, given that he doesn't believe in souls, but definitely thinks the unsaved just aren't coming back. I've tried to explain to him how this makes God the most horrific mass murderer imaginable, but arguing with religious people like that doesn't generally accomplish anything.

His job is literally convincing himself and others that his reading of some old books is the right one. It doesn't help that he can actually read the original old books, as he's fluent in Hebrew, Ancient (but not modern) Greek, German, and Latin. He's probably right on what the words mean and just wrong to /trust/ them the way he does.

*** These are all definitely great examples of the rational genre, but aren't super suitable for someone just looking at getting a taste of it, due to the sheer length of these things. They're more what I'd recommend if someone said "So, I tried rational fiction and loved it, what are some stories I can sink my teeth into?"

** I'd echo the suggestion below that "Metropolitan Man" is a good entry point, just to even see if you like this stuff. It has the benefit that you'll probably already be at least a bit familiar with the cast of characters involved, and not being of epic length,

If you are into horror and just want to watch anime, "Promised Neverland" hits the rational vibe. Smart kids, orphanage, horror.

"Mother of Learning" dips into other tropes that seem popular in these circles, (time loops, and complicated magic systems) but it's a rather large commitment.
