** An interesting thought experiment.

I'm surprised that (beyond the "nonconsensual sex" discussion, and the fate of most of humanity in the Normal Ending), that more time wasn't given to the subject of choice.

That's what I found truly horrific about the baby-eaters: not that they ate their young, but that the young were old enough to comprehend that, and to choose not to die. Compare, say, the waiter from /The Restaurant at the End of the Universe/, which is a sentient being who /chooses/ to be eaten. Or any non-fictional animal raised to be part of the human diet, which can't really comprehend how and why its life is scheduled to end.

Had the offer to humanity been subject to individual choice, if people could have chosen to join with the Super-happies, rather than having been forced into it willy-nilly, the Normal Ending wouldn't have been nearly so bad.

Maybe that's why the rape conversation is in there? Deliberately, as an indication that humanity doesn't value an individual's choice so much any more? If that's the case, I see why humanity wouldn't present it as a counteroffer, but not why it's not a more common topic in the comments.

** Wait - isn't this the great story that (halfway through) decided to destroy any ability for me to recommend it to friends by having an ill-advised reference to the legality of rape?

"What? I can't believe there was ever a world where rape was illegal."

And yeah, I get that it has a thematic purpose - and you can construct a hypothetical chain of reasoning that makes it a rational idea assuming the right technological environment. But it was so entirely out of place that it ruined the story for me. And more importantly, the concept's inclusion made the story impossible to recommend.

  So the question is “what was the story purpose and/or creative history behind the legalization and apparent general acceptance of non-consensual sex in human society from Three Worlds Collide”, where Three Worlds Collide is a story that I wrote.

  So, the notion that non-consensual sex is not illegal and appears to be socially accepted might seem a bit out of place in the story, as if it had been grafted on. This is correct. It was grafted on from a different story in which, for example, theft is not so much legal---because they don't have what you call a strong centralized government---but rather, say, theft is in general something that you'd pull off by being clever, rather than a horrible crime, but of course you would never steal a book.

  And in this society everything---you know, I have yet to publish a really good story set in this world; they all seemed, most of them I haven't finished, the one that I have finished I think still has other story problems---but if you were to see the story set in this world, you would see that it develops out of a much more organic thing in which, say, dueling, theft, non-consensual sex, all of these things are governed by tradition rather by than by law and they certainly aren't prohibited outright.

  So why did I pick up that one aspect from that story and put it into Three Worlds Collide? Well, partially it was because I wanted at that point to introduce a culture clash between their future and our past, and that's what came to mind, more or less. It was both of something to test out to see what sort of reaction it got, to see if I could get away with putting it into this other story, and because it's a sort of exemplar. When one can't use theft, their society, the Three Worlds Collide society, actually does run on private property; when can't use dueling, their medical technology isn't advanced enough to make that trivial; *but you can use non-consensual sex and try to explain sort of what happens in a society where people are less afraid and not afraid of the same things. They're stronger than we are, in some senses, they don't need as much protection, the consequences are not the same consequences that we know, and the people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things.*

  That's what made that sort of particular culture clash feature a convenient thing to pick up from once story and graft on to the other, but ultimately it was a graft, and any feelings of ‘why is that there?' that you have might make a bit more sense if you saw the other story, if I can ever repair the flaws in it or managed to successfully set and complete and publish a story set in that world that actually puts the world on display.

What the fuck. I had always assumed the whole point of the decision was to show the future society was equally alien to us, three alien worlds colliding instead of our world and two others (after writing this I realize other people have already said the same better).

Is EY actually saying rape being equivalent to other types of mild violence is "more ethical", or am I really misinterpreting this?

****** You're reading it differently to me. The claim “people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things” implies to me that the society doesn't generally have an issue with sexual assault. That is, when the population is near-universally trustworthy (‘have a higher grade of ethics'), and the consequences of getting things wrong are minor, the protocols for opting in to sex might change with it.

An extreme example might be hugs; it is still not OK to hug someone if they say no, and the law will still protect you if this is violated, but there is no law specifically against nonconsentual hugging, no rule that makes it explicitly opt in in the way we rightly think we need sexual activities to be today. A sufficiently advanced (and alien) society could, with both unusual levels of trust and unusual levels of mental security, in theory, reduce the worries of society about sex in a similar way. It would not be that they consider it right or reasonable to force someone else to engage in sex, but that the topic becomes sufficiently low risk that our social and legal protocols seem unnecessary and inhibiting in the same way a nonconsensual hug law might seem to us.

That's my reading, anyway.

(FWIW my mind is pinging déjà vu on the hug analogy, so I might have stolen it.)

****** the implication I think is that it's not illegal, but people *wouldn't do awful things* just because it's legal, they have higher moral standards *culturally*.

So imagine a society where consent is understood really well by everyone, and no one would intentionally harm other people.

In such a society, you could have temporary suspensions of self-sovereignty, much like in the BDSM community today.

That is, to people who understand power dynamics and consent really well, you can play at the boundaries of consent/control more readily, in ways some people find attractive.

When the character in the story talks about it, he references flirting with and leading on a woman, knowing that there is a risk she could bid for your sexual consent on a market and then force herself on you. This is a very nuanced scenario that implies a lot of things that are different in their society, it's not just "rape is legal."

****** Imagine that assault, battery and threatening someone's life are all still highly illegal. Imagine on top of that that there is no special social taboo of any form attached to sex. Imagine that unwanted children and STDs aren't a thing. Imagine that psychology and psychiatry are highly advanced to the point where practitioners actually know exactly what they are doing and how to cure something without trial and error. Imagine that education is highly advanced as well, uses aforementioned advancements in psychology, and creates graduates that aren't only actually prepared for the adult job market and economy, but also for all the other perils that adult life in that age routinely throws at them.

Given all that I can imagine a world where consent is less important. And given a society that is both much more ethical (as in people actually follow and trust the local moral code), but also much more sheltered (in the story it seems that most characters never even saw accurate video depictions of the horrors of previous ages) I can imagine that the generation of that age equates the word "rape" with sex that lacks consent, devoid of all the horrific mental images that you or I would connect to it.

Of course I never was raped, never had a real life conversation about rape with someone who lived through it and don't even have people in my circle of friends and family of which I know that they were raped. So maybe I am wrong.

I /will/ say that it makes sense thematically from a story perspective. The entire story is about dealing with comically different cultures. It makes sense to have a note that encourages the reader to turn their perspective inward. But still - blegh.

I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then -- flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, /knowing/ the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she /couldn't/ take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far -''

  ''You need a history refresher, my Lord Administrator. At some suitably abstract level. What I'm trying to tell you -- and this is /not/ public knowledge -- is that we nearly tried to overthrow your government.''

  /''What?''/ said Akon. ''The /Confessors?/''

  ''No, /us./ The ones who remembered the ancient world. Back then we still had our hands on a large share of the capital and tremendous influence in the grant committees. When our children legalized rape, we thought that the Future had gone wrong.''

I hold the author accountable for his use of a term that, while it is certainly possible to construct a world that might have a legal framework condoning it, nevertheless creates a visceral impression in most readers that alienates his intended audience.

The author chose to take a weird stand for the sake of making a point that could have been conveyed in dozens of other ways. I thought the story, as a whole, was fine. It pretty much just took the themes from Speaker for the Dead and presented a new take on them (more ham-handed, but that's to be expected from short stories). But the story wont ever get widespread appeal due to a single foolish mistake by the author.

*** @AHaskins, yeah it's that story. Frankly I think EY would have been more advised to extrapolate from moral values that human beings have currently to predict where they might lead, rather than just going for the shock value of RAPE. He is a smart and creative guy, he could have picked consensual incest or something. But I suspect he ended up going the route he did because he was only trying to appeal to a narrow range of readers who would already be likely to agree with him on such a thing, and it was THEM he was trying to shock, not a broader and less ethically wise audience. And I also suspect that things like this are what contributes a lot to why rationalists aren't as well respected as they could be and why there are so few rationalists. Besides TWC, the main alternative route for getting someone interested in rationality is HPMOR, which is freaking long and not at all friendly to non-technical audiences. In other words, HPMOR is written as if it assumes that its audience already has some measure of rationality skills from the moment they start reading it--the very same sort of skills that it is meant to help teach!

And don't get me started on rationalists' deep-seated irrational fear of being seen as cultish if they try to effectively teach their REAL, GENUINELY USEFUL SKILLS to the larger public. You know what makes people look cultish? Isolating themselves from the rest of society in a community of hermit gurus. The fact that in this case the gurus' wisdom is actually CORRECT doesn't matter because they're hoarding their wisdom to themselves, hiding it behind mountains of opaque, jargon-filled text where no outsider will be able to reach it and understand it. And if outsiders do not know what one's wisdom entails, then it could be harmful gibberish for all they know. How are they to know, when the one is hiding their wisdom?

And even if I say this, I doubt most rationalists will actually listen to me and understand. If I say "Presentation is important dammit! How other human beings perceive you matters dammit!" they will likely hear "we should focus on improving our self image at the expense of perfect blunt honesty and accuracy of what we say." NO. NO NO NO. That is not what I'm saying. But unfortunately, inferential distances don't just apply to mere epistemology but to skills in general, and there is a big inferential distance to cross to get rationalists to not only communicate effectively with outsiders, but to actually know why it is important to do so and to care about how outsiders think and feel about them and their work.

It's infuriatingly frustrating as all hell, and the legalization of rape thing in TWC is just a symptom of this whole mess.

I think the cultish feeling is more insidious than you think. It comes in part from the thought that somehow the great harry-potter-fanfic-writer is giving deep knowledge. I don't get it. It a poorly written fanfic that displays a surface-level understanding of cognitive biases and heuristics. I'm perhaps biased (I work in psychological research), but I didn't think there was much that really seemed all too novel other than the combination of the concepts with a fictional world.

I can't help but feel that if my mentality were more common, then this community wouldn't feel so cultish. "Writing utilitarian characters with a modern understanding of cognitive function is a nifty trend, and I'm happy to read those stories.

As for the novel things it does, it has intelligent characters that genuinely think and act in intelligent ways instead of being the standard idiot spock nerd who tries to be cold and unemotional, makes wildly uncalibrated predictions with way too many significant digits, always knows exactly what the plot requires him to know and can spout technobabble that doesnt make any sense. The standard idiot spock nerd is the archetype of intelligence in almost all fiction, and he isnt at all relatable to real life nerdy intellectuals. But in HPMOR, a genuinely intelligent intellectual character is the hero of the story, where in conventional tales the closest analogue of him would almost always be the sidekick or the villain, and those sidekicks or villains generally do not pass the ideological turning test.

That is a large part of what was so novel about HPMOR.

The earliest I can think of from my own experience is Jalil from Everworld (the second series by the woman who wrote animorphs). But characters like that show up frequently in sci-fi and fantasy - you don't have to try to break the world to be an intelligent character. Raistlin, Ian Cormac, and pretty much anyone from Brandon Sanderson easily qualify.

Writing intelligent characters isn't novel. What made that book novel was the writing of a character with a working understanding of cognitive biases. It was interesting and I welcome more of it, but that's all I can really say.

I guess, given how common Harry Potter fanfics are, it makes sense for a person who wrote one of the better ones to get an internet fiefdom? But that doesn't make it any less silly.

*********** And unlucky... Did she walk into a random door and end up there, or was she guided there by her interactions with these three overlapping communities, and subjected to abuse and driven to suicide as a result of seeking out rationalist discourse?

I think it was number two, and luck wasn't part of the equation.

If the rationalist community bills itself as promoting rationalist discourse, but funnels seekers into groups where rationalist discourse is seconded to or married to sexual play, that is a problem.

Everything I've read with this conversation as a jumping point has consistently portrayed the bay area rationalist scene as toxic and unpleasent, and without any evidence to the contrary I am going to accept that opinion; it gels with my experience living in the bay and the 'rationalist' people I have met.

** I'm surprised the "destroy the sun" ending is considered the True or Good ending. The story sets up that humanity broadly believes in utilitarian principles (the rationality community's "shut up an multiply" is said by a few characters) and considers the plight of the babyeaters to be of moral concern, with babyeater children compared to human children in moral value. So the calculus looks like:

- 10 billion humans die + humans continue to have the capacity to suffer + babyeater children continue to suffer, BUT humanity remains human and able to determine their own destiny or evolution
- VS:
- Every babyeater, human and superhappy is modified into a morally superior (from both human and superhappy perspective) form, and suffering is eliminated

It's not clear to me that the superhappy manner of existence is any worse than ours. They still clearly have science - they have spaceships after all. In fact their commitment to truth is stronger than the future humans of the story: humanity had to lie to themselves about a physical constant of the universe to avoid people maliciously causing supernovas - both superhappies and babyeaters have biology or cultures that eliminated that possibility. As a rationalist concerned with the truth of the universe, I would think any modifications to humanity that increased our capacity to seek truth would be a /good/ thing.

Plus, in the True Ending, the Confessor/Kiritsugu mentions that he had fetal alcohol syndrome and was a murderer before being saved and "fixed." It's possible that all the improvements to him were made with his consent, but the way he talks about it I have my doubts. So future humanity is clearly okay with modifying an individual, possibly against their will, in order to improve life for the individual. If that's the case, they should have no objections when they are the defective individuals with the equivalent of Fetal Alcohol Sydrom that are being rescued.

No, the whole point of the morality of it is that you are doing a noble sacrifice by eating your own babies - hence eating babies being good. It's made very clear in the story that t hey even love the children that they eat.

...well, yes. That is the point: humans are actually decent at switching away from suboptimal Nash equilibria (in the Pareto sense). This, however, is a fact about humans, not about economics in general, and it is perfectly coherent to imagine a civilization with minds structured differently.

(Also, when I say humans are "decent" at switching away from suboptimal Nash equilibria, what I really mean is that they /occasionally/ manage it. In the vast majority of cases, humans get stuck in suboptimal Nash equilibria just like economics predicts they should--which is why pretty much all existing institutions are dominated by perverse incentives.)
