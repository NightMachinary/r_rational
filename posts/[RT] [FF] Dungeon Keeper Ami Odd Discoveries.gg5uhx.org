*** Sailor Mercury gets isekaied into the dungeon keeper (both 1 and 2) universe and then has to fend for herself against a world of antagonistic bad guys (other keepers and suchlike) who see her as a threat, and antagonistic good guys, who assume she's evil because she's a keeper. Armed with her sailor powers and science, she sloooowly manages to hold her own.
