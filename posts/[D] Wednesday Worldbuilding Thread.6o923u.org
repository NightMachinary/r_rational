Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** There is a city of perpetual night.

Within city limits, no stars can be seen in the sky, there is never any hint of sun, and only the moon shines it's light.

The two biggest consequences of this are probably the death of all plants, and the enormous need for artificial light. The difficulties in timekeeping and scheduling are secondary consequences; the only reasons to keep a 24-hour day with 8 hour work period are convention and circadian rhythms. I'm less sure about what the psychological effects might be.

Any thoughts on Things Which Must Be True given a city without daylight? (My intended tech level is roughly 1940s, but I would be interested in takes on earlier or later periods.)

*** Assuming this city is the only area affected by the Eternal Night (and the planet would be pretty much dead if it wasn't), there must be some reason that people choose to live there.

What that reason is will almost certainly shape the city and the city's culture.

Is there some resource buried underground there? It must be a mining town.

A valuable plant or fungus that only grows in the eternal moonlight? There are gardens everywhere, or maybe the city is mostly underground with the surface made of farms.

Whatever mystical effect causes the darkness also causes people to age more slowly? People who appear as children may have knowledge and experience of someone several times their apparent age, along with many other potential effects.

Maybe the darkness descended recently, and the geopolitical situation keeps people from being able to leave. Maybe the Land of Sunlight is filled with terrifying monsters. Maybe people can't die in the Nightrealm.

**** I've been thinking about this a bit, since it's what I see as the most serious issue. In the current iteration, it's an important port at the mouth of a major river, built prior to the Eternal Night. Basically, it exists for the same reason that New Orleans would be founded in an instant if it didn't already exist; geography is a really powerful factor in how and why cities form.

(I /think/ it's been about thirty years since Eternal Night fell, and there's been some migration out from the city to the land of daytime with huge, congested commutes involved for everyone who can afford it, a "night flight" syndrome that's left the city proper with high crime rates, low property values, low taxes, poor government, etc. And the city nevertheless exists, because economic incentives based on trade are far too important to ignore.)

***** In that case, it's probably a shipping city, which introduces complications that should be accounted for. Ships will be docking/undocking and moving past each other in almost complete darkness. I imagine the main dock areas would be extremely well lit for safety purposes, more of an eternal daytime than eternal night.

There might be regulations that require ships passing through to keep lit, and maybe buildings/buoys filled with lanterns to improve visibility on waterways. Either that, or ship collisions may be a real and common problem.

Keeping docks well lit may be expensive, which means there may be cheaper "dark docks" used by ships carrying cheap cargo and poorer passengers.

A city like this will probably have a lot of people passing through, especially by ship, who are still on "sunlight time." To cater to these people, there may be buildings or even whole areas near the docks where the lights shut off or become dim at "night."

Uh, it just occurred to me - maybe we're overplaying the use of vision? I mean, people have been living there for 30 years now and given the whole "people rich enough to leave, leave", people won't necessarily have the money for lighting. If people /could/ get by without light, they /would/. In fact, people depending on how expensive lighting is, just about everyone might be used to either low light conditions or complete darkness.

At which point, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] has practically recreated "Day of the Triffids" without the triffids! Some blind people have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation][learned how to use echolocation]] to lead the people who can't, see.

Actually, reading that wikipedia page, /everyone/ can learn how to do it, and given that darkness is more-or-less a fact and seeing with your eyes costs money, chances are that everyone will learn to do it. People born in the 30-year period, sufficiently poor, might have never learned to see.

Ignoring the above for a sec, if the docks /are/ brightly lit up 24/7 (which might actually be a thing, since shipping to daylight land will necessarily involve people who are used to daylight) then light pollution may be a thing. This could be a huge boon - /free light/! Resulting in people clamouring to live near the docks, and taking advantage of the light as best they can.

If the dock is shallow enough, some people /might/ (if possible/feasible) want to replace the dock's waterbed with a transparent material in order to live below the water with a sunroof of sorts - again, free lighting. Would require dredging the dock to keep those roofs clean, but again, economic incentive.

--------------

Come to think of it, lack of light means lack of /heat/. Eternal night-time means /it's freaking cold/ (unless the bubble is on the equator or something, and the surrounding sunlight country is quite hot and heats it a bunch). Icebergs might be possible, in the docks. Hell, even the whole river could freeze, which would make the shipping route less useful when it happens (see: Russia's northern ports, and its desire to control warmwater ports). Warm clothing would be a must, then, and (imported!) fuel for warmth might be a requirement. If that's the case then light isn't /quite/ as expensive, since it basically comes free with the (required) heating.

*** Highly prevalent seasonal affective disorder, for one thing. Parks wouldn't exist, exacerbating the mental stress faced by the residents as well. To help counteract that, malls and other buildings would have sunlamps and greenspaces to attract people, much like how our current buildings have air conditioning.

There would likely be 2-3 shifts for /everything/ (assuming that the city's self-contained enough to have its own economy), and those different shifts could diverge and segregate themselves socially and culturally when filter bubbles and "immigration" divide the people into tribes.

Tying into the previous point, noise bylaws and similar things that change based on "time of day" would need a radical rework. This could be either by not having any, or else neighborhood/apartment building specific times, which would further segregate people based on their work shift.

*** The City of Ember did this fairly well, though they had structured nights and days built into their quasi-religious reverence for "The Builders."

That also came with a total loss of technical uplift information, however. They even forgot how to make candles, and could only repair things by replacing broken parts with stored ones. It probably isn't what you're going for, but it's the only example in literature that I know of which was delved into with any depth.

*** You may want to check out [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/70647-silo][Hugh Howey's Silo series]], dystopian novels in which the inhabitants live within underground, windowless silos. Time is measured by mandated shifts (similar to what [[/u/ulyssessword]] suggested), crops are grown within small-scale artificially-lit farms, etc.

For your world, I'd also imagine that people would generally be extremely pale. Being tan (now accomplished entirely through artificial means) might be a sign of wealth and elitism, in the same way that paleness was once a sign of wealth in many of our societies (as it implied you did not have to labor in the sun).

*** People would need a secondary source of vitamin D. We mostly get ours from UVB exposure, and the moon [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1974Moon....9..295C][is a poor source of UV light]], reflecting only 0.7% of incident UVC (compared to 7.2% for visible light).

As far as I can tell our current dietary sources seem to all depend on UVB exposure. We can create D3 from lanolin (found in sheep wool) or fish liver + UVB, D2 from fungi + UVB (though the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergocalciferol][page for it]] doesn't specify that it's /only/ UVB, it could be; the minor levels of D2 in unirradiated mushrooms could be from sporadic sunlight exposure).

Fortunately, since the sun-free zone only extends to the city limits it means that livestock or plants grown outside the city can be imported for use. Apparently milk fortified with vitamin D was common by the 1930's, so a diet that's some combination of fish, mushrooms, and fortified milk (all sourced from outside the city) would be pretty likely.

On the other hand, the rich could probably afford to have large homes outside the city limits and commute in for work/social engagements, and wouldn't necessarily need such a diet (they might shun it, in fact, as a way of proving they're not "common").

Expect that anyone who can't afford a diet with enough vitamin D will develop rickets or osteomalacia. This could be a large percentage of the population, potentially. I imagine that the stratification of the city's society would have a lot to do with this.

*** What happens when the city expands? Someone builds a new suburb out into the Sunlit Lands - does the Endless Night expand? What happens when the city grows to the point where it begins to merge with a neighbouring city?

Is there a great big lump of Endless Night that just happens to overlap the city (and if so, how far outside the bounds does it go), or does the Night expand with the city in some way?

*** Well, if the city is on a planet which no stars ever shine on, even though the moon does, it should be frozen solid. So I conclude that it is not the planet that does not see the sun, but the city itself. Yet the moon shines on the city, so the city is exposed to the sky. How is this possible?

One possibility is that the planet that this city is on is tidally locked to the star it orbits, so the same side of the planet always faces the sun, and the city is on the other side. The lack of stars could just be that the atmosphere is too thick/cloudy for the tiny stars to be visible. In which case, the city certainly would be lacking in plant (and hence animal) life, but they can engage in trade with cities on the light side of the planet and thus avoid starving to death. But then why would anyone stay in a dark side city? And how would a dark side city have the profits needed to constantly import food?

So a thing which must be true is that this city has some kind of massive money maker. Maybe it's on top of a diamond mine. Or oil. Or coal. Or gold! Luring an influx of migrants from light side cities, all hoping to literally strike gold and become rich and successful. Trade booms, as traders go to dark side cities to sell food supplies and buy whatever the miners are digging up, and return to light side cities to do the opposite.

Alternatively, the dark side city could be a prison, on the very center of the planet's dark side. Security would be unparalleled because any criminal attempting to escape the city would simply starve to death before managing to reach the light side of the planet.

*** WHat happens on the edge of the zone? Is there a twilight band or a weird physics breaking line? Twilight band would make extra desirable housing area, as would the sunlit area just outside, unless the zone expands to cover it. I'd predict housing on the edge would be very expensive, but you could also have parks and schools out there so kids get enough UV (unless you want them running round in their underwear under UV lamps as they do in Siberia.) Day trips to outside would be super popular.

If the rest of the world is as normal people with sunlight sensitivity disorders would move to the city (and vampires if you have vampires)

**** I haven't quite decided yet, because I don't 100% have the project pinned down.

What I think would be cool, evocative, and ominous is to have the sun's apparent position in the sky start shifting as you approached the city. For a stretch of about a mile, the sun would appear to be setting to the north, until you were in the city proper and the sun was (apparently) entirely below the horizon. That would give a band of twilight.

** I came up with an interesting story idea about the landlords of a black market shopping district in [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1713530785583721/permalink/1911137659156365/][a cyberpunk setting inspired by Shadowrun and Red Markets]]. I like the idea of appealing to 80s and 90s nostalgia in a way that also exposes the blatant consumerism inherent in the franchises being referenced. I've reimagined the character archetypes of Shadowrun with this in mind: Street Samurai are trying to be edgy anti-heroes, Wizards are eccentric Harry Potter characters, Adepts are Martians arts heroes from shonen anime, Riggers build drones and mecha, Shamans catch and train spirits like Pokemon, and Deckers are magical weirdos obsessed with card and board games. There are a ton of adventurers all looking to stick it to the man and pay your illegal businesses lots of money to do so.

To further differentiate the setting from Shadowrun, I've decided to also reimagine the fantasy archetypes of elves and dwarves with enough internal diversity that they can fill in for the other races. Changelings are born with a telepathic link to a specific spirit, usually animal totems, and by fostering a relationship with their spirit gain thematically appropriate magic powers and appearances. They can change their bond to different spirits through pacts, though this takes effort. They are generally more powerful than humans in certain ways, but the effort to maintain and improve their boons can incentivize eccentric behavior. Bonding with spirits representing humans results in the traditional "high elf", which are known for being prideful because humans see themselves as superior to other animals.

Meanwhile, jotun can control one elemental force (fire, ice, storm, metal, stone, etc.) based on their bloodline. They can also transmute their flesh into their element and vice versa, so they will sculpt their bodies into a form of their choosing. Maintaining control over a lot of their element is difficult, so many build relatively short bodies to conserve power until their skill improves. There are plenty with inhuman faces or who even take the forms of giants, but that's less common since all "metahumans" started off as human until magic returned to the world a few generations ago. Personally, I think this could be a pretty cool world to play around in with enough potential for interesting and stylistic stories.
