/This fanfiction is inspired by HPMOR and by "Harry Potter and the boy who lived". It will also take a lot from Eliezer Yudkowsky's other writings as well as from those of Scott Alexander and others/

A flash, black with streams of emerald green. You can see it reflected in his eyes. But not his son's; his son's were that same green color as the light.

So yes, a bright green light, a streak, it sucks the light out from the room and leaves death where it has has been. He is standing in its path. His cry dies in his mouth. It does not pass through her lips. And alongside his tear, that one that moves down his cheek, comes first a drop of blood and then another, a stream. His eyes don't move. Their life is gone. His son just sucks his thumb.

You all know what happens next. The curse bounces back. Voldemort shrieks. His phantom spirit flees the scene. For some time he goes unseen and those that don't know any better think that he's gone, although we know that he is not.

That version of events is true enough, I suppose. But it was not a shriek. That was not the noise that Voldemort made. Voldemort was not scared. He was not afraid. He might have been in pain but I doubt that he would have cared even if he was. You see what Voldemort valued above all else was knowledge and comprehension.

/Do you know what it takes to be a dark lord/? A dark lord in not some simple minded idiot that happens to have the most innate ‘magical power'. That's nonsense. That's not how magic works. Magic is a science. Not merely a science but a whole field of sciences and philosophies. Only the most brilliant and the most original magical thinkers would dare to call themselves a dark lord.

But Voldemort wasn't just any old dark lord. No. Though he stood on the shoulders of the giants (both light and dark) that had come before him, there is no denying that Voldemort was the greatest Dark Lord to ever live. Some might even say that he was the greatest wizard to ever live. Of course those who say that are wrong. Albus Dumbledore was and is the greatest wizard to live.

Never the less, what there is no denying is that Voldemort and Dumbledore were in a league of their own. Their grasp of the magical sciences were unlike anything that the magical world had seen up until that time. It was if thousands of years of magical research, all the magical experimentation since Headmaster Francis Bacon first brought the scientific method to Hogwarts, had lead up to these two geniuses and to the unprecedented magics that they would each produce.

If not for the horror that came with them, then the whole magical world would wait on Voldemort's latest discoveries the same way they had once waited on those of a young Albus Dumbledore.

There is of course a reason that I tell you all of this. It's not simply to sing the Dark Lord's praise. I tell you all of this so that you will understand that when the curse bounced back and when Voldemort screamed it was not out of shock nor out of pain. As the phantom crack of his soul split off from his body Voldemort only laughed. /Voldemort loved to learn new things and boy had he just learnt something new/.

So even as a fled, a phantom without a body carried in the wind, he considered the night as whole to be a great success. There was that whole disembodiment thing of course, but knowledge has a price and his body was a small one to pay. He knew what he must do next. He knew what he must learn. If he was correct then James Potter had proven something that Voldemort had attempted to prove a thousand times and failed. James had proven that intent is not only a part of magic, James proved that magic is intent; or at least he had provided an experimental means of testing that hypothesis. He would remember what James had done and would make sure that James one day received the credit that he was due.

That old half-senile fumble-dork wouldn't stand a chance. He just hoped that Dumbledore didn't die too soon. Voldemort was hoping that he would get the chance to kill the old man himself. His plan would take some time. He would need at least ten years to put everything in place. He would have to tell Severus to keep that senile medaling old fool healthy until then.

Yes. Perhaps he would have him apply for the potions position. Only Severus could be allowed to know his whole plan. Severus: his most loyal servant. Voldemort now realized how wise he had been to spare the girl.

Severus was somewhat of a prodigy. He had within himself the makings of a great dark lord. Yes, Severus would one day be a great dark wizard. And now Voldemort knew that he had the man's undying loyalty.

/Now readers, it will be some time before you realize the genius of what Voldemort had done that night. I will tell you though that there were some players that Voldemort failed to account for./

Unlike our disembodied dark lord, the boy with the lightning bolt scar wasn't having a good night. He cried in his uncle Remus's arm while his brother, the one with deadly hallows scar on his forehead was rocked back and forth in the arms of his godfather. Sirius sang to Nate but his eyes were on Lilly.

James' body was sprawled before the fire place.

Lilly's had been looking at James's dead body for an hour now. She hardly blinked and her eyes had little life. They were nearly as dead as those of her husband though they shined in the same bright green color as her son's.

There was a ring, the chime of a bell. Dumbledore had arrived. Sirius went outside to take down the concealing charms and then there were lights. The green of the killing curse flashed in the window.

Remus began, “stay with the children”, but Lilly was already out the door. More lights, brighter this time, far brighter; though they were never green. After a moment or two the lights died down.

Remus keeps the twins behind him. To his surprise Lilly and Sirius' bodies are gently levitated in through the door. Dumbledore walks in behind them, his robes are a deep purple, appropriate for the somber yet joyous occasion.

“Remus” he says, “I will not insult you by taking your wand with superior force. Don't make me. I only ask that you trust me and hand it over”.

Something was off.

“What was James' senior thesis in Transfiguration?” Remus asked. His wand remained raised.

“Ah ever vigilant my young Remus. Mad eyes doing I suppose” said the man that appeared to be Dumbledore before he laughed and said “I'm not likely to forget. My dear James published some truly groundbreaking research on the properties of magical maps.”; Remus lowered his wand but Dumbledore continued to speak, “It was most impressive for a mere 7th year to produce such sophisticated research”; Dumbledore paused reflectively and then laughed adding “ of course I knew that he had completed his research in his 3rd year. I believed he called it the Marauder's map. But I saw no harm in letting his pranks go unnoticed, especially when they were producing such ingenious magical creations”.

Remus felt like a student being chided by his professor once again. He handed Dumbledore his wand.

“Where is James anyways?”; Dumbledore asked as he put it in his pocket; “the wards appear to have fallen”.

Remus pointed over to the fireplace, to James, to Dumbledore's most prized student, the heir to all of Dumbledore's magical discoveries. In an instant Dumbledore was as white as nearly-headless Nick. But Dumbledore was not as white as Remus became once he noticed who was standing behind Dumbledore. As soon as he saw Severus's smug face hiding behind Dumbledore he reached for his wand, but it was gone. He realized that this is what Dumbledore wanted. That meant that Dumbledore was protecting Snape. Dumbledore would not protect Snape unless Dumbledore knew something that Remus did not. Dumbledore trusted Snape, he realized. If Dumbledore trusted him then Remus would trust him too. Remus quickly realized what must have happened outside with Lilly and Sirius. No doubt Sirius had been the one to cast the killing curse; he was unsurprised. The two were closer than brothers, Sirius and James, so there was no doubt that Sirius's mind was full of the vile things that fueled a killing curse.

Remus looked to Dumbledore who nodded and began to speak; “I must say that our young Lilly gave me quite the run for my money. Sirius, a trained auror, I was expecting, but Lilly? Even my James cannot perform magic at such a level”. Dumbledore whispered something to himself before beginning to speak once more, “In all my time I have only seen three wizards perform such complex magic at so young an age. The first one was my soulmate, the one true love I have ever known in this old mans long and lonely life.”. For a moment Dumbledore seemed broken, but he managed to pull himself together and to continue.

Both Remus and Severus wondered who this witch was. She must have been something for Dumbledore to talk about her like that. So they were of course shocked when he said "*He* was the only one that ever freed me from the solitude of my own mind"

“The second” Dumbledore continued, “ was if I may for a moment abandon all appearances of humility, myself. The third, a student with so much potential, such a waist; his name was Tom I believe. However, he goes by a different name these days. I suppose he must consider his new name more sinister and villainous. No doubt you've heard of him. These days he has people call him Voldemort, Lord Voldemort”.

Remus was filled with a chill. There were goosebumps on his skin and prickles dancing down the edge of his spine. Nothing was known of Voldemort's childhood. He collected himself and began to speak, “He /went/ by a different name, you mean, professor?”.

“Of c-” Dumbledore froze, “Surely you don't mean?”. Dumbledore's eyes were wide and his jaw was open agape, dumbfounded beyond belief.

Remus nodded. Dumbledore grabbed Severus's arm and pulled up his sleeve. Remus noticed that Severus had only the outline of a dark mark.

“My children. The mark has begun to fade! The dark lord has been defeated!”, Dumbledore was all smiles until he looked down at James's body; that helped bring him back down and somber the mood.

“What” whispered the wizened old professor who was for the first time in his life at a loss for words, “What happened here tonight?”.

Remus gave Dumbledore wide and unknowing eyes, “you will have to wake Lilly and ask her for yourself”.

“Yes” Dumbledore said, “but first two calming are in order, no?”

“That seems wise headmaster” the potions master slowly drawled. He pulled two flasks out of his pocket and handed them to the headmaster before he turned around and gave one to Remus.

Remus tried to refuse but Snape continued to insist, “You're best friend just died for Merlin's sake. I would expect this from the three idiots but you should know better”. Remus gulped it down. Severus looked at the sleeping twins for a moment; he flinched and then nodded before putting another flask in Remus's pocket; “for later” the potions master plainly stated as he tucked it into Remus's pocket.


** I notice that you've started with a chatty first-person narrator, and then you swing right away to a third-person scene with only an odd italics line to separate them. This feels like an odd choice.

You also call Sirius and Lily "bodies" despite them being alive, which threw me off for a bit. I also saw "never the less," which should be "nevertheless."

I agree that it doesn't flow perfectly, but assuming this is a first draft, that's not the biggest problem. If you have a chatty first-person narrator, the flavor of their chattiness needs to carry the scene; it's a style that really depends on your ability to deliver distinctive and memorable prose. I bet the flow will go better when it's a bit more conversational.

Just off the top of my head stuff. If /you/ find the story compelling, it's worth pursuing, if only because it's always better to be writing than not writing and the best way to get better at writing is to keep doing it. Good luck!

** Worth pursuing. Has a ... 30? ... percent chance of being good, given its current state as a draft/concept; my base rate prediction was 10%.

Definitely issues with grammar, style, and flow, but contra to other commentary I wouldn't actually recommend "working" on those, so much as just writing perhaps 10x as much as you've written so far, and then throwing it all out and starting from scratch once you've sort of settled into a groove. i.e. write the first five to ten chapters, then trash them and rewrite those /same/ chapters, but without /actually looking/ at your first draft.

** I'm going to list some things that have jumped out at me.

#+begin_quote
  As soon as he saw Severus's smug face hiding behind Dumbledore
#+end_quote

I'm not sure canon Snape would be enough of a short-sighted arsehole to be openly smug in that situation. Not a fan of this character interpretation.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's eyes were wide and his jaw was open agape, dumbfounded beyond belief.
#+end_quote

Again, I like to interpret Dumbledore as a bit more of a self-controlled person. Gaping at things doesn't fit that. Not to say that you can't change his character to fit your fancy, just that it doesn't match my preferred image of him.

#+begin_quote
  The first one was my soulmate, the one true love I have ever known in this old mans long and lonely life.”. For a moment Dumbledore seemed broken, but he managed to pull himself together and to continue ... "He was the only one that ever freed me from the solitude of my own mind"
#+end_quote

Now is not the time for that. Seriously, would you start reminiscing about your past lovers in such a situation? Also /soulmates/ are a staple of bad fanfiction. I've never seen them done in a satisfactory fashion and their presence alone constitutes enough evidence for how bad the fic will be that I usually drop them on the spot.

#+begin_quote
  “I must say that our young Lilly gave me quite the run for my money. Sirius, a trained auror, I was expecting, but Lilly? Even my James cannot perform magic at such a level”.
#+end_quote

And he must have somehow missed that while teaching them and then leading the order of phoenix. Maybe in this AU Dumbledore is not supposed to have been closely working with them to combat Voldemort, though. Even then, it still seems like something he should have known beforehand. Exceptional talent doesn't unexpectedly arrive overnight in grown people, as a rule.

#+begin_quote
  Remus pointed over to the fireplace, to James, to Dumbledore's most prized student, the heir to all of Dumbledore's magical discoveries.
#+end_quote

Yes. Because Lilly suddenly becoming a Dumbledore-tier magic user was not enough. Surely the whole universe simply must revolve around this family. I wouldn't be surprised if both of them also were secretly heirs of Hogwarts founders and also Merlin and also trained by an anthropomorphic personification of Hogwarts itself or some such tripe.

#+begin_quote
  He cried in his uncle Remus's arm while his brother, the one with deadly hallows scar on his forehead was rocked back and forth in the arms of his godfather. Sirius sang to Nate but his eyes were on Lilly.
#+end_quote

I can't critique the change itself, since consequences are yet to be seen, but I have acquired a certain degree of dislike for it, since it rarely precedes a good story in my experience.

--------------

If this wasn't posted here on [[/r/rational]], I wouldn't have even read this draft to the end. I'd say it needs work, but the problems are not limited to the technical aspects, the changes made to the universe are problematic as well, at least from my point of view.

**** Looking back on it, I think I sound a bit too harsh in that post. From my POV the problems are there, of course, but there is a large subjective element to it. And some of them, like the soulmates and Harry having a brother, are really not even problems by themselves. It's just that they usually come up in bad fanfiction, so they taint this draft purely by association.

I hope you don't get discouraged by my comments.

** A wizard of Dumbledore's caliber walks into a room after a disaster of some kind without observing anything of the immediate environment? He doesn't even know where James's lying just over the fireplace?

Why does Dumbledore need to put some extra tidbits to the security question? Among themselves - capable people - they should have always maintain the precautions - especially during distress, why the need of refering to Mad eye?

Dumbledore came here for some serious business, yet stood chatting, commenting on his students performance, while there's a body in the room. What's the list [first, second, third] for? Get to the point!

I still don't understand the point of Remus just standing there after knowing his two very powerful friends being dominated out the window. When hostile knock your door, and clearly you're incapable of stopping them, flee. Don't just stand there and ask question! You're the last stand of the two infants, for Merlin's sake!

** It's a good start. Though the prose needs another pass and the style needs tempering, the story has a good deal of potential. I would like to compliment your use of speech indicators: I actually didn't notice them at all on my first read-through. Normally I get distracted by dialogue because many otherwise excellent writers fall flat when they try to use speech indicators. You have begun to bend yours to the will of the story. Well done.

Taking this to be a prologue, I'd read at least the first chapter or two just to see where you meant to go with it.

Your replies to the feedback you have received so far have been polite and gracious. Being able to accept criticism (and act on it) without expressing resentment is a rare talent. Well done.

If /you/ think a work is worth pursuing, it /is/ worth it. If you have a story to tell (and it sounds like you do), you should definitely tell it!
