  Harry nodded. "Is it entirely safe? Can a malicious soul do anything to me?"

  "Other than attempting to manipulate you, no. They have no power but speech, and you can dismiss them at any time."
#+end_quote

/That's plenty of power./

#+begin_quote
  Before the other could argue further, he turned the stone three times in his hand. "Tom Marvolo Riddle."
#+end_quote

So in the next chapter, Voldemort tries to talk his way out of a Box.

*** "Voldemort tries to talk his way out of a Box." - this made me laugh :)

edit: Though nobody has the ability to let anything out of The Box yet.

This is MOR!Voldemort. He'll invent a way with Harry's help, even if it is impossible for him to think of entirely new things. On the plus side, this might help save everyone else.

****** True, he cannot innovate. But it's canon that he's been planning for over half a century. Even with a lack of innovation, he will still have access to his past innovations. And based on his note, he's bound to have already created multiple plans based around his death, which he will still have access to. In addition, I believe, based on what was said, that ghosts can still deductively reason, especially if they've spent enough of their life time doing this, even if they can't learn, or spawn entirely new ideas.

******* Whilst he's been planning for over 50 years, he's only had the Resurrection Stone for a few months - he tells Harry that he was the one to point him to the Stone. No matter what plans he's laid out, he didn't know this Box existed until very recently, let alone how to talk himself out of it.

******** A few months is a long time to map something out enough to maintain the plan postmortem, based on what Cadmus was saying.

***** If the dementor ate his soul and it didn't go to ether, he shouldn't be found by the stone. IF destroying the dementor freed him to go to ether, the horcruxes should also work already so he is out of the box anyway. If he is summoned as a soul, it shouldn't in itself do anything with the horcruxes.

*** You know, when Cadmus started reporting /his memories of prior summonings/, I think Harry should probably have asked what Riddle talked with him about. (Because surely he would have gone for Cadmus as well.)

Why on earth would you have kept reading this long if you weren't interested? I'm honestly curious - I write, and I like for people to read what I've written, but it's really hard to understand what keeps people reading, and what makes them drop a book.

****** Possibly because it's been well written and promising so far, well written enough to keep you entertained while the promise of something /interesting/ has you hooked.

Or possibly because it's human nature to complain that's something /just/ got interesting when you realise you're about to lose it.

EDIT: I can attest at least to the fact that I was actually shocked last week when I checked the current chapter/word count and saw it at 32 chapters and ~650 worth of paperback pages. My intuition would have been closer to maybe 20 chapters if I'd thought about it, and maybe a couple of hundred pages.

  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_AI][Friendly AI]] studies, an *AI box* is a hypothetical isolated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware][computer hardware]] system where an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence][artificial intelligence]] is kept constrained inside a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality][simulated world]] and not allowed to affect the external world. Such a box would have extremely restricted [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information][inputs]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output][outputs]]; maybe only a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext][plaintext]] channel. However, a sufficiently intelligent AI may be able to persuade or trick its human keepers into releasing it. This is the premise behind [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky][Eliezer Yudkowsky]]'s informal *AI-box experiment*.
