** I choose xamueljones, because I like to have a normal name with the first letter switched out for an uncommon letter (J, Q, X, Z). For example, I would take Richard and change it to Qichard. Hence Samuel had s switched out with an x.

Names where no (sane) parent would ever name their child feel weird to use. That goes double for usernames with numbers at the end. I suspect that people who don't put a decent amount of time (a few minutes at least) into picking a name tend to treat politeness in social interactions on an online communities as a suggestion instead of a necessity. If you aren't going to care how you are perceived by others through your username, then you aren't going to care if others get offend by what you say or do.

I added jones to the end and made the name lower-case to subtly honor [[/u/alexanderwales]] because he was the one to lead me to [[/r/rational]] and reddit in general via [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]]. By matching his style of all lower caps and a first-last name, I can pattern my username after 'alexanderwales' without being too similar.

** Mine contains elements from different usernames I've had in the past.

My first username I ever used was CubicZirconium (CubicZirconia was already taken) because the only thing better than a diamond is an artificial diamond made with the awesome power of science! Unfortunately, it and the other username I've used, CopperFlower, are apparently fairly popular so I had to come up with a new one. CopperZirconium 1) sounded cool and 2) combined both my nerdy and artsy names.

I don't know if Copper and Zirconium actually form a useful alloy or not. I assume not due to lack of Google results.

The explosion is considered to be the loudest sound ever heard in modern history, with reports of it being heard up to 3,000 miles (4,800 km) from its point of origin. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave][shock waves]] from the explosion were recorded on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barograph][barographs]] around the globe.

** Avret:\\
This goes back a while...In my first playthrough of skyrim(still one of my all time favorite games) I named my character Avret the Executioner...no idea how I thought of it. I thought the name sounded cool, so used it for many things in the interim, and then decided to post my fanfics under it. To preserve continuity I use the same name on reddit(My lessWrong username's different because I created it 5 months or so before I started using Avret for everything).
