** Even ignoring the question of whether other things than the laptop are important, money brings flexibility, and having more money makes things cheaper (for instance, you could live in an apartment with a one year lease that amounts to less per week than your current arrangements). You also probably don't have very good medical benefits. I don't know what your college degree is in or how many marketable skills you have, but you at least need to realize that a low end fast food job is bad rather than being satisfied with it, and treat it as a problem.

Also, this is off-topic here, since the subreddit is for rational fiction.

**** Probably the off-topic thread, if you want rationality-related advice. There's a few posts like yours every week.

**** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fyubf/d_friday_offtopic_thread/]] is the current off-topic thread, where we discuss all kinds of things-- including stuff like your situation! Feel free to come by and check things out.

Many people from the rational community in general who like to talk about rationality hang out at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex]] -- a subreddit that draws from the community if the slate star codex blog. Either would be a good place to check out as well!
