** The mental image of Reagan melting in the rain is one I'll keep for a long time to come.

#+begin_quote
  New Country
#+end_quote

I wonder if every other country name had already been taken at this point.

#+begin_quote
  Vatican Crater
#+end_quote

That's ominous

#+begin_quote
  the Israel-Palestine Anomaly
#+end_quote

This one really cracked me up.

#+begin_quote
  THE REAL
#+end_quote

Wtf?

*** Could be related to The Matrix:

#+begin_quote
  Welcome to the desert of the real.
#+end_quote

The line became the title of a Marxist book, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Desert_of_the_Real][the Wikipedia page for the book]] says that it refers to a quote from /Simulacra and Simulation/:

#+begin_quote
  If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly [...] this fable has now come full circle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacrum [...] It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.
#+end_quote

Which is indeed ominous.

** There are surprisingly few eighties and nineties in this chapter.

I see a 538 (BC, in the epigraph), a 19 (th century, with Phineas Gage), a 3 (days that the mud is available for viewing), 50 (countries in UNSONG), 100's (of dollars for a Name), 250 (pages in The Temple and the Marketplace), 5 and 11 (chapter and verse in Job), 3 (recounts), 20 (electoral votes), 100,000,000,000 (chance of coincidence (ignoring TINACBNIEAC)), and 40 and 4 (Chapter and verse in Isiah).

In fact the /only/ numbers in the chapter between 80 and 99 (inclusive) are the years that the events are taking place in. This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.
