*** Well, but if you have a giant propulsion laser that's probably not going to have much in the way of quick, agile targeting - a solar sail is a target that /wants/ to be hit. Couple that with the fact that the destructive potential is obvious, and the propulsion laser will probably be made to be slow to target /on purpose/ as a safety measure, exactly for the same diplomatic reasons.

In other words, it won't hit the side of a space barn if someone can just as much as push it away by huffing and puffing.

***** Well, there still wouldn't be much point in making those too mobile either. They'll have some RCS control system I guess. I just don't see many possibilities for military use unless one carries out a major re-engineering project.

******* Mmm, fair, parallax would require them to be able to do some complex tracking.

** Speculative videos have had some success here, so when Tech Ingredients put something out I felt it deserved a shot.
