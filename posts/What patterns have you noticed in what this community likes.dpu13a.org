There is a definition of Rationalist Fiction.

However, there is also the questions of what people in this community talk about. There are authors I think of as "Rationalist" that rarely come up. There are also works that it would never have occurred to me are rationalist that get brought up a lot.

For instance, I've never heard anyone bring up John Wright (who preaches a rationalist viewpoint) or Isaac Asimov (who wrote many books about science, puzzle books, and rationalist thinker heroes). There is very little hard sci fi (except Greg Egan), very little Epic Fantasy (except Brandon Sanderson occasionally).

I think what gets brought up here is skewed a bit towards Fanfic, LitRPG, super hero stuff, and male power fantasies.

What patterns have you noticed in what gets the most "air time"? What works do you think fit the definition of Rationalist Fiction that this community seldom brings up?


** I agree with most of what you said. I think the prominence of fanfic etc. can be explained with the fact it is free. I can recommend a Practical Guide to Evil or the Erogamer to anyone and they can read it and then the community can discuss it.

I would say the two big things people here hate are the idiot ball and characters acting out of character. A general approach to bettering themselves and the society around them seems to also be expected of the protagonist but it is not necessary if the work of fiction is interesting in other ways and raises important questions.

*** I to hate the Idiot Ball and that hatred has brought me to this reddit. That and a dislike of authors and characters who don't think through the implications of the Fantasy/Sci Fi elements they introduce.

I think part of the prevalence of fanfic is because people are really really angry at the irrationality of their favorite/least favorite franchise. That and the fact this is reddit. If you are here you have an internet connected device in front of you and likely spend a lot of time online. If a library were to set up a rationalist book club I suspect the book list would look very different.

If you want to read a print book, you have to either buy it or get it from the library. Ebooks make this a little easier, but if you don't have Kindle Unlimited or access via library, etc. you're going to have to actually buy the book. Whereas web serials are never more than a click away. Mention your serial here at 3 PM and eight people will have read the first four chapters by 8.

** Part of the popularity of fanfic is obviously, as has been said in this thread before, that they're free. Another one that I think people have overlooked, is the serial nature of them, i.e there's always something new to discuss. Even though he was a prolific author, Aasimov only has so many books, and they came out a while ago so most people don't have much to say on the topic that hasn't been covered already. Compare that to the front page right now, where each time a chapter of PGTE/ mother of learning/worth the candle comes out, it's a lot easier to analyze the new stuff from there and how it fits together with the plot, and new content multiple times a weak or monthly at most leads to it staying fresh in people's minds.

** I think a lot of what you're observing with regards to the authors you listed is the difference between published authors (who rarely put out more than a book a year, and usually much less frequently than that, AFAIK) and webserial authors, who usually do a few chapters a month.

There's also a lot more involved in accessing the works of published authors, whereas with webserials there's a button to click; more, if I want books not epubs, I can't immediately start reading.

There's also a huge difference between discussing a single chapter, and discussing an entire book.

So, in terms of air-time, it's a function of quality, frequency, accessibility (a little bit) and content-size, which results in something like a black swan effect. The air-time something gets has more to do with how recurringly discussable it is, than subjective quality (although subjective quality definitely matters; look at PGtE vs TGAB).

After _that_, it's probably a question of "what kinds of webserials tend towards rationality" more than "we like LitRPGs".

Regarding "male power fantasies", it's gonna take more words. Rational works in general lend themselves towards stories about the growth of power; rational _readers_ quite like power-fantasy-ish stories, _but_ we also tend to not like curb-stomps, which is what the classic "power-fantasy" story involves - that's the whole "give Frodo a lightsaber, given Sauron a death star". After _that_, AFAIK the rationalist community skews male - so it makes sense that writers tend to write male perspectives (it's what they know), readers tend to read male perspectives (people like reading about people like themselves) - and fiction itself skews male (so if you're writing fanfic and pick a random character (even weighted by some measure), it's likely too be male). And then still after all that you can climb down the rabbit hole of "does default society treat power-seeking as a masculine trait". Finally, consider that Worm and PGtE are two of the top fictions as rated by this community.

So, overall, I'd say that "male power-fantasy-ness" is a (light) _negative_ predictor of a work's popularity on this sub, because a) power-fantasies tend to be both worse fiction and tend to be less rational fiction and b) sexist fiction tends to be worse fiction (globally).

Actually I'm pretty sure this is wrong. Women read WAY more then men and dominate urban fantasy.

I've noticed a definite gender bias to different genres.

My two favorite "Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" style series bring in harems and have vaguely sexist undercurrents. LitRPG has a male bias. Yet as I said, if I go to a bookstore and look at fantasy novels there is a definite female slant, and Reddit Fantasy seems to be much more female leaning.

**** I agree with most of this comment, but I don't think rationalist fiction protagonists skew male. If anything, it's the opposite.

I admit this is anecdotal and that my knowledge of the genre is biased toward older (6+ years ago) works, but when rational fiction gets discussed, the works that seem to me to get brought up most often are:

- hpmor
- alicorn's fiction (luminosity's author)
- friendship is optimal
- the metropolitan man
- qntm's fiction
- wildbow's fiction (It's been debated whether this one is in the genre, but I count it because looking for stories similar to Worm was how me and a lot of other people discovered the rationalist community in the first place.)

Of these stories, only hpmor and mm have male protagonists.

Alicorn's fiction has almost exclusively female protagonists.

Friendship is Optimal has CelesteAI, who while not strictly female, is referred to as she/her.

qntm' fiction consists mostly of ensemble pieces with no clear protagonist, but the his SCP Antimemetics series has protagonist Marion Wheeler.

And Worm and Ward by Wildbow have female protagonists as well.

Of the works I mentioned, only hpmor really qualifies as a power fantasy. (Although FiO /might/ qualify too. Depending on your system of ethics, it's either a power fantasy or existential horror.)

Luminosity, Metropolitan Man, and Worm /kinda/ start that way, but rapidly deconstruct it.

And qntm's stuff is the polar opposite of power fantasies, dealing with protagonists who are in way over their heads and stay that way for pretty much the whole story.

Yes! Well, maybe not most, but an awful lot. It's easy for heterosexual people writing out their sexual fantasies to forget the objects of those fantasies are actual people, or at least gloss over pesky character development issues. When I read Laurel K. Hamilton I had a realization...I thought the male characters were blow-up dolls and the author totally didn't understand what the situation would like like to them and realized "Oh! I finally understand the weird feeling my female sci fi fan friends said they had when they read Robert A. Heinlein". Laurel K. Hamilton is the queen of creepy FEMALE power fantasies. It's always kind of uncomfortable reading literature devoted to a fetish you don't have...the inconsistencies are glaringly obvious. In fact, I started looking at LitRPG on Reddit partly because I'd ODed on the Alphahole/Pride & Prejudice style romances that were common in the Urban Fantasy/Supernatural Romance hybrids that were big for a while.

** Fanfic and other web fiction is popular here because the rational fiction community (or at least THIS rational fiction community) gained much of its popularity from HPMoR, and because the episodic release style that much web fiction uses is more conducive to active community discussion than the more traditional route of releasing an entire work at once. The popularity of LitRPGs seems to me to be especially high right now as far as web fiction goes in general, so that (along with another work popular in this community, Worth the Candle) contributes to the LitRPG trend, and of course Worm (while in my opinion not rational itself) is highly popular here, contributing to the superhero stuff (seems like 90% of the superhero stuff I see here is worm related).

I think power fantasy is admittedly something a little bit common here (though I think the name "power fantasy" has too much of a pejorative context and problematizes something not fundamentally problematic, and that while it shouldn't be the only tool in our toolbox there's nothing wrong with a work of fiction catering to a desire for a feeling of agency and ability to meaningfully affect the world, something our current society causes many to lack in their normal life), but I disagree with the characterization of it as specifically "male power fantasy", because I have never seen a work of fiction on this sub that seemed to endorse or portray a worldview in which the power should specifically be possessed by men. Certainly the gender or sex of the protagonist is irrelevant for these purposes; having a male protagonist pursue power does not evidence that the author does not believe women should have power.

That explains a lot, actually.

I'm not assuming the presence of Power Fantasies equates to Male Power Fantasy. I was qualifying Power Fantasy by adding "male" to distinguish it from other power fantasies. It's just a flavor I've been getting lately. (I've been running into a lot of power fantasies with harems and weird depictions of women lately and got irritated. And the difference between the "male" and "female' dominated forums is amusingly telling).

**** "Harems" (another word I don't like) do seem to pop up occasionally here, and I attribute this to the influence of anime and manga on nerdy internet subcultures, this one included. But whether or not "harems" are inherently problematic depends on your definition of such. If it's one man in romantic or sexual relationships with many women, or the slightly broader version, one person in relationships with many other people, then there's nothing wrong with that (in fiction or otherwise) as long as all people involved are consenting adults. On the other hand, the most cliche, played-straight conceptualization of the harem DOES seem to imply a level of objectification, seeing women as a prize to be won and something of which having more is better, a status symbol who could have been anyone as long as they were hot. However, I haven't seen the latter conceptualization of the harem in any works popular among this particular community (that I've read, obviously).

I do agree that most implementations have been off, though, at least the implementations that deliberately invoke the idea. I know of at least one ratfic that pokes at the idea in an interesting and non-problematic way, but it doesn't seem to be an example of the trope as such, CERTAINLY not played straight, although it's not finished yet. The specific story is Worth the Candle, marked as a spoiler since even though I didn't say anything specific about the story it's a spoiler that it pokes at that trope.

** I'd guess fanfic is dominant here because the term [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][was coined]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky in reference to his Harry Potter fanfic (and people asking him to recommend similar works/tips on howhe wrote), and a lot of the initial subreddit population came from there? So we were pre-selected for liking fanfic.

And then of course it's self-perpetuating, since a lot of the stories posted and written by users here are fanfic they'll attract mostly people who enjoy fanfic.

** The following post is not worded sensitively because I have not been feeling very well lately and I'm too tired and stressed to fix it. These are just my own point of view. Please bear with me and try not to take offense.

One of the things that really bothers me about rational fiction is that while it tends to be more psychologically and socially realistic than other fiction, it usually doesn't take that realism far enough, especially when it comes to characters who are too different from rationalists in their skill sets and way of life. Rationalists generally don't really understand how other people who aren't rationalists think and perceive things and why they think and perceive things the way they do. And non-rationalists generally don't have the analytical skills nor the obsession with constant maximum self-awareness to explain their reasoning to a rationalist's satisfaction. A lot of the nonrationalist reasoning is implicit and is easier to understand if you understand what a non rationalist's current knowledge, experiences and goals are. Even when people are ridiculously and systematically wrong, there are usually understandable and relatable reasons for why other people are so wrong like that--theyre human beings, not cognitive mutants after all. They arent fundamentally inherently different from rationalists. The true nature of mass delusion is just as much social/communicative as it is intellectual, if not more so in some ways. Otherwise if it were just an intellectual impediment rather than a social/communicative one, you wouldnt get so many people, many of whom are otherwise very intelligent and rational in other areas of their lives, sharing the /same/ delusions. Everyone would be religious and they would all have their own religion unique to themselves alone.

Non-rational fiction is often unthinking and full of holes. Rational fiction often makes the mistake of at least to some extent, strawmanning people who arent rationalists. Not strawmanning their specific arguments/beliefs, because rationalists have an injunction against strawmanning those. Instead they strawman the non-rational characters themselves, by treating them as inferior in skill and goals to the rationalist protagonist, and often not presenting them plausibly the way their real life equivalents would be.

Tbh, I think draco in hpmor could have taught Harry a lot more stuff, but we mostly see things the other way around with harry teaching draco. Harry has the science, draco has the people stuff. Yet somehow dracos role as the people person is made less important because Harry thinks he already understands other people very well and doesnt think he needs to learn much from draco.

Some of the more recent rational fics I've seen have done better with this. Alexander Wales has gotten particularly good at not strawmanning non-rationalist characters. That being said, I feel like Solace's character in worth the candle could be pinned down and fleshed out better. Just because her magic is meant to be undefinable and magically uncomprehendable by dm fiat doesnt mean her own heart and mind need to be that way too. She feels mysterious and serene and she cares about things being unknown and mysterious and not being pinned down and broken down and defined. Great! So if she doesnt like analyzing things or being analyzed, what does she like instead? The opposite of analysis isn't ignorance, it's CREATIVITY. Why don't we see her being creative more often instead of her magic being creative for her? Why doesnt she make art or sing? Real hippies/environmentalists/creative-nonconformists/anti-technology/anti-academic establishment types (pointing to an empirical cluster in person space here) might seem to think and act like solace on the surface, but there's a lot more to them than that! As a character, Solace is a strawman of those types of people. Generally speaking, she doesnt believe what she believes because of any understandable and relatable experiences, neither through her own nor her ancestors' experiences passed down in oral tradition or some other cultural mechanism. She believes what she believes for the purposes of being anti-rationalist, to steelman /antirationalism itself/ instead of steelmanning the kinds of cultures and perspectives that non-rationalists actually would plausibly develop.

People are complicated. The human brain is the most complicated dynamic system in the known universe. Generalized intellectual brute force can only get you so far in understanding the hearts and minds of other people in specific detail. Science is designed to attain /generalizable/ knowledge, not /specifiable/ knowledge. Understanding the general theory of everything doesnt help you understand the specific theory of why that person just told you your tie looks nice. In theory it would if you had infinite computing power and infinite time, because reductionism. But like, you dont have infinite computing power or time? That's why we have to compartmentalize our understanding of the world into different levels of scope.

How HJPEV was able to visualize an entire eraser in maximum physical detail for his partial transfiguration without the infinite computing power necessary to get infinitely precise visualization is still a mystery to me. His brain didn't have enough neurons to represent the eraser at even the quark level, because there were fewer neurons in his brain than quarks in the eraser. Visualizing the eraser in even more fine detail than that makes even less sense. If you can get infinite precision and infinite computing power, you can get infinite observational data, and then you can get probabilstic beliefs that are ACTUALLY 0 or 1 rather than simply rounded up to 0 or 1 in certain contexts and levels of scope like the brain /normally does/ because of limitations on its precision.

The chances that 2+2 != 4 are lower than the chances that santa clause exists by many orders of magnitude. It would take far more evidence-fuel to prove the former than the latter, but the absolute difference is small enough that their chances /feel/ equal from inside a human brain, because the brain is not infinitely precise. That's also the obvious explanation for why scope insensitivity exists btw.

*Tldr*; Rational fiction spoiled non-rational fiction for me, and now rational fiction has been spoiled for me too. Where is the next level super-rational fiction that I am now craving? The rational fiction that is actually rational fiction of which the current flavor of rational fiction is but a pale imitation of? /sighs in wistful desperate longing/

How much do you think this is a mistake by the author and how much is it a purposeful character flaw he consciously gave Harry? I think it is a mix of both.

Back to your point though, the stuff you describe is why I like Wildbow so much. His PoV characters, be they the MC or from an interlude, are definitely not rationalist in the vast majority of cases. They are biased, both due to their general personality and due to the specific stressful and emotional situations they find themselves in. And yet they feel real. I rarely see obvious idiot balls and the like. In fact, I often feel like they are making obvious and understandable choices and only notice how skewed their thoughts were at times if I look back at it for a second readthrough.

Do you read his stuff? Or is there something that bothers you about it that you can't ignore enough to enjoy his stories?

I think Harry just said that Draco can teach him about "people stuff" to get him to cooperate. Draco doesn't know shit about people, he's a bully and a death eater. What manipulative knowledge patterns Draco does have are poisoned by the way it is shaped for ill intent, the same way that Quirrel's is.

I prefer same-sex romance stories and that often leaves me with a very bad taste in my mouth because there are much fewer authors writing decent slash fic. Most of the authors who write same sex relationships put same-sex attracted people on an othering pedestal of rainbows and specialness, just like half of the society I live in does, and the other half of that society isnt tolerant enough of same sex relationships to write them in fiction at all. This fact makes me angry and sad and leaves me with a very sour taste in my mouth, because whenever I want to read some good same sex romance stories I have trouble finding any i like and just end up watching porn instead. >:(

******** Gotcha. I've been trying to write a "super-rational" fic myself, but its very slow because I was a terrible prose writer with a very narrow perspective when I first started in 2017. I published the first book only to find out later that there were serious flaws that neither I nor my editors caught originally.

It's a novella series called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". It's about an alternate near-present day Earth very similar to our own, where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere and the threat of human extinction is drawing near thanks to mass deception enabled by deep fake software and mass displacement of human workers enabled by the automation of their jobs.

It's what one might call high/epic Earthfic (as contrasted to low/drama-earthfic like this one: [[https://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]])

I'm curious, are you familiar with A Practical Guide To Evil? It has very spot-on character writing for people's differing perspectives and how they clash and /exactly how people are irrational/, in my observation, and I enjoy it greatly for that. It has no 'perfect rationalist' characters, even those who espouse the values and employ the methods and come close are still people with biases and shortage of computing resources.

If you've read it, I'd be curious to hear your opinion on it. If you haven't, well... this is a recommendation then!

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance][Super Science and Fast Romance]] is very good and complete (ish, i think?)

Edit: I found Street Cultivation to be kind of boring - the other series by Sarah Lin starting [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42847216][Changing Faces]] was definitely more interesting for me personally. The conceit is the protagonist is an NPC evil lich who accidentally wakes up inhabiting a body that was supposed to go to a LitRPG player - and proceeds to play the game as if it were real life (which to him it is.)

**** I'm not sure it's a problem if that's what the audience is here for. It's just kind of interestingly odd when even a teenaged character's emotions are being dissected like a psychology case study by said teenager.

But yes, there is some dissonance between "this character, if wholly rational, would probably avoid getting into a fist-fight with a dragon, but he did max out his Punch stat and Dodge stat, so he can totally do that, and people love fantasy violence, so this calm, methodical puzzle-solver is going to beat the hell out of a giant monster to show off how cool he is."

***** Honestly, I probably dissected my emotions more when I was a teenager then I do now. To be fair, it probably didn't make my behavior more rational.

What I run into is "This 8 year old is going to methodically study how magic works, perform meticulous controlled experiments...then go off alone to fight kobolds rather then waiting a few years until his body gets bigger and his magic improves." Ran into that twice lately.

Also, I'm annoyed when a character meets an actual god and gives an atheist rant when the god is right there. I have a strict policy of not telling telling anyone they don't exist where they can hear me.

I wish you'd talk to some Republican figureheads for me. They don't seem to be able to see or hear me when I try to tell them I exist.

**** I've heard that term used but never defined. What counts as "male power fantasy"? Is there an equivalent "female power fantasy"? How about other versions for non-binary and/or gender fluid? (Or are those concepts too new to the mainstream to have been systematized yet?)

#+end_quote

Yes! As I've said earlier in this discussion, Laurel K. Hamilton is all about those.

A plain old gender neutral power fantasy becomes a male power fantasy when you add some stereotypical macho imagery and the hero's power (as expressed through his skill at violence) gets him lots of girls. I suppose this could be a lesbian power fantasy, but I personally haven't encountered a lesbian version of it.

As for gender-fluid power fantasies...I haven't encountered enough of these to get annoyed by them yet. (Or even recognize them). I'm sure they must exist, but I'd probably have to go to some really specialized subreddit to find them.

******* Well, Laurel K. Hamilton plays it direct...Anita Blake in the later novels uses her strength to get a harem of guys fawning over her. But that's unusual.

Usually it seems to involve the notion of standing up to men...a perfectly reasonable idea, although like most things it gets weird if you dial it up to 11. There are a whole lot of novels where an overpowered female protagonist gets to say and do whatever she feels like without worrying about others feelings, bulldozes through the consequences with super human strength, and shouts down a controlling alphahole until he admits he is wrong and becomes a sensitive boyfriend.

Do you have examples of this within the most popular fics on this subreddit? I haven't really noticed this as a full-blown trend within the stories I found through this subreddit and like to follow/enjoyed to their end.

  I think what gets brought up here is skewed a bit towards Fanfic, LitRPG, super hero stuff, and male power fantasies.
#+end_quote

Other people have mentioned that fanfic is common here because it's free. There is almost certainly more fanfic available in the world than original fiction, so even beyond its free status it's likely to dominate just on numbers. Moreover, it's an easy place for new writers to get started, and new writers are generally looking for an audience so will make at least a modest effort to spread the word.

LitRPG seems to be a fad on the internet right now, hence why there's a lot of it. I don't remember much of it showing up here back in 2013-2015 when I was publishing /The Two Year Emperor/, so my guess is that it will die down eventually.

As to superhero stories, I would disagree with you there. From what I've seen, superhero stories per se have never gotten a lot of traction here, either in terms of numbers of posts or numbers of upvotes. My /Change Storms/ novel was the least popular thing I ever posted on this subreddit, and Doc Future's various books about Flicker (eg [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34152071413/flicker-phone-tag]]) get confusingly few upvotes despite being what looks like tailor-made rr-bait.

** I just prefer good quality web +comics+ serials over the popular books. It's not about cost because libraries are a thing. I can get sucked in to books as well but then the wait for the next is long enough that I don't really care to read more than a trilogy. Also Robert Jordan's really disturbing views on women just turned me off of the entire medium. At least he didn't make all women into monsters like Lovecraft did with minorities but no, actually he did.

I have gotten into a couple web serials. The problem is I find none of the best web serials are ever finished. The couple I've gotten into publish a page or two a week, which makes the progress painfully slow. Plus reading books online gives me headaches.

I use an RSS reader for most of what I read so I don't have to keep checking. Nice side benefit of that is by the time I realize someone has stopped updating it's been long enough that I don't really mind.

** We like being vindicated, we like being right. The rationalist characters are generally placed in surcomstances uniquely suited to the rationalist approach and they don't make nearly enough mistakes. The worlds are also often not rationalist and the characters don't ask about that, just take advantage of it. I don't like this. I think the point of writing a story about a philosophy or method should involve testing it to destruction. Not doing so limits the depth.
