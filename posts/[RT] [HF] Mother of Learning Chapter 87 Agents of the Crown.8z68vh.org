If we're talking about foreshadowing, this chapter also presents a divine compulsion that is much more insidious than boring mind control.

***** That's a pretty good point! Add to that the fact that Zorian is trying to figure out divine energies... So you have Zorian trying to solve a different problem which gives him the tools to solve this problem as well.

At the same time, I still think mind magic compulsion is a better story, because we've been leading up to it for so long (Zorian is unfairly amazing at it) and so Zorian using his mind magic powers to solve a problem has more in-story support. Divine energies and compulsions are extremely recent.

****** Doesn't it kinda lend more support to the whole "Zach's being mind controlled" theory tho? QI knows a fair bit about divine magic, while RR does not. RR had shitty mind magic (considering he had a plain old mind blank, instead of a proper active defense), and so far we havent seen QI demonstrate any decent mind magic abilities (as far as I can remember). If Zorian develops some sort of divine sight, he could potentially figure out if Zach is being altered in some way, tho that does leave the question of why QI didn't figure the same out.

******* Along with the question why QI didn't figure it out, it took quite a bit of time for QI to figure out the divine tracker when they robbed the treasury. QI hasn't taken that amount of time with Zach's soul. Secondly, we can assume that RR had 6 restarts to get QI to help him (without arousing his suspicions).... And especially is RR is Veyers (or even that lawyer) then they are super young and will raise his suspicions. I'm not sure if getting his help, and convincing QI to place a divine compulsion on a random teen is possible in that amount of time.

Mind blank is pretty damn powerful on its own though. And, RR had shitty mind magic from the POV of Zorian, who is ridiculously powerful. RR was able to mind probe Zach in Ch 26, that tells you he's no slouch in mind magic (compared to non-Zorian psychics)

**** Another thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is that Zach is *very* eager to learn mind magic... from anyone/spider but Zorian. I imagine at least one part of the compulsion is to encourage him to learn to defend himself to keep the compulsions better hidden, while keeping away from anyone significantly skilled that could detect them.

****** Not actually proof, because he faithfully followed what most mages consider to be the most practical method of mental defence. Conventional wisdom says, get some basic mind shields and then focus on whacking the other guy before he gets through them.

So, if it was the kind of compulsion where you follow a command to your own best efforts, which we've seen before with Zorian dominating the iron beaks, then it would be logical to see Zach's defenses plateauing when he thought they were good enough, and escalating again now that he's working with a powerful mind mage.

This isn't the first time he's sought more defence training since meeting Zorian, either. He reluctantly agreed to let Xvim tutor him. Xvim isn't psychic, so there's no way he can peek by accident.

******* That's fair. However:

that seems a ridiculous method of defence - to only improve in mind magic if you are consistently interacting with a powerful mind mage. If mind magic is THE danger, then it strikes me as rather naive to accept conventional wisdom re safety. It only takes one mind mage that can overpower Zach (tbf, not very many can do so) but Zach accepts drinks from everyone and anyone. It's not like Zach can identify mind mages on sight, like Zorian can.

Also, subverting the iron beaks was easier because quite a few of them were not big fans of Sudomir. How much of their initiative was because they really really hated Sudomir and the invaders?

He didn't /used/ to have the skills to do any damage to Zorian's mind or soul, so he was a stuck in a "if he attacks me, I'm fucked, but if I attack him, he'll just reset and /I'll/ be fucked" situation.

******* I expect the solution will ned up being a modified shifter ritual.

It's been established that shifters are a human soul and an animal soul in one body, that a modified ritual can reverse that and make a wolf into a human-shifter, that the guardian's objection to letting more than one soul out is that it doesn't have ethically sourced bodies for the extra soul and displacing a soul from outside the loop would be murder, and that the main risk of being a shifter is that there's soem cross-talk between the souls.

So, Zack becomes a Zoian shifter, shifter-Zack leaves the loop with both souls. Then shifter Zack tracks down original Zorian and makes original Zorian a loop-Zorian-shifter. least effective result is Zoinan resets to pre-loop except now he has a power-up form with the shaping skills he learns inside the loop, best case scenario the similarity of the souls makes for a clean merge and Zoian gets to exit the loop complication-free. Most likely scenario both loop and original Zorian's personalities co-exist for a bit while loop Zorian's soul overpowers the original. The souls are very similar so this mostly manifests as original Zoian judging loop Zoian for being too reckless and amoral.

*** Evil!Zack is a certainty in my mind at this point.

Here's the narrative as I see it with Red Robe as Zack:

Zack grows up resentful of his family's betrayal by the nobility of Eldemar. His guardian gives away various treasures to placate the royal family, including the Dagger. The reason Red Robe could access the Dagger is he is the rightful owner and could have used political pressure to reclaim it.

Zack and a certain like-minded friend get in with the planned invasion, which already involves numerous high-ranking individuals resentful of Eldemar.

Zack puts on a fake persona at school.

Zack starts the loop a month before the invasion, to ensure it's victory. He uses a simulacrum to trigger the Gate, allowing him to start safe in his room every loop and avoid suspicion. Side effect: The simulacrum exists at the start of every loop and technically has the marker. The simulacrum starts looping alongside Zack.

SimuZack deviates from the original. We've been shown how even a day old Zorian clone will play pranks and get annoyed with the original, and that's with the increased mental connection allowing them to partially remerge afterwards. SimuZack is just as selfish as original Zack and has no hope of surviving even as a memory, so he decides to make sure he's the one out of the loop. He ambushes original Zack and uses his limited mind magic to program him. Unfortunately, he can't exactly soulkill his mana source. So instead he forces new!Zack to play along in the same role he's always played at school, makes sure no-one but him can access Zack's mind, and orders Zack to focus all his efforts on unsubtle power-building magics rather then anything tricky or subtle. I think we've seen this programming slowly decaying, but it was built by someone with plenty of time and an intimate knowledge of the person being edited to make up for magic skill limitations.

The end result is one brainwashed, actual Zack and one unchanged Simulacrum Zack. Simulacrum Zack then discovers there are others looping. He panics, then panics more when, on checking the original's mind finds they're complete unknowns to Zack. With no idea how this is even possible, he bails, confusing the Loop. Zack has now both left and not left the Loop.

Endgame: Zorian and Zack both escape, with Zack and simulacrum Zack being merged in the original body, removing all compulsions and editings applied to him. Who knows how he'll react at that point.

***** Wasn't there a line a while ago, when ZZ were first proving the loop to Silverlake where she had a complete 180 in terms of sass when she actually started taking the idea seriously? I don't remember what it was, but while most people seem to think along the lines of "Well, there's nothing I can really do about this, I guess I'll just go with the flow," Silverlake took the loop as someone killing her over and over again, and took that very personally. I think that all of the reasons she'd be such an old and accomplished mage are also reasons she'd want to try to escape the loop, even the mini-loop ZZ took her into. She's probably afraid of death, she's incredibly driven, and she's very confident in herself. I absolutely think that if she's given the option to sacrifice everything to escape the loop dimension she will take it in an instant, just so that she doesn't die. Also, if she gets out in a way that means there's two Silverlakes, that probably isn't much of a negative to her. Either she avoids her other self or she cooperates with her, but either way, it won't really matter since she doesn't have much contact with the outside world. If that's impossible (I don't remember if it was established or not), and she has to fight her original soul for control of the body, she seems like the type to slaughter her doppelganger in a heartbeat.

All in all, I think she's got nothing to lose and everything to gain, as well as every reason to try to escape the loop. Of course she's nice and helpful for now, she's got a whole roomful of people chasing the same goal as her, but as soon as they stand in her way I think ZZ will find her to be as big a threat as QI.

What's important about the loop isn't time, but the ability to survive your death and steal information without other people knowing. This means that the time loop would let Silverlake do dangerous things like making experimental potions and searching for alchemical ingredients in uncharted areas.

I can see three very strong motives for Silverlake to stay behind: first, her main goal is to make a potion of youth, which requires the grey hunter eggs and a super old salamander. Z&Z is unlikely to help her get those ingredients outside the loop (since they could die fighting the grey hunter, or get killed in the fight against Red Robe before helping her), so she would have to get it herself. A time loop makes learning how to get these ingredients far easier than being ageless, since she can try all kinds of risky plans to get them. Being alone in the time loop makes this even easier since she doesn't have to deal with all the ripple effects from the other time loopers and doesn't have to bother with troublesome requests from Z&Z.

Second: one of the biggest advantages of a time loop is secrecy, as shown by Z&Z extracting information from countless people without anyone finding out. But you can't have this secrecy unless you're alone in the time loop. For example, one of the things Z&Z have been doing is employing countless researchers to research stuff for them, and keeping the knowledge across restarts to advance their research further. Z&Z plan to gift these researchers outside the loop, but definitely wouldn't tell them all about the research. Silverlake could want to do the same thing secretly, without anyone (including Z&Z) knowing what she is researching. But she can't while Z&Z are in the loop: Z&Z are already using up all the researchers, and there's a possibility that whatever researchers she employs may betray her to Z&Z and give them her secret research.

Third, and this is far more evil: so she can stab Z&Z in the back. She is used to being an ancient unrivaled archmage who can defeat or hide from just about everyone else, and here there are suddenly two new archmages who may be as strong as or stronger than her, and know her incredibly well thanks to their time looping shenanigans. Wouldn't she want some kind of leverage over them to at the very least ensure her own safety? Being alone in the time loop is a priceless opportunity for her to get this leverage by attacking the "original" Z&Z copies, who are mere academy students with no skills to defend themselves against her. She can then mind magic the hell out of each loop iteration's "original" Z&Z copies, learning everything about who they were before the time loop. Their goals, their personalities, their principles, the way they view the world, etc. Even if the time loop changes these, the information still gives her a much better understanding of Z&Z than she could ever get through any method other than remaining alone in the time loop.

Also interesting to see that Zach acknowledges that they have lost the moral high ground, and now it's the time to take what they want, hang morality. (the restart didn't end, so we have 17.x still left).

**** Maybe. Remember we rationalists are essentially hoping, even expecting based on the evidence, this very thing to happen in the real world.

We're expecting that once advanced AI begins to earnestly be developed, for the tools to self improve to the point that you have a machine agent that will be able to make as much usable progress in key areas of science and technology as all of the progress we have made since the Enlightenment.

Well, if we don't screw up and it blows up in our faces.

But the goal we need as primates made with deeply flawed bodies and programming code is we need to develop medical science as far as we'd get in about 10,000 years at the present rate of progress. Or all 7 billion people alive today are going to die within their 'natural' lifetimes as well as some unknown number of billions of people who haven't been born yet.

(the number isn't known but I would expect even if this AI singularity never happens for some future generation to arrive at a solution so the number isn't unbounded. A mere 20 billion dead or something, you know, more than who ever died in warfare in probably all of human history)

*** Like clinical research in reality, I suspect that animal experimentation can only go so far before you have to switch to human experimentation. Even with human experimental subjects, there are no guarentees since they only have 1 chance to modify themselves.

In regards to detecting divine energy, I feel that studying the non-human spell formula of the Filigree Sages is the best bet. Ilsa did say that structured magic (chanting & gestures) just limits the full potential of magic. If anyone could learn to sense divine magic, it would be someone not limited to Ikosian-Style magic.

***** I was just thinking that maybe the Ikosian language itself limited mages in what magic they could perform. For example, aranea spell formula seems to be highly compressed compared to human spell formula. In particular, the Filigree Sages use their own unique glyphs for their spell formula & anchor them to spider webs rather than sturdier materials.

Non-human perspectives may introduce a deeper understanding of magic that wasn't obvious from the start. Like how the aranea use mind magic in ways that human mind mages can barely imagine. Just because its possible, it doesn't mean that someone had already thought of it.

That said, it doesn't have to be non-human. The search for knowledge & tricks across Altazia & Koth might also produce similar results. I am just hoping that all of this search for "/low/-/hanging fruit/" (whether its non-human magic or human magic) crystallizes into something revolutionary.

- is ectoplasm new for zorian?

- The hydra didn't understand human speech but knew to kneel

- if he had command of the hydra (kneel, don't attack zorian), why did he have to coax it to return to the orb?

- that the cranium rats weren't able to warn QI about Zorian reveals a couple interesting limitations. 1) they don't have any way of instantly contacting him and 2) they don't have any way of leaving him a message

- zach wasn't willing to let zorian poke around his mind but was ok with spiders doing it? Will the spider say anything if he sees something? Maybe zorian could ask the spider to check some things on the downlow?

- if QI helped red robe permanently join loop, why didn't he just do it to himself too? (unless the help was modifying a temp marker as opposed to creating one from scratch)

- are they attempting to convert the orb to a black room so they have their own personal black room or something else? Even if they create their own personal black room, how are they going to power it up? The recharge time on the others is already substantial and this one should be even longer

He has "command" in the sense of having a loyal pet, not full mental domination. It's like having a pet dog, just because it generally listens to you doesn't mean it'll instantly do anything you say.

Assuming the update rate doesn't pick up substantially that only leaves us 7 or 8 chapters away from the end then. It seems like you'd be hard pressed to wrap up just getting out of the loop even if you do things at a crazy pace for all those chapters, let alone solving things in the real world and wrapping up the dangling threads with the family and all the side characters we've gotten to know.

More power to the author if there's a plan in place and they can pull it off, it just seems like it would be too hasty from the outside at least.

** The black rooms are much more useful for new agents (they would at least double the time they are spending in loop) - looks like they will get to know each other very well in the dull environments of black rooms.

Converting orb into black room is just nice extra. Looks like the main purpose is to milk government institutions dry. By initiating this particular project and throwing a lot of weight/resources behind it - they get and extra teachers with little effort. Krantin seems like a very experienced researcher/geek into dimensionalism - so ZZ should reap some ( a lot of) knowledge in there.

I wonder how they will reap what they saw. While the government will analyze the stuff they seeded around (as per suggestion from Silverlake), the rebels/cult/Ibasa should get hands on the intel as well. It may be hard to get the additional research done by various organizations, but hey - at least it provides enough distractions.

Zorian should stab hydra with dagger ( to see the effect). This is to verify if they need to kill the sulrothum high priest or it is just enough to steal the other knife (besides ring) to control the sand worm. Also Zach to allow borrowing hydra for one cycle (to allow Zorian one month of a very close interaction with hydra / learning the stuff). Not allowing for that would be just author artificially limiting Zorians grow rate.

The mind magic and Zach/ aranea is interesting topic as well. After Zach bullies them into teaching him, I'm pretty sure the teacher would take a peek at his mind and discover/remove that compulsion/anything else left at his mind without asking Zach first to unravel some hidden memory/plot advancement.

what are the chances that the frog he defeated in chapter 37 to assist/rescue Yellow Cavern Guardians is the toad they are looking for? Coming back to it and revisiting the fungus plantation would possibly reveal another secret behind it. IIRC, the web just killed Zorian after he defeated the monster - there's some shady secret in cavern/location.

Too bad it's another 3 weeks (if the chapter is light) or 4 for the next chapter to come up. So much stuff going on in background, so little covered. So much ground to cover... This is going to take awhile.

**** Yeah, the Yellow Cavern Guardians were basically utterly terrified of Zorian at that point. Perhaps distrofijus was confused because the story kind of skipped ahead to the next restart?

**** Ok, it was awhile back and yep, I might have forgotten this/didn't read far enough. But there's definitely something fishy with that cavern. They are most likely guarding the cavern for with the secret (and that's why Yellow Cavern Guardian Matriarch refused his help when he offered it to fight the monster).

My current theory is that is related to Ishmali Reservoirs we've learned about on latest chapter. Since they were created somewhere in the desert, one of the problems is getting the water into them. And there are additional pocket dimensions/exits to Reservoirs to fill the with water from different continent/whatever. One of those reservoirs is filled from the underground where Yellow Cavern Guardians are living in. That's how the toad appeared in the neighborhood and there are some other relics in the cavern left by the creators of reservoirs.
