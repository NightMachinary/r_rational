I've read a few rational/rationalist fics, with varying degrees of enjoyment. /The Waves Arisen/ is a recent favourite, for example. However, I just cannot stand /HPMOR/. The characters, the author's tone - I just do not dig it.

Is /HPMOR/ generally considered to be representative of this genre, or is it considered to have teething pains and not really represent where the genre went later on?

EDIT: Can you fig it, sucka?


** I'd call [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolian Man]] the best representative of rational fic, since it has all the best features of that genre, while avoiding the flaws of HPMOR. Please go read that one first, especially if you liked 'The Waves Arisen'

HPMOR is exceptionally preachy, for rationalfic, for instance. I'd say that rationalfic usually strives to copy HPMOR's good side while avoiding all the flaws in it. On the other hand, i'm bad at noticing preachyness unless it's something i've already heard and disagreed with.

** Someone once described the levels of rationality in fiction:

1. Characters are not rational. They act as the story would require, rather than how people would act.
2. Characters are thinking. They act in a coherent, thought-out manner to achieve their goals (unless they're supposed to be dumb). The story results from the interactions of these attempts, with a garnish of Plot.
3. Characters are "rational". They are aware of the science and study of human psychology and apply that knowledge.
4. Story attempts to teach rationality. An Aesop's Fable, but for the science and study of human psychology.

Most pop fiction is Level 1. Harry Potter, Twilight, most superhero movies. Some popular fiction is between 1 and 2 - there's stuff that is definitely there just because story, but after and around that, the characters react with thought - Star Trek, latest Star Wars, most of the new Marvel superhero movies, Daemon.

Some extremely popular fiction is Level 2. Game of Thrones, Name of the Wind, The Lies of Lock Lamora, Nexus, The Martian, most classic science fiction (Herbert, Asimov, Niven, Heinlein). The "humanist" classic sci fi is between 2 and 1, because there's more Plot Conceit in order to put the characters in the desired situation within which they react, but they still react like people - Phillip K Dick, Sturgeon, Vonnegut.

Most of the web fiction (fan or otherwise) recommended by this sub is Level 2 - Worm, Pact, (Twig is edging into 3 because Sylvester, but edges back towards 1 because Frankenscience), Shadows of the Limelight.

Very little fiction is Level 3, all of it recommended by this sub. I think I've heard of one published novel that's Level 3 - it got recommended in the last couple weeks. Metropolitan Man, Lighting up the Dark, Luminosity, etc. Some of this fiction edges towards 4; Origin of the Species, HPMOR.

The only stuff that I'm aware of that's "truly" Level 4 - given that you now have to sacrifice the range of story that you can tell so that it's a fable - is the Bayesian Conspiracy shorts that Yudkowsky has written.

(PS - Feel totally free to challenge me on any of the level assignments. Either I didn't think it through enough, or I welcome the discussion)

**** I would probably say the same thing for HPMOR. The whole premise of Scientist!Harry was basically lost after the first twenty-something chapters, and there was less and less science after that point. And by the end of the story the takeaway message was clearly that knowledge can be very destructive and dangerous and therefore we should not "open doors that should not be opened" curiosity killed the cat sort of stuff. Not a very rational message. While the author has gone on record saying that this was not what he intended to say and definitely not intended as a main takeaway message, the story reinforced it with the events of the ending as well as a lot of stuff building up to it. For instance, how Harry ended up [[#s][spoiler]].

To be honest, I don't think it takes a rational genius to understand the reasons for the statute of secrecy. Someone with sufficient training in relevant fields who had the training to learn about and understand other cultures and how and why they function the way they do could have understood why the statute of secrecy existed, and why getting rid of it without a viable alternative would be catastrophic, even if they didn't have any training in rationality.

And while the average person, put in Harry's shoes might not accomplish much, they also wouldn't do so badly that they nearly destroy the world either. When a "rational" protagonist is so irrational that even though they are super smart they still miss obvious things like Quirrel being evil (which Hermione got right away despite her not having rationality training like Harry had), when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's /stupidity/ nearly gets the world destroyed, when the story is preachy (the preachiness in the story discourages questioning it or figuring out what's going on, and the severe lack of science doesn't help), you have to wonder whether it really qualifies as a rational fic. I would say HPMOR has hints of rationality, but does't really qualify as a rational story. It has a lot of potential to become more rational with a decent amount of editing and rewriting, but from what I recall the author published it while it was basically a first draft. A lot of the views that HPMOR presents are views that a lot of rational/rationalist people have, but merely agreeing with rational/rationalist views isn't enough for the story itself to qualify as rational fiction.

That being said, it does technically meet all the criteria on the sidebar, somehow, despite all the issues described above.

That's a fair assessment, though I think it's easy to lose that point in the way that Harry often seems to think he has everything figured out. He's so sure of himself almost all the time, and the plot usually rewards his actions and beliefs. So it's often difficult to determine what the author's intentions are in showing us these often flawed points of views.

In many cases a later event will come and show that Harry actually wasn't right about something, and you'll realize the author intended that. But often times the immediate pay off of Harry's self-righteousness is more weighty than his reflections on being wrong.

And it seems even at the end that he never really evolves beyond wanting to tackle all the world's problems on his own. And he still seems to trust his own judgement beyond that of those with many years of experience over him even after seeing how flawed his own judgement has been in the past.

I think that is really my main problem with the story and it seems to be a theme with lots of rationalist fiction. It's the story of one flawed man trying to be rational all on his own, instead of realizing that big problems are often better solved through collaboration.

Note: there are some scenes in HPMOR that highlight that Harry's unwillingness to rely on others is a weakness, not a strength, but it seems as if he never puts the lesson into practice.

Ch.119 is the one where Harry is finally learning to cooperate and delegate.

But I do fully agree with you that this is /very late indeed/. A lot of Harry's mistakes are called cleverness, or at least not explicitly called stupidity, for most of the story.

Actually, I think this /was/ part of the intended message: "the simple, obvious, boring hypothesis is most often the correct one; so while Dark (Slytherin) Is Not Evil /sounds/ like an interesting trope subversion /in a story/, if you actually meet someone obviously Dark (Slytherin), they /are/, most probably, Evil (Dark Wizard), and you should stop rationalizing away evidence that they're not just because you fanboy over their awesomecoolness."

I mean, the guy /is/ prone to writing lengthy essays on how in the real-world, the truth is usually simple and we call things boring because they're actually highly probable.

The problem was that in stories, ie: fanfics, awesomecoolness overrides almost everything else, so the /readers/ were fanboying over Quirrell /more/ than the characters were, which made the message fall flat.

I remember [[/r/hpmor]] collectively palming its face and going, "Oh OF COURSE Quirrell was evil! He was Lord fucking Voldemort, after all! How did we /ever/ get fooled into thinking he was /merely/ a 'Light-side Slytherin'!?" And there was much joy among the Sunshine Regiment that day, for we had been right all along.

** HPMOR is a tract for "rationalism".

Different people have different ideas about what constitutes "rational" fiction. Some consider "rationalist" and "rational" to be part of the same spectrum, synonyms, or separate genres. Some require the characters to have rationality or rationalism as core goals, others just want the world to have "hard SF" levels of internal consistency. That last is where I find myself. I consider /Worm/ rational, for example, because the irrationality of the characters is driven by a rationally derived plot point that's a core part of the universe, and characters are realistic and as rational as they can be within the bounds of that constraint. Rationality, in /Worm/, is a useful tool that is likely to lead to a successful outcome.

"Worm isn't a rational work, it's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that operates with a set of laws and with a set of characters which are inherently irrational in order to create a superhero universe.

******* Keeping in mind this is untestable metaphysics...

Assuming as well that time isn't a flat circle, if there's a metaphysical "factory" that produced the universe, then the two reasonable assumptions about it are either it worked once or it's still going. If it stopped at some arbitrary integer, which is any (including 1 IMO) that implies it was stopped, it implies there was a choice or inbuilt possibility of stoppage, and those qualities and characteristics imply some type of god, even if god in this case is a computer scientist deciding there will be 2^{24} universes in the simulation.

I believe I posed the issue with knowing about triggers in the IRC and the answer, and I'm pretty sure this was word of god in some form, was that people didn't understand trigger events and that was at least in part because Dragon was deleting such information off the net.

This has reminded me of another issue regarding power types. Wildbow says, and this may even be in-story, that powers are so categorically combat-focused because the entities want to promote conflict. This is why healing is described as appearing incidentally, almost always as a side-effect of a different power.

Well, healing existing as a power at all means the entities recognize its utility, but in maybe the biggest instance of fallacious reasoning/historical ignorance, Wildbow says utility shards don't promote conflict.

Dude, the more bombs, bullets, and guns you can make, the more likely you are to go to war. The better your soldiers, the easier they are to train, equip, and heal from injury, the more likely you are to go to war. Parahumans do what? Build better weapons and armor, heal your soldiers back from crippling and life-threatening injuries and they're your best, most powerful soldiers.

Imagine the USA has the first superman package trigger.

The plane explodes, he triggers. He has the flight to save himself from hitting the ground, he has the durability to withstand the heat, shrapnel, and pressure wave, and he has the strength to tear himself from the wreckage as it's still falling, and now he realizes he can save his team. He goes enemy plane to enemy plane, breaking off wings or ripping pilots out of their seats. He's faster than planes, can withstand missiles, and has the strength to literally rip planes in half. How belligerent does the US become knowing that for the time being, they have absolutely perfect air superiority? What about when they realize they can use him to apprehend anyone they want?

Same goes for tinkers and healers, anyone or anything that helps the war effort. The more belligerent a country can be almost always becomes how belligerent a company /will/ be.

Hang on, though. I asked you "why does anything less than infinite universes imply a creator" and you responded with "assume there's a factory that creates universes...." That factory would be a creator, right? Aren't you making a circular argument here?

#+begin_quote
  then the two reasonable assumptions about it are either it worked once or it's still going. If it stopped at some arbitrary integer, which is any (including 1 IMOesn't require intelligence to be applied. it implies there was a choice or inbuilt possibility of stoppage, and those qualities and characteristics imply some type of god, even if god in this case is a computer scientist deciding there will be 224 universes in the simulation.
#+end_quote

Just to make sure we're on the same page here: my definition of "a god" requires self-awareness as a necessary but not sufficient element. I'm not sure "something stopped working" requires that a self-aware being be involved -- as an example, fires burn out from lack of fuel regardless of human involvement.

I agree with your general thesis -- countries with more supers would likely become more aggressive. I would nitpick, however, that one cape with FISS powers does not provide perfect air superiority, simply because she can only be in one place at a time.

********* If the number of universes is an integer greater than or equal to 2, then the metaphysical force that allowed for universes to exist applied itself a number of times and then ceased. I don't think a metaphysical force can simply "cease" unless a decision was made for it to cease, and decisions require agency, and agency requires intelligence, and an intelligence who can affect a metaphysical force is god. The fire comparison isn't apt unless the metaphysical force is a physical force, like a computer that is simulating those universes, but that just draws back to my point anyway.

For that matter, the same applies even if there is only 1 universe, but I'm not intuitively apprehensive of "The metaphysical force allowed 1 universe to come into being and then ceased to exist," while I am intuitively apprehensive of "The metaphysical force allowed (integers > 1) universes to come into existence and then ceased to exist."

Why? You're asserting this but I see no clear evidence for why I should believe it. Also, could you provide an example of a nonphysical force? Or a clarification about where the factory / god came from before there was a multiverse? Or what it was inhabiting if not part of a multiverse?

But, sure, I'll roll with your "fire isn't apt" for a moment, for the sake of discussion. How about "Antimatter annihilates with matter, but only once."

But generally HPMOR is definitely above average in that dimension; you just need to try some things and see if you like them

** I think it depends a lot on the source material, in the case of fanfic.

HPMOR deviates hard from the canon flavor, and yes, becomes ‘preachy.' TBH I read it mostly for the audacity of the gambits.

/Lighting Up the Dark/ (Naruto) is a very fine example of rational fic that doesn't end up being preachy --- mostly because it is about the process of /becoming/ a rational thinker. In it, it is /commonplace/ that the main characters get schooled by their betters. It has the amazing gambits of HPMOR, without the annoying protagonist.

My own work /The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake/ stays very true to the source material of /Steven Universe/ --- to date there isn't a character characterizable as rational/ist/ in it. (Will come at a later date--- whoops, spoilers!) Mostly it is some people with a lot of emotional baggage who talk it out like reasonable folks, and try to save the world as best as they can.

** I love HPMOR, but I understand disliking the style. After finishing Lighting Up The Dark, whose writing style was heavily inspired by HPMOR but was a poor imitation, the flaws were made clear to me. It allowed me to see what people disliked about the style, while still being able to enjoy it in its original form.

I haven't read much rational fic, but the entire time I was going through Lighting Up The Dark, I was thinking of Time Braid and how good it was. I highly recommend Time Braid. Not exactly "rational fic" by definition of the subreddit, but I feel that the definition set out by the subreddit is contoured to HPMOR, and restricts the genre.

Time Braid has none of the problems you'd have with HPMOR, even the underlying writing structure is different. Characters are still highly intelligent, but they aren't /trying/ to be. They just are. Characters use logic and rationality to solve problems and experiment with their powers bringing them to their logical conclusions, without speaking like textbooks and using modern day terminology which would feel out of place in such a setting.

I don't know if this genre has been weened off of HPMOR yet, but it is still in it's infancy and is experiencing its growing pains. It will grow out of it eventually, i'm sure.

However, my own comment would be that you familiarize yourself with the differences between the genre of a rational fiction, a rationalist fiction and the particular qualities you like/dislike when reading a work of fiction.
