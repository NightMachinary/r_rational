** The translator for this series has commented that they're getting tired of translating it, here: [[http://mangastream.com/r/wsjac/%2322/3795/3]]

I don't think the author is enjoying the series as much as we are. If they drop it, I hope we can find someone willing to translate for us. This has seriously been a highlight of my weeks for a couple months now.

*** Translation is a fickle business, but mangastream will probably find someone else to translate if they flake out.

Hell, it's only translation and not something hard like redrawing. If they wanted, they could just post the raws on /a/ and they would get translations within the hour. Sometimes better than the ones they have currently.

** Huh, now we see to be getting an idea of where's Emma's specialty lies in. Empathy, but more than just understanding feelings into being able to predict how a given personality is likely to act in a situation. It's really cool to see her 'out-smart' Ray and Norman in this chapter for once.

** I wonder what Emma would even do if she knew what Ray is trying? She was 'pissed' this chapter at Ray, but she still wants to save everybody. So her options are limited.

Maybe on the day of the escape she'll make Ray go along with the escape whether he wants to or not, making it impossible for him to back out? If she takes away his ability to choose sides, then he'll have to help her with her plan no matter how impossible it is or how much he doesn't like it, because it's his only option.

I don't really know what she could do to put him into that situation though.

*** I think she already at least suspects it .
