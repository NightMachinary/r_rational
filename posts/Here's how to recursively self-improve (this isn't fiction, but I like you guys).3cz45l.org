** I know this is going to be extremely difficult to face, but you appear to be posting word salad. If you are on drugs, and I am asking you this for your own good, /please stop/. If you are not on drugs, please, again, for your own good, /please/ see a psychiatrist.

If you are remotely capable of comprehending Hutter's work when you're brought back to reality, then there is /far/ too much excitement in store for you to let this illness take your mind away from you.

Please, see a doctor. It will be hard, especially because some of the things you'll say will sound insane /besides/ the word-salad. But word salad is a symptom of severely life-impacting schizophrenia, or some other form of psychotic breakdown.

Please, /please/ see a doctor.

*** Ooh, a challenge. OK:

You agree that my post appears like word salad to you. That means that it seems like "random noise." Yes?

Now recall what "random noise" really means: It's a uniform distribution over some closed interval.

But, does "random" really mean "totally structureless?" Or is it just that there's a structure that we're not seeing? Specifically, a structure that is /infinitely self-similar/, so that when you look at it from far away, it "looks" uniform.

What does it mean to be "infinitely self-similar"?

Recall the idea of "recursion," or "recurrence relations." These say that you can describe two or more equations /recursively/, for example as follows for the Fibonnaci sequence:

F_0 = 0

F_1 = 1

F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2).

This "inductively defines" the full sequence, F_N.

Now, how can we make F_N into an infinitely self-similar sequence? Because if we can do that, we can define the structure of "random noise," that is, a "uniform distribution on any closed set," /inductively/ or /implicitly/ by specifying particular recurrence relations /of recurrence relations/.

Now recall Tarski's undefinability of truth, as well as Godel's theorems.

They say that "you cannot define 'truth' precisely within the same system that you are describing." To translate,

You cannot define an arbitrary set infinitely precisely.

However,

This is /not/ the same thing as saying:

#+begin_example
  It is therefore in principle impossible to describe a particular set S uniquely.
#+end_example

In fact, these theorems do /not/ say this.

That is, we actually /can/ describe /any particular set we wish/ by an /arbitrarily large, but finite/ set of relations.

OK, then how do we do this?

Back again to the idea of recurrence. It is well-known in computer science that the exact relation between various complexity classes is not well known. That is, we don't really know whether P is or is not NP.

Yet it appears that, in physical reality, P is in fact equivalent /probabilistically/ to NP. View:

[[http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/6/e1500031]].

Now, you might think, maybe they've made a mistake in their methods. Surely this can't be right. But maaybe... Is there really a possibility that this might be true?

Now, if you are doing inference approximately correctly, the above argument should give you /some/, but not /unlimited/ confidence that the above argument might be valid. Consider the consequences if it is:

1. All problems immediately become solvable recursively. That is,
2. If we can construct a recursive procedure that we can show, by recursive reasoning about its structure, will converge in the limit of infinite computation to /any function/ with probability 1, we will have a constructive proof of 1.
3. If 2. can be done, it follows that /there are no coincidences/, that is, /everything is, in fact, related in some way./

I provide the construction of this procedure in the PDF (shared by mega.co.nz), the link to which is given in the original post.

(Consider: the filetype PDF /just so happens/ to have /the exact same acronym/ as "Probability Distribution Function." Again, if the conjunction of (1-3) is true, we would have a theory that /explains exactly why this is the case, to a degree of precision which is finite, but large enough to predict, with probability 1, that this would necessarily be the case./ That is, it wouldn't be a coincidence.)

Now, consider the /overall/ structure of the above argument. Is this not approximately similar to just the procedure which it argues to have constructed?

I sincerely hope you will be able to follow this chain of reasoning, and thus ascend, as have I.

**** I'm afraid that you've misunderstood. Word salad isn't necessarily completely random nonsense.

Your behavior, I'm afraid, is consistent with the use of psychedelic drugs. You have experienced something that feels like profound insight. Unfortunately, it isn't actually insight, but rather a breakdown of the user's ability to delineate the separation between concepts.

Regardless of whether you're under the influence of psychedelics or not: The association you see between these concepts, and the recursion you're experiencing, is in fact false. You have established a falsehood as a theorem, and any logical reasoning you derive from it will be necessarily flawed.

My suggestion to you is to make yourself comfortable and focus on pleasant things for the time being, and once your head clears, either discontinue drug use, discontinue Reddit use while tripping (though kudos for having the presence of mind to make a burner account), or seek help if neither of the former are relevant or desirable.

***** Indeed, my theory precisely predicts that there will exist people with this view, and you are entitled to it.

However, the eventual consequence of this is that I have the ability to predict that, with probability 1, you will eventually die.

Whereas, by following the procedure which I argue everyone should follow, I derive as a consequence that everyone who follows this procedure can avoid death indefinitely.

In short:

#+begin_example
  Come with me if you want to live.
#+end_example

It indeed turns out that it is precisely true, as a consequence of this procedure, that I /am/ from the future, in a certain sense.

/I am telling you that you will die with certainty if you do not take me seriously./

Further,

/I derived this recursively as a unique set of consequences defined by a finite set of initial recurrence relations./

/There are exactly 5 propositions in this set./

The correct way to view this is as the set:

(CCCC)U, which is:

#+begin_example
  The unique indefinitely long continuation of computation of a complete
  and consistent initial, finite, set of recurrence relations closed under the
  stationary (Unitary) relation U.
#+end_example

In brief, we get to this by /avoiding, for an undefinable number of attempts, the computation of any procedure which eventually halts./

That is, the precise inverse of the Halting Problem. (Which we know is uncomputable.)

Currently the difficulty bar for understanding your theory seems very high and would likely take much work, which many of us are wary to do for an uncertain pay-off. I think we'd all feel much more comfortable trying to understand your theory if you took the time to establish with us that you were of sound mind and body beforehand.\\
The most basic way would be to confirm in several days time that you are still certain on your theory. Checking with medical professionals and friends, double-checking medications etc. would all go a long way as well.\\
PS: Perhaps try letting your mind work on it in the background during that time, to see if you can come back to it with a new angle and approach to explaining? The current one, as noted, is rather confusing.\\

********* In what way are my posts not arguments?

Recall the /Curry-Howard Isomorphism/ which says

#+begin_example
  There exists a unique bijective map between computer programs and any number (but not all) of equivalent mathematical proofs.
#+end_example

I will now argue that my initial post is a completely specific argument, by constructing a specification for a computer program which will evaluate ('it'(

Suppose (the initial state is related by a unique bijective map (a functional relation) to the following literal value( '[[https://mega.co.nz/#!6hBQkKDb!_5sDe7r-O86qqgDK7M9cBiyNAkwaFW7BjuO5lh7NYdE']])

Then( that initial state(is approachable by( a finitely long sequence of strictly finite transformations of /some particular/ initial finite set)

(It turns out that the process is just like "finding out your true name." Mine is my reddit username.)

The exact description (to the level of detail I can give you) that led to this universe was the following(

'M'editations (on( O(M (breed (like (rabbits( whose( pom(pom( tails( we (wave (in( excitement (at( the( British( who( made( an (empire( with( unstoppable (momentum (that( eventually( met) its )complement( the( immovable) object) and )instead )of )fighting) (they( interpret(...(GOTO ('M')))(

  *Brace matching*, also known as *bracket matching* or *parentheses matching*, is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting][syntax highlighting]] feature of certain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][text editors]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment][integrated development environments]] that highlights matching sets of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket][braces]] (square brackets, curly brackets, or parentheses) in languages such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)][Java]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B][C++]] that use them. The purpose is to help the programmer navigate through the code and also spot any improper matching, which would cause the program to not compile or malfunction. If a closing brace is left out, for instance, the compiler will not know that the end of a block of code has been reached. Brace matching is particularly useful when many nested [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_statement][/if/ statements]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_loop][program loops]], etc. are involved.

******* Yes.

Further, my brain has converged to approximate this structure in the initial finite case. This means I can wield the power of analogy with complete mastery. I can simply read the mathematical structure of anything if it can be related somehow to English letters. I give the example of the mathematical structure of DNA, GATTACA, in the paper.

It turns out that the sentiment:

"A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs"

Is a provable truth. And, actually constructing the full proof yourself gives you the power to "directly intuit", in the same way you intuit what you see as "objects" like "chair" or "desk," relations between proofs.

This is the quite literal process of "transcending the infinite series of cardinals." That is, /eventually/, with probability 1, computing the /closure/ of the infinite series of cardinals.
