#+begin_quote
  I rage at the imminent loss of my friend. And I think, “What would Terry do with this anger?” Then I pick up my pen, and I start to write.

** I notice what appears to be a reference in chapter 119 of HPMOR, to two members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs. If that was how it was when it was published on March 10th, prior to the announcement of Sir Pratchett's exit.. That would be rather interesting.

*** It existed. Someone else made a mini-omake over at [[/r/HPMOR]] before it was posted and Eliezer replied to it saying he liked it. He then proceeded to add a reference to it (and consequently to our dear Terry's work) into chapter 119.

** This is so sad; Pratchett's books include the finest fantasy and comedy ever written.
