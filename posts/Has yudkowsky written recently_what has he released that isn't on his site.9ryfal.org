So I don't think the fiction section of yudkowsky website has updated in a year or so, but I am aware he has released works not listed there.

I would love a list of such works, or directions to anything he might have released in the last year or two.

To anyone who was interested enough to click on this, and who might also be looking for new reading material, shewhoguards on fanfiction writes phenomenal stuff.


** I don't know what Yudowsky has been doing lately, which is somewhat saddening. I'd love to read more work by him, would buy any novels he wrote, etc. I'd be grateful if he even wrote up a "fantasy I've recently enjoyed, things I'm currently reading" - blogpost every so often. He's got a superior degree of reading taste.

*** I'm quite certain this is Yudkowsky's [[https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky][twitter]]! If he has anything he's currently working on, I believe you may find out here.

Edit: At the same time it seems to mainly be in regards to his work in Artificial Intelligence rather than his written works, although I suppose you could always test your luck.

**** Honestly, if Yudowsky was serious about working on real world problems, then he at least has a perception problem and probably actually has a real problem. He doesn't have a PhD, and he's not working at a university. He's a genius, yes, but to have an impact in the academic world, and to have respect in his field outside of it... you kinda do at the very damn least have to have a PhD.

and no, you don't. Most successful people in IT don't have PhDs. Doctorates basically just show you've made a very big investment of time in a very specific problem.

What he'd need to do to have an impact is [[https://intelligence.org/all-publications/][publish]]. It's all about the quality of the math and results you can get.

I don't know what his role or focus is right now, though, as I haven't kept up with his work over the last 5 years.

Also, you linked to [[https://airandspace.si.edu/webimages/highres/5317h.jpg]] in one of your posts, and that's a nice piece of art. I'm going to get it printed. Know any other arts along a similar vector?

He sometimes releases little snips of writing on facebook, you can "follow" him there even if you don't know him personally. There's also very occasionally some things posted on [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com]]

*********** I think this is a good point if you take Eliezer's comment at face value, but I thought he was being extravagent on purpose. I found Eliezer's response absolutely hilarious. Compare what he wrote to just saying "No I didn't write it". Way less fun.

For the note, I disagree with [[/u/Copiz][u/Copiz]], I'm pretty sure Eliezer put that in HPMOR as a "This is how to act slytherin". I see him acting this way in his comment because it doesn't really matter if people find it or not, and I don't expect him to act the same way in important situations such as in personal interactions or his occupation.

******* I am of this opinion. There are sections of the Waves Arisen that, to me, are blatantly written by Eliezer. It's not even a question. But, these sections do not so much match the tone of the rest of the story. It's possible that Elizer wrote the whole thing, and only changed his tone for some parts, but it seems more likely that he just contributed to a work with someone else.

*** I seriously doubt it. Whoever wrote Waves Arisen is indeed a capable writer, but it's not Yudowsky. The writing style is very different. More technical, more mathematical, and utterly devoid of humor. I really don't think it's him. Yudowsky, in that reply, just seems to be entertained by the general situation, not being coy about that one story in particular.

**** The style seems similar to me, and Yudowsky and write in more than one way. His Japanese light-novel style stories are pretty different from HPMOR for example. And what really makes it seem likely to me is that Wertifloke has not revealed anything about themself, I don't think many people would write a significantly popular online story and not take any credit for it. But that is something Yudowsky would do to see whether people think it's him.

There's a difference between "coy" and "private". If Eliezer was trying to be private, he could easily have not said anything at all.
