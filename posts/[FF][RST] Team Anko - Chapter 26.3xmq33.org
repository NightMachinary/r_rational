** I notice that Naruto didn't put any restrictions on how long Kurama could take control for this time. Of course Kurama is an ancient and powerful being with his own goals and desires so probably nothing to worry about, right [[/u/eaglejarl]] ?

***** Do you /really/ want to know?

I'll give you this much of a hint -- consider who's involved:

- A couple dozen Sound ANBU. Fanatically loyal to Orochimaru.
- Anko. A high-A-rank ninja. Smart, vicious, and absolutely /done/ with anything that gets between her and getting her kids home...even if it means her death.
- Orochimaru. Rationalist. Psychopath. Crazy prepared. One of the best, if not /the/ best ninja alive, he's more than a match for any non-Kage and can give most of the Kages a run for their money.
- Kurama. In terms of raw chakra he is by far the most powerful being alive. A bijuu with literally billions of years experience at manipulating chakra and a thousand years of watching human history unfold, he's been trapped inside one person after another for almost that entire time...and now he's out. With no restrictions on what he can and can't do, so long as he protects Team Anko.

******* Points of order:

1. Orochimaru fought Itachi at a handicap, needing him alive, while also being in a weakening body in need of replacement.
2. Itachi has a powerful bloodline that eventually evolves into literal godhood.
3. Orochimaru still escaped that battle alive.
4. None of this is cannon to Team Anko.
5. [[/u/eaglejarl]] only said that he is /one of the best,/ leaving the possibility of being the very best open.
6. [[/u/eaglejarl]] is the author, therefor his word is WoG.

** I'm surprised that the Kurama rebuild did not (yet) reveal some kind of Chakra sense. Given nine tails is a spirit creature, I'd expect that to be part of its native perceptions, and something it would want. We know several special eye bloodlines exist, so it seems possible.

** I believe I found a typo in ch 13

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/13/Team-Anko]]

"police... kunai" -> "polish... kunai"

unless policing has another meaning, like keeping clean of or something, similar to how someone might police a neighborhood?

EDIT: Well, I'm seeing it used later to refer to picking up kunai, so it's probably just a word I'm not familiar with.

*** Yep. It's a military term. e.g. "Police up the barracks" means to pick up all the junk and tidy things up.

I had the same issue in 2YE. I wrote "the undead had invested GrÇ«fhamr". I got a bazillion people gleefully writing in to tell me that that should be "infest". Nope. Infest would mean they were inside; invest is a military term meaning "to surround a town or other objective".
