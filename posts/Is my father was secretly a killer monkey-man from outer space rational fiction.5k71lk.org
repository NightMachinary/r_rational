** I removed this in the interests of A) keeping discussion confined to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5jvd89/d_outsider_viewpoint_why_rational_fiction_is/][this thread]], B) helping some of the worst tribalism to die down, and C) because this submission is not rational fiction and there's a limit on how many discussions we want on the front page of this subreddit at one time.

** Context: mfwsakmmfos is a fanfiction by Earthscorpion, crossing over NGE and DBZ, with Gendo as a low class, yes, killer monkey man from outer space.

Now, the reason that I'm asking this question is this post:[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7532109/]] From the recent 'why rational!fic is inheritly bad thread. In it, Earthscorpion claims that since his fic fits all the requirements of a rational!fic, the classification is meaningless. Thoughts?
