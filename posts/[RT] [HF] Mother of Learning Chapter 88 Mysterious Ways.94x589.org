** Well the Sulrothom thing was fucking hilarious. They should really check with QI if he got a similar visit, and if he kept the angel as a pet.

Slaying a Dragon huh? I'm betting there's a major subversion in there somewhere, but everything we know about them so far matches up to it's behavior, so I don't know. At least Princess will finally get some good exercise.

A visit by an angel to the Eldemar royalty could explain how red robe got the dagger so easily while still beeing close to the cult and having access to the robe and QI crown.

So unlikely they would tell him anything really.

This is supported by her referencing Zorian as cockroach and thrashing him - hunting behaviour - as well as always having another trick up her sleeve and being described as swarming him in these incidents. She is also red robe because reasons. Her master plan is to escape and cause the overwrite process of the gate to turn every.living entity on the planet into one giant swarmmind with her at the head.

Some of that may even be factual.

****** My best guess is that the staff is either a shaping aid (the typical use of a staff for a wizard) or grants psychic abilities, as it is one of the more useful abilities that could be given to a human, lately I have been wondering whether Zach's huge mana reserves are more useful than Zorian's psychic nature, and I don't really think they are. Zorian is likely the best human mind mage on the planet at this point and he reached that level in 8~ years (although through the use of Infinite resources and some rather unscrupulous behaviour), if that is worthy of being a divine gift, I don't know what is.

******* One of the things which bothers me about zorians mind magic is that he hasn't taken the obvious advantage of augmenting his mental /senses/ beyond the single incident of creating a reverse direction eye.

That's all Z? come on man! create a device which is /constantly/ divining 5-60 seconds into the future (whatever seems reasonable to the author) and dumping it into your head. Now /that/ is a power up. At first it will be horribly distracting, but eventually it will become second nature...and instinctive short term divination will instantly turn him into a power house combat mage on the same order as Zack.

Innate mind magic is /entirely/ around him being able to process information that is dropped into his mind, it's what they basically explained what being 'open' as being. He doesn't need to augment his mind, only build a spell/device which constantly does the divination and drops the info in his mind, just like every other divination spell for information he is currently using. The big change is leaving it on all the time this will quickly (mostly) force his brain to make it natural and automatic to use.

Heck, if we could just get the information dumped into our /own/ head, it would work the same way. This is the same principle behind human echolocation, the tongue echolocation device, the remote controlled robot arm, etc etc. The brain is remarkably plastic on what it considers 'itself'.

********** There's a doctor (V. S. Ramachandran? Maybe?) That works with people that have lost various senses. One lady he worked with had lost her sense of balance due to inner ear damage caused by inappropriately prescribed medicine so he modified a hard hat with two accelerometers that were wired up to an electrode array that is worn on the tongue. When the head tipped forward or back the front or back of the array would activate, or side to side the corresponding side of the array would activate. The lady didn't even need excessive training with the device, her brain recognized the information as relating to balance almost immediately and she could stand and walk normally just minutes after pitting on the helmet even though the signal was coming from her tongue rather than her inner ear.

If we could wire into the brain safely and easily, with low damage/rejection, the things we could pull off would be amazing.

We have all ready done the equivalent of telepathy wiring two peoples brains together, so extra senses are just the tip of the iceberg. For zorian, who has the special ability to be /better/ at normal humans at processing outside information dumped directly into the brain? yeah, he should /definitely/ be building all kinds of divination devices that run non stop. the power of that is hard to explain, especially when you are talking about things like magic and the possibilities involved there.

*** I think the biggest issue is that there isn't any real drama, nor stakes; Besides the threat of soul attacks. It feels as if the story will really start once they leave the time loop.

They come out of the time loop suddenly much more powerful, which could attact a lot of unwanted attention, and then they'd be able to interact with the world with actual consequences.

QI can kick ass once, but nothing can really challenge the time loopers in the long run if they are careful enough.

The only challenge left is the time crunch. Can they get out before the loop runs out of steam?

*** "Maybe that's the consequence of the characters growing too strong for interesting and believable conflict?"

some of the best chapters had nothing to do with conflict. I enjoy the exploration and discovery and growth. Getting out of the loop is secondary to me, I wish we could just continue to explore this world. For instance if they spent an episode figuring out how to get the lizard mage to teach them, that would be fantastic. Or visiting the dragon and going through all her treasures.

**** Hate to say it, but epic fights aren't the author's strong side. At least that's my opinion. So I agree, the first two arcs were the best because Zorian was keeping a low profile, and the chapters tended to be more personal. There was a lot of growth potential, both magic and personal. And a lot of things weren't going Zorian's way. We still get some of that when a particularly strong character appears, i.e. the lich's public persona and Silverlake, but most of the time ZnZ just plow through and there isn't any banter.

***** At this point in the story Zorian has access to enough tools that he's able to quickly learn new things as well. Early on we got to see him get better, now it's just a matter of where he placed his attention. He doesn't struggle to convince powerful people to teach him anymore because he's either got the skills to prove himself to them or the money to pay for it.

**** Yeah, I'd actually argue that the focus on ramping and conflict is the biggest issue more recently; the best parts of the story were back in arc 1, when Zorian was fumbling around poking at the edges of the time loop and seeing how people react to various changes and learning to care about others through it. Things like the question of what was going on with with Akoja and the way Zorian's initial assumptions about Taiven and Kirielle fell apart were what I was /really/ reading for, along with the sneakier understanding-based loop progression where Zorian was mostly expanding his options and figuring out causes and effects while trying to stay under the radar and knowing that brute force was simply not a viable way to stop the invasion. We've had a couple of nice character moments along that line in more recent arcs, like Taiven's breakdown and the subsequent loop, but overall it feels like the best parts for bringing those back, like the magicless loops, just got timeskipped over.

*** I feel that Princess and Ibak can use some more attention this chapter. Peculiar hydra and grouchy suspecting oldman are interesting characters, but they feel flat. Passages on Princess are of lower quality when compared to Novelty; who displayed unbound enthusiasm first time she's appointed as Zorian's tutor, or giving an off-hand dismissal when Zorian talked about creation of glass apparatus. And Ibak is the same when compared to Haslush Ikzeteri; who's friendly but still commanding respect.

Zorian brief interaction with lizardman children could also use some work. Moving the description of their big build earlier (when they're touching Zorian wondering if he's a fairy) would allow better flow when they play with mudman construct.
