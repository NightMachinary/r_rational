*** u/wren42:
#+begin_quote
  “Unless Pax was a bust,”\\
  “Twenty minutes,”
#+end_quote

use period instead of comma. it's like this in many places where a quotation ends. use a comma only in cases that the sentence continues, such as ' "Ouch," she said. '

#+begin_quote
  Some new mix of AI and Artificing she thought abomination.
#+end_quote

break out "she thought" somehow, either commas, italics, or quotes.

#+begin_quote
  starfighter's
#+end_quote

no apostrophe for plural.

#+begin_quote
  These scans are worry.
#+end_quote

tense.

#+begin_quote
  closely cropped haird
#+end_quote

typo

#+begin_quote
  dossier's
#+end_quote

plural, no '

#+begin_quote
  She has been sent to the best schools. Had graduated the Academy of War
#+end_quote

"had" or "has" pick one, not both.

#+begin_quote
  unknown races battleship.
#+end_quote

possessive should use '

#+begin_quote
  drove a furrow into the prospective colony's ground.
#+end_quote
