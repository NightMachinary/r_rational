So I posted the next discussion about chapter #14 in the read-through for /Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ and for some reason, the post never appears on the front page of this subreddit. I tried deleting and reposting it several times now and even when I wait a few hours, it still doesn't appear.

Does anyone know what is going on?

The post is [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/35mjwy/geb_discussion_15_chapter_14_on_formally/][here]].

EDIT: Okay, I messaged the mods about it and it's been taken care of. Thanks for your help guys!

** Not sure...my first hypothesis was some sort of oddity in the algorithm for reddit's 'hot' posts, but it doesn't appear on new either. Hmm...

EDIT: I'll try commenting on it and see if that changes anything.

*** On the subject of 'hot' posts -- what exactly is the definition? I was looking at some of the things I've submitted in the past and I noticed that when I rank them by 'hot', they don't actually fall in upvote order, which is what I was expecting.

**** I'm not too sure how this would be calculated, but it seems to work by what posts are getting the most upvotes in the shortest amount of time. To use a physics metaphor, upvotes are the speed and 'hotness' is the acceleration.

***** Hm. I wish there was a way to say simply "rank by upvotes". It would be interesting to be able to flip through 2YE and see which were the most popular chapters, see if I could figure out why.

I swear I tried that before and it didn't do what I expected. Okay, I am wrong. Thanks.

******** It doesn't /quite/ do what you expect. Sometimes sort by top for the week will give you a higher-rated post than top in all time.

** Posts have to be upvoted some before they appear on the front page. Are they appearing in /new? If they're not appearing in /new, then your posts are probably being caught in the spam filter and you should message the mods about it.

*** In a sub this small, I believe any post will be on the front page of [[/r/rational]] shortly after it's posted, due to the way that the "hot" ranking works.

***** The internet runs on the 90/10/1 rule. If there are 3,000 people, there are 2,700 lurkers, 300 commentators, and 30 content creators. This is just a general rule, but I think it holds roughly true. It's still a fair number of people (and still my favorite sub) but I do think of it as being small.

****** True.

/Pedant Mode Activate!/

2,700 + 300 + 30 = 3,030

You probably meant 2,700 lurkers, 270 commentators, and 30 content creators. As well as the 90/9/1 Rule.

/Pedant mode Deactivate!/

Thanks for taking the time to be one of the 1% then!

******* Content creators are almost always commentators as well, but the 90/9/1 sum doesn't work out if people can belong to multiple categories.

You're both right!

***** Most of the stuff caps out at 30 or 40 net upvotes (sometimes it gets over 50 I think). We have a lot of subscribers but I feel like most people are just here to read. For a long time I was a just-reader because logging into reddit was too much trouble.

yeah though I think everything appears in hot
