** In most stories an infinite wish engine would end everything very quickly and boringly. In this one I'm expecting it to just release more danger from the other side. I'm guessing different magics/worlds cancel each other out, so she can't just wish aslan away. Hmm I wonder if the belief of the people currently living and in the area has an effect

Also great to see the general's internal perspective. Makes him much more sympathetic and nuanced

** It's that time again. A few things to cover this week:

- Between RR and AO3 we've hit 5,000 views in a little over 1 month since this started going up. That's crazy! So glad you all are following along, thank you.
- The finalized cover from RHL_Shen is here and it's /beautiful./ [[https://i.imgur.com/tyc9Z1O.jpg][Check it out]], and [[https://www.instagram.com/rhl_shen/][check her instagram out]] for more good stuff.
- We're getting into a very short timeskip today, so [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXYHaERqFlBl1iuEDvTM5tepfjdUYjvcKAMVNXn9G5U/edit?usp=sharing][here's the next character sheet for Haley]], already kind of obsolete by this Thursday.

** I don't quite understand what spell list Haley is using. Like, can she just select any level-appropriate spell from the whole Wizard/Sorcerer spell list or something? Because Infernal Healing seems like a strange fit for a Gold Dragon otherwise.

Also, do dragons have some kind of general exemption from material component requirements for casting? Fleece is easy to get, but where did Haley scrounge up multiple vials of Unholy Water?

I know that many DMs ignore that stuff, but if RAW can be applied in ludicrously favorable ways then IMO the same should be true to all the stupidly annoying limitations that pure RAW introduces.

*** Gold Dragons /technically/ have access to the divine spell list as well, if you look at some of the pre-gen monsters, but that rule isn't specified anywhere that I have found so I'm trying to be good and limit her immediate access to the wizard spell list. She's allowed to pick what she wants though, and infernal healing is a great source of HP, despite the icky "Evil" flavor text. She's being very practical.

Also, re: components. I think I'm part of the camp that has never, ever, even once in my life paid attention to components. I think they're fun flavor but holy hell do I not want to have to come up with a drop of devil's blood or whatever, every time a character needs to cast a level 1 spell in a tabletop game or in a story. For the peace of mind of the true rules-sticklers we can assume that they are pulling stupid party tricks like ordaining Sean in the Church of Satan and having him bless a vial of water for Haley for the healing. If they get into spells that /really/ need to be rate limited, well- I guess we will see what she comes up with to get around high component costs.

**** I don't know if Gold Dragons have access to /any/ spell list according to RAW. They get full access to specific spells, like certain casters do. There's definitely precedent. Do you have any examples of specific Dragons (of any color) in Pathfinder that cast spells outside of their specific Monster Manual list? Because that would be proof that Dragons actually learn spells like sorcerers do as opposed to just having what they have.

#+begin_quote
  Also, re: components.
#+end_quote

Of course. Most everyone plays that way. They also usually disallow infinite wishes tough. And much of the other various broken RAW things. But you have repeatedly mentioned in your story that Sean and Haley are so lucky because they have no DM limiting or houseruling anything. If now it turns out that there is some houseruling going on, but only to their benefit, well, what would the story implications of that be?

Also, ordaining Sean to the Church of Satan is not really possible without working internet or communications. You would have to found your own unholy church. And if we're going by D&D, there would probably have to be some power behind the ordainment (see [[https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Unholy_water]]), while if it is based on some other narrative rules from your world I would expect either some actual rules when it comes to founding a religion in a way that makes stories acknowledge it, or consequences for officially devoting oneself to a random evil deity.

Would Sean really risk that just to squeeze out a few additional hit points from a level 1 spell slot?

***** Pathfinder is the same as DND 3.5 where they get effective sorcerer levels from increasing in age category. They can pick from any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list for their spells known, and official modules released by WotC and Paizo do so when implementing dragons.

As for cleric spells both gold and silver dragons add those as arcane spells to the list of sorcerer spells to choose from.

***** Hmm, I'm not sure where you're getting the idea of a Monster Manual spell list? I'm unfamiliar with it, but it would be a major plan changer if it exists- link me and I'll dig into it. If that /was/ the case it would be... problematic for her later build.

There are no house rules (unless you count a dragon PC as a house rule, I certainly would). Just certain bits going unspoken because they're tedious to track, as both an author and a reader. The "Rules As Written" claim is a promise of fairness and reproducibility to the reader, as far as I'm concerned. I.E. "You could argue that a PF character could do this with your GM and they'd have to use fiat to block it." It doesn't mean I'm going to bog the story down with Haley collecting bat guano or whatever, but I /did/ plan to ensure that she has a source- on that front, can't say more.

In this particular example I am offering a cheeky non-canon response because I honestly forgot to look at the component cost of a level one spell. Silly me for assuming a low level PF spell wouldn't have something dumb in it! If she were to hit a high level and try to cast Wish directly the material cost would be prohibitive, but an Efreet has Wish as a SLA with no material cost. Lucky!

Sean would /absolutely/ risk eternal damnation to get castable fast-healing. One human afterlife for, potentially, multiple lives saved per day, for the rest of Haley's existence? Sure, easy trade.

****** I think what [[/u/Bowbreaker]] means by "Monster Manual list" is the spells listed on the [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/metallic-gold/young-gold-dragon/][Young Gold Dragon MM page]]. It does rather specifically state "Spells Known," and I generally agree that monsters (even extremely powerful and intelligent ones) don't get the flexibility that humanoid casters have. I just assumed that Infernal Healing was for some reason a default Gold Dragon ability.

That said, I'm sure there's some feat or craftable item in Pathfinder that grants access to spells outside one's normal range, like the Magic Initiate feat in 5e.

EDIT: Or Haley is a Gold Dragon PC with caster levels! That's even more broken.

******* My understanding is that the example monsters are just that- pre-generated examples. I've never heard it suggested that all monsters of a type conform to the one example listed in the wiki- especially in their optional areas, like spells known! That would be exceptionally restrictive. Look up any existing Pathfinder module and you will find that the encounters are full of monsters that don't conform to those templates.

******** Interesting! I've never played Pathfinder, but in 5e the idea seems to be that a monster of a given type will always have the same spells. For instance, a rusalka will always have magic related to charming and entangling, a sphinx will always have informational and defensive spells, etc. Obviously a DM can alter or add whatever they want, but I agree with [[/u/Bowbreaker]] that "we are specifically playing RAW Pathfinder" feels a bit at odds with "I can pick whatever spells I want."

Maybe a little discussion between Haley & Shawn to clear that up? Or not, anyone who's not intimately familiar with Pathfinder dragons probably won't notice any discrepancy at all :P

******** I guess giving dragons a full sorcerer spell list plus whatever is directly printed on their sheet is fair. Lots of settings flavor sorcerers as being able to sorcerize due to limited amounts of dragon blood in their veins.

But in general RAW means that if you can't find any rules printed in official sources then it isn't possible. To five an example: 3.5 Monks would be unproficient in unarmed combat according to RAW. Yes, I know that's dumb.

My point is that if nothing details how Gold Dragons acquire their spells or what their choices are, then typical RAW reading says that there isn't anything.

Is it though? Not only is eternity a few orders of magnitude higher than average human life expectancy, but Haley would have learned Cure Moderate Wounds the moment she hit Young Adult.

Also, if the component is Pathfinder Unholy Water, as opposed to being mere water that a Left Hand Path preacher spit on or something, then it needs the necromantic Curse Water spell specifically.

Also dragons spells come from pseudo sorcerer levels, so you can choose any spell on the sorcerer or cleric list everytime her age category increases. On page 91: "Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type".

** So, I'm afraid you've mistaken some rules here.

[[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/master-craftsman/]]

Benefit: Choose one Craft or Profession skill in which you possess at least 5 ranks. You receive a +2 bonus on your chosen Craft or Profession skill. *Ranks in your chosen skill count as your caster level* for the purposes of qualifying for the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats.

Your caster level is equal only to the *ranks* in your chosen skill, not the final bonus which would be laughably broken for the reasons you set out here. Ranks are limited by HD, and no other bonus increases them.

However, you don't actually need caster level to craft items, as that's just the suggestion. The only real limits are for constructs. The rest can be avoided by adding 5 to the DC, so I think she can still get the candle working.
