Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A bored and reclusive billionaire has had you kidnapped and taken to his island. He informs you that you are to be killed. However, you are allowed to choose an animal. Either a species or a specific individual animal, but it has to be alive. He will kill you using this animal. Until he can get his hands on it you are allowed to live a life of luxury on the island, although you will not be able to leave or contact anyone. He will use his wealth to acquire the animal, but where possible will seek to play as important a part as possible in finding and acquiring it. For example, if you choose death by giraffe, he might get into a helicopter himself and scour the Savannah to find one, sedate it personally, etc.

If you choose an animal that could not normally kill a human he will get creative. He might just freeze it and beat you to death with its corpsicle, or he might have its corpse surgically implanted into your chest to rot.

If he cannot get his hands on it within a year, he will release you and give you a billion dollars.

What animal do you choose?

**** Humans are animals, so fair game. However, this billionaire is quite happy to improvise. There are some who would suggest that the current President of the United States might be amenable to persuasion if, say, an eccentric billionaire walked up to him at a golf course and offered him half a billion to come participate willingly.

***** Avoiding modern politics for now... There are any number of heads of state that you could list if the president doesn't fit the bill of people who would be extremely difficult to abduct or bribe. Or just other really rich people: listing Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos as the 'animal' you have to be killed by would give some pretty big problems for this eccentric billionaire.

Going more into the spirit of the question: there are various microscopic animal species that would be rather difficult to kill a human with, even if directly implanted into someone. Endangered or otherwise protected species would be rather difficult to acquire, but probably within the scope of a billion dollar budget. If the animal has to be living, you could list various extremeophiles that would present pretty serious problems in transporting to the surface (animals that live at the bottom of ocean trenches, for example). Listing an extremely rare animal might work, but it's hard to say, since there haven't been billion dollar budgets put to finding them. Giant squid come to mind for that, since we know they exist, but I don't think one has ever been captured alive, and there are very few sightings of them at all. Lastly, if the animal has to be alive, you could list some specific animal that will die before the billionaire could feasibly transport it to his island, contingent on you knowing of that animal in advance.

****** Your best bet would probably be some deep sea animal that is positively identified but vanishingly rare. Even for a billionaire, there's going to be a lead time just to get an expedition equiped. If your pick is rare enough, chances are they will run empty handed and have to start over again.

Giant squid seem close to ideal, because in addition to the difficulty in finding something that is absurdly rare in an enormous search area, there's the problem of actually capturing and moving such a large and dangerous animal. After looking it up, giant squid have been captured, but it seems like they're captured by accident in fishing nets rather than a specific search for them. There are only a handful of videos of adults in their natural habitat.

****** If a single microscopic animal won't work there isn't anything to say he can't just use a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand.

Even if they are tiny, a good chunk of them say, injected directly into your brain fluid should kill you dead just fine.

We also know pretty clearly the animal doesn't have to be living (as it lists killing you with its corpse), so he doesn't have to even try to capture one alive.

Which incidentally opens up another path for him to take for super rare animals: He can just grab the corpse of one already dead in a museum somewhere (and yes, they totally have giant squid corpses at a museum) and use /it/ to kill you. I will admit it is very much against the spirit of the question, but there isn't anything that says he can't take that path anyways.

*** My immediate thought is a dust mite recovered from, like, a Pakistani CIA blacksite. The only thing I can figure which might be possible to do with one dust mite, assuming he could collect one from the blacksite at all, is somehow transform its body into some hyperpotent toxin, but doing that without introducing a significant fraction of contamination and "cheating" might not be possible with current technology.

If we find out the recent discovery of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere was caused by life, I would demand to be killed by any living thing from Venus. It wouldn't be possible for him to recover that in under a year.

#+end_quote

This seems pretty strong? Whatever the animal is, as long as he can acquire it, he can just plant it in your brain and you are dead. Mostly because of the brain surgery, but technically still because of the animal.

So our best hope is to pick an animal that he can't acquire.

*Begins googling current animals in space and how hard it would be to bring them back to Earth.*

Gah, the requirements are so strict! If it just had to be a living thing, then we could choose a (bacterial) spore on the Voyager 1 (there almost certainly are some spores on it, and spores are quite durable so they could still be alive). If this question was in January 2019, we could have chosen a fruit fly egg on the Chang'e 4's lunar lander. Good luck getting that thing back from the far side of the Moon, but now its already dead.

And sadly, all astronauts are currently on earth or will almost certainly return from space in under a year, so we can't choose them either because they could be abducted on return and have their corpses beat you to death.

Edit: I started googling people on nuclear submarines, because they would be damn hard for the billionaire to find and kidnap. But I think this is going to put me on a list if I keep going >_>.

Edit2: Just thought of a different angle of attack: does the billionaire have to PROVE that he has acquired the correct target? So, can I pick the murderer of an unsolved murder case, and then the billionaire has to solve the case in order to get the murderer to kill me? Or do I have to prove that the target is currently alive first? Hmm...

He's doing all this for sport. If you asked for the criminal behind unsolved case x he might accept that, though if he pours $5 million into solving a case and discovers to his own satisfaction that the criminal has died, he's going to come back and say good try, now pick something I can immediately confirm is still alive. He has integrity in that he will play 'fair' with you, but he doesn't feel obliged to prove things to /your/ satisfaction.

He would accept that, if you could name someone. It wouldn't be easy for him to find their submarine and get them to the island, but it's something he could realistically try to achieve within a year.

This /would/ indeed have been an excellent pick. Double A+ on obscure knowledge gathering for that one.

First thought there is a coconut crab, though I'm wary of that particular choice in the off chance that he does find one with the right coloration. Doesn't seem like a good way to die.

** What story plots can you break or subvert by giving a main character the ability to retain their memories from when they were a baby/infant/toddler? Clear, well formed and organized memories from the moment of birth through childhood. To make it even easier, they instinctively avoid talking about their memories of being a baby when they first learn to talk.

Inspired by a main character from The Promised Neverland. I recently binged it on Netflix.

*** Any story where the parents of the protagonist are unknown and a major plot point would be significantly altered. Meet the Robinsons comes to mind, since the main character finding out the identity of his mother is his big motivation. Star Wars would have gone differently if Luke knew from the start that his father was responsible for overthrowing the Republic, that he had a sister named Leia, and who Obi Wan was. Harry Potter would have obviously been /very/ different.

The identity of the father could still be unknown, especially if the father isn't brought up in conversation around the baby, but unless the mother and those around her knew that this baby would remember everything, there would in general be no reason to avoid that particular topic.

*** Do I have to spend it now? I'm also assuming property is out of the question unless it's just for fun.

A trip to the ISS will apparently cost tens of millions, so unfortunately that's out of the question.

State-of-the-art VR and VR peripherals could probably use at least $10k and I definitely want that. Probably $20k for a high end computers, software, peripherals, and games. A few thousand on books and movies too I guess. I'd rather wait a few years for better VR, but if I gotta spend it now it's fine.

I don't know much about making movies or musicals, but apparently the budget for ranges from several million to tens of millions (with some movies in the hundreds). So maybe feasible to fund an indie or short film, but that'd take up a significant portion of my funds and not have that high of a fun return.

I could probably spend $300k commissioning a game, and $100k commissioning a ton of mods for games that I already play. Hope making those public doesn't count as improving the world too much.

I'd definitely commission some art, not really sure what at the moment but I think I could manage to spend $100k that way. Some nice big landscape paintings for sure.

I've never been on a cruise but apparently a 2021 cruise is 40k per person for 3 months so maybe I'd spend a few months on a cruise with some friends, roughly 160k. I'd definitely try to book for 2022 though, try and be fully done with corona.

Apparently a personal chef is only like $25k a year for a family of 4 if they cook for you every week, so I could get that down to $15k-$20k and have a personal chef for the next 15 to 20 years with my remaining $300k. Gluttony and laziness counts as fun, right?

I'm not sure how else to spend the remaining money if I can't get a personal chef. Is gambling allowed? It's definitely the fastest way to spend money. Oh, and now that I clicked your link I would definitely buy some replica fossils, could spend like $100k on that.

Edit: just realized you probably meant entertaining for other people or an entertaining idea... in that case either a video game or a very big and whimsical Rube Goldberg machine respectively
