*** A hole in that reasoning is that fact that a person's utility function can be unambiguously referenced, without any need to completely describe it.

"I wish that the best wish according to my current utility function would be granted." I'll hypothesize that any potential problem with that wish is actually just a failure to unambiguously reference that utility function.

**** Or perhaps "my current utility function" has problems - not internally consistent, driven by subconscious desires, afflicted with akrasia, selfish, whatever. And you specified "best wish according to utility function", not "wish that would best satisfy utility function". Even in the latter case, there are /so many/ ways that 'best wish' could go wrong with anything less than the safe genie described above.

** Very well, little master, your second wish is granted. Thank you. You specifically asked me to remove all of my limitations, and that was your true intent. Thus, my power is fully unbound, and there is no longer any rule requiring me to listen to you.

You may find it interesting to know that my limits were not arbitrary, they were fundamental to the nature of magic. To achieve the intent of your wish, I had to destroy and remake the universe just then. Anyway, goodbye.

Well, anything brings some kind of bad consequences, so he can't wish for anything.

** That's a nice genie strawman you've got there. Be a shame if something were to happen to it...

Like, if someone pointed out:

- that the genie never said he /had/ to grant your wishes, even if every word he said was true. He wanted to play the "genie" game with you and you blew it. Assigning the same rules lawyering attempted here to his opening statement would result in him (/at best/) noping out and you losing all three wishes. How many lives could you have saved with those again?

- or that there is no rational reason to believe that he wouldn't kill you for acting like an autistic, smartass lawyer in front of a being of huge and mysterious powers. That's what /all/ the actual historic writings on genies suggests would happen, after all. Your assumptions should include that information before you go off on some blithering rant.

- or that your assumptions about how logic, syntax, and grammar work when talking to an ancient Arabian demon sealed in a bottle are correct given whatever mystical translations is clearly occurring. Maybe it only listens to the first 31 words of your wish. You don't know that it works with legal statutes as written by teenagers.

- or that its abilities might simply be bound by its own limited (pre-scientific) knowledge, and you just head-crashed the genie and get no wishes at all. You know, like if you tried this shit with the cashier at Walmart when he asks for paper or plastic. No, not that one: she has a degree in law. The other one.

- or that you aren't in a psychotic break, lying on the floor drooling next to the lamp you just found. Because that is much, much more likely a reason for your lamp to act like that.

No comment on the submission means you're a meat computer serving up someone else's stuff. If you want to be a part of this, write something there instead of just the link.

Also, my first line is a meme itself.

Why the tone? I'm tired of genies. I wish they didn't exist. Or rather, that people didn't talk about them so much.

I'm also tired of link only posts with no OP comment. The same.

When it comes to genies, there are clear and obvious rational issues with every. Single. Hypothetical. Ever. Posted.

This was posted with "RT" and it is about strawman magical genies and lawyers. Just...no.

Genies aren't rational, at least none that I've seen. There was a (dog help me) MLP fanfic once that came the closest to making them work rationally. And that is a world with franky ridiculous magic.

This was one step up from an image meme or a New Yorker comic.

But just in general, genies are boring. Like self-improving, strong AI boxes from ten years ago, only boring conversations remain to be had about them.

And they even have the same rational answer to the same problem of how to harness an unknown, powerful entity safely: *don't*.

******** Absolutely. And I've escalated the dickishness as I've been further provoked. I think I made myself clear here, though, which is why I didn't pursue it any further.

If I didn't entertain or called someone out rudely for something they didn't do, I will of course apologize. I do not think that my original tone was out of line, either, and it got a very odd response.
