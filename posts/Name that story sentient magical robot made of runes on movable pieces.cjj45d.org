The author stopped writing it after a [few?] dozen chapters but I'd like to re-read it anyway.

My guess is that you're thinking of /The Tinker's Daughter/ by eaglejarl (first chapter posted to this subreddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4310vk/hfrst_eaglejarls_new_project_the_tinkers_daughter/][here]]), but I didn't read it.

**** It's not down. You should be able to see it here: [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/general-public-1-4218932]] It's public.

EDIT: Nope, I'm wrong. The links appear to have broken at some point...dunno why, since I don't think I've moved anything. Regardless, here you go: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxi003os31p2os3/tinkers_daughter.zip?dl=0]]
