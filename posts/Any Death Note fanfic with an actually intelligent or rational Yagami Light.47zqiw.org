ie. the protagonist wouldn't make the psychological slip ups that happen in canon; thinks outside the box; takes the rules of the death note to their logical limits.

*** Hmm.

Abandoned...

Hmm..

On reddit the author was [[/u/pedromvilar]] but he also stopped posting a year ago.

Hmm...

On FF.net the autor says they also have a tumbler blog.

[[http://scientiststhesis.tumblr.com/tagged/rationalising-death][HMMM.]]

Well still that's less than promising. Stuck in a literary roadblock in april and hasn't gotten over it. But he's displayed desire to continue if he could, so maybe we should try reminding him.

But uh, as a lazy person who is aware of the bystander effect, I nominate specifically [[/u/luminarium]] for the job of doing so.

**** I'm reminded! And alive!

Mostly the problem is that I... lost momentum, in a way? And I've gotten better at writing since then, I want to rewrite the ten chapters already published and then continue, I have a plot in my head and all, just. Ugh field, life terribly busy, my fiction-writing needs are being satisfied by glowfic, that kinda thing.

I have a tab open on my tumblr where someone asked me to continue to remind myself and slowly give me courage and desire do go on, but I can't hold myself to an ETA at the moment :x

****** Yeah.

This might need an introduction. So, Alicorn wrote her [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Twilight rationalfanfic]] a while back. Soon after, she and a friend started something called [[http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html][Effulgence]] where they threw that fic's Bella at a number of other universes, mostly fanfictional. The link has more info.

This has spawned "glowfic," which is a series of this style of RP between many people and many other people. [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/board/index.php][Alicorn's forum]] is a little hub for glowfic, as is [[http://alicornutopia.dreamwidth.org/][Alicorn's index]] and [[http://glowfic.dreamwidth.org/][the dreamwidth glowfic community]].

Which brings us to [[http://peterverse.dreamwidth.org/][my very own glowfic index]], where I mostly throw this one character called Sadde at other places and people. It may not make sense without knowing the source material, and some may not make sense without having read Effulgence.

And before I forget, a lot of glowfic happens via Milliways, the bar at the end of the universe (which universe is anyone's guess), whose door replaces (mostly) random doors in (mostly) random universes at (mostly) random times. When someone goes through that door to Milliways, time in their home universe is paused until they return or until Milliways decides that they won't be able to. The bar, for that matter, is sapient, and talks to people via notes on napkins. People's first drink is free, the rest is paid with origin-appropriate prices (i.e. a character from a given world will use currency from that world to pay for stuff, at culturally appropriate prices).

Ummm, I think that's it!

I'll give it a shot

  ... /I've killed two people.../\\
  He walked into an alley and threw up. His stomach churned; down the back of his neck spread chills and a feverish heat in sick unison, crawling down his spine, his chest, speeding his ragged breath, arms shaking, too weak to hold himself up. He collapsed against the alley wall, sat beside his vomit, gripping his hair as tears fell.

  /What have I done?/ ...

  "Did you mean them? Those threats?"

  Light's pencil paused in its traversal across the page. Ryuk waited, watching Light's seated stillness from behind. He floated in front of Light and saw his eyes on the page, unmoving. He waved a hand in front of Light's eyes; they didn't track it. Ryuk floated on the desk in wait. Finally, Light blinked, showing slight surprise seeing Ryuk on his desk.

  Light looked to his writing, the pencil scratching once more as he said, "I don't know."

  "You must be a shinigami, then," said Misa, her eyes aglitter with flickering light as they fluttered, twitched in random directions. Her mouth opened in mock horror, her trembling hand reaching up to cover it. "And your name is REM." Misa fell to the floor, body perfectly still as her eyes continued their movement without any cover of fleshy lid.

  "No. It's Remu, but I don't like the 'u', so it's Rem, halfway between Remu and Ren."

  Misa dusted herself off as she stood from her charade. "Too much work. I'll call you Remu." She grabbed the death note and held it up to Rem. "What's this?" ...

They are fine! If that's your plan, you will likely end up postponing it forever. And you stopped right where it started to get really interesting :(

** It's not a fic, but I quite liked the [[http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][write-up by gwern]] on what Light's biggest mistake was (perhaps surprisingly, it's not killing Lind L Tailor)

** It's tricky to do because a Rational Light doesn't kill Lind L Taylor, doesn't let the police know he knows they know he's one of Japan's millions of high school kids and never ever gets identified.
