*** Sometimes phisycs advances because a new experiment. Sometimes physics advances because we make a better theory from the evidence we already had and later confirm the results whith experiments, like Einstein did for relativity.

And its not like most people in theoretical physics are sitting arround waiting for experiments to unfold, they are in fact sitting arround publishing papers whith new theories from the data we already have.

I mean particle accelerator experiments in particular are a good example. They are big and expensive and take time so most people doing physics can't just directly test whatever ideas they have. You don't just sit in a room whith a particle accelerator testing things. You theorize a particle and 50 years afterwards someone makes a collider big enough to detect it and you win a nobel.

So maybe they can't actually realistically figure it out whith the info they have or maybe they do.

The teacher is basically saying they can figure it out so presumably it is the second case.

*** They're rationalists - their ability to find the correct answer is vastly superior to ours. We think we haven't done enough experiments on particle accelerators to find the right answer. We're wrong.

Alternatively, since this is (probably) set in the future, they've /already done/ enough experiments.

Or, alternatively, they're all wrong and they can't, in fact, discover the theory of quantum gravity. Maybe the teacher will grade them based on what they tried, not based on whether they succeeded.

**** The second is unlikely. So long as we have cirumference left on the planet we can always build a bigger accelerator. And it remains to be seen if we're even close to the bottom of the mechanics of the universe. Quantum might just be the start.

***** I meant enough experiments to write down the theory of quantum gravity, not enough experiments to be 100% sure the theory of quantum gravity they discovered is the correct theory of everything. (Those are two distinct problems - even after you have a theory of quantum gravity supported by experiments, it's still possible that there will be a bigger particle accelerator that will disprove it.)

** Discussion: should we regard Brennan's "lack of pragmatic motivation" argument refuted by the ongoing, uh, performance issues at the FDA + CDC, and if not, how should we reconcile the theory with the observation?

Non-Americans: Feel free to substitute your own versions of our federal agencies.

Note: I'm looking for attempts to relate observations about our performance regarding Covid to Brennan's hypothesis, not just general opinions, narratives, and whatever you want to say about covid.

*** I suggest that the specific decisionmakers at the FDA are indeed lacking in pragmatic motivation. What do they care if ten thousand people die? They'll still go home with their nice paychecks to their comfortable homes in zoned suburbs; and they'll still be first in line for getting the vaccine, whenever they decide it's safe enough for them to risk. As a civilisation we may have pragmatic motivation for speed; but we don't make decisions as a civilisation. Specific people do, and their incentives evidently suck.

**** I can understand why this seems like an appealing idea but I don't think that there is any real evidence to support it.

Do you really think that the people at the FDA and throughout the government are really just taking it easy? They may not have as much as a direct incentive to avoid the threat of death as many of the more impoverished citizens but they still have all the normal incentives to do a good job. We can also assume that they all have a strong motivation to bring an end to the pandemic simply based on normal human empathy. There are some tremendous organizational and scientific challenges that have to be overcome before any real solution can be implemented. It is certainly possible that there is some level of institutional apathy slowing things down but it makes no sense to treat that as the sole source of delay. It seems like saying that the reason for the lack of an immediate solution to the current crisis is a lack of concern serves more to create a convenient enemy than as an actual explanation.

I think that the key problem is that we (average citizens) have no real way of determining how long it should take to produce a major scientific effort (vaccine or new theory). Can we really say that they are going "slow" when we don't fully understand all the steps in the process? What would a "fast" means of producing scientific results even look like? Is the current length of time (1+ years) for the vaccine really that long? My perspective is that our lack of understanding means that any evaluations we are making regarding the effectiveness of the government and the scientific community will be inherently flawed as they will be based on our frustrations rather than on actual evidence.

I would also say that there is a big flaw in assuming that you can end up with a superior or faster product simply by "working harder". There are unavoidable constraints on how much effort you can get out of people and applying pressure in an attempt to increase work productivity can easily backfire. History seems to indicate that forcing people to meet artificially imposed deadlines that are applied based on public demand or political needs will lead to failures or falsifications intended to avoid punishment rather than true improvement. This seems like it would be especially true when we are dealing with something like vaccine creation where any errors can lead to a massive and irreversible disaster.

That is true. But it does not seem that difficult, for example, to prepare your [[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/a-suggestion-for-the-fda.html][fact sheet]] in /advance/ of the meeting wherein you're about 99% sure you'll approve the vaccine, instead of waiting until it's approved and thus delaying the distribution by a week. Are you seriously going to claim that there was nobody at the FDA who could do this clerical work in advance, instead of after the meeting, for fear of burning them out? This speaks to me of an utterly lackadaisical attitude, a complete lack of appreciation for the need for speed.

********** There's an obvious direct (inverse) relationship between speed of approval and rigor of review. It's totally unsurprising that in an administration where regulatory review is seen as meritless (in all agencies, not just the FDA), things are approved faster; that does not mean the FDA is doing a better job.
