** This nighttime campfire respite in the middle of a monster infested zone is giving me such hard Dark Souls vibes (if it was unintentional I'll eat my hat) and I'm all over that. This may be one of my favorite chapters thematically so far--right up there with the Everdeep Fortress delve.

Wolf is such a cool chick, I sure do hope we get to see more of her in the near future! She wouldn't happen to be a Bloodborne reference, would she? Frickin monster hunters transforming into beasts in a long night of hardship and horor. I'll be disappointed if she isnt carrying a saw or cane of some sort.

As somebody who does a lot of camping and card playing, I feel like an expert on the subject of playing cards by campfire. In my expert opinion, it is not easy to play cards by campfire at night. For one, the slightest breeze risks losing a card to the fire (or worse, getting the cards dirty). For two, smoke to the eyes does not a happy card player make. Still, I had the dumbest grin when the chapter started with a group of "friends" just passing the time playing cards and being asshats to eachother.

I really hope Rain's monster compendium becomes a regular thing. It gives us context on how to measure a person's strength. Up to now, we only really had Rain's previous numbers to compare his new numbers to, and it made his progression seem very impressive (going from 8ish dps to like 1k dps or something). But after seeing some of those HP numbers, I can now more easily see why people aren't as impressed as I was (freaking 20k ballpark for a normal enemy 3 levels below Rain's? Goddamn his dps looks pretty pathetic in this light) Makes me wonder what kind of numbers Velika can pull to just walk all over these things. The growth rate in this world looks to be comparable to the Disgaea series from the looks of things. Maybe a Laharl cameo sometime? He and Val would just be the best of friends.

** I still hold to the theory that the system is balanced around party builds, but as seem with the sentiment towards supports, everyone is building as solo builds..

So, combining Rain's optimisation of the builds, as well as having people spec for filling party roles, the "wall" of 25 ought to be much easier to clear.

Actually, thoughts are colliding! I shall make a prediction!

Some of the workers who have aligned themselves with the "Lord Rain", will awaken, after which they will come to Rain seeking his guidance.\\
Rain will share the various builds he has come up with, then after some back and forth, will group them after party rolls, and the revolution will have begun.

Electricity will be used to deal with the problem of darkness, as it has already been introduced without a payoff. There ought to be a lot of ways to run a turbine when you have access to magic, so they wont need to go digging for coal.

The monsters solve the need for food, and the barrier allows for the revolution to develop without outside interference.

*** As to your first point, I've seen similar comments on RoyalRoad. It's clear that awakened who try to pass the walls need to optimize their builds, and even one stray misused skill point out of the 10-20 they typically have can screw them permanently. The people of this world have the belief that solo builds are the only working solutions, given all the dps and tank builds we see everyone running. Hell, the only supports are some low level slaves that the Empire uses, and maybe a stray healer here or there. I don't think that world uses what we would consider optimal party comps with supports in our games. Rain as a support, especially when he gets some of the other really nice support auras, can definitely boost the other 7 in a party of 8 much more than if he was another dps.

That's probably why monsters seem exponentially stronger, if the system and world is based on party-oriented combat, which when optimized would put monsters and humans on an even playing field. These concepts of supports and such are probably too foreign for the world's awakened due to the general distrust and secrecy they have towards their builds and power and of course the result of living in a medieval society, the trust, openness, and vulnerability of relying so heavily on a crucial support or being the physically weak and trusting support would be impossible. It'd take a modern weirdo that'd understand optimal team comps and the strength of supports, a completely foreign element like Rain to really fully embrace this kind of build, as I doubt any other newly awakened people would try such a risky and untested build when a single mistake can permanently screw them over and when there are so many tried and true archetypical builds.

Now it makes me curious about the truth of the world and how this system and it's workings were created. It better not be another mischievous Evil God.

**** For world origins, whatever the fuck those forebearers are called are probably the guys who set the system up. Probably started with some amount of magic, then bootstrapped their system on top.

***** We got some hints that makes that almost certainly the case.

There's a lot of arbitrary elements that haven't been justified, they haven't even been handwaved!

It also matches up with the rumor that the forerunners didn't consider someone a mage until they reached level 100. (Or 75? I can't remember)

With the forerunners building the system to empower people, with the full intention that it will be left behind.

It only has the 122 trees because it wasn't meant to have everything, it was just supposed to get you started.

Mind, I don't actually have a textual basis for this. It just fits my intuition.

**** As of the latest Patreon chapter, Rain is gathering up a handful of awakened and a ton of non-awakened with the intent to go traveling through a dangerous ranked area in the middle of winter with a minor goal of awakening the civilians. Those people venerate him, are all friends, and are much more group-oriented than most adventurers. Rain would almost certainly be able to push them into parties and party-oriented builds, exactly as you suggest.

**** Yeah, a large part of the reason I think the theory makes sense, is because it explains why people haven't just solved it already.

The solution depending on cultural technologies that they don't possess, presents a major barrier to initial adoption, while keeping the cost of implementation low enough that the solution can change the world fairly quickly.

**** Would a Light Aura cause the widescale environmental emission of light necessary to prevent monster spawns though? Immolate only creates fire around targets, which have been monsters in every case I can remember.

There must be a Light Aura, because there's a Dark Aura iirc, so I imagine there must also be a reason it's not more prevalent in Xiugaara where light generation is a major issue.

The need for a target with HP would be a logical limitation.

*** I would mostly agree about the party comps if it weren't for the fact that you NEED to deal damage to monsters to get kill credit. The walls at the higher levels have been stated to be resistance break points where people would no longer be able to even deal damage by themselves due to their subpar skill selection, thus ceasing their ability to grow. Only the damage dealers in a party would be able to benefit from party comps.

The limit of people in a party is 8 and there can only be one party in a lair at a time. Outside a lair, multiple parties can gang up on an essence monster, but only the party that actually deals the finishing blow gets the credit.

******* That's not quite true though, is it?

I think our difference in opinion comes down to deductive vs. Inductive reasoning.

Inductive reasoning often doesn't come with the same ironclad certainty, that one might be used to with deductive reasoning.

Weather or not one entertains that looser reasoning, is a matter of personal judgement.

That said:\\
We have been given quite a bit of information on the system, and we have not been given any information to indicate, that there has been any drift in the system.\\
Everything we know points to a static structure.

The contention on Lairs, is that we haven't been given the information to extrapolate.\\
If they are doing anything important magically, then it might be subtle enough that it's not general knowledge.

My own guess is that they are Tel and Cyst farms, with the added bonus that they can get people stated on their awakening.

That would normally be fine, but the character dialog and story writing is, frankly, juvenile with so many pop culture jokes and meme references. The story is cringey to read right now, when the jokes are relevant. It definitely won't age well.

Every character has the exact same personality and voice and teenager sense of snark. Even characters from different empires, different cultures, different species, all sound the exact same.

I don't really agree with your assessment, the doge reference is already very outdated. Still, Rain's meme evolution effectively stopped like 2 years ago for obvious reasons, so it's understandable for me.

If the upcoming fight doesn't do it for you then I highly suggest taking a break from the story for a couple months. For the last long while it's been political machinations galore, and it doesn't seem like itll be ending in the foreseeable future.

**** I have no problem with character heavy arcs, or political machinations, as long as they are well written. The vast majority of Practical Guide To Evil lately is dialogue and politics, and they are very well written, and enjoyable.

The problem in this story is that every single character, has exactly the same voice. From Rain, to Amelia, to Tallheart, who is an entirely different species, to Valencia, they all sound like the same 15 year old boy.

I enjoy the fights, I enjoy the characters using their skills in inventive ways, and I really enjoy the magic system and progression. But the writing is just so cringey, and juvenile.

You're probably right, and I should break for a while and binge the story later. Good recommendation
