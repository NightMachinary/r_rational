Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Bit of a longshot, but here goes:

Is anyone else a fan of David Brin's Uplift saga? I'm interested in hard science fiction where humans uplift animals, not as slaves, but as companions and fellow citizens. Where humans do their best to try to pay homage to the essence of the animal that's brought to intelligence, preserving something of the unique point of view of that animal, while bringing them into the fullest flowering of what it means to be sentient.

Bonus points, of course, if at least one character is a good rationalist role model.

*** You might like Eclipse Phase. It's a TTRPG, but there are a number of official novellas in the setting and you can find a few fanworks if you look around a bit.

The general idea behind the setting is that it's some unspecified but not /too/ distant point in the future (best guess around 2100-2200), 10 years after a cataclysmic event known as The Fall where some AIs got exposed to a hostile memetic (amongst other vectors) alien virus left as a trap, went through a hard-takeoff singularity, murdered most of transhumanity and then mysteriously fucked off before finishing the job, leaving Earth an uninhabitable ruin and only a few percent of the population as survivors (and most of those as as digitally stored egos, who had to abandon their physical bodies to escape Earth).

Before the Fall a number of species had been uplifted, and how they should be treated going forward is one of the points of contention between the various different factions.

** Seeing [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] mentioned reminds me of a long-running question that I have no simple way to ask, because the concept doesn't exist in our baseline culture and has a lot of distracting wrong neighbors, but I'm going to ask it anyways: What fiction have you read that is written for the /cognitively intelligent/ reader?

This is distinct from many distracting-wrong-neighbor concepts like "Author mentions technical stuff you're supposed to have prior knowledge about" or "The characters in the story are told to play excellent chess" or "The story contains stuff that is difficult to understand because it is ambiguous bullshit". So far as I can tell, indeed, our baseline culture has no standard word that means "cognitive intelligence" in the sense that I defined it for "intelligent characters", which is why no such branch of literature exists; it has prior concepts only for status-markers vaguely associated in some way with cognitive horsepower, like big science words, playing chess, being educated, saying stuff that sounds hard to understand but like you are supposed to understand it, having high status in a scientific field, i.e., what a normal person would call "smart", which in standard-culture literature does not especially connote a character who correctly solves the many implicit cognitive challenges of a story.

What fiction have you read (besides Fall of Doc Future) that assumes the reader is cognitively intelligent, without that being a matter of demanding the reader have prior technical knowledge?

*** That's an interesting question, and one I'm pretty sure that if you hadn't spelled it out I would have answered wrong. Certainly, there are books where you can get more out of them if you're smart; ones with hidden twists and easter eggs, where it's satisfying to work out what's going to happen before the story makes it clear. And there are books that are hard to read, and require dedication and intelligence to understand, but most of the examples of this are mostly like this because they're badly written and hard to understand; ie, ambiguous bullshit. And there are stories with mechanics designed to demand the readers have high intelligence, either as a whole or individually, but these are mostly in the form of quest or games linked with the story, where the intelligence is required to succeed at the game, not the story; if you're just reading a playthrough, or following a story only thread, no special intelligence is required on the part of the reader.

There's genuinely not a lot of fiction like this, because the incentive isn't really there. You're not going to see many TV shows like this, because the ultimate goal of a TV show is to get as many people to watch it (and, for the applicable shows, to buy as much merch) as it can, and restricting your demographic to "cognitively intelligent readers looking for cognitively intelligent targeted works" is small.

I think simply by virtue of the defining characteristics of what you're looking for, you're not going to find much in popular culture, especially the monetized bits of it. The closest things I can really think of along those lines are Umineko and Serial Experiments Lain, and neither one is exactly what you're asking for.

*** I just read /Fall of Doc Future/ (thanks for the rec) but I didn't feel like it was particularly challenging, so I'm wondering if I missed something.

I am trying to stumble towards what you meant, and so I want to give an example to see if I'm on the right track. I suspect that a story that requires a more cognitively intelligent reader occurs when less is directly stated (via dialogue, infodump, etc) but is shown/implied and left up to the reader. The standard for this that I always remember is from To Kill A Mockingbird

#+begin_quote
  ... Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks...
#+end_quote

The point that Harper Lee is trying to make is that Jem has never seen Boo, but she doesn't tell the reader that. You have to notice it. (I didn't notice this when I first read it). Is that in the right ballpark?

I suspect that Jane Austen is like that for social and class-related commentary but I don't know. I can't get it. From what I've read, its Iain M. Banks and the Culture stuff. A lot of things are only hinted at, and the transcripts between the ships are dense. But on re-reading it, everything is there. There is certainly some tech concepts, but nothing particularly weird by SF standards. (The later books are more straightforward).

******* That's how 40k Imperial Navy macrocannons work, I always assumed - they aren't gravitic (speciality of the Eldar) and they also aren't railguns (Tau only), and behave a lot like normal chemical-projectile cannons except that they fling solid thousand ton shells at many thousands of kilometres per second, far beyond the detonation velocity of any chemical explosive.

Explanation:

There is an inertial compensator in the cannon barrel, designed for incredibly high power output over a short time, the shell is manually loaded and fires its powder charge and imparts a certain momentum to the round, then the pulsed inertial compensation triggers while the round is leaving the barrel, mass goes down by a factor of 1000 and velocity goes from 1 to 1000 km/s. Extra kinetic energy (because v^{2)} comes from the power cells in the barrel. Fusion of giant guns and the highest of high technology is very 40k, apart from anything else - railguns are a far simpler technology, but /they/ are tech-heresy and there's no STC template for them, but inertial suppression is required for all ships in the Navy and must be used anyway.

If you are loking for books where the characters demonstrate actual intelligence, I think the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson has a lot of characters that accomplish their goals by intelligent methods and show their work. I've recommended this one here before, it is set in the 16th century and is written from the viewpoints of multiple characters. Lots of plotting and planning by everyone that involves alchemy, inventions, currency and stock manipulation, the royal society, bankrupting countries, cryptography, faking deaths, the English succession, round the world trading voyages, prison breaks, etc..

One would need to have a classical British education and speak at least a few languages (including a couple dead ones) to even come close to understanding /every/ mythic allusion, untranslated snippet or nod to folklore. But I also imagine that comprehension/enjoyment of the book scales fairly well with "cognitive intelligence," just based on the sheer amount of wordplay and literary techniques he uses. Good memory and close reading skills are also rewarded.

As mentioned, certain niche areas of expertise will have outsize contributions to a given reader's enjoyment; as a lifelong Greek mythology buff I got a lot of mileage out of the whole Odyssey framework. Intimate knowledge of the Old and New Testaments, the history of Ireland, or the minutiae of Roman Catholic dogma/tradition/psalms would also be of great use. But even without any such specific knowledge, just having a good vocabulary and command of English (both linked to but obviously not the same as cognitive intelligence) will grant a better understanding of the book.

Just in case you end up reading it, I highly recommend reading certain parts aloud. Joyce was very aware of the Odyssey's origins as an oral tradition, and much of /Ulysses/ is written to be harmonious when read aloud.

** After binge-reading half a dozen Worm fanfictions, I thought I'd leave my impressions here for anyone else who enjoyed Worm and is looking for more in-universe content. These stories aren't generally super rational, but if you've read Worm you know what to expect. In no particular order:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wake-worm-au-complete.305014/][Wake]]: Basically a must-read if you liked Worm. These two completed stories follow a regular bug-controlling Taylor as she attempts to dismantle all of the gangs in Brockton Bay after her father is killed in a bombing spree. Probably the closest-to-source adaption of Taylor's personality, all around an excellent story.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/collagen-worm-altpower-complete.578045/][Collagen]]: An alt-power fic of Taylor with Marquis' power: creating and controlling bones. Another solid, completed story that sticks pretty close to the main story beats of the original, but with Taylor becoming an independent cape instead of joining the PRT or a villain team.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acceleration-worm-au.284714/][Acceleration]]: Taylor gets the powers of Accelerator from ACMI. Pretty OP, and closer to a crack-fic than most others on the list, but I still found it enjoyable enough to read the entire thing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/][Glassmaker]] Pretty much the most wholesome thing you can think of. Its a short, slice-of-life style story about Taylor with the power to eat various materials and make stuff out of them. No conflict, just pure WAFF.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] A self-insert in the Worm universe of a new Tinker who is connected to Jumchains' Celestial Forge(?) instead of a regular shard. I'll admit I don't know much about the crossover material, but its essentially a large pool of various Tinker abilites from other fiction works. The story is ongoing and pretty solid, though I feel it suffers from spending more time explaining the new tinkering abilities than actually using them to make anything. Still, that's probably partially due to having to wait for weekly releases, which makes me impatient for more content. Despite all that it solidly caught my interest, so I'd recommend checking it out.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/it-gets-worse-worm-au-fanfic-complete.366768/][It Gets Worse]]: Very much a crack-fic, Taylor gets a different shard -- one that causes random unlucky events to happen to anyone who wishes her harm. Features incidents like death via falling piano and other such shenanigans. Quite amusing, if not terribly serious.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-friends-like-these-altpower-taylor-worm.312205/][With Friends Like These...]]: Controlling insects is too easy -- instead Taylor gains control of all three Endbringers, who spend most of the time in Chibi form in her backpack. Another lighthearted read that has lots of fun moments of other characters discovering exactly what her powers are.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/][A Cloudy Path]]: A Worm/Supreme Commander crossover where Taylor gains Tinker abilities related to making machines from the SC universe. Much more serious, similar to Cenotaph and Wake in exploring Taylor's personality and fears, while focusing on slow character growth. Its a very long story but unfortunately not complete, but despite that I'd still recommend taking a look if you like a more serious tone.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/alchemical-solutions-worm-exalted-story-only-thread.283060/][Alchemical Solutions]] The only quest (afaik) in the list, this is a Worm/Exalted crossover where Taylor dies in the locker and is reborn in a new Alchemical body. The story starts off similar to the source material, but around the time the S9 show up things start to spiral out of control.

He gets more creative later on, bringing in new villains but it just feels like a missed opportunity. All in all, I think I would've been better off reading a different 1.6+ million words. On the other hand, it did get me into Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, which still has a flourishing playerbase on FAF, so it wasn't a total waste of time.

** Putting in a request for stories that have kingdom building/societal restructuring as a primary conflict.

The list of stories I'm familiar with include:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]](HPMOR, finished): Rat!Harry and co tries to reshape society after the end of HPMOR. I find the complexity of the plots to strain plausibility a little.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/#post-27571185][Purple Days]](ASOIF, ongoing): Timelooped Joffrey that tries to gather Westeros to battle the night army. Does a good job at instilling a sense of awe and comraderie but it's a little difficult to get into MC's head.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gospel-of-the-lost-gods-asoiaf-worm.760033/#post-58501312][Gospel of the New Gods]](ASOIF/Worm, ongoing): Isekai Taylor and a hero team to the world of ASOIF in which they call themselves gods and try to create a community for themselves. Interesting and believable politics and intergroup conflicts that are phrased so I end up caring about them. The author have a billion ongoing stories and I feel somewhat doubtful that it'll finish.
- Worth the Candle(Isekai/metanarrative rpg, ongoing) has super interesting elements of kingdom building but they are not the focus and there are so many (exciting) things happening that the kingdom building parts takes a background role.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/#post-65418408][Kill them all]](Worm/Gamer, ongoing): Taylor with powercopying gamer powers that can travel to other fictions. It has an ongoing plotline that is continually brought up with involve building a community in an apocalypse zombie-infested world. The murderhobo mentality and the self-righteous attitude feels like a strawman for the argument of killing villains, and frankly it's grating, but I've been able to roll with it so far.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time/chapter/477232/chapter-1-beginnings][An advance in time]](Isekai/upload, No update in 3 month so dead?): A guy is accidentally uploaded with a high tech 'modern' company and accepts a task to build a kingdom in a simulated 'medieval' world. Fair ammount of uplift. I enjoyed the kingdom building aspects and how insights in how the company tries to make money on it. Stopped updating just as it felt the ball were starting to really get rolling.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8979811/][Amalia]](Worm, complete): Panacea starts actually using her power and collects a team of overpowered individuals. Aside from solving a bunch of problems and fighting end bringers with zerg-inspired monstrocities, there are some(if not enough) focus the politics of multiple dimensions and building a kingdom in one of them.
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A hero's War]](Isekai, dunno): I'm being told it's about uplift and while the MC does do some kingdom building I felt the kingdom building efforts dragged on without payoff and found it difficult to connect with the characters, so I stopped around chapter 50.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire/chapter/300519/prologue][Enlightened Empire]](Isekai, dunno): MC is isekaid into an exiled prince and after king dies he gets a piece of the kingdom and tries to build an uplifted kingdom. I threw it away around chapter 200 because the the incompetence of the antagonists(which a lot of the plot were centered around) became unbearable.

*** Release that Witch is a Japanese +LN+ WN that is pretty much entirely focused on kingdom building/uplift. I haven't read the whole thing but what I did read was decent. There were some story beats that were a little /too/ convenient, but nothing that outright broke the story.

Life Reset/ New Era Online is a published Kindle Unlimited series originally on Royalroad that features a VRMMO player trying to build a settlement as a monster race. Solid, published-level writing and a cohesive story, though I felt it was missing a bit of that spark that some of those rougher works have. Still, nothing to complain about.

Safehold by David Weber is a huge published book series about a cybernetic avatar who wakes up hundreds of years after they were put in stasis to find the world has been stuck in the middle ages by a global religious institution. Probably one of my personal favorite stories ever, though with all David Weber books they are so full of detail sometimes it feels like you might choke.

Yeah, there are 9 books that cohesively wrap up the story in a nice package. There's apparently a tenth book as well that basically just a collection of timeskips after the main plot that show what characters are doing years later, but I haven't read it.

Not sure how you define "picking up" but the world gets a lot busier and more interconnected as the series goes on. Allies and enemies around the planet get more screen time so to speak, and as the war becomes global it opens up lots of action and characters. The writing style itself doesn't really change though.

** I have never seen this being recommended here but I recently stumbled upon [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][he who fight with monster]] on royalroad. I was surprised that I have only just found this now.

The genre and premises are a bit like your typical litrpg isekai but the writing is really good. The world-building is also superb and rational like. The protagonist is a clever smart ass that likes to nitpicking small stuff and make a reference to culture from his original world. As an outworlder, his power is uncommon and can be a bit OP but far from unheard of.

Another aspect of the novel that I like is the author willingness to explore stuffs which only briefly touched or just straight ignored in other isekai literature. This includes things like the identity and psychological aspect of someone who just moved world. In one chapter, the protagonist was described as vulnerable and exposed since his decisions in this world can be a matter of life and death. His principles are being put to the test, and he was forced to confront what it means when they bend or even break. Furthermore, the only thing he brought to the new world is his value from his own world, which often clashes with the local values. For me, this kind of exposition really enhances the story telling.

I was surprised this novel is on the first page of Best Rated novel on royalroad. So, if you haven't read it, I recommend giving this one a go.

  Non human how?
#+end_quote

I'd say there should be two main elements.

1. The character has thought patterns and values distinct from human. E.g., Mud is a maximizer AGI dead set on trying to achieve a certain goal, and Shade Touched's MC is your typical LitRPG monster that was born with self-awareness and insatiable curiosity. Both of them have thought patterns that no human would have, and their goals are also quite different from what you would normally read in a fantasy.

2. The character being different as described above prevents them from fully integrating with human/other sapient society. Or, at least, prevents them from dealing with the same problem a human adventurer might have. (This is why I /didn't/ put Super Minion on the list; he tries his best to pass as a human, so I can easily see his late game being the same as for any other MC in a superhero setting.)

*** Surprisingly enough, Blue Core is pretty rational. There are explicit scenes that require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but none of them are really integral to the story, and they are labeled, so you can skip them. The MC actually discusses his build and options to his companions, and tries to optimize it. The powerful enemies are also smart and resourceful, and generally don't hold the idiot ball.

I'd also recommend Ar'Kendrythist. It's not /that/ rational, but the worldbuilding and magic system are robust, and the characters always seem three dimensional. It's definitely on the level of something like Delve in terms of rationality, and personally I like it more. The magic is more mystical though, and the mc is middle aged and at first fairly set in his ways. It takes time for him to really come to terms with the new world.
