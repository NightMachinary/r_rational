**** Use rationalreads as your backend commenting and rating system, and as a result every new story posted gets uploaded to rationalreads (along with the appropriate chapter links and description).

This way your website gets visiblity to exactly the audience you're looking for (your value prop), and rationalread's rating algorithm gets more data (their value prop).

***** Hmm, I don't think I'll use it as a backend, but I like the idea of automatically reposting stories over there. I'll think about it and then contact the author, maybe we can figure something out =)

** Is there any possibility of automating the transfer of stories from other fic-hosting sites?(Similar to what AO3 does for all websites but FFN)

*** I already have a script that imports stories from FFN, I just haven't built an interface for it yet. This feature is definitely coming.

For now, if you want to import your stories from any site - just let me know, and I'll do that for you.

Sorry for that, now all should be fixed.
