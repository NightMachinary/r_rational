** Amazing episode, thank you very much for making it!! The part where you have brainstormed and explored the world together was super valuable, it's really cool to see your thinking process, I would love to hear more of that stuff!! It would be awesome if you would try to plot a story arc or write an episode outline or develop a character. Witnessing what goes throgh your head as you do this is extremely useful.

If I were to live in the splitting-people world, and could control which half gets what, I would probably put the top 50% of my traits(best qualities, memories, skills) into one half, the remaining 50%(flaws, fears, traumatic and sad things) into another half. Then, right after splitting, the cool part would immediately put the unlucky guy out of his misery. That way, over a few generations, I could breed myself into a superhero.

*** Glad you enjoyed it! I enjoyed it too, and with some more forethought we can probably do it for future topics as well.

Interesting idea, I wonder how much evolution in such a world select against such behavior. After all, anyone that decides to do a thing like that is putting all their genetic eggs in one basket. Also, at some point you'll have to be sacrificing useful things too. I wonder if people carefully would parcel out their time in such a world, allotting certain amounts of time to each activity so as not to spend more than 50% of their life on things their "real" child won't be able to keep...

** Hey everyone, welcome back! Today Alexander and I discuss Bottom Up Storytelling, bring up common pitfalls to avoid, and explore some homespun examples.

Alex's recommendation for this week is a scifi book called [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345460367/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=dayeld-20&linkId=a407ea0065f7d3a4c8acc59469c936c8][The Integral Trees]] by Larry Niven. The central idea is that of a gas torus surrounding a neutron star with no planet. This gives a breathable atmosphere but only very weak microgravity. All of the other features of the world are drawn from that starting point, from the titular trees (which are 100 kilometers long and tidally locked), to the trilateral symmetry of the inhabitants, to the globes of water that float freely in orbit. Niven started from a solid core idea and extrapolated from there, which is the major strength of this book. While there is a plot, much of the path that plot takes it to showcase the world that the plot takes place in, which adds in travelogue elements and is very typical of Niven. If you want to give it a listen, [[http://www.audible.com/t1/30trial_at?source_code=PDTGBPD060314004R][Audible]] is offering a free 30-day trial with one book credit to our listeners, which helps to support this show.
