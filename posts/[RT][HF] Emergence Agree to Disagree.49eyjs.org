** Could you give some more info on what this is and what makes it [RT]? As it stands I don't even know if its a short story or a single chapter of something bigger without committing the time to read it.

*** It's a chapter in a much bigger story with emphasis on realism. It starts with team RWBY coming to our world and escalate into bigger scope.

We're nearing the point of first contact with Remnant proper even as the world came to grasp with the reality of fiction becoming reality.

**** How enjoyable do you think it would be for someone who knows nothing whatsoever about RWBY?

***** I think quite enjoyable, but I knew RWBY before reading the story.
