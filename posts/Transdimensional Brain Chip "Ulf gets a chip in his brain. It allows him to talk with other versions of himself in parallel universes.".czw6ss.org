** This comic hasn't been reposted in four years ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/][link 1]], [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/35ayz7/transdimensional_brain_chip_now_finished/][link 2]]), so I think it's time. The art is godawful and the beginning is very slow (A/B testing is the first thing any moron would do with this power, which makes sense since Ulf starts out the story as a random moron but is boring to get through) but once it gets going it gets /really/ good. Existential risk, the anthropic principle, weaponized memetics, applied utilitarianism... truly a must-read for any rationalist.

** I'm about halfway through. This is fucking hilarious. Making the protagonist an idiot was definitely the right move.

Edit: Wow, that really escalated! It was a lot of fun. One thing I'm confused about: How did Aisha manage to outnumber Ulf? Every time one of herselves split, shouldn't that have created a new universe with a new brain-virused, chip-connected Ulf? Or maybe it wasn't literally creating new universes, just connecting her with similar ones, but it still shouldn't have been possible for her to outnumber him because there'd still be a chip-connected Ulf in every universe she connected to by pressing the button in a universe where she hadn't defeated him yet. Maybe there were multiple, isolated Ulf networks, each of which originated with a different universe's Original Ulf getting the surgery, and Aisha was able to access universes across more than one Ulf network while each Ulf could only access within his own network? I guess that last idea works, although there might be a simpler solution I haven't thought of.

*** You are thinking that every time Aisha clicked the remote a new universe was created, but if you reread the very first comic, you'll see that the universe is naturally splitting over and over every second. The remote is just connecting Aisha with another Aisha from an identical universe that split at the same time as the remote being pressed. So Ulf doesn't split when Aisha does.

**** Right, but see my edits. Every time an Aisha presses the button while her Ulf is active and has a working chip, the "new" universe she connects to must also have an active Ulf with a working chip, so there should always be a connected Ulf for every newly connected Aisha, excepting any Aishas split off from universes without a connected Ulf. Which would make it difficult if not impossible for her to outnumber him. I think it works if there are multiple Ulf networks that are separate from each other, so each individual Aisha has access to a much larger network than the one she's competing against.

#+begin_quote
  Every time someone "splits" (bearing in mind that the chip didn't actually split anything, but connected to a universe that diverged at the same moment), all other networks in that universe (still 1 per chipped person though) are split wholesale, but while the splitter's chip connects the two resultant versions, no such process happens for the other networks. So while in a sense there may be more individual Ulfs, each Aisha split does not increase anyone's network size but her own.

****** It's confusing to think about because it seems to imply that when a non-Ulf splits a universe with an Ulf in it, it results in a duplication of the entire Ulf-network, with the "original" and newly-diverged Ulfs each only having access to one of the networks. So when Aisha splits...why doesn't that double her entire network instead of increasing it by one? Or does it? Early on she went from 2 connected selves to 3, which suggests a button press does only add one new Aisha.

  Ulf's doublings doubled his whole network, because each happened at the same time in every universe. Since Aisha's was triggered by the button, one version of her splitting doesn't split all the others.

******** Oh, that I get, but I mean that it sounds like when /Aisha/ splits, Ulf's entire network is duplicated so that there are two complete, isolated parallel networks. Because Aisha A and Aisha B each have an Ulf, and each Ulf is connected to as many Ulfs as he was pre-split.

  Every moment, our universe splits into a gazillion other universes.

The second strip? The first split? That's playing out a gazillion times with a gazillion other Ulfs A and Ulfs B, who will have each split seven gazillion times by the time of the second split. Every time there's a number denoting total Ulfs? Multiply that number by infinity. There are infinite Aishas A and Aishas B. A human meat-brain just can't write that story.

EDIT: Rearranged the order of some sentences, nothing was added or removed.

** Plot hole: The button is too powerful. As soon as Aisha had figured out how to make it safe to expand, she could have simply precommitted to pressing the button a bunch of times, so that all her split-offs would press it too, yielding exponential growth. She must have done something like this to get a network of 10 million within 3 days. But the story vastly underestimates that kind of growth. She could have easily gotten a network bigger than the square of Ulf's within /one minute/, as soon as it was possible to spread with impunity. Then she could have easily outclassed Ulf's network in any world with better antivirus technology, and once she had done it once she could have done the same in every world in her network.

The biggest plothole isn't really that Aisha didn't do that, however. It's that /Ulf/ somehow didn't manage to figure out how to speed up the splitting process in his chip, especially since it was apparently an arbitrary limitation. He specifically shows that he has access to brain-computer interface technology, and yet not one of his millions of copies figured that it should work on improving his chip, or even just removing the timer, given that it too is brain-computer interface technology, and it's the most useful piece of technology he has! It doesn't make sense to argue that he was distracted by his world manipulation or his religious wars either: world manipulation becomes much easier the more computing power you have, and the first religious faction to successfully remove the timer from the chip would instantly and totally dominate the network.

*** I think we're meant to infer that once Aisha defeated Ulf, she set about implementing her own vision of utopia, which is what we see in the epilogue. We don't really need to know exactly how she did that; we saw how easily Ulf took over Earth once his own smarts and resources had snowballed enough, so we can assume that Aisha similarly took over Earth with ease as soon as her competition was out of the way.

** If you get the power to split into four time lines or split once and then split again at a separate time what would you do?

Power works like this does, you can fade in and out, you can communicate by thought, to pay attention you can't be distracted.

Isn't it best to split into four immediately? But then the time lines will drift apart.

Perhaps you wait until before a big decision?

One use is during exams you can assign each of you to a specific topic then copy each other during the exam. Of course then you won't learn everything which could be an issue.

**** Bit of a necro, but I still think it's a bit of a horrifying world. She's letting countless people die that she could save because she somehow thinks that's less evil than just using her nanotech to regulate reproduction, and her brain-hack motivates sole focus on average happiness, which might be OK if you're the sort of utilitarian that really thinks that should be the sole factor, but I value things like freedom even in the absence of an associated increase in happiness.

** One point where I think the comic is wrong:

The universes can interact through the chip, so this means the universes are entangled with each other. This should mean that a split by /any/ Ulf should split the entire 'multiverse', so it would double /all/ the Ulfs. So the rate of growth is not just 2^{# of splits}, instead each Ulf only committing 2 splits (from their perspective) is enough to diverge to infinity instantly. A single Ulf deciding not to split a second time will cancel the infinite doubling though.
