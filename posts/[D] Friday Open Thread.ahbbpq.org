Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I recently started rewatching Stargate: Atlantis on amazon prime, a show that I haven't seen since childhood. Almost done with season 1, and so far it holds up /extremely well/. In fact, it's even better than I remember it, especially when episodes are watched back-to-back so the season-long arc becomes crystal clear.

The show does so many things well:

- Great cast playing lovable characters
- Great chemistry between the characters
- Great soundtrack, as per usual for a Stargate show
- Extensive subtle references to classic sci-fi, including Star Trek, Apollo 13, and Alien
- Usage of good-old-fashioned hand-painted vistas as backdrops
- Great balance between season arc and episode arcs
- Interesting moral dilemmas
- Pretty good technobabble
- Half the episodes barely even have a conflict because they are just about the thrill of discovery
- Characters learn from past episodes and tend not to make the same mistakes twice
- Characters generally cover the obvious possibilities when making their plans

Sure, the characters are no rationalists, and they do sometimes hold the idiot ball or conveniently forget some amazing technology they encountered in a previous episode, but no more than any other serial television show, and probably much less. (Without idiot balls, most TV shows wouldn't exist at all). The main villains, the Wraith, are quite campy in design, but I actually like this, because it fits the tone of the show quite well. There is the convenient fact that literally everyone, human or alien, on every planet, somehow magically speaks perfect idiomatic modern English, but I'm fine with this suspension of disbelief, because it allows plots to move forward without the same annoying translation problems every episode.

When I think of the constraints placed on the show by budget and tone, I actually think the worldbuilding is rather genius. The Wraith are a clear nod to Alien, while their campiness takes the edge off the horror to preserve the mostly lighthearted tone. And the fundamental premise, that ancient humans spread colonies around the galaxy which are now mostly in a primitive fallen state co-existing with mysterious ancient technology, not only allows the showrunners to save lots of money on set pieces and character designs, but it also makes for very interesting plot dynamics.

I was also impressed by the number of times I was thinking, "why don't they just solve their problem with this?", only for one of the characters to raise that point in the very next scene and either incorporate it into the plan or explain why it won't work. ("Why is a storm threatening this powerful ancient city?" "Oh, it's because they relied too much on their shield, but now we don't have enough power for it."; "Why don't we go back to that one planet and get that one thingy" "Oh yeah, good idea, let's puts that on the table"; "Why don't the wraith dial into stargates to prevent people from escaping?" "Oh wait, they actually do use that tactic when they need to")

I'm sure there are plenty of other flaws in the show, but so far I'm loving it enough that those don't matter.

*** I also loved that show growing up!

I haven't done much rewatching of it, but I remember two things that struck me back then, when I'd compare the first season to the 4 following seasons.

1) The costuming. An in-depth analysis of fine technical details is beyond me, but I definitely felt like the costuming improved after season 1: somewhat in the outfits worn by the main cast, but mainly in the diversity of Wraith characters that later appeared.

2) Later season arcs. I remember and really enjoyed how the first season gradually developed into the 3-part finale (the third part being the premier of season 2). But later seasons didn't feel as established to me; as interesting as later season finales were, the development didn't seem as strong.

But then again, my impressions may also benefit from a solid rewatch of the series. Just two things I thought I'd share.

*** I am appalled by you liking Atlantis! It holds no candle at all to to original Stargate. No part of the setting makes any sense at all. Wraith suck "life energy" which ages the victim? They are not even trying for any kind of pseudoexplanation. Welcome to fantasy land, vampires were just in at the time of writing.

The McKay character is so very socially incompetent and clichee that its offensive to nerds anywhere - his very mode of operation is to ignore common decency, chain of command, endanger his team. If one were to tally up the the numbers on how often he safed the team vs how often he fucked up, I am sure it'd come up as a deficit.

The Magical McGuffin that are ZPMs annoy me to noend. "Basically unlimited" energy, except that they run out every second episode.

About the only good pieces of Atlantis is this predeployment rat!fic [[http://synecdochic.dreamwidth.org/122553.html]] and some of the old character episodes.

**** I have to disagree with you.

The process of Wraith feeding was described as a complex physiological process that /resembled/ physical aging. More details would have been welcome, sure. But from the scientist characters' perspective: it is at first something that they've never seen before, getting samples of Wraith to analyze is dangerous, and for the few body parts and corpses that were recovered over the course of 5 seasons, those analyses would take time.

McKay may have suffered in the consistency of his character development, depending on the writer, but I doubt he was ever that bad. His most catastrophic failure in the series, in "Trinity", only endangered himself and Shepherd (before the Daedalus intervened).

As for the ZPMs... first, I give them a pass under Clarke's Third Law. Second, they were never described as unlimited, just huge. And while every second episode in the first season might have revolved around looking for them, I cannot remember a single episode post-season 1 that revolved around a ZPM running out. Feel free to remind me, if there's one you specifically have in mind. Also, I question calling the ZPM a McGuffin; the characters need one in order to supply (huge) power to Atlantis, and once the have finally have one they are able to access more of Atlantis' capabilities, like the shield. They story doesn't have them search for one purely for the sake of searching for it.

***** There were, strictly speaking, three times the ZPMs ran out or needed replacement past season one.

When experimenting with universe bridges, sending alternate!McKay back to his universe drained the ZPM, which later allowed the (thus shield-less) city to be taken over by replicators. The replicators installed their own ZPMs, a full set of three even, which the expedition kept when the replicators were defeated. Of these, one was taken to power Earth's drone chair, one was installed on the Odyssey, and the third remained in Atlantis to power the shield.

When Atlantis fled the planet to avoid the Replicators' satellite beam weapon, taking a glancing, unshielded hit to the main tower in the process, the resulting energy leakage drained the ZPM over the course of about a day. Unable to land on a planet without one, the Replicator homeworld was raided to acquire another ZPM, at the expense of their main trump card - the ARG - which they had to abuse enough that the Replicators ended up adapting to it.

Finally, since the city can't normally fly without a full complement of three ZPMs, they had to be given another two by Todd in the series finale. (Don't get me started on /everything else/ about that finale, though.)

Of course, these were rare, exceptional events, and the assessment that they "run out every second episode" is blatantly exaggerated.

**** Haven't seen the original Stargate in a very long time, so I don't have a comparison, but...

- Literally all TV shows do things similar to what you describe. Like, literally all. If I rewatched SG1 I'm sure I could come up with similar criticisms. If I held TV to rationalist standards I wouldn't be watching any TV at all (maybe that would be for the best)
- I am therefore willing to suspend disbelief regarding characters who would have been fired in the real world
- Stargate Atlantis is just loads of light fun for me, and a callback to when I was a kid

Edit:

Also, regarding Wraiths, the lifesucking is a perfect plot device for television, because it provides a villain without being too graphic in violence on screen. And speaking of magical McGuffins... this is a universe based on magical stargates that make no physical sense... you just sort of go with it. The physics is not the point.

I wish that the response had been more like, "I'm glad you liked it, because I had a hard time finding the Wraiths interesting due to the lack of explanation on their energy draining power, really took me out of the show."

I don't know if I am supposed to read sarcasm into it or some kind of playfullness, but if the original poster didn't read those things in, well, this does seem kinda mean, and it would be cool if we were all careful about that, because tone isn't present in text unless you really go out of your way to be explicit about what you are conveying.

** This might be a little weird but I really enjoyed [[https://youtu.be/f-K6b6mPnkM][Tangled: the series]] and been following the second season now. For someone that spends lots of time working, an idealist and relaxing adventure show is great. I can see where the SoL appeal in anime is.

I also loved the twist of a supporting cast character becoming the big bad, and seeing all the hints there makes all the previous interactions take on a new light. The fact he becomes evil because of all the abuse and faults the "heroes" inflicted on him makes more sense than other series villains and feels slightly rational, making me instantly side with him.

Plus I'm a sucker for scientists and one man industrial revolutionaries in fantasy worlds.

The world feels so lively and the writers made good dialogue and chemistry between the characters without making them overly childish, which surprised me and made me feel less guilty about watching a cartoon usually pushed to the "little girl" demographic lol.

The romance keeps progressing and is refreshing to see the main character change and develop a wider emotional range across the episodes, and have intimate interaction and support between the two lovers unlike other series that try to stall any romantic development until the end.

They even got the original movie cast to voice the characters and the art style and color palette is relaxing and makes sense if you read the reason they used it. IMO one can feel the passion behind the project and I wish it had more fans, especially people I could discuss it with.

** I've just finished Chapter 31 of Pokemon: The Origin of Species. Unmarked non-specific spoilers for up to that point below.

I'm getting a little exhausted from the constant near-death experiences (said the guy who likes wildbow stories). If what Red, Blue, and Leaf are going through is in any way typical for new trainers, how on earth does anyone make it out of their first year? I don't think mortality rates have been explicitly stated, but yeesh they must be terrible. And this is with a trio that seems like they're probably in the top percentage of +rattata+ 12 year olds in terms of experience, preparedness, and intelligence.

...oh hey I was double checking on the age and found my way to the FAQ. Let me check that out...

(wait does the Temeraire series eventually address how dragons are treated seriously? I only read the first trilogy and after the one person who brought that up turned out to be the villain I didn't think it would be relevant anymore).

Alright then. I don't really have a problem with the justification for smarter than average kids or kids doing something this dangerous- especially since these kids in particular have good reason to be that way, and the world is definitely dangerous enough to justify it. In general I'm liking that- I love the idea of the legendary birds being an endbringer-ish sort of threat.

It's not the suspension of disbelief over plot armor that's getting to me so much that the constant "almost dying" on the road is a bit oppressive. I'd like to see the cast deal with problems that aren't just life or death battles. I liked the Pewter city chapters because we finally got a chance to /breathe/, and to see the characters actually in their element.

Sorry if I'm rehashing old ground here, I haven't looked at any other reviews or discussion but I'm sure there's a reason the FAQ lead with those questions. I am definitely enjoying the story.

I don't think RBG are typical new trainers. The mortality rate is probably pretty bad, but RBG intentionally dive into any crisis situation they possibly can. Though also, I'd expect higher fertility rates too.

*** I think the early wild Pokemon attacks are kind of a point the author is trying to make. How many times did you get attacked by wild Pokemon when just trying to travel from place to place in the games? The early areas are especially bad for that because they don't even have a path from point A to B that isn't overgrown with weeds that Pokemon like to nest in.

The random brushes with death let up later on and are replaced with brushes with death that result from the group doing something stupid like ignoring warnings from the rangers and rushing into a situation they are unprepared for. Not sure if that's much better but at least you know to expect it or that you don't need to worry as much. Even the +endbringers+ legendary birds follow somewhat predictable patterns because of the weather.

*** The fake news trend has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with the fact that a single major tabloid holding company owns most of the nation's news companies. Information services are in a uniquely powerful position to shape the behaviors of groups of humans and that's exactly what Newscorp did . They grew so powerful that they were able to get a permanent exception from certain FCC rules that nobody else got. As a result they control close to half of periodical information publications (also including things like tv and radio).

So they publish fake news with some branches and the kind of stuff that will make you more likely to get caught up in fake news stories through other branches.

They're so powerful that other companies are copying the same business models and making the problem that much worse.

It's probably been like 25ish years since the last time I watched Mary Poppins. There's a lot more to it than I expected there to be, in stark contrast with the books, which (in spite of their esoteric/mystical/occult/Theosophical symbolism) can scarcely be said to have a plot at all (they're basically nothing more than a series of disconnected vignettes). It's actually pretty good as a movie, not just within the subcategory of "movies made for children."

(Incidentally, the new movie actually /is/ utter shit; it succeeds well enough in replicating the /stylistic/ content of the original, I suppose, but has zero understand of the /thematic/ content of the original, to the point that only a modern Hollywood studio could possibly have made a followup so vacuous and empty.) I think that this is a fairly common narrative about Mary Poppins - many people are vaguely familiar with the Disney movie, but haven't really given it a deep watch, just associating it with vague memories and exaggerated cultural tropes, sometimes so strongly that they could actually watch the movie but pay no real attention to it and not notice what they're doing. Then some of them also read the original books, note the differences between the books and the movie, and decide that the movie is a broken or watered-down version of the books. (I think that similar processes must have been at play in the development of the new movie.) In actuality, the movie is its own thing, and I personally think it's an /extremely thematically coherent/ piece of /great art/. So, assuming that I'm correct that you rewatched it sometime after posting that comment, I'm very glad that you've come around. :)

**** Oh pish posh, Mary Poppins Returns isn't nearly as bad as all that.

Now, the Disney movies /are/ sanitized, in the sense that all of the non-Christian symbolism has been either stripped out or hidden. But they both have surprisingly prominent anti-capitalist themes, possibly stronger in MPR than in the OG MP, and I really think it's uncharitable to characterize MPR as "vacuous and empty." It might seem like they copied the plot of the original movie, but Mary Poppins Opens the Door had a plot that copied Mary Poppins Comes Back, and Mary Poppins Comes Back had a plot that copied Mary Poppins.

Incidentally, MPE is going to be quite a bit more involved than I initially thought. I've decided that Mary Poppins exists across the possibility space, that all the infinite versions of her are connected, less like Rick from Rick & Morty and more like the Lutece twins or Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite. The books show one version. The movies show two versions that are near each other in the possibility space. The one who I see... Well, look at the title. She's basically Kalki.

******* I mean, it /is/ somewhat of a meme, and there /are/ people who go along with it for reasons like what you've listed, but I've been "aware of" Pewds since 2012. I found him annoying back then, and Markiplier was similar but not annoying. There seemed to basically be individuals who played games by themselves with their face in the corner of the screen talking at the audience, and groups who played together without webcams talking to each other, and I mostly stuck with Markiplier and Achievement Hunter, one from each category.

I don't know what sparked it, but I started occasionally consuming Pewds's content in 2016 when he started vlogging on a more regular basis. At some point, he expressed some pretty strong disdain for Trump and I started watching him even more frequently. By early 2017 I was pretty much watching all of his daily uploads.

Then September came, and with it the incident on the bridge in PUBG. I was shocked that it happened, but it never made me think "oh man Pewds is really a secret racist nazi oh man how could he do this oh noes."

I really think it's a generational divide. It /is/ distasteful to use that word in anger while gaming, but people who came up during the beginnings of online multiplayer /should/ "get it". People get mad at you and they have nothing else to throw at you so they reach for the worst words they can think of. I was never all that big into the online multiplayer scene myself (I really find it pointless, it's like a sport except you don't even get the benefit of physical exercise, I had a friend who was big into those types of games and I've watched him sit through match after 15-minute-long match for multiple hours at a go, and I just don't see the appeal) but I came up during that several-years-long transitional period of gaming's development from niche thing that nerds did with LAN parties to mainstream thing that literally everyone does, and that's just how it is.

People will call you a "sum-guzzling digger-maggot" and threaten to "tape and girder" your relatives without a second thought, trash-talk is part of gaming and it's meant to be implicitly understood as hyperbolic and not taken literally. Or rather, that /used to/ be the case. I haven't played a non-singleplayer game in years. That probably isn't how it is nowadays. Gen Z seems to be too exceptionally prudish for trash talking to still be the way it was a decade ago.

Anyway, if people are confused as to why Pewds didn't lose a ton of fans after the incident it's because most of the people in the demographic his content is targeted at are aware of this stuff. I thought it was childish of him to allow a videogame to push his temper to the point where he would reach for the big lexical weapons, but English isn't even his native language. You can hear him over the last 6 years go from "Swede with a bit more fluency with English than average" to "Swede with noticeably more fluency with English than average, who strategically exaggerates his accent because it's become part of his brand" to "practically indistinguishable from an American." He didn't learn the n-word in Sweden. He learned it from the online multiplayer gaming community. I can't see it having the same associations for him as it would for someone in the American South who learned the word from the local community.

He went a long time without making gaming videos because people were getting tired of his shtick (and he's revealed in the last couple of years that he was getting tired of it too) so he did a bunch of vlogging for most of a year. Then PUBG came out, and it was a fun game to play, and it was interesting to watch, and he was decent at it and not playing it like "2013 Pewds" with the annoying commentary (and purposefully being bad at the game, because I think that's part of why people used to watch him), so his PUBG videos got decent views (I know they were probably the first gaming videos from him that /I/ had seriously watched because I legitimately found them entertaining), and he had just set up his streaming thing because youtubers all started streaming for some reason in 2017, and then he dropped the n-bomb and it was live and he couldn't edit it out and there it was.

But he learned the word in the "online multiplayer first person shooter" context, and he was trying to be more serious about gaming than he used to be, so he was taking it seriously and he let himself get mad and it came out. Childish, incredibly immature, but not indicative of racism.

Of course, I'm sure people disagree with my analysis of the reasons why he used the word, or with my rationale behind how someone could use the n-word without it being racist, but I don't really care. I don't for a moment believe (based on his past attitudes and behaviors and actions) that Pewdiepie is a racist and I /surely/ will not be convinced that he /is/ by someone who hasn't even consumed his content, and even if someone were to occasionally have checked out some of the videos he's posted over the last year or two, I wouldn't be convinced by them either because I wouldn't believe they were "seeing past the meme". Like, Pewds seems very much like he was getting tired of being a youtuber but he's reinvigorated himself by turning himself into a living meme, if you don't have several years and hundreds of hours of context I really feel like he's too impenetrable for a new viewer to "get it". There's probably a window between ages, like, 25 to 35 where /some/ of the people in that demographic "understand." I feel like most people older than that lack the cultural context and most people younger than that are too conservatively hypersensitive and prudish.

Anyhow, that's my rationale for believing that people who believe Pewdiepie is "problematic" don't know what they're talking about.

The other stuff you said is relevant as well. I feel like the internet was a bigger place from roughly 2006 to 2009, and I feel like it's incredibly small at the present, like, all there is is Youtube (and netflix and video streaming in general) and Reddit and social media, like, pretty much all I use the internet for on a daily basis nowadays is Google News and Youtube and Reddit, and sometimes Fanfiction Dot Net and the webcomics I follow (whittled down to just two of them over the years) and then of course random articles and Wiki entries for random things I decide to start researching. It's like the six corporations who own the planet seem to have strangled the internet down to a few choke points, and it's like they're trying to turn it all into television again and restrict access to information to what they want to dole out. That's part of it. Eff the corporations. This is OUR internet.

If you had all the hours of context from the dozens videos over whatever period of weeks leading up to that one video, you'd see that it was meant as a "look at what you can get away with paying people to do on Fiverr, they should probably ought to moderate their platform a little bit."

All you've seen of any of these issues has been completely devoid of context. I can't for the life of me find it, but I saw a quote (I think it was brought up in relation to the Elon Musk 60 Minutes interview) that went something to the effect of "careful editing is indistinguishable from outright fabrication." I assume "the little [you've] seen" comes entirely from reading articles about him. That means you're basing your opinion on misinformation.

People are allowed to compare people to Hitler, and doing so kinda implies that you think being compared to Hitler is a negative thing and kinda makes it actively NOT seem like you're promoting Hitler.

People are allowed to draw parallels between YouTube's policies and certain Nazi policies, and doing so kinda implies that you think being compared to Nazis is a negative thing and kinda makes it actively NOT seem like you're promoting Nazism.

Look at me, saying the words "Hitler" and "Nazi" over and over again, gosh I surely must hate Jewish people, huh?

This whole thing is confuffled by the fact that it's virtually impossible for the "Not Anti-Pewds" side to prove their point because doing so would require trawling through hours and hours of years-old videos and compiling evidence and then expecting people to devote the time to watch it and be disproved. People don't open themselves to being refuted. The media has already analyzed the situation and told them what to think about it, and that's the end of the story as far as they're concerned. I'm telling you as someone who watched all of his content from the periods in question that the media's portrayal of it has been exceptionally biased. That's as close to the truth as you're going to get without binge-watching hundreds of his old videos on your own. Until then, you haven't in any way convinced me that I should accept your assessment of the issue as an informed opinion and in turn alter my own assessment.

I very much like the internet like it is right now.

I can watch any TV series or cartoon I want, for free, right now, by going to a few different hosting websites. If any of these websites shut down, there's about 30 others providing the same. I can go on Github and download millions of projects in every programming language imaginable until I find the ones that match my needs. If I'm bored, I can spend hundreds of hours watching Tom Scott videos or reading Wikipedia articles and keep learning new things.

Honestly, from what you're saying, PewDiePie sounds like the very definition of "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", plus lots of internet tribalism that I really don't want to get into.

******* Area denial is possible, then. Imagine a floor covered in spikes made of the same material as the floor; if it phases through the spikes then it falls through the floor and if it doesn't then it hurts its feet.

But let's consider detection of such a being at all. Now, there is clearly /some/ interaction between this being and normal matter - if there is not, then it cannot see us and is merely in the universe next door. Specifically, if it can see, then there is some interaction with light - at least in the vicinity of the creature's eyes. It must absorb - at the very minimum - a percentage of the photons that pass through where its eyes are, so that it can see what's going on.

This implies the existence of a couple of eye-shaped 'dark patches' that move as it does. Perhaps nothing that you'd notice if you weren't deliberately looking for it, but there.

Now, it's possible that the alien technology or whatever is phase-shifting this person attempts to compensate for that by releasing new photons in the same place, removing the dark patch. However, this runs into another problem - processing delays. However fast the system is at replacing the light it took to see with, it cannot be /instantaneous/, and light travels as fast as it is possible to travel (without starting to mess with the equivalent of time travel). So, in this case, there would not be a shadow but there would be a time delay - if you were looking directly through a phase-shifted person's eyes, you might see a distant fast-moving object appear to jump a bit (or even be in two places at once for a moment).

It makes more sense (to me) to assume that the intangible person also has some means of flight - a personal jetpack or similar. But very well - either way, the spiky floor doesn't help.

We could try running a few thousand volts through the wall and seeing if that's enough to stop a phased person coming through, though I see no reason why it should be.

However, if they can see, then they're vulnerable to (at the very least) being blinded by very bright lights, and possibly even eye damage from */very/* bright lights.

Reproducing the light /perfectly/ isn't possible. Reproducing the light well enough to be indistinguishable to the human eye... /is/ most likely possible. So the phased person can't be picked up by sight. (But might be able to be picked up by very carefully watching super-high-speed-camera outputs for discrepancies - though you wouldn't do that unless you already had reason to suspect something).

*** I'm pretty sure that that statement doesn't make sense. First, what does "phase shifted" mean? Does that have something to do with intangibility? If so, that kind of axiomatically prevents it from interacting with physical phenomena like the double slit experiment. If it did, it would have to do something really weird, like muck up probability on a quantum scale.

I'm not sure the wave function refers to an actual wave, and if it did, then I'm not sure what it would mean for something to be "shifted" relative to it.
