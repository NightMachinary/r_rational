** It's good to see it confront some of the big problems people cite- older individuals taking positions of power in the economy, lack of innovation, people who are too old for easy treatment with anti aging serums, and seeing those challenges being overcome.

It'll be good to see the before and after. People mourning after losing parents to degenerative diseases and aging related sicknesses, and how they feel after it's ended.

Deal with how people handle those who died of aging before the treatments.

It'll be good to see some of the hypocrisy of people- the super rich who are morally against it seeking secret anti aging treatments.

It'll be good to see the old be restored to good health, enjoying physically and mentally intense adventures again.

** 1. You would need to address overpopulation immediately. I'd almost say you should address it before you release such a cure. I think somewhere around 15-ish people die every 10 seconds, and like 20 are born (super rough numbers, obviously) Not all of that is due to aging, but I'm sure a good portion of it is due to aging and diseases that would be cured by an aging cure. We'd run into scarcity problems after a few decades. Addressing it, in and of itself though, is tricky, as having babies is one of those things that people feel they should be in total control of, so any obvious attempts to curb that will be protested heavily.

2. How easy is this to produce? How expensive is it? Who's controlling such a cure? Something like this in the hands of someone who isn't very altruistic could have terrible consequences. I'm vaguely reminded of the rich people in /In Time/, that Justin Timberlake movie where time is currency, and everyone just stops physically aging at 25. They just live for centuries and keep a forced monopoly on stored time, enforcing the aristocracy.

Plus as long as human output over a lifetime is more than their input then overpopulation is a non-existence problem at large enough scale, until you reach the energy cap of the universe being consumed obviously.

If you do have a cure for aging, do not wait to "solve" overpopulation so millions and billions can die while you wait for a solution.

1) There is almost zero economical or personal incentive to do those things. The immediate immortality of all people changes that.

2) We can create inefficient sustainable habitats, enough solar panels can fuel anything. We already know all the theory behind mining such that there's even a few companies already out there. Just because we haven't built such a thing yet doesn't mean we couldn't.

3) Immortality would spark a technological revolution, there's not a larger incentive to develop sustainability or a quicker method of leaving than the surety that you have to suffer the downsides (rather than great great grandchildren). Plus however much output is invested in afterlife based religions which would I presume fall apart in immortality (people are unwilling to kill/delibrately endanger themselves with lifespan to get into afterlife) and other things like the death and health industry which are fueled by aging and aging related problems.

******** No, okay. Let me try. The point of curing aging is stopping people from dying. The long-term goal is for no one to die anymore, because death is bad. Ergo, any 'solution' to overpopulation that involves people dying, while technically valid, is still counterproductive and not the kind of solution we want to settle with or work towards.

Again, the real, long-term goal is total immortality for everyone who wants it. Not just young people who still die.

Next. Sterilization? No sane human society is going to agree to any form of forced sterilization, barring some hard, factual reasoning. You COULD try telling people "Hey, you can be immortal, but you need to sterilize yourself." But then they just have a few kids and sterilize themselves afterwards. That's definitely preferable to those people who will keep popping out babies as long as their immortal genitalia are functioning, but it's still not a solution.

Next. It's bad logic to presume that immortality would spark a technological revolution. What does immortality change in the world of science as it is today? You CAN posit that, with immortal scientists, the odds of sparking a revolution go up (since none of our scientists are dying off) but the odds don't go up nearly enough for you to say immortality will cause a revolution in and of itself.

Next.

#+begin_quote
  We can create inefficient sustainable habitats, enough solar panels can fuel anything
#+end_quote

This made me laugh a bit. It's simply incorrect. We have more to consider than just fueling issues.

- The components of our space station/ship/mars city aren't going to last forever. We need access to the materials that we use to build these things, for when things inevitably start to wear away and break down.

- We need a way to create water, air and food while floating through space.

- We need to ensure that our space settlement is positioned such we're getting enough sunlight to facilitate our needs

EDIT: We still haven't developed a way to escape Earth's orbit that doesn't require a massive dump of fossil fuels

And those are just what I thought of in maybe 5 minutes of typing. Look at how much constant upkeep goes into the cities we live in now. Settling elsewhere would mean we'd need to "science the shit" out of a few particular aspects of how we live, else our stations won't last very long. And before you say "Oh, we can get what we need from Earth", keep in mind the whole point of this resettling is leaving because the Earth's resources are becoming insufficient.

Anyway, finally: You stated that over population solves itself. I remain unconvinced. Just because people won't starve to death (and that's a leap in and of itself, as OP simply talked about curing aging, which in NO way implies we won't continue to need food and water) doesn't mean overpopulation won't have consequences.

Not really hard is it... at the end of the day you're the one suggesting that such an enormous number of deaths from overpopulation would demand that the inventor not release the immortality solution and so left billions die or be injured while he waits...

#+end_quote

I already told you. It has nothing to do with people "surviving", it's entirely to do with people's utility function now predicting a near infinite time horizon. It completely changes how people optimize behaviour. People might care about their kids to act well, but they certainly don't act in the interests of great great great great children. But if you're alive, and you predict you'll be alive in 100 years your incentive model is completely changed.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nothing will last forever. If you take sustainable to mean that then I admit that you are right and nothing in the universe is sustainable. The goal I intended is to last until new technology is invented.

You said that we couldn't do it, that it's literally impossible (which obviously is true if you're using last indefinitely but I'll ignore that and assume you mean like 100 years). That if in 5 years time the Earth would explode there (and everyone knew this and there were no more tech developments) there would be no life long space container with humans inside. Well you weren't so precise since you said cannot really I can do any scenario without tech development.

#+begin_quote
  We need a way to create water, air and food while floating through space.
#+end_quote

NASA already electrolyse their oxygen. As space stations are almost entirely self contained (no mass loss), with constant energy from the sun you can break and form bonds as much as you want.

We know how to do all those things, as I said it's just greatly inefficient. It's just turning waste back into usable products.

#+begin_quote
  We need to ensure that our space settlement is positioned such we're getting enough sunlight to facilitate our needs
#+end_quote

That's not hard when you're not locked to an planetary orbit lol. Just orbit the sun, or not, anywhere in space you're statistically likely not to be in shadow.

You confused me by saying "in space" when we were talking about on a body too. Where it's even easier to do all the above since you can just mine from the moon or Mars more resources. Though as I said we can do it mass neutrally anyway.

#+begin_quote
  We still haven't developed a way to escape Earth's orbit that doesn't require a massive dump of fossil fuels
#+end_quote

So what? That's not what you said. You just said we can't do that. I just said it was wrong, we could do it.

#+begin_quote
  And before you say "Oh, we can get what we need from Earth", keep in mind the whole point of this resettling is leaving because the Earth's resources are becoming insufficient.
#+end_quote

If we need to leave Earth because the resources are dwindling, then there will be motivations to make it more efficient. A space elevator is almost technically possible, if not already so (not kept up with carbon nanotubes of late) and that has the barest of funds.

Yes, I sure said that overpopulation won't have consequences. I said people would starve to death, not wouldn't. If you breed so much you can't feed yourself you die.

You said let people die until you figure out how to solve a problem that you believe has no solution for, so that's an indefinite problem. I don't want to die because someone listened to your advice and is sitting on immortality for the next three hundred years.

#+end_quote

The bane of you as an indefinite pronoun. You said the creator must find a solution to overpopulation prior to releasing immortality.

Needing to find one means that immortality could, under your logic, never be found, out of the fear that the population cannot contain itself and some other nebulous bad thing will happen involving overpopulation. You could never be certain of a "solution" working without releasing the immortality so that basically means it'll never be released, alternatively the "solution" takes millennia to discover and the counterfactual was say 90% of the current population die if immortality was released.

It isn't. It really isn't. Your body (barring some disease or trauma) will continue to produce gametes for however long you're young enough to do so. Especially in males.

** If you haven't yet, immediately read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy. The aging problems start in /Red Mars/ and only get worse in /Green Mars/ and /Blue Mars/. This is a world where people there's an effective anti-aging treatment, but it's not perfect, and can't solve all problems.

Some issues addressed in the book:

- Mourning people who die young, though accidents or disease
- Children who watch adults die 'early', when they had been told that people could live forever.
- People whose bodies longer than their brains can continue functioning, and people who are living through this process, realizing that it is happening to them.
- People who refuse to get the anti-aging treatment.
- Socioeconomic and political effects of having an ever-increasing population, many of whom might not be able to find jobs because the experienced workers aren't retiring.
- People coming out of retirement to work.
- People deciding not to have kids.
- Resource production and distribution, especially as regards food and shelter.
- Class warfare, if the thing that defeats aging is not widely available.

** Social -political implications, in particular inequality and social stasis - if the result is that the rich get richer forever, and that the relatively young form a permanent underclass, that would, to put it mildly, be socially destabilizing.

There have been various more- or-less hilarious proposed solutions to this. Periodic jubilees where all debt and all wealth are reset to zero. Every 50th birthday is an individual version of the same thing.

Less drastically, there are ideas like just having asset taxes that on the margin work out to absolute wealth caps - a world with multi-millionaires, but no billionaires, in effect. ¨

Forcible career changes on a 40 year rota - This might actually turn out to be pretty important just to keep people from ossifying.

overpopulation is actually a mild problem compared to this, because, well frankly, we are pretty good at building food production capacity. But if you get into a situation where most of the population thinks they're going to be servants to the plutocracy for all eternity, the world is going to burn.

** My initial reaction was a smirk and a shake of the head. "We'lol never get there!"

Next, I realized that THIS REACTION could easily be said about a number of things we now take for granted.

We send invisible messages to each other through the air.

We fly in airplanes around the world.

We sent a man to the moon. It was in the context of a Cold War space race to demonstrate technological superiority.

These feats required an immense infrastructure, the right combination of economic and cultural values and I'm sure there are other common themes.

Pick a historical context for disease and death and research the reactions of the conservatives and progressives of the time to see what issues came up. (A big task -- one that I'm working on for my own Rational story on "Medics and Magics")
