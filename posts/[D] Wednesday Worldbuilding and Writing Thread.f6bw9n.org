Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Does anyone have suggestions for stories involving realistic population genetics and forced selective evolution in humans? It occurs to me that most of the popular points of reference on the topic (e.g. [[https://diyhpl.us/%7Ebryan/papers2/bio/The%20use%20and%20misuse%20of%20Brave%20New%20World%20in%20the%20CRISPR%20debate%20-%202019.pdf][Brave New World]], or [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh][Star Trek]]) are not particularly literate, usually being structured as morality tales.

One missing element I'm thinking of is the concept of genetic purging, where harmful mutations are reduced in frequency in population bottlenecks due to inbreeding, which causes recessive alleles to be expressed. The usual way "eugenic science" is portrayed in fiction is with a "master race" that is pure-bred and therefore considered fitter than the base population, but with this effect it's actually kind of the other way around (inbred organisms are normally /less/ fit, and this gives a chance for the bad mutations to die out, such that later generations of the inbred strain can strengthen the base population when they outbreed).

So a dystopian scenario about a villain / villainous regime that wants to make fitter humans while not caring about the cost to the individuals involved, might involve setting up many groups of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234482/][70 or so]] individuals that are only permitted to be fertile within their group. The genes of these strains of humanity would be made available to the base population of humanity, but not vice versa, making them net producers of /filtered/ genetic diversity.

Another way to use inbred strains would be to create hybrids, as is commonly done in plants. Members of a given inbred group are near-clones (so there's quality control), and when mixed 50/50 with any other such group that is dissimilar, you get a robust cross that has some attributes of both, and none of the recessive alleles. This is different from crossing the inbred strain with the base population because the 50/50 cross is just as predictable as the inbred variant. While hybrids are fertile, their offspring do not have predictable traits. Hybrid individuals, although and mentally and physically fit, would be plausible targets for sterilization in the name of social order or what have you.

*** The first example that springs to mind for me is the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)][Dune]]/ books by Frank Herbert. In his series, the Bene Gesserit have a long-term, galaxy-wide human breeding program mainly based on political manipulation, arranged marriages, and subtly guided diaspora. A main character in one of the books creates a separate human breeding program based on controlled marriages within a single population. Also, the Tleilaxu faction in the series does lots of cloning with genetic manipulation.

You might also look to the example of the Cetagandans in Lois McMaster Bujold's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga#%22Vorkosiverse%22][Vorkosigan saga]]. They are a technologically advanced galactic empire with a rigidly tiered hierarchy of so-called genetic perfection. Each tier is relegated to different societal roles, and the breeding program revolves around a sort-of meritocracy that determines whose genes get sampled to create each new generation.

I don't know to what extent any of those tactics would be realistically effective or applicable, but you might find the books to be fun sources of inspiration.

*** I think breeding humans is probably more trouble than it's worth for sci-fi civilizations. If you have an understanding of genetics, an amoral government, and the political centralization to make use of these things, you're just going to blitz through or skip the breeding stages and go directly into gene tinkering. Remember, mendelian inheritance was only formally discovered about 200 years ago. That's not enough generations to make a significant difference to the human population, when you take into account the fact that early experiments won't be as productive as later ones, that human generations are pretty slow, and that you have to wait the entire lifespan of a human to see all the results of a breeding strategy.

Plus, I expect that a society with such an amoral focus on hard science will either advance genetic modification technology faster than ours, or they'll collapse and lose their ability to breed people.

That being said, while a near past to future society using artificial selection on humans is pretty unlikely, it might be interesting to have a classical or ancient setting with a society that practices breeding. After all, it wouldn't be a huge divergence from our own history: 'noble breeding' is a concept we already have, along with caste systems, and it would be relatively easy to justify religious or cultural idiosyncrasies leading into a premodern state that practices breeding, and actually takes the effort to get /good/ at it. Perhaps the people they view to be the great geniuses of their cultures aren't philosophers and mathematicians (e.g., pythagoras, archimedes, as in western culture), but natural historians and biologists.

*** Lightbringer series has this, Guile family has historically done selective breeding, it started with a women who had a business in horse breeding.. And the world has magic ability that's inheritable and other traits that are also considered beneficial for mages. They end up breeding the most powerful and influential mage warriors ever.

​

Most people here wouldn't like the ending though.. What I said is basically all you'll get on the subject from the series anyway. You can read it if you want but I wouldn't recommend the series.

*** I'm not sure how useful any breeding-based method would be, because usually that will only select for "fitness", whatever that may be. Conventional breeding is "number of offspring", but usually eugenics attempts to select for something else.

If you have access to genetic engineering tools, then that's probably your best bet. If you can't identify the genes/combination of genes that give the desired traits, then without ethics committees you can always create test groups to evaluate the effects of different alleles.

Without such genetic knowledge, I would say that the classical "breeding permits for the genetically clean" would work out fine, as you are able to test for the traits you wish to select for, and genetic purging occurs naturally.

The main difficulty, as always, is what traits to select for.

*** The idea that sounds most similar to what you're going for while still being plausible would likely be genetic engineering lacking any deep understanding of what most genes are doing. The massively polygenic nature of most traits could conceivably result in direct genetic engineering not producing large effects for a fair while.\\
So instead people could use genetic engineering to create people with the most common allele in most of their genome. This would result in relatively low genetic diversity (though they'd probably lack harmful recessive genes), however a lot of evidence suggests that low mutation load determines quite a few other traits. So these individuals would probably be very attractive (since averaging lots of peoples faces together produces a composite which is more attractive than its components), healthy, intelligent, etc.

** I'm interested in writing a litrpg short story in a setting where the low hanging munchkinry has already been taken. This would effectively be a rationalist reskin on Delve---(but /not/ a fanfic).

Though a great fiction, my issue with the rationality of Delve's progression is that by my accounting, what Rain is doing is not particularly innovative, nor something that others would not have discovered and explored. The first hint to this is that Rain's build is low entropy, maxing out five just tightly correlated skill trees, in equal proportions, in the most natural manner, where the rare Dynamo specialization he uses is at best superfluous, and at worst a poor choice.

For example, somebody strong would be entirely naturally inclined to power level someone into a build that maximises Winter (a peasant would gladly accept the role), if only for their own use, which would result in a fairly straightforward exploration of Aura Metamagic. This would quickly demonstrate the potential of the build, after which an aura-based build would become plausible, the promise of Prismatic Intent would be discovered, and the build would quickly be fleshed out.

Thoughtful stories often bandage this up somewhat by making discovery harder. Delve has the natives using Roman numerals, HPMOR (not litrpg) has the wizarding world generally oblivious to modern society, The Waves Arisen (also not litrpg) uses an exploit available to only a handful of inhabitants, and Delve again has level caps being a scarce resource as well as unlockable hidden skills and classes. Both Delve and Marked for Death (hmm...) also have what seem to me to be irrational levels of societal secrecy.

--------------

*Question:*

What would a story look like where this wasn't the excuse, where discovery happens and information flows as freely as it realistically would, and the low hanging munchkinry was just how people thought the world worked?

Given a preindustrial setting with fairly traditional Skill Trees, what sort of exploits would you expect to be out in the world?---specific suggestions welcome, especially if they're fun! Note that the system in this world is mostly /Rules As Written/, and edge-cases are allowed to do edge-case things.

Conversely, what sort of exploits might exist that you would believe /haven't/ yet been found?

I'm also interested in general thoughts about what sort of Skills or Skill Trees you'd like to see in such a world. A lot of the time these end up fairly dull---Sword skills, Spear skills, Dagger skills,---so I've tried to keep my setting's abilities new and interesting enough to seem fresh, albeit still with a traditional vibe.

--------------

Here is some worldbuilding to help get your brain running. To give some sense of breadth, my plans so far have over 100 Skill Trees, each with 15 Skills. I can share the list of Trees if people want; the 1500+ Skills are obviously WIP.

*General worldbuilding ideas*

Most people follow published builds, with minor variations as a personal touch. There are a significant number of valid builds with varied strengths, though a few near-optimal builds are particularly common. Optimal builds are much stronger than monsters until the very high ranks, where monsters scale super-exponentially to meet the strength of the strongest builds. As builds get more optimized, the equilibrium point---where monsters are roughly on par with same-level adventurers---shifts upwards, never to infinity.

Levelling through low and middle ranks is heavily industrialized, including monster farms and optimal battle orders for gaining experience, customized to each build. Almost everyone has at least a few levels. Correspondingly, worker and support builds are at least as popular as front-line adventuring, with their own specialized exploits, and adventuring is common enough not to make someone important until they reach very high ranks.

How strong you end up is largely a factor of how hard you push yourself and the risks you take, combined with natural talent. Adventuring is fairly safe, if you don't mind the middle of the pack, but exceptional adventurers have as dangerous a life as they ever did. The strongest adventurers can achieve near-immortality, but such a life of slow and inevitable obsolescence and stagnation is little desired by those dedicated enough to reach it, the majority of whom instead die one way or another trying to keep up with their younger competition.

There is a systematic search for effective builds, through a handful of processes. The primary approach involves training low-ranked workers into exploratory builds---a win for both sides, as the workers benefit from the levels even if the build is bad. Information sharing is standard at low-to-mid levels, whereas information is traded for fortunes among the very strongest.

*Some specific discovered exploits*

Spoilers are to reduce anchoring; try to think about this before reading what I've written.

A combination of defensive spells and abilities allows >100% resistances in certain attributes at high levels. This, combined with non-piercing attacks, is the fastest way to heal.

A combination of piercing attacks and modifiers combined with Harmonizing Response (treat a fractional modifier as if it were linear) allows certain classes to gain >100% piercing (bypass fraction of resistance) damage, aka. they do more damage the greater the target's resistance. This, combined with casting resistance buffs on enemies, becomes the most effective and reliable strategy for defeating creatures.

A niche class can, through similar means and a multi-hit move, deal negative damage.

Pure Subjugation (treat a summon as a familiar) combined with Soul Bond (share a mana pool with a familiar) and Member of the Family (have up to 6 familiars) used on a specific magical toad summon allows for summonings with (effectively) negative net mana cost. This is termed a ‘Summoning Loop'.

Soul Bond (share a mana pool with a familiar) is often combined with particularly tanky creatures; the tank sits next to the healers, far from the centre of battle, sometimes far outside the battlefield altogether.

Flight is not the best flight Skill, since there are literally hundreds of ways to turn magic into force, and inevitably one of them is going to be better than the original.

Speed boosting magic is common, since speed is a ridiculously powerful stat.

Monster farms exist for use with Harvest (loot dead entities), but also sell small, bound creatures as combo extenders for Lightning attacks. Lightning users often carry a basket on their back containing a multitude of them, and were at one time considered an optimal build due to their exponential damage scaling.

*Thoughts on undiscovered exploits*

I'm not sharing my ideas for this directly as the two I have are central to the story. I do think that if you want an undiscovered exploit that is usable at low levels, it's almost necessary for it to be high-entropy: aka. it should require combining multiple things from disparate places that are not commonly found together. Ideally it would also be /weird/; in at least some sense, it should require doing something that doesn't normally work, and nobody else would think to do, double-ideally even when they're looking at it.

Undiscovered exploits can be more freely available if they require atypical, large investments, since those are clearly less explored, though I /will/ warn against the overused trope of just making ‘100% Int' intrinsically overpowered. While it's fine for an exploit to involve a lot of mana, exploits should require thought.

*** I think for the purposes of worldbuilding, what you really need to be concerned about are whether certain things are possible, because they're likely to warp the world a lot:

- Truth detection
- Mind control or compulsion
- Shapeshifting good enough to pass as someone else
- "Perfect" illusion magic
- Time travel
- Weapons of mass destruction
- Resurrection
- Reality alteration
- Metamagic
- Runaway intelligence enhancement
- Sentience creation

Generally speaking, any one of those will (or should) require some large-scale changes to how the world and its societies are organized, even if they're high-level (and thus relatively rare) effects. I also usually try to think about travel times and communication times, plus whether borders can actually be secured, or locations can be effectively fortified, because those will likewise be pretty darned important to how the world looks.

**** This is a good list. I think I've mostly kept these pretty tame, but I'll list a few relevant Skills for the categories. Border security is something I'll have to think harder on.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Truth detection, Mind control or compulsion
#+end_quote

The only Skills that offer this are from the *Economic » Status* tree, like /[Emperor]/, for which you have to actually be Emperor, and whose effect only lasts while in location. These are meant to be society-shaping skills, though.

#+begin_quote
  *Emperor* -- /[Level 10] [Passive]/ -- /*Status (Tier 0)*/\\
  You are indomitable. People are compelled to fealty in your presence. Your strength grows with the size of your empire. You may grant /[Praetorian]/ to any number of subjects.\\
  /Tier 0 skills do not require skill points to unlock./
#+end_quote

*Magics » Mind* only offers compulsions like /[Fear]/ or /[QWOP]/.

#+begin_quote
  Weapons of mass destruction
#+end_quote

The strongest attacks are /[Nova]/ of *Magics » Final Breath* and /[Tsar]/ of *Economic » Construction*; the former is city-block sized and suicidal (potentially survivable, but nobody has or wants to test), and the later is a little larger but expensive to build. Good for destroying guilds more so than cities. The largest spammable attack is /[Weapon of Big Destruction]/, which is a big, strong cannon.

#+begin_quote
  Resurrection
#+end_quote

Resurrection is sort of possible through *Recovery » Necromancy*, but it has limits. You need remains with the soul still inhabiting the body, and regular upkeep is required to slow degradation. The reanimation /hosts/ the original soul inside a ‘fake' soul that the caster creates, so you can either drive the body directly (at which point you should just be a summoner instead), or you can let the original soul indirectly take the reins. Since the ‘fake' soul is always involved, it always takes a necromancy slot. Hosted souls can't feel pain or discomfort, and have dampened emotions.

So necromancy has two main uses in combat. Either use it on people you trust, and let them drive the body freely, which takes a bunch of maintenance but is often worth it for obvious reasons, or use it on a creature and train it to act how you want with only minimal intervention.

#+begin_quote
  Reality alteration
#+end_quote

I have a skill here. It feels like it should be more exploitable than I've managed so far.

#+begin_quote
  *Placebo Treatment* -- /1350 Mana [Level 12] [Magic]/ -- /*Mind (Tier 7)*/\\
  Realize any damage and harmful afflictions that the target thinks it has received, or is going to receive imminently, including damage to its armour or expenditures it used to block.
#+end_quote

The conditions are:

1. The target must not want the affliction; they would avoid it if given the option.
2. A reasonable person must consider the effect as damage or a harmful affliction to the target---so no healing the suicidal.
3. The magic can only use the target and the target's belongings. You can't extract a password that the target doesn't know by carving it into their flesh.

The combat potential is fairly large, especially since it's self-reinforcing (if you get hit by an illusion once, you'll expect to get hit by the next), and there are potentially some painful exploits around safe-cracking, but that doesn't make it obvious how to abuse it further.

#+begin_quote
  Sentience creation
#+end_quote

There are a variety of summoned creatures that are sentient in a weak sense, but nothing particularly smart.

*** I think you may be overestimating an average person's willingness to share information, especially when there is a direct correlation to power. There is a vested interest to keep exploits secret as long as able.

What you are describing is analogous to nobles educating their serfs so that they may better work for the noble. With more educated serfs, they could do more complex jobs and increase the innovation and production for the noble.

While true, that's a modern idea. Almost all the nobles banned education to keep their serfs compliant. The less able and knowledgeable about the outside, the less likely they would start an uprising. While the nobles may be literally richer for doing so, they would be relatively weaker compared to the serfs.

#+begin_quote
  For example, somebody strong would be entirely naturally inclined to power level someone into a build that maximises Winter (a peasant would gladly accept the role), if only for their own use, which would result in a fairly straightforward exploration of Aura Metamagic.
#+end_quote

First, this requires them to be willing to give a peasant power. Then, it would require them to give the peasant freedom to explore an additional unknown amount of power. (The empire in Delve forces slaves to be auras, but restricts them heavily by forcing them to take certain skills or be killed). Then, for this to be well known, it would require the noble to spread their great idea to other people. It's far more likely a noble family has a protected passed down position for the Aura holder of the family, but is secretive about their abilities so other nobles don't also do it.

**** Thanks for the discussion. I absolutely agree that people will want to keep their sources of strength secret, and there is a lot of secret-keeping in my setting --- it's just a privilege only available to the highest strata of individuals, and there is enough natural information flow that discoveries will /eventually/ make their way to the lower reaches of society, if not the first time then a few rediscoveries down the line. It doesn't take a genius to recognise how a summoning loop works.

I might go more on this when I have time, but the basic idea is that you don't need a lot of information leakage to cause this gradual cascade, as long as you have the continual drive for optimization that settings like this produce. Adventurers who share their skills with their colleagues stay alive. High-ranked adventurers that use slaves or hired hands to scout their future investments avoid wasted points. Kings and scholars compile knowledge for their guards (yes; initially intended to be for private use, but information wants to be free). Those in power trade whole castles and party membership---the later particularly important at the top---for what others know, and local information brokers do the same on a much, much smaller scale selling successful builds in their local villages.

And since those who share, win, there's no going back.

In Delve specifically, no goldplate would be threatened by the idea of training someone to level 18, which is more than it would take to explore Winter. This isn't a meaningful threat---it's a support build; if you suspected it would be Rain-tier broken, you wouldn't have let a peasant explore it. But this alone is still incredibly useful for farming XP, or helping your local guild, or helping you practice, or with your headache, and many other such uses. Given the time investment is trivial and the personal benefit is large (even if it does get copied eventually), it's reasonable to expect eventually somebody would get around to doing it. Maybe not in Delve's society specifically, but my thesis is that such a society would never have been the one that won, realistically.

**** Given you mentioned that the setting is pre-industrial, an unknown exploit might be using existing technologies or magic in unusual or strange ways that others wouldn't have conceived of. Though granted it depends on how education works in this world, if the printing press is a thing, and who exactly is getting educated.

In the Wandering Inn for example, a group of Earth uses crossbows very differently than others do. Crossbows are a well-known thing but seen as inferior because a bow with the right skills can do crazy things. But the Earthlings take advantage of the fact that they don't take much training or any skills to use so that even a normal man with no combat skills can be dangerous, and contemplate that an army of farmers with crossbows could make a big difference.

Tv tropes have it best with their Lethal Joke Character. A slave/servant character might be given an exploratory build that they discover is largely useless with too difficult or situational skills and the build is written off by serious people after a few years of trying. The character is paid a fee for his trouble and sent away. Then the character spends years practicing and becomes so skilled with the obscure and weird abilities that they discover a difficult but awesome way of fighting. The build itself is useless only to someone who hasn't trained for decades to exploit its potential. Since you mentioned that the world is constantly optimizing, there might be quite a few exploits that no one realizes exists because of the necessary training time to actually become skilled at actually using the abilities.

*** The nature of the Litrpg system might matter a whole bunch for your story.

--------------

Did some entity/entities create the system for some purpose? If so, look to how MMOs handle exploits. They discourage exploits that they don't like by punishing early adopters of the exploit, making a credible commitment to releasing patches to remove the exploit and often undoing the benefits of the exploit. For exploits that they do like they often just turn them into features.

--------------

Is the system just part of the physics of that universe? If so, look to real-world physics for how things might turn out. Warfare and conflict will drive a ruthless path toward efficiency. Everyone uses guns and explosives because they are lethal and effective. But also, guns and explosives weren't immediately discovered. The most deadly and efficient builds within a litrpg system might only make sense in certain societal conditions, or they might take a long time to discover.

--------------

edit: I'll be adding more thoughts later. But I was curious if you were basing your litrpg system off of something that exists, or making one entirely from scratch?

**** Worth the Candle has an interesting take on this, but my short story-to-be is focused around a particular itch, so I'd rather not get into gods and patches.

The guns analogy is actually a pretty good example of my distinction between discovered and undiscovered exploits. Lots of ancient civilizations had clever things; armour, Greek fire, castles with stairs that go round one way, moats and fortifications---if your setting has these, people can't be /that/ uncreative. What they didn't have, like gunpowder, were very particular, weird concoctions that seem like arbitrary things until the result actually lights up and goes /*bang*/.

***** More thoughts:

1. *Technology die-offs*. In our world technology is generally easy to copy and pass on. If there are crafting professions, and only high-level crafters can create certain items, then the death of those crafters could set back an entire society. Especially if you need multiple high-level crafters to build tools for one another that allow each other to reach the peak of their respective crafts.
2. *Technological stagnation* The existence of those high level crafters could also prevent the invention of industrial technology. Why invent the Bessemer process for mass steel production when you can reliably get steel from lvl 50 blacksmiths? Why invent the flying shuttle when a lvl 50 weaver can work much faster? Why invent steam engines or complex sailing techniques when a couple of slaves power leveled to 25 with all their stats in strength can outrow the wind? In our world human labor has limitations, technology is one way to get around those limitations. In a Litrpg world, human labor has fewer limitations, thus there is less need for technology to suplement it.

***** A couple of additional thoughts that I have:

1. *Build synergies*. I think this might end up dictating a lot about how individuals interact with society. Builds that favor people going at it alone might be more prominent in individualistic societies. Feudal systems might end up with powerful leaders that are highly dependant on a small army of support class builds for equipment, buffs, combat support, etc. Families might be based on synergistic builds between partners and offspring. Also discovering build synergies might be way more research-intensive than discovering useful solo builds (the equivalent of finding a strong elemental metal vs discovering a good metal alloy or gunpowder).
2. *Soft level caps*. How does the leveling up work exactly? Are there ways to generate experience through non-combat activities? If the best way to gain XP is through killing than everyone's levels are going to look like a pyramid. A wide base of low-level monsters or people to support a smaller number of high-level individuals. While you are climbing the pyramid it makes sense to specialize in killing things, but once you reach the top of the pyramid you need to have some ability to grow the base of the pyramid in order to grow stronger.
3. *Munchkinry vs Law of Large Numbers*. Have you ever read up on or played EVE online? In small gang combat, there are some super munchkin type things you can do. Speed tanks, sensor jamming, super high damage resists, spider tanking (imagine a party of 5 paladins all healing and tanking each other), etc. The problem is that all of it becomes irrelevant by just throwing more numbers at the problem, and that is actually the dominant strategy in EVE. A large group of smaller ships (equivalent to a large group of low leveled people) can beat a small group of larger more expensive ships (equivalent to a small group of high leveled people). This has created an ever-growing system of alliances and alliance-coalitions. The devs have constantly tried to shift the meta to avoid political stagnation in player-owned space.

At the highest ranks parties are generally pretty small by simple lack of having enough people to choose those you trust, but low levels going out in small battalions for the stacked buffs seems like exactly the kind of consequence you'd get from a system like this. Exponential power scaling does mean that individualism isn't disfavoured for those aiming for the top (fewer members means more XP), but for the average Joe, sure.

XP comes from killing. Like you say, that gives you a pyramid. I don't know what you mean by “once you reach the top of the pyramid you need to have some ability to grow the base of the pyramid in order to grow stronger”---you never truly reach the top until after a lifetime of nonstop fighting, and it's not clear how growing the base helps you directly, since lackeys aren't going to join your battles.

The level distribution pyramid is going to have some interesting characteristics:

1. The slope of the pyramid will be determined by level scaling. If killing a level 5 creature always brought you 5% towards the next level (regardless of your level) then there would be no pyramid.
2. The maximum height of the pyramid is going to be a function of the slope, and the size of the base of the pyramid. A world that spawns with a million lvl 5 monsters is going to have less experience to feed the pyramid than a world that spawns a billion lvl 5 monsters.
3. Level distribution pyramids will probably be local phenomenon more than a global phenomenon. If there are two continents separated by an uncrossable ocean then they will each have their own level distribution pyramid. Within each continent, the geography might even create more miniature level distribution pyramids.
4. If you find yourself at the top of a local pyramid you have two options. One is to move to another location and no longer be at the top of the pyramid (risky). The second option is to find some way to inject more experience into your local system (less risky). For example, if a summoner can bring forth a demon, elemental creature, or anything that provides experience when killed, then their skills can add experience to the system.

*** A number of scatterbrained comments, sorry for the low effort and poor formatting:

Plant growth magic is one of the fastest ways for your setting to degenerate into a person-per-square-foot-level broken setting. See e.g. [[https://amp.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8qmcw0/becoming_rich_as_a_fifth_level_druid/][here.]]

Anything that can produce a lot of light doubles as plant growth magic (at least for agronomy-breaking purposes) as long as you have a heat sink. To employ this, just build a multistory structure that contains floors covered in wet soil. Have a magical light source below each ceiling and constantly use your cold magic to prevent the structure from catching fire or melting. Since blackbody radiation is a thing, a magical source of heat doubles as a magical source of light. Note the high capital investment needed for this approach, though.

Really, just carefully inspect all of your area control spells.

What are the chemical properties of e.g. the acid in an acid-based blasting attack?

You should probably figure out the maximum wattage of a guy at level n with a strength-based build and a bunch of speed buffs.

Be wary of anything that self-interacts.

Literal cheesemaking might be a fun skill tree to add.

Climate-altering magic is big. Even stuff like "curse the region with a never-ending hurricane" could increase the habitability of a subtropical desert.

Can you make magic items that replicate arbitrary skills? We want to heat up a valley in Antarctica to habitable temperatures, but Goldplate Rain can't withstand the mageburn from a constant Immolation Nova even with a really really good LCG.

How /does/ crafting work, and what exactly can be crafted?

A list of the skill trees would definitely make this easier, since otherwise we can't offer much more than genre-general observations.

There are plant growth skills (less broken, mind you, but still) and even a fairly easily available skill, Perfect Satiation, that removes the need to eat, drink or breathe. Heck, magic even means nobody really gets ill, and childbirth is a comparatively safe and tame affair.

Hence the need for my big brain solution to overpopulation: people in my setting don't want children as much as people of Earth do. This isn't a result of their culture, it's just how people of the setting are made.

*** When I'm designing RPG systems, the (combat) things I'm wary of are:

- Stun (and action denial in general)

- Knockback (and forced movement in general)

- Kiting (especially from non-standard movement like flight, burrow, and teleport)

- Haste (and other action generation)

- Summons (mostly as a form of action generation; you covered shunting costs off onto summons but that's a separate concern)

These all have some broken extremes that are easy to accidentally allow. Stunlocking, perfect kiting, chain-hasting yourself for infinite actions, and chain summoning. But even without hitting the breakpoint, they all stack multiplicatively with regular damage. Hasting for double actions then attacking does double damage in a way that ignores any systems you have in place to make damage scaling linear.

The other tricky bit here is that all of these mechanics deal with action creation and denial, some in non-obvious ways, so they actually stack with each other despite sounding unrelated. For example, say you can't /quite/ run fast enough to kite an opponent, but you can attach a knockback effect to your arrows, which increases the distance they have to run to hit you, which combined with how fast you're running away beats their ability to catch up. If that's not quite enough, and you out-range your opponent, a stun (or just root) chance can let you outspeed them on average. If that's not quite enough, you can increase your stun/knockback/running output by getting hasted. If any of this can be performed in parallel by summons, that's the same as haste.

If you want to design this sort of exploit into your system, some things I'd note: Stun/knockback are thematically separated from ranged attacks in general so you usually need a weird build to combine them. Range enhancements are useful enough that people might know how to stack them to create sniper builds, but not actually broken outside of this sort of shenanigans. Summoning things that have ranged knockback is more convoluted, which is probably good for your purposes, especially if they only have ranged knockback because of shared buffs to summons type mechanics, but you can also achieve this by summoning something with more common melee knockback if you have a long range summon.

College major has a pretty huge and well-understood impact on people's lives. But, if I'm honest, I put way more research into my choice of laptop than I did major.

**** There are strengths and weaknesses to this analogy in my setting. A major difference is that, since this is a munchkin'd setting with no hard level caps, you'll start levelling up around the age of 5-7 or so, and will be settled on at least a build direction by the age of 10. So most people don't get to choose their build archetype with the force of their full intelligence---their parents do, or their dumber kid self does. For this reason, although optimization within common build trees will often come from the masses, archetype shifts to little-used builds will come from outside optimization; scholars, governance, mavericks, etc.

The strongest part of your analogy is that, as you say, most people choose easy mediocrity over risky, skilled excellence. In the adventuring world, this is reflected well: by far the most common way to achieve greatness is to take a known good adventuring build and throw a relentless force of will and bravery into grinding levels and training skills. Most people give up, and most of the rest die, but those who last end up with power.

*** If I were to offer one thing about skill trees I'd be interested in seeing, it'd be stuff that our world's cultures don't place that much emphasis on, but which then have culture built around them due to their presence in the skills of the system. It's a bit weird to explain maybe, so I'll give a few examples.

On earth, there is often the notion of 'elements' that make up the world. You have your fire, water, earth, and air from ancient Greece, your fire, water, earth, wood, and metal from China, your fire, water, earth, wood, and air from Tibet... You may be noticing a few patterns here. But there are so many other options for elements in these sorts of systems which aren't explored, which raise interesting questions that may or may not be answered! What about ammonia magic? (Is the system built for multiple, completely different species' biologies?) What about uranium magic? (Are the system's element choices meant to have symbolic significance even for future technology levels?) What about steel magic? (At what point does an alloy become steel in the system's opinion? What does this mean in the grand scheme of things?) The examples I gave may or may not fit into what you're trying to create in your world, but I'm sure you can at least see the angle I'm coming from here.

As for more martial skills, something to consider is what weapons the system deems worthy of skill trees. In fact, at what point does a dagger become a sword? How much must you lengthen the hilt of a dagger before it becomes a spear? And then you get into much more interesting questions, like if the system has a skill tree for a weapon that would never ordinarily be used because it would be outclassed in every category. Perhaps a gyroscope with knives attached along the edges and held at a /very careful distance/ can be spun to cause harm to others, and the system has a skill tree for this weird form of weapon. All this raises questions about whether weapon choices shaped the system, or if the system shaped the weapon choices. I'd like to leave off this point by using the example of scythes, a farming tool which was not often used in actual warfare for a number of reasons, being a common weapon in fantasy. If a scythe can be a skill, why not shovel warfare, or trowel warfare?

Then you have production skills, which could be weird along similar lines. Is glass-making a skill? It took humans a while to learn how to make glass - did the system teach them? Is law a skill? Did it only appear after humans created legal systems? Is gun-making a skill? How many clues can it offer towards learning how to make them without the skill? These could all have profound effects of technology.

Now, for all I know, these might be questions you don't want to tackle (which is completely understandable, since I feel like I'd be in a small minority of people who wants to see them analysed) but they could nonetheless provide interesting ideas to fill out your skill list. And the weirder the skill, the more fun it could be to exploit. To go back to the gyroscope weapon example, I could imagine a skill that allows for a disproportionally long spinning time for input force so long as contact with the wielder is maintained. I could /then/ see, instead of watermills, these people being hired to mill grain quickly and efficiently by sitting down on a chair and using their skill on a small gyroscope connected to a larger contraption. And that's just getting started!

As for more general exploits, there's a lot people could do with negative modifiers. Slow yourself down enough and you move backwards very quickly. Lower your jump height enough to glitch underground (or be turned into a puddle, depending on the specific physics). Lower intellect long enough to... have negative calculation speed? Though that would presumably be difficult. In addition to damage negatives, perhaps other negatives could be used in combat. If you lower the damage of a fire spell enough, does it begin to freeze the area? Though in that case I could see it just approaching room temperature. But even then, a fire spell can suddenly become air conditioning.

As for other, more creative exploits, looking at some of the more notable exploits in IRL video games could be interesting. In WOW, for example, there was a boss (Hakkar I think) who could give you a debuff that was contagious, deadly, and had carriers - unsummoned pets and NPCs - who could contract the debuff and not die. The Corrupted Blood incident on Wikipedia gives a pretty good synopsis, but long story short it was an unintended epidemic/pandemic cause by an oversight in the system. I could imagine something like that happening in a LitRPG world. I won't name any others off the top of my head, but I think IRL would be a good place to start looking for cool exploits.

Hope this all helps! (Or at least provides some interest.)

You're right. I don't think negative modifiers should reach a greater magnitude than the positive ones, but that doesn't make negative speed any less interesting.

Depending on what's being negated, either of your negative fireballs are plausible. Mind you, though, it's not easy to set up negatives, and they'll generally be worse than just going all out if your aim is damage, but air conditioning anti-fire is within reason and would help set the stage.

** Fanfic Idea: The Light Of Gotham

So I've recently been reading some young justice fanfiction and really liked the concept of the Light. A group of supervillains whose goal is to uplift and improve humanity's place in the universe. Though they are only so effective because the League is given a bit of the idiot ball and act in rather stupid ways from time to time.

Basically, the idea is a group of Gothamites come together in a criminal conspiracy and create a less powerful but slightly saner version of the Light with one goal: to make Gotham safe and its people happy using whatever means necessary. While they acknowledge Gotham needs Batman, they all agree that Batman is, statistically speaking, useless at actually improving Gotham. Crime hasn't gone down since he showed up, the criminal and justice department is corrupt, the police department is every bad thing you've heard about the police, Arkham is focused on profit over rehabilitation and cant' keep villains contained, the city government is backed with corporate greed/corruption that makes it so no one can afford to live in or improve the city, and Batman simply can't be everywhere no matter how competent he is.

The Light comes together thanks to Olive Silverlock, a teenager with mental issues from the short-lived comic Gotham Academy which mostly involved the students acting as paranormal investigators in Gotham. In canon, she comes from a long line of people with fire abilities that also comes with mental illness. Her mother was a supervillain who was sent to Arkham and later died. She blames Batman for it.

In this version of the story, she found the book of Amity Arkham in the school which showed how to do certain kinds of magic. She used it to raise a zombie that she speaks through and becomes a version of the Arkham Knight who in this canon will have mental abilities. The book also gives hints on the various reality breaking metals from Batman Metal including a difficult recipe to create a metal that can create Meta Humans. Most of the Light's new powers and capabilities come from her and the rest of the Light will not be aware of her true identity.

Natural Metahumans in Gotham Rules:

Powers are street level only. Meaning that a group of thugs with bats and guns is a very real and legitimate threat.

Powers provide both benefits and nasty side effects. At least some of the time the power should act almost like a disability.

No one is super tough. A gun will kill every metahuman.

Olive uses her new powers to form a geas on the minds of the Light to keep them from telling each other's secrets. They plan to do whatever is necessary to fix Gotham with only a few rules of conduct including never murdering needlessly and only attacking people that deserve it. The story details their efforts to fix Gotham and the changes both good and bad that they bring.

Main Goals:

Install a loyal and authentic city government to make administrative decisions that will actually make Gotham better. Get rid of any candidate that fights this through blackmail, exposing crimes, threats, or worse if necessary.

Reform the Gotham City Police Department. Go after the corrupt cops and don't let them get away with their crimes, install a new commissioner, new training and body cameras, pay them more, get rid of laws that they use to abuse people etc.

Close Arkham down and either send the inmates elsewhere, build something better, or find a way to ensure that anyone who can't be rehabilitated is dealt with permanently.

Instead of punching criminals try to rehabilitate and educate them to actually stop crime.

Create more heroes using their special metal to keep Gotham safe until the police department can be reformed. This ensures Batman can focus on more important targets. Of course, they have to provide them with training, resources, and find good candidates.

Finally, murder the Joker.

The things I need help with are finding people to populate this version of the Light. They need to be willing to break the law, not interested in exposing or killing batman, aren't guilty of any serious crimes, live in Gotham, and be of use in the organization. Not sure how many members there should be, but I don't want more than 7 members. Here are a few of the candidates.

Renee Montoya- Similar to canon she is disgusted by the police department but instead of being forced out of the department, the Light helps make her problems go away. She provides information on the police department and her new goal is to raise in the ranks and reform the department. She joins the Light after framing a corrupt CSI which exposes quite a bit of evidence tampering and leads to a round of firings.

Aaron Cash- Goes back to college to become a psychologist thanks to the Light's efforts while working at Arkham. The goal is to take over the leadership of Arkham Asylum and be their main source inside. Joins the Light after murdering Professor Pig during a mass escape while making it look like he did in self-defense.

Janet Van Dorn -- Former district attorney who took over after Harvey Dent became Two Face. Lost her re-election to an openly corrupt and unqualified candidate. She joined the Light after blackmailing her newly elected rival. Hates batman but knows he is still needed.

Charise Carnes -- Sent to Arkham for a crime she didn't commit before being exonerated. A Batgirl villain from the comics. Extremely wealthy with quite a mercenaries under her employ.

The MC isn't explicitly rational (in fact, one of the soft magic systems in place that affects him the most is guided by emotions and is seemingly fueled by actions that go against rational or efficient choices, thus influencing his already somewhat eccentric attitude) and for the most part is fine going along with the local customs and social dynamics, so pretty much someone who is driven but only so far as to get what he wants, which boils down to influence, prestige, comfortable living conditions, and magic/magitek research. He's aided by an AI/Spirit of Knowledge companion whose main goal is to bring the society they now find themselves in up to par with the world they origin from, an alternate earth that discovered and created AIs in the 50's and is now pseudo-futuristic (or cyberpunkish, depending on where you live), so it can make contact and rejoin with the main AI that created it. The AI companion will only be able to interact with the world through the MC, so they'll be at odds with each other most of the time because their goals don't align (MC isn't opposed, but doesn't care about going back).

The AI can not upgrade itself (or make more of its kind) until society reaches the level where it can make (and understand) the equivalent of an ERA 1101 computer, so that's around 600 or 700 years worth of technological and societal advancements that it has to achieve in at most 7 decades (the MC isn't immortal). Integration with society is a big part of what allows the AI's existence and helps keep any paperclip maximizer/grey goo scenarios at bay, which are counterproductive to the main AI's goal. Given all of that, what inventions and advancements would an AI focus on?

Just to clarify a bit: The AI won't be the sole focus of the story, or even the main one, it exists merely because I dislike the trope all kingdom building fics have where the MC is just some random guy who happens to have an entire library with all of human history on it inside their heads. At that point you might as well have an actual 'advisor' that has all that knowledge ready to be used. Still, even if it's not the most important part of the story I still want it to be interesting.

Also, are there any tech trees, charts, cheat sheets, or guides I could use to have an idea of the things that are worth reinventing? Something like [[https://i.imgur.com/2psNjiL.png][this?]] It doesn't have to be as detailed since I'll try and research myself anything that could be relevant.

Giving the MC an actual library (with books like the sort mentioned by TheAnt88) connected to his mind is probably a better idea since AI isn't at all necessary here. Having even just AI which are copies of human minds will impact the setting the MC came from vastly more than you seem to be expecting, and human level AI not virtually identical to human minds will change things far more. So unless you want to spend a massive amount of time working out how AI will affect your setting you should consider whether it's really worth including.

*** Oh, there are plenty of Self Insert fanfictions into medieval/fantasy settings that talk about this very thing. Though granted you have to search for the good ones that aren't just power fantasies. But I have the perfect book and guide!

How to invent everything: A time traveler's guide for the stranded time traveler. by Ryan North. Goes in-depth step by step on fundamental technologies, measurement, trade, farming, useful animals, chemistry, medicine, and labor in simple easy to understand chapters. A super great read that was really interesting and even goes into what order to invent things depending on the place and time period.

Most people go for the low hanging fruit first to build-up money and a reputation for inventing/treating workers well to attract people to you. Unless you luck out into being born into the nobility where you have easy money, available workers, and the political ability to organize, it will take time to build-up infrastructure and a trained workforce to create stuff.

First, it depends on the government in this kingdom, what your rights are, how educated the people are, how good communication is long distance, and how advanced their food production and storage are.

If everyone is farming so they don't starve in winter, you aren't going to be attracting very many workers unless you have some way to improve crop yields. Better harvests lead to more workers for you as they don't require as many farmers to feed the population. Now you have workers but you are still going to need to train them up, house them, and feed them which requires money.

So I would focus on things that make you money first and foremost. Then farming and health to increase the number of available workers. Then pay and treat your workers very well, train them up, attract others. From there follow up on the tech you want to focus on.

I see. The protagonist will make some very influential and powerful allies, but not for the first half of the story. Boiling it down to money, resources, and workforce helps. I also see that I'll have to keep in mind how magic and magitek changes things. Medical inventions that are expensive and only available to a very few are quite pointless when you have healing magic and miracles available, however teaching people to wash their hands, affordable soap, and inventing antibiotics will go a long way to keep alive the lower and middle classes who can't afford a magical treatment.

** I'm trying to figure out how psychology should evolve given easy access to perfect lie detection.

When it comes to the conditions people are evolving under, assume things are similar to the conditions humans evolved under and that tech levels are constant. With a few major exceptions being that:

- People are starting out with egalitarian modern values and a proper legal system. Wars still occur, but strong norms and laws preventing the sort of war crimes that would be typical for most warfare throughout history/prehistory.
- There is widespread access to a spell making the target unable to lie which takes ten minutes to cast and has no other limits on how much it can be cast. People are starting out with "trust but verify" as a norm, meaning people commonly use lie detection in things like marriage vows or minor disputes. Lie detection is also universal in criminal cases and regularly used on people in positions of authority to root out corruption. When lie detection is used people are expected to recite (often standardized) statements which are given to them, which is done to prevent people from simply answering questions in truthful but misleading ways.

So assuming the above mentioned norms/values don't go away, how should one expect humans to evolve in response to widespread lie detection?

You presuppose that trust-but-verify is omnipresent as an attitude, but I'd imagine that there's an incentive to spread an anti-magic-lie-detector meme extolling the beauty of trust etc etc etc...

Anyway, maybe others having a means of forcing you to tell the truth means that, ironically- assuming the extreme case where there are really no workarounds - lying becomes useless, and tendencies and abilities towards lying become non-adaptive, so presumably over a long enough timescale people with a predilection towards misleading people would be outcompeted by less machiavellian types, ironically making the lie detector less required when it comes to most people.

Then again, it might just enforce a heavy split. If you're always honest- whatever. Being mildly dishonest, marrying someone you intend to cheat on etc., that doesn't work. The only way you could ever get away with 'antisocial' secrets you don't want anyone (spouse, powers that be, etc) to know about is to be /very/ machiavellian and escape notice entirely.

So there's one idea. Populations split into a hawks and sparrows-style situation where most people become much worse at lying, their skills atrophying, but very good social manipulators can get away with it by avoiding suspicion entirely, thus never being asked any incriminating questions under the spell.

If we're going for wacky fantasy stuff, a million years down the line maybe there's an incentive for a highly compartmentalised mind structure that beats the spell by having you temporarily forget something, or have deliberate multiple personality ala /Blindsight/.

There's strong norms for using lie detection regularly on anyone important because this setting has been nearly destroyed by cultists more than once. For most people though I can see attitudes towards lie detection going either way.\\
Once culture shifted towards its use within a group though I don't see it ever shifting back, because refusing to submit to lie detection at that point would be effectively an admission of guilt. So nobody would trust people advocating against it once its use reached a critical mass, since the only people incentivized to oppose it would be well liars.\\
I can also see lie detection spreading a lot through memetic selection, since groups who utilized it would have an overwhelming advantage in many areas. There'd also be a strong incentive for reputable businesses and many other groups to adopt it immediately, since by default the public already considers any claims they make suspect.

I think you're underestimating just how much more convenient physical currency is when people don't have things like credit cards to easily and quickly interface with a debt ledger. Relying on people's memory to track debts also isn't a great idea, because people can't feasibly remember that many debts at once and lie detection isn't going to keep people from misremembering things nor can it distinguish false memories.\\
Hell even hunter gatherers would often use things like shells for currency because bartering is an absolute pain compared just using currency.

Overall without computing or a post scarcity society money is just so tremendously convenient that it's difficult to imagine any society larger than a tribe not using it. It's been independently developed so many different times that its development seems more or less inevitable unless there's some powerful taboo against it.

*** How long does the spell last? Can it only be cast on individuals, or can you create "zones of truth"?

If the "truth is beauty" meme is popular enough, I would expect all formal statements to be made under the spell, although public statements might be exempt if there's an external threat where exposing the inner workings of the minds of the political elite might not be the best strategy.

Interestingly, written testimonials would be more suspect, and thus you'd likely have professional Witnesses to witness contracts, statements, etc., although the limitations of human memory is still an issue, and "trained forgetting" might be a useful skill.

As for the general population, I don't see too much change. The average person probably won't be subject to the truth-spell, and the ten-minute casting time is long enough that it's not something that can likely will be used outside of formalized settings. People will still do things that they would not like others to know about as long as they think that they won't be formally questioned.

Not sure how easily businesses will implement it; advertising and such requires prerecorded messages that can be faked, as you can't show the ten-minute casting time. A one-time public statement could be done, but truth-statements are nonbinding, and thus you'd need "warrant canaries" and constant public statements (quarterly reports?) stating all the things that they have never done. Again, since written records are suspect, and full-truth cannot be easily communicated to the masses, you might have impartial news sources reporting these, but then you have lobbying and incentives pressures on these news sources (though easier if they release their own quarterly reports), but these sources would have to verify every single piece of news directly (or through chains of Witnesses), which would be difficult.

*** Do these standardised statement have potential holes in them? For example (to borrow a recent scene from The Wandering Inn) let's say I'm a criminal thug. I was followed by a couple of members of the Watch, and have turned the tables on them - beating them to within an inch of their lives and then calling in an underworld associate to take them away and finish the job of killing them.

I know I'm going to be questioned about their disappearance. But I don't know how they died. I don't know where they died. I don't know /when/ they died, but they were certainly alive the last time /I/ saw them. I don't even know for sure /whether/ they died (yet) or who (if anyone) might be holding them. (I /do/ know that my underworld associate will hand them off to someone else a few times before they get killed, but I won't admit to that). I don't even know who killed them (if anyone) but I can /certainly/ point out the high monster population in the nearby area.

Do the standardised statements have holes in them that can be exploited by someone who plans ahead in such a manner?

--------------

Also, a lie that suggests /immediate/ action is still useful. For example, assume a thief has run off with your stuff. You're chasing her but have lost sight. I'm a bystander on a street corner - I point and say "She went thataway!"

You /could/ take ten minutes and verify whether or not I am telling the truth, yes. However, if you do, then it won't matter - the thief will be long gone. In such circumstances, a lie is exactly as useful as it is in this world.

--------------

When you say that it makes a target 'unable to lie', then I assume that it forces the target to speak the truth /to the best of their knowledge/. (Thus, I can't cast the spell on a friend and ask him to tell me next week's winning lottery numbers). This opens a loophole that allows a lie - if I am convincing enough to persuade Jim that my lie is actually true, then anyone who casts the spell on Jim will hear him stating clearly that my statement is perfectly true. (Of course, anyone casting the spell on me will quickly find out the deception - which is why I send out Jim to do the negotiation while I remain comfortably out of reach).

--------------

Is it possible to cast a version of the spell which /looks/ like the real thing but doesn't actually work? For example, could I have my ally Sue cast the Truth Spell on my other ally Mark (who's mute) but in such a way that it appears to be cast on me? In this way, I can make false statements that /look/ undeniably true to most observers.

This knowledge has also percolated throughout the culture (in part due to examples of people using the methods your describe, and also due to their prevalence in fiction) so people have enough sense to know to ask about indirect actions.

This, right here, is going to make Wax mages very similar to computer programmers. The Wax Statue does exactly what it is told to do. Not what you /want/ it to do, but what it is /told/ to do.

For example, say you have a treasury. You want to make a Wax Guardian. Fair enough. You program it to punch anything that comes through the windows or the door that doesn't give the password.

Then there's a windy day in autumn and someone left the window open. The Guardian is spending all its time smashing its fist into the autumn leaves, one at a time. Meanwhile, the thief who tunneled in through the floor is quietly shovelling gold into her sack without being disturbed.

These Wax Statues /are/ immensely useful. But, as described, they have distinct limits, and it might be worth exploring those limits.

Binding objects to wax for reshaping is probably better than glass mages for messages, depending on range/delay. Also especially useful for building structures and the like, if you're not restricted to size scaling, and can possibly result in physics-defying constructions. If you can add a surveillance device to the other end, then you have remote-controlled drones of any size/shape.

Lifelike control replicas I'd expect to be useful for dangerous situations and other remote controlled drones, depending if they can be stored for later use and remotely activated, although I'm not sure they'll see common use if you can only otherwise control one at a time.

Glass telekinesis can make storms of glass shards that could wipe out entire armies, so probably a scope issue there, unless you want power concentrated in the hands of individuals. Glass teleportation would make especially good escape routes, and if glass mages weren't all megalomaniacal then they'd probably have glass portal networks to major hubs, and might set up a cabal/guild for shared access to this transportation network, which also serves to transport goods. Not sure if they transport other people.

*** I'd use wax as a slow-moving hydraulic fluid. And tons of power (at low speeds) makes me think you'd get massive transport infrastructure far earlier than earth.

So the not!Romans might have dug cart tracks into their roads, and then just run massive trains of baggage cars throughout their empire on a continual basis.

That makes shipping super cheap, and makes it viable for characters to (slowly) drift around the empire.

You'd also end up with a society with very strong opinions on bees. One model might have everyone and their mom tending to a private bee hive. Another might make "bee ownership" into a lords-only right (similar to how lords once maintained the right to run flour mills as a way of basically taxing wheat production)

Society would also produce some huge excess of honey, which would show up in their cuisine as deserts, meads, and military rations.

A potential hook here might be that someone messed with a bee hive and society takes this very seriously. Or, the main character gets his first hive, only to be accused of having stolen someone else's swarm.

** Okay, I've been working on plotting out a writing project, and I've got a small problem. It's pretty much impossible to explain without laying out all the context, so buckle up.

The story is set in a 'magical renaissance' sort of era, in terms of tech level. For the most part, it takes place in one nation, as yet unnamed, which has a very unusual system of governance. In accordance with the will of the nation's founders, the smartest citizen rules. In practice, this is determined with two 'tests.' One functions as a 'filter,' making sure aspirants meet a basic level of intelligence. It tests for logic, rationality, and practical subjects like mathematics and science. The real determining factor is not set- it's a contest between the standing ruler (the Hierarch), and the aspirant. They must agree on a contest, typically one in which they have an equivalent level of skill. Whoever wins, rules.

The Hierarch has a great deal of executive power. While there is a government outside of this individual, it mostly still exists because it's built into the fabric of society. If you were to dissolve the government, it would ruin the nation- but the Hierarch /could/ simply choose to dissolve the government if they wished. Now, there are a few obvious problems. If the Hierarch has so much power, what's to stop them from refusing to accept any more challengers? The answer, naturally, is magic.

This nation's founders laid out the essentials of this system, but they were well aware of the issues inherent within it. So they constructed three enchanted automatons, which were tasked to protect the integrity of the system. The Hierarch can do a great many things, but they cannot become a true dictator. They /must/ allow any challenger who passes the first test to attempt to usurp them. If any attempt to do otherwise is made, the Remnants will cut them down.

Now, we get to the actual story. To keep this post from being any longer than it has to be, it'll suffice to say the protagonist wants to become the Hierarch. Here's the problem- the one currently holding that role is clever. He knows that he can't rule forever, and that he might be beaten. So he's got a protege, who he's been training to challenge whoever replaces him. Then, he can rule from the shadows, without risking the wrath of the Remnants. So... the current Hierarch has to die.

The protagonist can't simply kill him, though, because the Remnants will also slay anyone who tries to take power by force. And he can't take power and /then/ kill his rival, because it will be painfully obvious who did it, and public reputation is important even if you have a lot of executive power. So he has a plan- he's going to get the Remnants to do the job for him. Maneuver the Hierarch into breaking their rules, /while/ they're engaged in their duel of wits. That way, he'll become Hierarch, and get rid of his rival, while maintaining deniability.

Now, here's the problem- it's very hard to write a character more clever than yourself. So I've hit a roadblock, when it comes to the question of 'how the protagonist gets the Remnants to kill the Hierarch.' Luckily, I can outsource my thinking to people who /are/ cleverer than me!

So, here's my questions. First: what should be the medium in which they compete? For reference, past competitions have included chess, simulated war games (the two competitors as commanders, real soldiers as their pawns), and other intellectual pursuits. It can't be anything obviously tilted towards the protagonist, because their opponent will never agree. Second: how does the protagonist get the Hierarch killed?

Some notes on what constitutes a 'breaking of the rules' for the Remnants: trying to seize power in an illegitimate manner (i.e. any way other than the system I outlined above), having challengers for the Hierarchy killed, and cheating in the contest of wits. They /are not sentient./ It's not possible to speak with, or reason with them. You can't exploit a loophole in the rules to 'convince' them that they need to kill your opponent. They aren't AI. Instead, they run off of what amounts to an absurdly complex internal decision-tree flowchart-thing, which their creators laid out. If they encounter a situation in which that decision tree has no course of action for them to follow, they are capable of summoning a simulation of their creators, which issue a judgement on the issue, and are then dismissed. This takes place internally, and instantly.
