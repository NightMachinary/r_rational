Hey again Rational,

​

As im sure you already know I am a professional audiobook narrator recording Mother of Learning as a free podcast. I am releasing the book as I go and trying to get it done as quickly as possible for you all. There are now 5 chapters done which is nearly 4 hours and has over 1000 listens.

​

My plan is to make this free but some other people on reddit suggested I set up a Patreon to gather support so I can pay my editor (audiobooks are not cheap to make). This will dramatically speed up the release schedule (and likely make the whole thing more professional).

​

Anyway, I find it weird posting this and don't expect anything but thought I would give you all the link in-case you were interested.

Thank you for all the support and thanks you guys have already given. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas for the podcast I would love to hear them.


** Hey your work is pretty good, so I hope people pitch in. I would too but Money is tight as a student. Anyway hopefully more people listen to these in general.

**** My best friend is dyslexic and is a big fan of audiobooks, last weekend he listened to all your chapters, cursed me for getting him into an incomplete audiobook, and started reading it. I am a service mechanic and have been listening through your chapters as I drive the last day or two. Long story short, thanks for the great audiobook. You do great voices.

** Are you paying any licensing costs for this to Domagoj? This entire work is under his copyright after all, and it'll be effectively impossible for him to publish a commercial audiobook if it has to compete with an illegal but available version.

** i'll throw some bch your way if you accept that. But the btc fees are outrageous and not worth using for small transactions like this ([[https://bitcoinfees.info/]])

you don't theoretically need a separate address to accept them both, but if you don't know how to access that it'd make sense just to set up a separate bch wallet.

** I will check this out. Even if I were to dislike it I would still throw some money into your tip jar to hopefully incentivise others to do the same.

Something I would really like to see is a rationalist audiobook bounty where (with the author's permission) people could set up an escro type thing for audiobooks they would like to see, and whoever creates it gets the pot (with maybe a community vote to prevent Microsoft Sam from narrating).

** I havent used patreon before. Is per creation a monthly thing or every time you put out a chapter?

As someone that wants to get into voice acting/narrating, how do you modulate your voice for different characters/accents? Especially for the opposite gender. Ive been thinking of getting singing lessons to help but am unsure if that would be applicable.

** When you do Xvim in the future, please don't have him be the not understandable Asian teacher stereotype. Every other character has been okay so far, but Xvim (though I'd think Zach would have more of a city accent; and the female characters aren't done as well as the male characters).

My favorite voice acting was Quatach Ichl. Now that was cool and immersive.
