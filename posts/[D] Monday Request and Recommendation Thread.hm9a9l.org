Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

His teardown of Sparta reads as slightly biased in a few sections, but it's also absolutely wonderful at recontextualizing that era of History.

This isn't exactly the place for it, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hm4a3c/what_books_did_you_start_or_finish_reading_this/fx42rp5/][I've posted my thoughts elsewhere on the first two books]], and the TL;DR is that I'm not particularly impressed, especially given the popularity of WoT and general praise I've heard directed towards it.

*** It's a conventional fantasy, in that it follows the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" to a T. If you don't like it by book 2 you probably won't like it later on, because while book 3 has a nice ending the books thereafter keep getting slower and slower paced, and book 10 is a total slog (which is where I gave up). However, it is a very polished and well executed version of the classic fantasy story, where you already know what the ending would be. The fun part is seeing the journey the characters take to get there. Unless you're in the mood for something like that, my guess would be that you won't enjoy it.

**** I don't mind the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" story, especially fresh takes on it. As I stated in the linked comment; that's a good way to start out with a relatable protagonist, introduce the reader to the world, and provide a steady raising of stakes throughout the narrative.

It's the execution and the journey I'm having problems with; the protagonists (especially Rand) are always on the back foot, and the antagonists aren't compelling or competent.

***** I used to love the WoT series. I read it as it was coming out (the latter half at least), and reread it several times during that period. However, what I eventually came to realize was that about half the books/plot don't really serve a purpose in the larger narrative.

You could completely remove several major plotlines (each of which took up at least one full book, and parsts of others) and all it would do is help make the story clearer.

The series has cool worldbuilding (with a host of interesting cultures, creatures, locations , history etc.) and an interesting system of magic, but that's about all it has going for it. If that's enough for you, great, you'll probably enjoy it. But you if want good characterization, decent writing, lack of unnecessary angst, and plots that make sense, well.....there is a reason that I haven't gone back to it since it finished.

*** It probably peaks around books 4-6 or so. Good worldbuilding and pretty memorable characters. The plotting doesn't really shine. I actually think the first two books are pretty weak, so the best is still ahead of you. It does get appreciably worse by the end of the Jordan segment, to the point where ther's a whole book you should just skip toward the end, as literally nothing happens. The Sanderson send-off is tolerable, though, if you'll need closure.

*** I personally found that the length of the books and the size of of setting they try to depict became grindingly difficult halfway through. Like, taking 6 viewpoint characters and separating them, swapping between them between chapters, building up a story and cast around each of them that is as big/complicated as an ordinary ensemble in its own right...kinda just tired me out. Not to say that there aren't amazing moments in each one of the books, but it sometimes get buried under the weight of everything else.

And also, as much as I think Sanderson is a good author, the last book was almost entirely gibberish to me. Maybe from being worn down so far by the preceding books, maybe from the way the plot is executed.

Overall I think the series has lots of great ideas and characters, but getting access to all that is far from free in terms of mental work.

*** I would say that it does get better. And then worse. And then better again, and then worse again, and then better again.

There's space for it, after all.

Book 4 is where the world really starts to open up. If book 1 is the honeymoon phase and book 2 is the "honeymoon is over" phase (and book 3 doesn't fit well in this sequence), then book 4 involves a lot of getting to appreciate your spouse as a person. And then things go sideways for a few books, and eventually start to go sideways-of-sideways.

Anyhow, I'd say the boring is worth the payoff of the exciting - often these are side-be-side, particularly in books 9-10. And then Brandon Sanderson comes in and more or less cleans everything up in books 12-14.

The antagonists will never be compelling or competent. The books, despite all the fighting, are not about Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil. They're /about/ all the backstabbing intrigue and personal growth of the characters that happens along the way of Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil.

** An off-the-wall ...not sure whether I'd say "recommendation", but I'd really enjoy seeing [[/r/rational]] discuss this work:

[[https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/originals/1.%20ObjectMentor][The Craftsman]], a sci-fi serial by Robert C. Martin. (The link goes to the first collection of chapters; further collections can be found by navigating up from there.)

Yes, [[http://www.cleancoder.com/products][that]] Robert C. Martin; "Uncle Bob" Martin; the guy people most associate with the popularization of [[https://agilemanifesto.org/]["agile" software development]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID][SOLID principles]] in OOP programming, etc. Back in the 90s, he wrote extremely campy edutainment fiction.

These stories, from what I can tell, were originally intended as a sort of cute ongoing bonus (like comics are in the newspaper) for readers of Martin's own /Object Mentor/ magazine. But, even after that went defunct, he continued contributing the serialized vignettes for a while to various other magazines: first /Software Development/, and then /Dr. Dobb's Journal/.

I call the story "edutainment", but I mean that in the same way that HPMoR is "edutainment": it's meant to teach you things, but it's also so heavily /dramatized/ (at least, after the first few chapters) that it feels less and less like a thought-experiment or satire, and more like a real attempt at science-fiction by someone who just happens to have a special interest in software engineering that they want to communicate through the work.

The setting for these stories is also kind of interesting: the protagonist's is a "maintenance software engineer", which doesn't seem that notable until it is gradually revealed that the codebase he's (in part) charged with /maintaining/ is that of the generation-ship he and a million other people live within. The maintenance they're doing is to the generation ship's centuries of accrued cruft logic that determines everything from soylent-green allocation to emergency bulkhead release. (Also, much like in Yudkowsky's fictional /Bayesian Conspiriacy/, or in [[http://thecodelesscode.com/contents][these well-known programming koans]], the protagonist is seemingly an apprentice in some sort of software-engineering trade-guild system.)

Honestly, it's not that I think this story is very good (or even that it accomplishes very well what it sets out to do: teaching people software-engineering concepts.) But the premise is golden. I'd love to see someone here take "maintaining the codebase of the thousand-year-old ship you and a million other people depend on" and run with it as a real ratfic, intended solely for entertainment value. Maybe even still keeping "the value of software craftsmanship" as a theme, but presented less as a thing to be beaten over the head with, and more as a /hidden power/ that you can observe the story's characters winning with, or losing for its lack (like solid statecraft is in /Practical Guide to Evil/.)

Someone actually did write that. It was about nonbinary computer programmers, and partway through the main character discovers a subculture of people who hew more closely to the binary and enjoy having sex. Or something like that.

A lot of self inserts are crack or they go out of their way to ingratiate themselves with the canon characters to have a happy go lucky adventure. Not my cup of tea.

The /Naruto/ universe has an apocalyptic future on a similar scale to Worm, so in my opinion 'fix it' stories in that fandom would also benefit from your free pass. That being said, all of these fics are ones I like because they don't indulge in any of the typical 'fix it' stereotypes:

These two are set in the past before /Naruto/ canon:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/][Sanitize]] - A doctor reincarnates in the Warring Clans era and gradually changes the world by introducing modern medical practices.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564973/1/The-Clan-of-Samsara][The Clan of Samsara]] - An entire clan composed of people who reincarnated from Earth throughout history.

The following fics are closer to the canon timeline but only touch on it peripherally. Each SI is a civilian who has to deal, in various ways, with the harsh realities of living in a world dominated by ninja.

While it /is/ true that the main character is mainly focused on surviving in a world full of unstable murderers no matter the price... the fic in general is more of a meandering, demented dance between 'full grimderp' and 'full crack' that broke my SoD within several chapters and only continued to get more absurd with time. It's not /bad/ per se, but it's definitely not 'laying low', 'accumulating power', or being 'realistic' in any way. Well, there's something to be said about how 'humor' is a part of real life too, and so 'realistic' in its own way, but, at least for /me/, Plasticity goes way beyond that and into the 'crackfic' category. I liked some of it, and would recommend it in other contexts, but definitely not in this one--while I can't really speak for the OP, I get the feeling they're looking for something more down-to-earth.

***** In my opinion, "Plasticity" has some important qualities that set it in a different category from crack fics.

To me, crack fics are ones that frequently disregard realism and internal consistency for the sake of humor. "Plasticity", on the other hand, realisticaly portrays the internal lives of its characters and the consequences of their actions.

The humor comes from the clash when the main character's futile struggles conflict with the expectations of her captors and sometimes lead to absurd results. While the situation is deadly serious for the people involved, it comes across as humorous to an outside observer. Thus, rather than being a 'crack fic', to me the fic falls into the separate category of 'crack taken seriously'.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native][Going Native]] is a great DBZ/DC crossover with a dubious SI who reincarnates into Tarble. It's a well integrated crossover and has some really good galactic politics.

- Brockton's Celestial Forge has the SI be a shard, and is from the pov of the bearer of that shard (which comes with the powers of the celestial forge, basically nerfed inspired inventor).

*** I read *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]]* recently, which is a Naruto SI fanfic that would probably fit. The SI's goal in life is basically to die of old age with as many friends and family as she can manage to bring with her. Unfortunately, the story is pre-canon and starts near the beginning of the Second Shinobi World War. Since the story is set so far in the past, most of the characters are original by necessity, though canon characters are mixed in. For example, the SI's parents are original, but her brother is canon.

The main character is born into a very minor clan, with her mother being the only surviving member at the time of her birth (her father married in). She doesn't have a kekkai genkai. However, her clan can acclimate to different poisons they come into contact with, which lets them prepare and use poisons more liberally than other shinobi. So she has a few advantages to leverage, but isn't in a particularly special position to start with.

Unfortunately, Naruto is a story about child soldiers, and this causes a fair amount of trauma for the SI and the other characters. Dealing with trauma is a major reoccurring theme of the story, in fact. It can get a bit angsty, to be honest, but if you can get past that it's pretty good.

The story is quite long at 675k words, and progresses slowly but steadily though the years. The SI regains cognizance at around one year old, and has thus far made it to the age of 13 years old.

** Any good alternate history stories?

I'm game for anything of quality, but if there's a story of a timeline better than our depressing world that would be swell. Maybe a timeline where there was no transatlantic slave trade, or where there was no scramble for Africa, no colonialism, or where there third world movement actually succeeded.

A good alternate history novel that I'd recommend would be [[https://www.amazon.ca/Years-Rice-Salt-Novel/dp/0553580078][Years of Rice and Salt]] by Kim Stanley Robinson, where the main premise is that the black plague killed off 90% of Europeans.

edit: er, just to be clear, the request and the recommendation are not connected, except by the alternate history theme. I do not think that killing 90% of europeans would lead to a "timeline better than ours", except maybe by chance. Human nature is /human/ nature.

Being the isekai reincarnation of a modern Japanese salaryman, she obviously doesn't go for the whole "blame religious minorities" and "genocide as an industry" thing, leading to a much less horrifying not-Germany in the alternate universe.

**** It's not just the year. Anti-intellectualism is on a sharp rise, right wing authoritarianism is ascendant in several western countries that should know better, China is murdering/suppressing over a million of its own citizens(and no one is doing shit), corporations are dominating the political discourse to their own stupid, short-sighted ends, and above all else there is climate change, on which only the most milquetoast proposals are actually considered and implemented.

You say Africa is going to be the next southeast Asia, I say a good part of it is going to be increasingly uninhabitable in 20-40 years. 50+ degree summers, extreme and unpredictable weather patterns and water scarcity is going to result in tens of millions of displaced persons in Africa, maybe hundreds of millions worldwide. And it's going to be blamed(correctly) on the west.

***** That's a very pessimistic way of imagining our future. Things are getting better overtime, I know a lot of people don't like hearing this but it's a fact. You can find dozens of books and hundreds of articles on it. Murder rates dropping, war casualties decreasing, reduced death from disease on average, higher quality of life...

Obviously the correct view is the balanced one rather than blindly optimistic or pessimistic, things are statistically getting better over time but new problems are arising that need solving.

Here's the thing, you can optimize your content and information consumption in such a way that makes you feel good and happy or in a way that makes you feel bad or sad.

Unless you're in a position where you can make a meaningful difference, doing things that make you feel bad is not necessarily a good idea. It may feel important or meaningful likely due to some outdated evo psych heuristic our brain uses but it probably factually isn't.

Or if you're like me and cares about the truth, just focus on that. Optimize your content consumption in a way that's compatible with it rather than focusing on optimistic or pessimistic sources.

PS. I'm almost certain things aren't going to be as bad as you seem to think.

So? Can people not be happy without macro economic growth? It will likely lead to a universal basic income being tested and applied to several countries which in the long run will improve the lives of most people and lead to a much higher degree of freedom and artistic and cultural expression..

The chinese gov is bad, but we can't do anything about it without war. This war would likely lead to the deaths of millions and likely nuclear fallouts. Therefore what we currently have is optimal given the circumstances.

Corporations are fine as long as there's government oversight and their ability to influence politics doesn't increase too much. Also people forget corporative terrorism is always an option if things get out of control. Just attach bombs to drones..

Climate change is not nearly as bad as you imply. Most predictions you'll see are worst case scenarios for 2100, and none of them have large percentages of africa become uninhabitable by 2040-60. People in africa aren't incapable and there's over 1 billion of them, they can overcome most challenges that may come their way just like the rest of the world.

So what if it worsens diplomatic relations between them and the US for a few decades or a century ? They're unlikely to ally china given the debt trap diplomacy it's been practicing there.

BTW if you like feeling bad, do some research on racism in china, while you're at it also check gender equality, gay and trans rights, and animal cruelty, censorship, the fact that chinese medicine is taken seriously there even though it's scientifically disproven..

*** I'd say it's worth watching if you have Disney+. The musical being filmed makes it so that some elements of the play are being lost in translation. Part of what I loved about the musical was the choreography of the background dancers, and when filmed, naturally the cameras will focus more on the main characters and you don't get all that's happening in the background.

This might just be me, but the emotional moments just didn't hit like they did the times I saw it live. Again, I think it's just a difference in the medium where if you see a live performance you will will be more engrossed and not be distracted by your phone or anything else.

I'm a huge Hamilton fan so I still enjoyed it quite a bit, just if you get a chance in the future, try and see a live performance. It's a great story where Hamilton is both the protagonist and antagonist and his ambition is both his greatest strength and weakness while Aaron Burr is set up as a foil to highlight Hamilton's strengths and flaws.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time][Blessed Time]] by CoCop

Blessed Time is a relatively new story on Royalroad and scratches my time-loop itch. It's set in a fairly normal LitRPG fantasy world - with classes, skill levels and such. On their sixteenth birthday, people are given a gift from the gods. This gift is a supernatural (or in low level cases preternatural) ability. Once gifted, they also get access to classes, a status screen and the other LitRPG elements. Some people don't get gifted and there's hints this creates a discriminatory caste system but that's not been developed much so far.

The central idea is the main character has an ability called Blessed Return, which sends his mind 5 years into the past. The ability then has a 5 year-cool down before it can be used again (so he can redo events multiple times but his 'redo window' only ever moves forward). This is a rare Mythic class gift, making it very powerful and very sought after. When he travels backwards in time, he looses his class but keeps his skills - resulting in progress across loops.

I'm really enjoying the story. It's written at a fairly fast pace. Normally I'd think it's too fast but it's really needed to make use of it's five year time loops. It jumps along, highlighting important moments before skipping forward months or years. This means we actually get to see the MC take advantage of multiple loops and it's enjoyable seeing how differently they can go.

I recommend people give this story a read, if not now (as I said it's new with only 23 chapters), maybe in a couple of months.

The flaws are not glorified in my writing. For instance, his "white knighting" is a knee jerk emotional reaction that immediately results in him getting his butt kicked, and chastised by other characters he respects and wants to be respected by. He recognizes his mistake, and makes changes immediately, growing his viewpoint as he learns more about the nuances of the situation. The changes to his brain and thought processes by the Mental stat growth is a recurring theme of the story.

Even before now, I have already made a major edit and update to the most problematic chapter referenced indirectly in i_choose_magikarp's feedback. I would recommend checking the story out in a couple of months once the full updated chapters are posted.

One of my major goals in posting the story online was to receive feedback on my writing in order to improve and execute my ideas better. Since I completed the first book last week, it seemed like a good time to take a short break and do some editing in between working on the second book.

Mainly I will be focusing on improving the prose, removing repetitive sentences and ideas, and tweaking the dialogue to sound more natural. Additionally, I will be pruning back a few of the problematic scenes, and toning down some of the initial romantic flirting.

The characters are still flawed, that is intentional to some degree and definitely a matter of taste for the reader, but hopefully my execution will continue to improve.

******* Is it? I guess if the story is posted in a dozen different places.

Some authors do go back and fix their messes when they get reader feedback (not as trustworthy as editor feedback but still). It's just that most webfic is either hobby writing or "I need to write three chapters a day to keep the Patreon momentum going" writing, and they'd rather move on than tediously rewrite.

The last remaining contestant wins 500k. Contestants are able to bring 10 items from a list provided by the show as well as 45kg of camera equipment to self document their time. Full disclosure I've only seen the first season.

Seasons 1-2 are on amazon prime. Seasons 3-6 are on hulu. Season 6 is on Netflix.

** Just finished [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The snake report]] which reignited my yearning for stories where the MC is "*mentaly but not physically human*".

Any more recommendations for more stories like this?

Almost anything is fine (translated/manga/anime is fine too, but I probably read/watched most of them already and unfortunately none up to the quality of The snake report) and I am specifically after HUMANS reincarnated/transferred whatever into non-human bodies, (so not like Mud's mission where the MC is not actually human).

Also ideally one where the MC actually does interact with the human population and is not just stuck in a dungeon the whole time or something. - I don't know what is so appealing to me about just reading the reactions of normal people to intelligent whatevers, and for some reason just the meaningless kindness of something which normally wouldn't do so makes me feel so happy.

I asked last week, but didn't really get any answers for what I was after so wanted to try again.

Other than that it's pretty similar to the snake report (or really vice versa) in that protagonists are both human minds in the body of (mutant) animals, in a dangerous dungeon.

This is my interpretation of the events you described. I don't understand everything, but it doesn't seem random. I just don't think we have enough information about the underlying mechanics to know what happened.

Swordmaster Zane interrupts the Elves' blood magic ritual by killing everyone. This is a bad way to interrupt a blood magic ritual, because it just makes more blood. This ends up overloading whatever the spell the Elves were trying to perform on the Snake. Blood magic is powered by some sort of deal made with past generations or Gods or something. Somehow, The Snake gets into the air, and is looking down on these Gods (collectively known as Chaos) from above. They like him because they know he'll be the Enemy of the World and do all that crazy stuff with the giant frog god and I guess that's pretty chaotic. But don't like him because they think it's too soon, so they hit him with fire and force(?), to try to attack him, but only push him up higher. Eventually pushing him up into space. Then he falls back down to the ground on another continent. Presumably saved by the cage erected for him by the elves. I'm not sure why his magic was messed up, but everything messed up had to do with the earth (assuming the messages were some manifestation of the Voice of Gaia). Possibly his connection with it was severed after he travelled far enough, or the ritual blocked it.

*** Roger Zelazny (prominent new wave scifi author of 60s-90s, known for /Amber/ and /Lord of Light/) wrote some pretty good poetry, most of it early, before he moved on to prose.

Unfortunately, it's not super easy to get your hands on it these days; I just looked for an online source and failed to find anything good. It was originally published in small, limited-run collections that [[https://www.amazon.com/Spin-Miracle-Poetry-Roger-Zelazny/dp/0934438498][go for a lot]] used these days. It was reprinted more recently in the [[https://data.nesfa.org/press/Books/Zelazny-Project.html][Zelazny project]] omnibus volumes, which are easier to get, but they're expensive. Maybe you could get them from a library, though.

If you do manage to get your hands on a source, poems of his I recommend:

- To Spin Is Miracle Cat
- Spring Morning: Missive
- Song
- Lobachevsky's Eyes (this one appears in his novel /Doorways in the Sand/)
- To His Morbid Mistress

/edit/ [[https://libcat.ru/knigi/fantastika-i-fjentezi/kiberpank/57724-roger-zelazny-to-spin-is-miracle-cat.html][Here]]'s a sketchy Russian website with a bunch of them.

Found a source for the full text of one, so here's a sample:

--------------

*Song*

When I learned the other day

that everything Emily Dickinson wrote

can be sung to the tune

of "The Yellow Rose of Texas”

I was crushed.

It was true.

I can no longer read Emily Dickinson

but Lone Star ghosts flit across the page,

the Alamo is not forgotten

and I hear the thundering hoofbeats

of the great horse Silver.

.

I wondered then

whether every person who pens a poem

has a tune,

a secret melody which will destroy him

if the word gets out.

A small thought, perhaps,

not quite as profound as it sounds;

and those who fool with /vers libre/

should be safer than most.

Yet the notion nags.

There's an awful lot of music in the world...

.

To be trapped by John Cage

or crushed by Leadbelly

would be bad enough.

But I have this nightmare

of being done in by a hymn.

If /Rock of Ages/ gets me in the end,

mocked Emily's diamond eyes

may sparkle like the dew

in stillnesses that lie

between the words and the Word.

*** I would strongly recommend Max Gladstone's /Craft Sequence/ pretty strongly to anyone on this subreddit.

It's set in an alternate world that vaguely resembles a magitech ealy-mid 20th century. The basic premise is that magic is generally based on belief and life energy, but about a couple hundred years before the "present" people figured out how to quantify and rigorously manipulate it. This left to a huge war that resulted in the new style of magic triumphant, creating a world where magic resembles modern financial and legal instruments, with the major players essentially acting as multinational corporations.

The first book is about competing teams of necromancer-lawyers competing over which faction gets to resurrect a deceased god that died because it over-leveredged its belief and didn't have enough power to survive an unexpected contractual obligation.

In general, the books are thoughtful and imaginative in ways that should appeal to folks that like this subreddit. They tend to examine modern issues through a lens of magic in ways I've not really seen any other author do.

As for some scattershot recommendations spanning a broad range of Genres with some relatively unknown and other quite popular:

Book (nonfiction): The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements by Sam Kean. My all-time favorite book.

Book (Fiction): Probably the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I'd recommend either starting with the Night Watch series of books or one of his YA standalone novels, Nation, which is a masterpiece. Good Omens is also a good stand-alone novel.

Korean Webnovel- [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/flow/list?title_no=101&page=1][Flow]] by HoneyB. My favorite complete korean webcomic. It has a setting in which everyone gets a wish from a gaurdian god but you have to pay an equivalent price. It's quite well done and I especially like the ending.

Finally, as someone is highly involved in rocketry, [[https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf][Ignition]], is a story of experimental rocket propellant chemistry and is quite a good read.

I've watched a few movies recently and found most mediocre, but liked the Apollo 11 documentary, Parasite, Knives Out and 1917.

For TV I'd recommend [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Hannibal]], [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/][The Americans]], and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Avatar: The Last Airbender]]. And for anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note][Death Note]], [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica][Puella Magi Madoka Magica]] (if you choose to watch this, make sure to stick with it until at least the 3rd episode before deciding to abandon it), and [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/37779/Yakusoku_no_Neverland?q=the%20promised%20neverland][The Promised Neverland]].

Edit: also, recently watched the Hamilton musical, and that was amazing (it was recently released on Disney+).

Edit2: A bit controversial I'm told (not in the culture war way), but I really liked [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online][Sword Art Online]] too (but /not/ the second part, I'd recommend stopping after episode 14, and going no further).

**** I'll note that so far [[https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][SAO Abridged]] has been very sharply written, and especially improves on character arcs and motivation.

Yeah, not much point to a story set in a game when they can just leave any time lol.

***** Sword Art Online:

Idk, I think the second part would have made a good story on it's own, but because they reused the characters, it ended up just robbing the original of it's ending.

*** Anime:

Kyousogiga (TV) is great at 10 episodes. Tells the story of a family of Japanese deities that live in the Mirror Capital (Kyoto but spelled differently).

For manga:

The Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is 10 volumes long. Amamiya Yuuhi is a disaffected university student that gets chosen as one of the Beast Knights who must protect the Earth from the Wizard's assault. He doesn't want to do it.

*** For long book series where each book is quick and punchy, you can't go wrong with Vlad Taltos, Alex Verus, or Dresden Files.

Vlad Taltos is about a fantasy mafia leader/assassin. Alex Verus is about an urban mage with short range precognition, and Dresden files is about a wizard in modern chicago.

** Pretty generic request here: Rational Lit-RPGs. Preferably fantasy based.

The wiki lists a bunch of stories, but none of them (except Harry Potter and the Natural 20) are obviously a Lit-RPG.

*** I haven't really seen much rational-genre explorations of litrpg, but these skirt the edge.

- Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has a few main characters and a power system that is pretty well understood. Leads to some good worldbuilding. Characters are pretty well done too for the genre, with no character really holding the idiot ball later on (beginning is a bit different, but hey at least the characters learn and evolve past their mistakes).

- Ar'Kendrythist starts off like Delve but goes on to do its own thing. The characters are well done imo and undergo some good development. Not as much of a rational munchkining as you may want, but for me it has been satisfying.

** I've been watching anime lately. By default, it's not a particularly rational medium, but the following at least have consistent characterization.

Evangelion (Whole load of fantasy science, but covers real psychology. Picks up around the halfway point. Dubs are mediocre.)\\
Steins;Gate (Pop culture, science; will not hold up under scrutiny, but some of the science at least pays lip service to real theories. Picks up around the halfway point. Dub throws in some awkward slang occasionally, but also adapts references, and is high quality.)

Madoka Magica (Irrational characters, rational setting. Gen Urobuchi's works: Kamen Rider Gaim; Psycho-Pass; Fate/Zero, tend to fall under this banner. Picks up a few episodes in. Can watch as three movies, or a series + the third movie. Dub is great.)

Re:Zero (Realistic protagonist. Does a good job foreshadowing and keeping viewers hooked from the start. Probably my favourite of the lot. Dub is great.)

*** People on [[/r/rational]] tend to like Promised Neverland, which has both an anime and a manga. I haven't watched it beyond the first few episodes myself tho, I have a hard time keeping up with anime.

** I once read a blog post on how to write blog posts that teach abstract concepts. The gist of it was that you do start with a metaphor and then use progressively more abstract explanations. I can't find this blog post.\\
I think it was a math blog.

Does anyone here know where I can find what I am talking about?
