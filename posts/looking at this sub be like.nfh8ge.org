** I would like to state for the record that this is [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/rationalist]]. The sidebar explanation that rationalist fic is a subset of rational fic is good enough for me.

Sure, HPMoR was a founding work of the subreddit, but I'll wager a significant fraction of the members weren't in it for the didactic side. For all its flaws, MoR has some /incredibly clever/ ideas about what has to change from the HP canon in order to...rationalize...the weirder elements. That sort of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency is a hallmark of rational fiction.

Like, assuming the worst case scenario that I can imagine (something like "star wars meets fast & furious in not even pretending to care about logics anymore"), the only reasonable thing to do for characters would be to spin in circles facepalming about the wretch of a universe they are in, with the very physical laws changing every odd hour.

Sufficient worldbuilding is a motel off an exit of that road.

Worldbuilding past that point is neither necessary nor sufficient for a rational story. Unnecessary because an overbuilt world won't fix bad characters, insufficient because an overbuilt world won't fix bad characters.

Then, I suppose in the sense that it's really hard to have a story move forward (and happen at all) only with static objects, characters are eventually more important.. but regardless "rational" still seems to apply to the overall result.

If I'm reading The Martian, and some rick-and-morty-like paradoxical event happens, then the protagonist can be as shrewd as you want, but the mood will be ruined.

**** in essence, yes. though there are certain elements you come across a lot in fictions discussed on this sub that extend beyond common writing maxims. Trope deconstructions, logical (vs emotional) protagonists, DnD-esque magic systems with clear rules and numbers, etc. It's a mix of influences from genre fiction, fanfiction, Japanese light novels/anime, and of course, the spectre of Eliezer Yudkowsky.

I agree with you though. I'm much more a fan of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency than any of the things I just listed. But I still check [[/r/rational]] because it's one of few forums where people who read stuff online discuss things critically and share things that are (generally) quite interesting.

It's not a perfect community and the term 'rational fiction' is a bit silly, mostly since it implies that things outside it are somehow not-rational (or perhaps irrational). Like naming your personal philosophy 'Objectivist,' it feels rather conceited and short-sighted.

**** It turns out that the borders of genres are NOT WELL DEFINED. Also if they're helping people find media that they enjoy that's pretty much the point. Genres are shorthand so we don't have to sit and describe a kind of thing we like for ten minutes every time we need to say it. Thoughtful world building and internal consistency IS part of the Rational genre because people use it that way and it can only truly be defined by its use.

**** The best understanding I've cultivated about what defines rational fiction as a genre is the specific feeling of /things making sense/. It's the feeling when all the pieces start coming together at the end of the mystery plot. It's the feeling when you connect the plot event to previous events that seemed initially unrelated. It's the feeling of reading bits of worldbuilding and seeing a coherent world assemble itself before your eyes. And my brain goes nuts for it.

Plotholes, by contrast, are when things explicitly /don't/ make sense, and just like I love things explicitly making sense I hate things explicitly not making sense. Put the two together and you get why I like rational fiction.

Some of this is just good writing advice, but it's distinctly more than just that. The specific feeling of things making clear sense is something that can be absent in other good stories which focus on other feelings that might resonate with people, and which can be present even in otherwise bad stories.

Rationalism itself, imo, is just an adjacent group that happens to attract the kinds of people who respond well to that feeling, which made 'ratfic' around seeking that feeling while being loosely defined as 'the kinds of stories we like'.

**** Reading was always something I pursued as a form of escapism.

That feeling of discovery with exploring a new world, playing a mental what-if. You get to travel with a good book. Sometimes you travel in someone's headspace, sometimes you travel through a narrator's eyes, and finding the good places is a real treat.

/rationalism has been a great way to taste a multitude of worlds and every now and then, chew on some wonderful mental problems. They won't all be good, but this sub provides a space for authors to develop and readers to encourage those authors to feed our addiction.

Everything else is, as stated, just thoughtful world building and internal consistency.

No idea about "most people" in the sub.

I mean threre's less rationalist fics out there in general so obiously they are going to be a smaller fraction of things posted and that's going to affect what kind of people is attracted to the subreddit but meh would have to do a survey or something.

Also you can be a fan of both things.

The sidebar has a list:

#+begin_quote
  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:
#+end_quote

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
- *Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.*
