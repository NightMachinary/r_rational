This is a fun manga / anime, centered on the process of becoming an astronaut.

Every character has interesting depths. Nobody is an unrealistic idiot or evil mutant, even when some people sometimes act dumb or jerkily.

The depiction of smart people is very good. For example, the main character is a mechanical engineer. During the show, he sometimes actually uses engineering to solve problems. Other people get to be smart too.

There's no world-ending stakes, nobody swings swords or shoots lasers at anybody else. It's a good example of how to generate stories without taking the "easy way out" of violent confrontation - stories that can take place entirely within civilization.

As for problems, there's a tension between showing a main character with weird (and stereotypical) reactions to women, and normalizing those reactions. Also, there may be a little magic for no good reason.


** I really like this one too. Probably the most realistic work of scifi I've ever seen. Pretty much it slowly details a series of missions returning to the moon in 2025 and the astronaut training and selection process.

There was one other problem for me as well though:

[[#s][Unfortunately]]

It sounds like I'm ranting here but all in all I do still strongly recommend this.

Also, like you said:

"Other people get to be smart too."

As an aside, I tend not to like stories where only one character gets to be smart and the whole thing is about that person gaming the system and the like.

*** The story and timeline is strangely actually less ambitious than ours and Elon Musk's real life story is actually crazier and more drama-filled in some respect.

** Related: the short film, "We Can't Live Without Cosmos". [[http://oscar.go.com/nominees/short-film-animated/we-cant-live-without-cosmos][Link]] that may or may not work.

** Space Brothers! (Feel so moon)

This is an excellent read. Updates every so often on the scanlation sites. Think Martian, but longer, and with less going wrong, but more being attempted.
