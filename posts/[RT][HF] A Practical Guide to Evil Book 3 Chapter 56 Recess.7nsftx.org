*** Not really. Warlock never liked Cat because he always had suspicions that the story between Cat and Black will end with Cat killing Black. All this time to the Warlock it seemed to be a far off concern. Sabah's death and Black's behavior splashed a metaphorical bucket of cold water in his face. So now he realizes it's a very, very real possibility. That and he and Black both are still very raw over Sabah's death. He's not thinking straight at the moment.

*** Warlock is probably very attuned to how the stories of Creation go, and with Captain's death, he knows that Black's days are numbered. Just by Catherine being the Squire, Black will eventually die one way or another. So he is understandably angry, since Black is pretty much his only "friend".

*** I don't think there's a single person left in Black's entourage that doesn't hate Catherine for what she is. Sabah liked anyone that joined their pseudo-family, everyone else considered Cat a mortal threat to their leader from the moment she took the Squire's mantle. Warlock and Ranger are simply more outspoken on that matter than Scribe, Assassin or the Dread Empress.

They aren't wrong either, evil characters killing their mentor is Career Planning 101. Doubly so for someone like Warlock who got his Name this way.

Once she achieved Squire, she was 'destined' to be the doom of Black. Whether she could replace him or whether she turned and became the White, either way she is determined by the story to bring about his demise.

Of course, we know how well /that/ goes... Cat's not one to let someone else write her story for her.

It's just a really cute case of "opposites attract". Or, if one decides to dig deeper, Archer basing the strength she's attracted to not so much on body as determination whereas in Hierophant's case it's more about her being a person he can't accidentally drive away.

**** I feel it could go either way. Masego always struck me as asexual, in the sense that he simply doesn't even think about sex or romance unless it's in an academic sense, let alone desire it. Archer though is very obviously a sexual creature, and she's getting Masego to grow closer to her. It's possible that this will lead to him developing feelings for her, kinda like how Warlock is seemingly a sociopath but still developed feelings for a select few individuals (Black, Sabah, his husband, his son).

***** Allosexuals can have platonic friendships too, though. Archer could be pursuing that with him (even if she wouldn't say no to a romantic/sexual relationship if he were interested). I see it as a developing close friendship, potentially as intimate and meaningful as a romance without being one.

This might be wishful thinking on my part. I know that there are people in real life who are just /mostly/ asexual or aromantic. And in the future, when the general population is aware that ace/aro people exist and aren't just broken, frigid, sociopathic, etc, it would be cool to see characters all along those spectra represented in fiction. But right now seeing /any/ ace/aro representation is rare, and having Archer turn out to be an "exception" to Masego's orientation would kind of undermine it here. We already hear "you just need to find the right person" constantly, and a canonical romance between Masego and Archer would essentially validate that frustrating stereotype (edit: but only if it involved sex, romance alone doesn't undermine asexuality).

********* Will there be an attempt to explain why this is so in the story? The statistical anomaly of this many characters having a different orientation is unsettling in a story where you should be actively analysing for all sorts of things. It's an out of place red herring IMO. What someone could make of it I have no clue, but it sticks out like a sore thumb and distracts the reader from the rest of the story if they pick up on it. It could be something as simple as 'Named are quirky, and orientation is definitely something that sticks out, and it's super well know or whatever' and it would be fine i think, and if someone is still bothered by it that's sadly probably got nothing to do with reason.

An admirable thing to do and I'm actually enjoying seeing this in characters, and learning what it means for their personality or whatever makes me put my phone down and think at the time, but it's my biggest issue with the story so far and it could be smoothed over with an offhand comment.

Also, just picked up the story in early December and holy crap is it awesome! This is a genuine inspiration to me, I'm just not sure what to do with that because I'm not inspired often. Keep up the awesome, at this point if you stop the story I might die!

Ok that actually made me laugh. No of course not. It being a coincidence felt really off to me, as I said in the other comment, so I wanted some way of letting the reader know that they were more common because it being a plot point didn't make any sense at all. It could be that it is more common for Named to be lgbtq+ for whatever reason, maybe just because it's yet another quirk, and that would be fine because most of the relationships we know of are among Named, and if it's exclusive to Named that's a way to comment on it, or it could be that they are actually more common among the whole of the populace, in which case having a high lord make some incredibly crass comment about repopulation problems due to people's sexuality preventing them from participating, and Cat 'educating' him with her sword would be funny as all heck.

You seem to believe that it's a flaw in the work for an apparent statistical anomaly (assuming, perhaps erroneously, that heterosexuality is as dominant in this setting as it is in ours) to exist without being a piece of the greater puzzle somehow, and I don't understand why. A rational approach to our own universe requires accepting that some things are just a coincidence; I'm pretty sure assigning undue significance to improbable outcomes is a typical example of irrationality in rationalist discourse. So why doesn't that apply here?

************** OK, so that's a different argument than "chance doesn't play a hand because it's a rationalist work." That argument didn't make sense because it's typically /irrational/ to assume that nothing is coincidental. Your position now is that chance can't play a hand because the setting is explicitly built on story tropes, right?

I would argue that just because story tropes are built into the setting does not mean that coincidences cannot exist in that setting. The serial's various LGBT+ characters aren't native to Arcadia, their characteristics and actions aren't 100% dictated by story. /Their/ world seems to operate as a sort of hybrid of realism and tropes, wherein tropes can be applied to existing scenarios to push them toward a desired outcome. I don't see that as mutually exclusive with "statistical anomalies that are just statistical anomalies and not some kind of plot clue."

We also have to consider that the tropes we've seen affect outcomes in this setting are of the grand, deeply-ingrained, mythologically significant sort. The rule of three, the theft of fire, the slaying of the maiden-killing beast, etc. I'm not aware of any trope of similar weight that relates to an improbable concentration of non-heterosexual folks playing an influential role in the protagonist's struggle.

My position hasn't changed I'm just doing a crap job at representing it because I'm distracted IRL but trying to keep conversation active while it's still relevant. I was trying to get at chance not being a device the author uses because the reader is expected to come to the same conclusions as the characters, as well as there being little room for chance within the narrative due to stories, but clearly missed the buck both times I tried to type it out lol.

You have a point actually, thank you. I think I was confused by the token gay character trope (but that doesn't normally have a narrative impact does it?), and assuming that nothing is ever a coincidence with master planers because 'nothing is a coincidence with master planners'. It felt really awkward to have that opinion, hence why i spoke up about something so minor. I haven't really had much time to mull over it all, I just got caught up.

On that note, it's kinda disappointing how crazy the Calamities are. It seems like they're all willing to kill her to save Black, yet she's precisely what he wanted - a worthy successor who shares his methodology. Trying to kill her is like spitting in his face.

Don't get me wrong, it's good to see they're flawed people despite their power, it's just... what are they trying to achieve? Either come to terms with Black's death or legitimately try to kill her. Making threats achieves nothing. Is the narrative causing some of this conflict? It's like they're throwing a tantrum cause the story isn't going their way, yet they're not actually willing to change it.

On the final note, I hope when Cat picks up a new Name it will accommodate the Winter power. Becoming a fae, even partially, would be a huge disadvantage considering how often she depends on changing the narrative to win.

It's not like he'd lose anything in the attempt. Black wouldn't be overly pissed at him and Masego wouldn't go against his father over Nauk (for Cat maybe but definitely not Nauk).

**** Haha, rice. Yeah you're right. But in that enclosed tent in close quarters inside Cat's own camp with all of The Woe (sans Thief) and Black merely a few feet away?

Situation wise that would not be a curbstomp battle though Warlock might win if he disrupted the spell structure around Cat's soul but that wouldn't kill Cat instantly and in those precious few seconds she's still alive she literally has the full power of a Princess level Fae. She also has TAKE and BREAK.

So why wouldn't she simply imbue all that power into her aspect BREAK and BREAK the Warlock's Name before she bit it? Its already been shown that you can write "instructions" on Names which is what Cat did with the Lone Swordsman when she just a regular non Fae titled transitional Squire and the Lone Swordsman was a fully realized Name.

It stands to reason that she could BREAK the Warlock's name with the full power of Winter at her behest.

Those odds are only applicable if Warlock is calm (which he is not at that moment) and prepared (I hazard a guess not as well as he should be for a Named like Cat).

I put it at 10/10 for a mutual kill.

*** Depends on the starting conditions.

There, in the tent, in melee range? /Cat/ all the way.

She simply needs to invoke any of her Three Aspects while drawing her sword. All his complicated magical wards and such are (broken/cease functioning for a time/have their control subverted) for the fraction of the second it takes for her to decapitate him. I think this is one reason he didn't push it or try to attack her in any way, honestly.

In any other situation, involving just the two of them? Warlock, 100%. If Warlock has time to prepare for you, he's going to win.

If there's a situation where there is so much as audio communication available between her and Black? Cat, again, because Black will stop Warlock, even if only as a distraction for her to finish him, though quite likely as part of one of his contingency plans.

*** I'd guess it would be a mutual kill. Warlock could most likely destroy the framework keeping Catherine's Winter title from killing her but she would almost certainly be able to take out warlock before her body gives out on her.

*** In a hypothetical, I'd bet on Warlock 100%. Dude can take out armies, he'd obliterate her in seconds. But in the /actual story,/ I'd bet on Cat. Being the main POV character confers a massive advantage, even if she isn't aware of it. The arbiter of her reality wants her to succeed.

*** In single combat, I'd bet on Warlock eight times out of ten. Ten times, if he actually plans it instead of blindly lashing out.

Cat has raw power, but Warlock has more as well as decades of practice using that power in combat. I'm pretty sure Cat isn't yet at the level where she can survive things that level cities or topple mountains.

Now, if Black and/or Masego get involved (on Catherine's side) that'd be something different...

I don't think Cat losing would be a result of differences in raw power, but rather finesse. Her soul is far too vulnerable.

***** Yeah, as Warlock has pointed out, she's left herself pretty fragile and vulnerable to anyone who can manipulate souls. That includes most magic-based Named, apparently (eg. Masego and possibly Akua), and definitely Warlock himself.

The ability to drop a mountain on her is just a viable Plan B, after that.

*** I think in terms of pure destructive power, Warlock is far superior to Cat. At the same time, Cat has a lot of skills which are directed at single strong opponents (such as Take).

Honestly, it would probably depend on how long it takes to break down Cat's soul. If it takes little effort, she would be boned. If it takes significant effort I would bet on her to win, assuming Break works on sorcery.

*** Warlock. He's way more OP than Catherine and Catherine is clearly very vulnerable to the kind of magic that Warlock is especially good at in her current state.

20% chance Catherine causes some sort of serious damage.

5% chance of a mutual kill.

*** Cat, because she has the power of narrative on her side with the young vs. the old right now. But narrative forces also dictate that there would be no fight here, since there has been no hinting or build up to it.

**** I wouldn't agree with the no build up line. Tension had been present (from the Warlock's side at least) from the moment Cat became Black's Squire and took up the Squire Name. It increased and became mutual when Warlock threatened Cat and now with this it has intensified. Powder Kegs have been filled and gathered. All it takes now is the Spark.
