Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I have a colleague who is antivax and creationist (with Ancient Aliens in Mesopotamia, based on ridiculously wild misinterpretation of their creation myths). I retaliate by feeding him all kinds of plausible conspiracies that are incompatible with and encroach on his beliefs (the bicameral mind, hybrid / stabilization theory of human evolution, anticholesterol drug conspiracism).

*** I'll add another to your list: the high concentration of mattress firms in southern California is due to the Russian Malfia conducting money laundering schemes with mattress companies. Think about it, how often do you buy a mattress? Why are there so many in Southern California?

**** I'd have to adapt this to our context (France and Ireland, instead of USA), but worth digging into, thanks.

** Ineffective medical treatments are pseudoscience and they take advantage of people's ignorance. Does this mean that skepticism of the possible feasibility of cryonics is pseudoskepticism? It's fine to voice doubts, but saying it's totally ok to let people predictably 'pass away' into corpses because cryonics has a less than 100 percent chance of working is pseudoskepticism.

** When is screaming rational?

When someone is yelling at you? (defensive/anger response)

When it'll get you what you want? (manipulative action)

When there's nothing else to do? (exasperation)

Obviously humans are not rational and conversations are complex, more about being right than logical, but when does a screaming match really make sense to be used, outside of emotional outbursts?

** I have a friend who believes in god. He's quite similar to me and has been my best friend for half a decade. I've introduced LessWrong to him and taken him to our local rationality dojo. He's quite receptive to ideas I talk to him about and he's willing to openly discuss his religion. he expresses due doubt of his belief but on further consideration, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/43PTNr4ZMaezyAJ5o/the-proper-use-of-doubt][he may be doing it incorrectly]]. I've read a couple of things Eliezer has said about:

a) people learning rationality wrong and using it to shore up irrational beliefs ([[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Valley_of_bad_rationality]])

b) rational people being incapable of applying their rationality to criticise their religious beliefs (can't find source)

And I'm worried that sharing rationality without careful preparation could be a Bad Idea. Before this, I didn't have any reason to dissuade my friend from his belief (christian protestant); he is happy with it and it has had a net positive effect on his life. Now I am considering properly arguing about it with him in order to check if it's a problem and maybe resolve it if it is. What do you guys think is a good idea? Any passing thoughts or comments are welcome and may be more useful than only one or two comprehensive responses.

Edit: Word choice to remove possible offensiveness

*** I think you are likely to lose a friend if you consistently act like you think his viewpoint is fundamentally inferior to yours, and you are unlikely to accomplish anything.

I don't think you should argue with him about his religion.

**** I see it's probably the line:

#+begin_quote
  before his mind gets messed up with rationalising his beliefs
#+end_quote

"messed up" wasn't originally my word choice, but one I read somewhere. I see that from the perspective of a reader this is quite offensive, especially with the "before" implying an assertion. I'll edit it and leave this comment here to show what I had taken out

**** Thank you for responding! I appreciate that you are willing to criticise me about this, but I guess that's the whole appeal of this community. I need to develop my communication skills and how to come across as less offensive, so I'd really like to know what parts gave off my impression of superiority.

I do consider his viewpoint to be inferior, but not fundamentally. For one, I think that his belief has made his life much better, eg. it has been an opportunity for him to meet and connect with people who have positively impacted his life. I am specifically worried that he may not be analysing his belief properly and if so that would be a sign to *do something*. Note that I specifically want to /argue with him/ as opposed* to convince* him: If he is right, then I want to know about it.

As for the losing a friend part; this kind of thing I wouldn't even attempt with most of the people I know. I'm considering this entirely for my friend's well being and it's completely consensual; if he didn't want to argue about it then I wouldn't pursue it.

Edit: word choices

Edit: Does this affect your opinion?
