Suppose you have access to a death note (a notebook that kills people whose names are written on it) and a shinigami (god of death) with it. What questions would you ask the shinigami about the workings of the death note? (And no, the shinigami can't answer "Please tell me all the death note rules." or variations.)

EDIT: (Also, please don't look up the official rules of the DN online, I'd like some spontaneous idea generation :P)


** The critical questions about the Death Note are what it can achieve in terms of optimization, fact-revealing, the limits of the channels by which it can alter reality, and what the Death Note's existence reveals about the rest of reality. The fact that the Death Note kills people is a distraction, the critical point is that it's MAGIC. So, sample questions:

- Can the Death Note ensure that the past (from before the command was written) is in conformance with the required result? What if I write that in 30 seconds someone will die from atherosclerosis or an advanced brain cancer? This doesn't distinguish well between the atherosclerosis having been retroactively added, or just magically materalized, but there may be other ways to check.

- Can the Death Note reveal facts via its operation? What are the limits of what it can reveal? E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."

- How much optimization can the Death Note do to achieve the desired outcome? "Bob is killed by Device X functioning as intended." Device X uses a thermodynamic random noise generator to try to solve an NP-hard problem and fires a bullet if it succeeds. (If that works, try it on a protein folding problem and get nanotechnology.)

If there's a Shinigami who might answer you, there are all sorts of questions which are worth at least trying to ask, like:

- What the hell is going on
- Why do Shinigami exist
- Do Shinigami have brains and how do the brains work
- What is the nature of magic and how does it fit into a universe that sure looked like it ran on mathematically simple laws up until this point
- What is the earliest event that Shinigami remember
- How did Shinigami come into existence
- Are there other realms like those of the Shinigami
- Are there other interesting artifacts in the world besides Death Notes
- What determines whether or not you can answer one of my questions
- Are there beings (or nonbeings) who can answer more of my questions
- Are there any books I should read about this stuff
- If some rule prevents you from answering me directly, are you allowed to do hints
- Are there any behaviors you can exhibit which can correlate to the answers of my questions
- What would potentially motivate you to give me hints, is there anything I have that you might want, can we trade utility function fulfillments

I finally remark that it seems to me that if the canon rules are not artificially hacked to forbid it, the canon Death Note has demonstrated enough power to fulfill the command, "Bob dies of a quiet stroke in a bathroom stall of the following club, brought on by the excitement of seeing on his cellphone that his lottery ticket has the winning numbers." Then take the ticket and go.

It cannot.

  #+begin_quote
    The conditions for death will not be realized unless it is physically possible for that human or it is reasonably assumed to be carried out by that human.

    #+begin_quote
      If you write die of disease with a specific disease's name and the person's time of death, there must be a sufficient amount of time for the disease to progress. If the set time is too tight, the victim will die of a heart attack after 6 minutes and 40 seconds after completing the Death Note.
    #+end_quote

In the second episode of the anime Light tests this; he tries to kill a Japanese prisoner "one hour later in Paris". Since it's physically impossible for him to be transported to Paris in that time by current technology, and the Death Note has a limited span of action, he just dies of a heart attack.

#+begin_quote

E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false." "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."
#+end_quote

It is not established. However, the same episode, along with the previously mentioned rules, suggest that it wouldn't be possible unless the person can think of it. There is also this rule:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Suicide is a valid cause of death. Basically, all humans are thought to possess the possibility to commit suicide. It is, therefore, not something unbelievable to think of.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

which suggests that your second example might be plausible, if Bob is a trained scientis who can reasonably reach that conclusion by his own means; but since the first example works on hypothesis instead of factual knowledge, the Death Note would simply kill him with a heart attack.

#+begin_quote
  How much optimization can the Death Note do to achieve the desired outcome? "Bob is killed by Device X functioning as intended." Device X uses a thermodynamic random noise generator to try to solve an NP-hard problem and fires a bullet if it succeeds. (If that works, try it on a protein folding problem and get nanotechnology.)
#+end_quote

This one might actually work, but the device would have to fit the limits of reasonable thought. Since you cannot make a human murder another one intentionally, you would need science geniuses willing to give their lives for science. The most plausible scenario that I can think of (that could succeed) is this:

1. Make a scientist (Dave) build a prototype. If it doesn't work, go to step 2.

2. Organise the lab in a way that success starts a chain reaction that kills the guy.

3. Write on the Note: "Dave. [time of death]. Goes to work and analyses his prototype. Figures out the problem with it and fixes it. He tests it and the device works as intended. The device starts a chain reaction [describe reaction in detail within the limits of reasonable thought]. The last step kills him without suffering."

4. If it doesn't work, Dave will die of a heart attack, which means he wasn't able to fix the device. Kill a few more scientists until you a) find one who can do it or b) the utilitarian value of the device is outweighed by the utilitarian value of the scientists' lives (which, depending on the device and the scientists, is totally subjective).

By the way, big fan, waiting for chapter 102.

If you can get the answer to that, then you have an engine -- kill and then resurrect people in order to gain more information, more lottery wins, etc.

** When a shinagami kills someone with the deathnote they get their life added on to their own. So is lifeforce tangible via some sort of liquid assets system? And if so, where does the life go when a mortal uses it to kill (or perhaps the life extension for shinigami is just an arbitrary incentive to do their jobs occasionally.)?

If a shinagami using it to extend lives is lethal to them, what happens if a mortal uses it to extend lives?

Whats so special about humans to the death note? Could it be used to kill an uploaded consciousness? A strong AI? Any other sapient being with a cultural tenancy to choose a name? Can a human ever have no Name?

Also the death note constitutes a bit of supernatural mind control. But the limits of this aren't really clear... I'm pretty sure the original limit was anything they could reasonably be expected to do. Which was vague. Can I make a tech official change his password to something I know and open a firewall hole to a specified IP? These are the sorts of things I'd expect to have to test myself rather than ask rules for though.

**** I am fairly certain he's writing Misa's questions to Rem, and Misa seems to be a rational person in the sense of Less Wrong. So the attempt is to figure out how someone with a similar mindset but who was ignorant of all the rules of the Death Note would go about figuring them out, without testing it, as sane people might have a moral opposition to killing people to test the limits.

Here are a few from me, specifically about how to break it like a handheld time machine given to children. These assume I am Misa and know what she knows:

Is there a time limit on the Death Note? Can I write my own name for example and write 'Dies peacefully in her sleep in 1 billion AD'?

Is someone whose name and type of death is written immune to dying in any other manner and at any other time before?

I already know it is possible to extend life with the Death Note, from experience. Do humans suffer the same fate that shinigami do if they do it?

What are the physical limits of controlling people before death with the Death Note? Will they teleport across the world if you write it?

What are the ancillary limits? If you kill someone who theoretically was in DC, and you wrote 'dies with the original copy of the Declaration of Independence in his hands', would the note arrange for that to happen?

How does the Death Note kill people? Is it possible to reverse it?

As the above, is it physical death, instant brain death, or some kind of dualism soul rip?

Actually, while we are at it. Souls? Afterlife? Get as much as possible. I just found out most of my axioms about reality aren't. I need more information.

Does the Death Note have to target people? I know shinigami are immune, but what about animals? Concepts? Physical objects?

Can the Death Note create information? What limits? If I try to get a physicist to solve an equation, an then get a high school dropout to do the same, will either or both get an answer? What if it is an unanswered major problem (GUT?)

Basically thinking in this vein. The incidental powers of the note are much, much more interesting to an extropian than the death effect.

PS : if you happen to be looking for a beta reader or just someone to bounce ideas off of, feel free to pm me. I've done editing before, and I enjoy this story.

And knowing that loosing possesion of the death note will remove it from my memories, what happens to my memories if I destroy the death note?

** Well, I would try and coax the Shinigami into telling me about stuff other than death gods and death notes that exist but which humans don't seem to know about. Basically, I would want to make absolutely sure there is no way I could extend my life or get additional powers before I started using the death note. Because if one very supernatural thing exists, there may be more.

More specifically about the death note, I would definitely make sure I found out all I could about the following: Do scraps of paper removed still work? Can I write on the same page several times, writing over text I have already written to kill someone else? Because if so, I could have a relatively small scrap of paper, filled with so much ink that no one would be able to easily read the text on it, and then just reuse it at will. Smaller = better.

Will the death note ever run out? (Seemingly no) - excellent. If I rip out page after page after page, can I generate an arbitrarily high number of pages, each of which still works? Because if so, I can write someone's name in the book, and instruct them to write down the names of [category of people to murder] and send them a few pages, which they are instructed to destroy after use. Makes it that much harder to identify me.

I suppose I would also ask if it were possible for me, while alive, to get into the Shinigami realm (and then return to the human realm), because I'm sure that would make it easier to gather information. Downside: The king might not like it, and he might have a book that can kill me even though I have a note book.

Can I kill animals? If I can /see/ them, can I kill stuff like single celled organisms and cancers?

Can I use my foreknowledge of what will happen in the future to reverse entropy, Maxwell's demon style? Because I'm /pretty/ sure that magic knowledge of the future would allow one to reverse entropy.

If I write a time of death which exceeds the time at which they otherwise would have died, does it prolong the person's life? Does the rule against extending people's lives apply to me? (I guess not, since Light probably extended a few lives by killing murderers)

Can I write things like "so and so lives as he would and dies at the normal time, except now he can't commit murders due to spontaneous compulsions to turn around and go home"?

The Shinigami Eyes can see how long you're "supposed" to live naturally, and Shinigami must structure deaths so as not to /lengthen/ anyone's time (That seems /really/ hard, one might easily do it by accident without lots of foreknowledge. Shinigami live precarious lives). Anyway, presumably, the "supposed to live" time does not factor in Death Notes used by Shinigami. Does the calculation of how long people are /supposed/ to live factor in death notes used by Humans on Earth?

While the cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, it is sometimes horizontal if it makes the name fit better, with a vertical line on the left. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language][Ancient Egyptian]] word for it was /shenu/, and it was essentially an expanded [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_ring][shen ring]]. In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)][Demotic]], the cartouche was reduced to a pair of brackets and a vertical line.

*** How would that work? Does it create new people? Does it resurrect dead people? If so? Does it reanimate (what's left of) their corpse or create them as they were right before dying? Both would suck. Imagine writing someone's name in the Life Note who died while on fire. If it brought them back to where there were right before dying, they'd be ruined, pain-wracked bodies.

** I always wondered about loopholes to escape the Death Note. What if you could use someone's birth name if they had a legal name change. Do you use the new name? What if they're finalizing their name change while you're writing their name down?

What if you write someone's name and the default heart attack can't kill them because they're currently on bypass? Related, what if you're technically dead during an intense brain surgery while your name is written down?

How do you use the death note to kill someone who's native language is one that doesn't use letters, like the click/pop language of some isolated tribes?

What if someone literally was never given a name, possibly for intentionally avoiding being killed by the Note? Like, an orphanage similar to the one Near and Mello were raised in, but none of the children ever had birth certificates and were never called a name ("you, in the red shirt...").

Is the death necessarily permanent? What if you're set up for ideal crionic preservation at the time of death?

Lastly, since the notebook never runs out of pages, I always liked to imagine sitting by a fire place, throwing one page in after another for hours. Could this be harnessed to create lots of (very dirty) energy?
