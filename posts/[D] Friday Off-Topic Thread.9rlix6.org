Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** A thought I often get back to when I'm looking into dating (whether on dating sites on in bars) is that, as a young man who's working in computer engineering, training in parkour, interested in video games, tabletop roleplaying, superhero and fantasy literature, and with a social circle that's more of the same, I'm in a situation where basically every single social circle I know is 90% guys and 10% girls who are already dating.

It feels like I should be looking for opportunities the other way around; try to get into social circles and hobbies that are either gender-neutral or heavily female-dominated, but I don't know where to look; I'm thinking maybe handball or theater right now. Do you guys have any idea what kind of activities I should look into?

*** Ballroom dancing tends to have more women than men; I did it with my wife for a while, and they were almost always short on male dance partners.

Aside from that, arts and crafts are usually female dominated. Pottery, sewing, painting, knitting, et cetera might be a good bet.

That said, I'm currently a stay-at-home dad, and childcare is one of the most female-dominated areas left. My experience with that has been that being the only guy is sometimes a bit awkward and/or excluding. I imagine this being different from the way that it's awkward/excluding for women to be in a male-dominated space, but I don't know for sure. Just something to watch out for.

*** Most styles of dance are heavily female-dominated (the only exception which comes to my mind right now is breakdance). Especially contemporary dance would go really well with your training in parkour I'd say, see e.g. this trailer for a workshop: [[https://youtu.be/NtjEjn9CtfA]]

Yoga is mostly girls as well and a good complement to other sports.

*** Roller Derby's a good one, women play and men can be referees and non-skating officials, and it's got a good community spirit. If you are happy to learn to roller skate, of course! (Referees can rollerblade, if you prefer).

There are also a few men's teams but if you want to hang around women more then you probably want to stick with reffing in a women's league.

*** Finished it over the weekend, along with Greg Egan's "Phoresis", since both just came out recently. Very much enjoyed both; Phoresis is overtly rational (and not abstract as Egan can be), FWIW. I'm certainly tempted to say Collapsing Empire is rational-adjacent; the MCs (and antagonists, for that matter) are smart and often solve problems through creative application of available resources, though there is also a certain level of deus ex machina.

** I'm reading this interesting highly recommended non fiction: Unscripted, by Mj DeMarco.

It's very interesting, any opinions ? Anybody ever read anything by him ?

​

Any youtube or game recommendations ?

** Did anyone think about making the weekly top-level posts only every other week? Or was there a discussion somewhere?

I think that could put more content into one top-level post.

And that would make it worthwhile to open it.

And if more open it, there will be more replies and also more content/questions/scenarios.

And if one really wants to post something in an off-week, they can still use the old post.

Which should encourage people to read again the old post so they can see the replies and comment themselves.

Off course I could be wrong, in which case it could just returned to weekly.

Also, munchkinery probably can stay weekly.

It is just that I have the experience that too often can sometimes kill participation.

Also I hope formatting works... I don't know if the app still uses markup or not or both or something different.

*** One of the primary purposes of the weekly threads is to consolidate low-value discussion, a purpose which I think is much better served by having them be weekly rather than biweekly. Looking at raw number of comments for the last five weeks:

| Thread                  | Current | Last Week | 2 Weeks | 3 Weeks | 4 Weeks |
|-------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------|
| Monday Rationality      | 6       | 15        | 3       | 2       | 23      |
| Wednesday Worldbuilding | 6       | 21        | 27      | 34      | 27      |
| Friday Off-Topic        | 7       | 31        | 51      | 41      | 37      |
| Saturday Munchkinry     | 74      | 32        | 60      | 14      | 16      |

Based on that, the only one that I think could be justified as going biweekly would be the Monday Rationality thread, but we're not going to do that, because 1) it's a useful tool to help people 2) it's a useful dumping ground for things that aren't appropriate as top level posts 3) there's less question of when/where it will be.

I also disagree with the premise that putting the threads to biweekly would help discussion, but that's a separate issue.

*** The way reddit is structured definitely kills off threads too quickly and if less frequent threads can help that then I'm all for it. I'm not quite convinced it will though, since half as many threads means those threads need to last twice as long just to match our previous participation.

possible solution: make threads monthly and sticky them?

I don't see why that's desirable, posts last as long as the interest in them and in the comments last.

​

Trying to artificially prolong it by decreasing their frequency just overhaul reduces the activity in the sub.

Slow weeks are expected, so are very active weeks.

​

By making posts less frequent they also become less current, we won't be able to discuss recent happenings as easily..

​

Yes technically we get 1 post per month that's more active than the average weekly post, but on average that monthly post will be less active than the combination of every weekly post..

​

We have a better than average understanding of statistics here, so why make changes based of assumptions we know are flawed?

***** Sorry, my comment wasn't very well written. I am against sparser threads unless there is evidence that it is better. My issue with short post life is that if I can't come on reddit for a few days or I think of something later then I miss out on discussions / can't expect anyone to return to talk with me. If it's Monday and I want to talk off-topic, it's better for me to wait for friday again than to go back to the previous friday thread.

If people are in the habit of checking back on previous threads, then we can sort by new to get the recent comments that people make, and feel confident that any comments we make will be seen. Positive feedback spiral: more comments -> more visibility -> more comments?

*** I love having them all weekly. If they don't get responses then they don't get responses. This sub has few enough posts that it can handle it.

If clutter's a concern the mods can always remove a weekly thread after ~3 days if nobody posts on it.

** For the first time in a long while, I have access to a library, meaning I have /real/ books available. I've been meaning to read both Prachett and Sanderson for a while, but looking at the catalogue's a little confusing. Any ideas where to start with Pratchett? Is Sanderson like Pratchett, with two or three books in a series and multiple series in the same universe, or am I misremembering?

*** Pratchett's Discworld series is in chronological order from first-written to last-written, but it consists of sub-series that follow a particular character, area or institution, but some sub-series are longer than two or three books (the Watch subseries has five or six, off the top of my head). The first few books follow Rincewind, and while they're good, they're not the very best. The Ankh-Morpork Watch is pretty widely considered to be one of, if not the, best introductory sub-series, as far as I'm aware. I started with it, and really enjoyed it - I also didn't feel like I was missing any background information.

So my personal recommendation would be to start with Guards, Guards! and then Men At Arms. After that you can either keep reading more about the Watch, or switch to a different subseries, or start reading all the books in chronological order.

Another good starting point, although it's more YA, is The Wee Free Men. It's shorter and has less setting, but is also the starting point of a subseries.
