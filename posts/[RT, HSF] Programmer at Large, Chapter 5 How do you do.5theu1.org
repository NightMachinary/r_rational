**** In the game Space Station 13 that's pretty much what happens almost every round: people with welders tearing down walls looking for the AI core because it may be rogue

***** Don't forget the endless constant spam of

  AI STATE LAWS

and

#+begin_quote
  AI IS ROUGE GUYS
#+end_quote

that's going on in the background of most rounds.

*** Thanks!

I've been [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/03/looking-into-starting-a-phd/][a little distracted]] this past week or two, so tomorrow's chapter is currently completely unwritten. I know what will happen, so I'll probably write it this afternoon, but it may be a little on the short side...

Update: It's actually ended up a little on the long side because I couldn't wrap up the beginning of the chapter as quickly as I'd intended. Chapter will be up in the morning as per usual.

**** Thanks for keeping me in the loop with the update. That's really going above and beyond. I'll look forward to it.
