Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** My DM has recently given us The Hole. It is a very flat oval 25cm x 35cm, it weights around 1kg and has one side completely flat. On the other side, there's a pitch black entrance into a different infinite universe. In this universe, neither light nor sound can travel, but everything else works normally. Gravity points inwards, but is of normal strength. It's full of normal, breathable air, but it doesn't generate it. The universe is infinite and empty. Inside this universe, you cannot go behind the hole, you always end up exiting through the hole somehow. The Hole is indestructible. The edges cannot be used to cut things.

We're planning tying a rope somewhere, putting it into The Hole, and then hide some people inside. What other fun stuff can it be used for?

*** You could assemble and hang ready to fire ballista in the hole to be used for combat. Drop the hole into a lake to drain it. Maybe use it as armor piece or a small buckler since it is indestructible and attacks that go in the hole wont do any damage. Since light cannot travel in it thermal radiation can't happen so you can store objects in there to help insulate them.

Edit: Just came up with something.

Lower a rope on a heavy weight inside the hole. Tie the rope to the ground and turn the hole upside down. The upwards force of gravity inside the hole will keep the rope in tension letting you climb the rope. I made a [[https://imgur.com/a/yZ09Wck][drawing]] to show what I mean.

**** Hooooly shit, your edit is absolutely incredible. I WILL do that. It's genious.

Regarding the insulation thingy, it most likely won't work, since the hole is filled with air. I think it's for the better, I don't want to overheat in there!

All the other potential uses are amazing too! We considered draining a lake, but it'd work only when it has no way of refilling. 25x35cm is quite small, after all.

Although definitely useful in defence, especially as an anti-wizard thingy. Imagine catching a fireball with it!

There are a bunch of universal fire type problems with light and sound not being able to travel, but if you ignore those, something like 60% of the heat we lose to our environment is lost by radiation. You'd get pretty hot in there.

*** With enough rope, you can use it to generate "infinite" power. Just tie the heaviest weight that will fit through the hole to one end of a rope, run the rope through a pulley system attached to some gears, and drop the weight down the hole. As the weight falls, the rope turns the pulleys and gears, and bam, infinite mechanical power, though only as long as the rope lasts. Add in a locking/braking system for the rope and you have power on demand.

It would take a pretty specific set of circumstances for infinite mechanical power to be useful in a dnd campaign, but one use might be in siege warfare, for winching up trebuchets or catapults extremely quickly and easily.

Also, if really heavy, strong rope is obtained, then you could use an even bigger weight (just make a long, cylindrical object that barely fits into the hole). The bigger the weight is, the more torque can be produced, which can be translated via gears into whatever speed is needed. This is helpful because it means that you only have to drop the weight a little bit each time you want power which means you overall need less rope to make things work.

If the weight falls slowly enough, due to the output gear being hooked up to a sufficiently large load, then the spider might be able to produce rope at a rate sufficient to keep the system working. That would be more useful for making a fixed power plant though, which is probably less relevant for adventurers.

*** Use the perfectly flat side to manufacture other perfectly flat surfaces, helping to kickstart a revolution in precision manufacturing. See if you can start a cult via the perfectly level surface [[https://youtu.be/w-wbWGwZ7_k?t=20]]

How sturdy is the level surface? You could do float glass process on it if it can stand the heat. Though if your characters try to go that route, they can just invent lead float glas, its seem medieval accessible technology.

How thick is it by the way? Depending on friction coefficient and sturdiness of the flat side you can do tons of stuff with it. Improvised sled or ice skates, you can use it as a non-stick pan.

The perfectly level side will strongly bond to other perfectly level surfaces, so you'll have to be careful or risk having the hole stuck. This sticking effect can also be used to rather ardously climb the the sides of a glass castle maybe or artificial iceberg.

If your world has a race of blind, deaf, flying, magically sustained sentient beings you can sell them infinite living space.

Stand at water shore, put hole over head and with just light pulling strain on your head you have a relatively safe way to cross flat water. Maybe needs a contraption to keep water from falling up your nose. If you go too deep the pressure differential will make this a rather spectular failure mode.

Depending on the magics of "doesn't generate air" - has the empty universe just infinite amounts of 1 bar air? Does the pressure differential cause air to cross? You can use this device to create a stream of breathable air at spectacular high altitude. If no air crosses, you can revisit the diving apparatus idea.

Social stuff: blackmail gods or mundane rulers for you to destroy the hole, or you will throw it into the ocean and doom the world. (Don't actually blackmail gods). Offer the hole as endpoint of the capitals sewage system, keeping streets and rivers clean. Generally garbage dump for dangerous materials, like sealed demons and Djinni.

Use mirrors and/or arm to find out whats on the other side of the hole in the empty dimension. If its a perfectly flat surface of normal material too, you can use that as anchor point for stuff in the universe. Like, tie safety net to the tablet or you can noch use the tablet as foundation for a building - you can use compression strength material aka bricks instead of tension strength material aka ropes as building material for a very small tower.

However, I do agree that there will be a force pushing the Diver into the Hole; and that force is his own buoyancy (as compared to the weight of the water pushing down on the top of the hole). Fortunately, it's easily dealt with; he simply needs to hook the Hole over his shoulders (assuming that they are sufficiently broad). If the pressure is significant enough for the Hole to push into his shoulders hard enough to damage them, then he's deep enough that the pressure is dangerous even /without/ the Hole; and if the pressure is /not/ significant enough for the Hole to damage his shoulders, then his shoulders will be able to hold it up.

At this point, it's indistinguishable from the final arrangement. There's a lot of pressure on your body, pushing you up into the hole; though little of the pressure on the water around your neck is transferred to you (at least not in a pushing-into-the-hole direction - most of that pressure is coming from beneath you). But the pressure isn't beyond what human musculature can survive (if it was, it would already be crushing your feet) so as long as your shoulders are broad enough that they don't fit into the Hole, you should survive...

Consider a filled water balloon. It doesn't take much crushing force to break this balloon; you could do it in one hand trivially easily. Now put this water balloon in some water. Presumably you can see that the balloon would not burst. Increase the pressure of the water. At what pressure does the water balloon break?

The answer is that it doesn't. You could put tens of tons of force on this balloon and it would be perfectly fine, because the water inside the balloon is incompressible and raises in pressure with the surrounding water. So if you take the force over any piece of the balloon shell, it is balanced out between the force from the water outside the balloon and the water inside. There is no net force anywhere where there isn't a change in pressure, at least at these macroscales.

A similar thing happens for humans. Our lungs are fine being crushed as the air inside them shrinks, and most of the rest of the material in the body doesn't particularly change with pressure. Since the net force around any piece of bone is zero your bones aren't going to be breaking. An example exception would be if your bones contained air pockets, like a bird. Presumably birds shouldn't go scuba diving further than they've evolved to withstand.

*************** Indeed, but the forces transferred are immense.

If we integrate the forces around the human, and assume the water around the sides is prevented from flowing (eg. there's some strong object between them, like a steel cone), the imbalance on the human is the size of the cross section of the neck where it crosses the barrier. Let's assume that to be aboud 10cm by 10cm, the force at 100m depth is about 10kN, or the same force as from one ton of weight.

If you remove the object preventing water flow (or it collapses), things become even more dire. The water pressure on the upper half of the body reduces, as the water is rapidly flowing into the hole. However, the water pressure on the bottom half has not yet reduced by much. Therefore integrating shows a larger imbalance, closer to the whole area of the shadow of the hole onto the shoulders of the human, probably around 25cm by 10cm.

This much power would easily break one's shoulders to push you through the hole.

*** At what pressure and temperature is this air? This matters a lot in how it acts, since large pressure differentials cause large flows. If it normalizes to the surrounding pressure and temperature, dangerous exploits happen.

What happens if you try to hook something over the inside edge of the hole? How does it end up coming out whole?

The most powerful exploit I can think of it to use this to generate arbitrarily large, continuous thrust. Put a heavy weight on a strong rope, attach the other end of the rope to a large X-shaped metal bar larger than the hole, and drop the weight into the hole. The weight will pull on the X-shaped bar, and all the force will result in motion of the hole. This should be easy to steer, and can produce as much force as the hole, bar, or rope can withstand before breaking. Just don't go into space with this, that could be bad.

I'm not sure how to slow it down without cutting the rope, though, so it's possible that a careful counterbalance is needed to make this practical and not-world-ending once you go beyond small thrusts.

There are lots of lesser obvious uses (eg. trash disposal, transportation of large objects, getting through small gaps, air supply, mere weightlessness), but I'm trying to focus on the broken stuff.

**** The pressure differential is actually a huge deal unless it's magiced away somehow. If the Hole's air is at sea level for example travelling to above sea level will cause air to start blowing out and travelling lower will suck air in. Since it's infinite inside with enough time it will make the air pressure at whatever altitude it's at approach the Hole's pressure(this would take a very long time for Earth). My physics knowledge certainly isn't good enough but here's some math:

Sea level (0m) = 1.03 kg/cm^{3} 1000m = 0.997 kg/cm^{3}

So the hole at 1000m would be blowing air out at a pressure of 0.033 kg/cm^{3.} Which I can't simply multiply by the hole's cm^{2} area or convert into a wind speed. These pressure differences would be greater on higher gravity worlds or with denser atmospheres also.

It serves as a combination air supply (full of an infinite amount of air) propulsion system (the air rushing out into the vacuum serves as propellant) and power supply (the turbine generates electricity as the air exits), so all you need is food and water, which can easily be produced onboard using hydroponics.

Disarm: if someone draws a weapon on him, he can reach his hand out and the weapon will leave their hand and launch towards his. This is unreliable, depending on his emotional state this could result his being hit by said weapon at high speeds. If he's being attacked with bare hands the power will attempt to rip the arms off and if he's sufficiently agitated it will succeed.

There is a shadowy, unethical, competent agency seeking out people who have weird powers. These kids range from 1-14 years old, MC is 13 when he first has to go on the run.

His goals are to have a secure home in which he can relax, then to find kids with powers before the agency does, then make enough money to basically give them anything they want with the constraint of keeping them safe.

He lives in London in 1993.

I'm thinking he starts off camping/squatting and stealing food by taking groceries into the bathroom and teleporting out, then becomes a bike courier with someone he notices uses illegal immigrants as a signal they might hire a minor? Using teleporting to cheat by going from deserted alley to deserted alley he's scouted before?

** */Ender's Game/HPMOR battle strategy & tactics/*

You are one magician on a team of six. There are two other teams and your objective is to "kill" everyone not on your team. You are allowed to fly, but no more than twenty feet off the ground. Aside from that, there are no rules. Two teams can gang up on a third, for example.

Once you "die", you're blinded, and deafened. You can neither move nor speak until the battle is over. There is no way to "resurrect" a fallen teammate. You are considered dead once an enemy spell has broken through your ward, or once an enemy projectile has come within a foot of you. Other cases (like stabbing someone) are dealt with on a case by case basis, but in general the emphasis is on realism. Note that nobody actually gets hurt, so combatants are encouraged not to pull their punches.

Battles are held outdoors in mountainous forest, or indoors. The exact details of the battlefield change with each battle, and you aren't always told in advance what they'll be. Sometimes you're told where the enemy team is or given a map, sometimes not. You may start in a fortified area, or in an empty clearing.

You are required to wear suit of armor (helmet included). The armor isn't medieval-style armor, but more like police armor, lightweight and flexible, able to protect from scrapes/cuts/etc, but it won't do much against knives or bullets.

You are always given a pair of compasses. After one hour has passed, the compasses will point to the nearest enemy combatants from each other team. The compasses are infallible and cannot be fooled.

You have no other starting equipment, but you are allowed to use anything in your environment.

​

What clever tactics would you use to win? I'm looking less for specific magical exploits and more general strategy. For example, HPMOR Hermione tricking everyone by pretending to be fair. You can define the battlefield details, if you think of something clever that requires a specific setup.

Magic wise, the two most important things are wards and shields. You can ward yourself, preventing any magic from affecting anything within several inches of your skin, and you can shield yourself, deflecting all incoming projectiles in all three dimensions.

Wards break after absorbing ten times their mana in incoming magic. This means that ten mages working together can brute-force kill a single mage, and there's nothing that the lone wolf can do about it. This is similar to HPMOR's /Finite Incantatem/ brute force counterspell, but skewed much more heavily in favor of the defender.

​

Other than that, you can do the following:

- Manipulate matter by conjuring small, simple items or disintegrating them. Complexity is determined by the size of the molecules involved. You can only conjure/disintegrate one type of molecule at a time, and you need a source for conjuration. So, for example, you could conjure water easily (hydrogen + oxygen), but not plutonium.
- Manipulate heat by transferring it from one place to another. You can start small fires, boil a pot of water, or freeze it. You aren't powerful enough to incinerate a person.
- Manipulate force by pushing objects around. You can deflect bullets, pin someone down, crush a skull, etc. You aren't strong enough to stop a car. You are strong enough to fly.
- Perceive other spells.
- Counter ongoing, active spells, removing the spell from existence and cause a brief flash of pain for its owner.
- Prepare triggered spells, binding together any number of conditions and a single spell. The spell to be triggered must be the same no matter what conditions occur, you can't stick a "variable" into the triggered spell. Additional conditions are harder; you can hold up to eight conditions across any number of triggers. Attempting to add more causes you to black out. You can bind a counterspell as a trigger, but each counterspell must be precisely customized to the spell it's countering so you would have to know in advance what the spell to be countered is, how much mana it's using, etc. /Wards and each dimension of a shield require two conditions. This means that full defenses use up all your conditions./
- Losing consciousness immediately removes all your active and triggered spells from existence. Losing skin with your cache (a piece of metal that contains all your mana) immediately removes all your active and triggered spells from existence.
- You have (for the purposes of the battle) a metal rod containing effectively unlimited mana. However, you can only use a small amount of mana every second. Don't worry about the math, the rough ballparks I've outlined above are close enough.

  or once an enemy projectile has come within a foot of you.

Ooooh, /here's/ a potential exploit.

First thing, summon up a whole lot of raindrops, twenty-five feet above the battlefield (i.e. above maximum Flier height). Allies don't need to defend, because they're just raindrops; several enemies are taken out immediately, because they're 'enemy projectiles' and it's not going to be easy to prevent that many raindrops from landing within one foot of yourself. (Try to do this before the enemy has their shields up).

--------------

This will only work in the first battle. Either the rules will be patched (raindrops don't count as missiles, no, nor do hailstones, nor grains of sand) or people will start throwing up shields and/or diving for shelter first thing.

So, next trick. Lithium is a good electrical conductor, while diamond is a decent insulator made of only one type of atom (carbon); both are lighter than oxygen and thus should be conjurable (though you might need to bring in a bit of Lithium with you, I have no idea where to find it naturally). It should be possible to create a network of underground wiring such that you can zap an opponent with electricity the instant he steps on the wrong place. That should pass both shields and wards.

As should anything else that gets inside the shield and then explodes. How does it get inside the shield? It looks harmless and innocent until the enemy moves close enough (the shields /can't/ be pushing the ground away, you pretty much have to let things in by walking towards them).

The enemy can get around this by perma-flying, but perma-flying turns them into targets. (Alternatively, conjure something heavy on /top/ of their shields and let gravity slowly work through their mana supplies).

--------------

A ward prevents all other magic some range from the user's skin, breaking when ten times the magic put into it is used. What happens when two freshly-Warded people shake hands (thus pulling their skin in contact with each other)? Do the wards both break, do they cancel out, do they ignore each other? If one of them has a Stoneskin spell (or other self-buff), does the other one's ward cancel it? All of it, or just around his hand?

**** I /love/ the raindrop idea. It's not even really an exploit -- if you can do it with raindrops, you can do it with acid or some other nasty substance.

Shields activate on fast moving objects, so the booby trap idea would work just fine. The wiring idea is also clever, though it would be a little too lethal since magic can't stop electrocution. Maybe I'll be able to use it elsewhere in the story.

I simplified a lot of the mechanics. Sorry. I didn't want to overwhelm people with an enormous essay.

Nothing would actually happen in the handshake example.

There aren't "self buffs" but yes, if you're warded and you walk into a spell it'll stop the spell from working for a few inches around you. The spell will still be active and drawing mana but it won't be doing anything until it breaks through the ward. If the warded person moves away, the spell will resume heating or whatever it was doing before.

So, to use your stoneskin example, only the hand would be un-stoned, and as soon as they stopped shaking it would be re-stoned.

Total spells don't matter, what's important is how much mana goes into them. More mana = more powerful spell. You can only use so much mana per second, and that mana is shared between all your active spells. Each active spell does have an additional soft concentration cost; the most you could reasonably maintain is a dozen or so. But each of those dozen spells would be 1/12th as powerful as if you only cast one spell. And they don't drain mana any faster than the one powerful spell.

You've got enough mana for a couple hours of continuous casting at your maximum rate. Once you're out, you can replenish through meditation (requires peace, quiet, and time). Or you could take a fallen enemy's cache and use that.

--------------

The attacks were coming at quite a pace, bombarding the fortress more often than not, but at Felicity's speed, even that left her time. She caught the paper plane while it was still unfolding into existence, and tore to work.

Her fortress didn't have mirrors per se, but it had sheets of shiny metal, which seemed good enough. She wanted to make a retroreflector, but didn't seem to have the tools. An approximate retroreflector would just be reliably terrible, so she took a single, thin sheet of metal (anything larger was too heavy to carry quickly), hoping it would offer protection and retaliation.

She then took canisters of poisons, a net, and a case of bullets off various traps, and lugged them close to the entrance. No more than fifteen seconds had passed since the round began.

One hand held the metal plate above her head, another held a fistful of bullets, and around to her waist a canister of gaseous poison was tied. She abandoned the net, which seemed too difficult to throw well, not built for human-powered artillery.

She was going to run outside, find her opponent, throw the bullets like buckshot, and shield her way back to the base. The she would repeat. Felicity took a calming breath, though she wasn't sure how much good it would do for her slowed circulation, nor, now she considered the issue, was she sure why her breath didn't cause tornadoes. But it helped.

The moment there was a pause between attacks, Felicity slammed open the door, which flew from its hinges, and ran. She scanned the surroundings, still running, and then the sky. Six or seven seconds later she found a small mark in the sky, hard to distinguish, but perhaps her target. She threw the bullets like buckshot, which probably went wide, and brought the metal plate between her and the target in the sky.

Then her surroundings went white, and she couldn't see. Her skin started to burn, and just as she grimaced from the pain, she disassociated, and the pain became abstract.

She ran in a direction she hoped was the entrance, but hit a wall, the world still white, and stumbled.

*Felicity Knight defeated!*

--------------

Sorry, you had terrible luck here. You bet your opponent didn't have an aiming wish, which was reasonable, but after her last fight that is indeed what she had figured she needed. A retroreflector would have been neat, if I could figure out how to build one, but probably wouldn't have worked since your opponent was bulkier than you and the retroreflector would have had to have been very precisely made to hit such a distanced opponent.

Feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.

The first we have is Felicity. You know this one.

Your first opponent wished to be able to throw things really well. This was a bit of a silly idea during brainstorming, and I'd assumed they would be eliminated before you encountered them. But after you got paired I thought about how effective this would be and actually ended up pretty happy with the idea---brute force at range is generally a good strategy, and most wishes would lose to it at this stage. It even comes with implied good aim.

The next two opponents wished for speed and to be... a great warrior. I was actually pretty unsure how this should play out. The issue is that speed isn't that effective at this level (~100x less wish power than yours), so it didn't give the qualitative improvements that larger speed boosts give, but still allowed for good evasion. I don't remember how this was settled, but eventually they would be forced to duke it out, and since the ‘Gr8 Warrior' was the only one who could realistically hurt the other, they would have to win.

Then, unfortunately for you, this ‘Gr8 Warrior' got concerned enough about that fight to specifically tune herself against it: fast reflexes, fast limb movement, and lots of bulk. This is why I assumed you would lose if you had wished for speed and reflexes in that round. Making things tanky and locally fast seemed like it required less magic than actual superspeed movement, so although you could have run much better than her, you would not have had many angles of attack.

A side point that you never observed is that Arlene's warrior skills were mostly magical supplements, not fully integrated, which is why she was still standing while overdosed on hallucinogens. You wouldn't have been able even to knock her over, even though she was mentally out of it completely.

The next two had materialization (create physical objects out of thin air) and immateriality. Immateriality would have been really strong later on, but at this point I couldn't justify making it particularly effective, so although materialization was also pretty nerfed, all it took was materializing a gun and shooting the other a few times.

After that success, I had this concept of a creative, artsy individual with this contestant, so shapeshifting seemed like an appropriate follow up. The “+Enhance” refers to wanting the shapeshifting to extend to physical attributes (strength, speed) beyond physical plausibility or mass conversion.

The next two wished for flight (the magic, superhero kind) and “effect reversal” ([[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Izanagi][Izanagi]] style). Flight seemed like fair play, and quite a nice choice. “Effect reversal” meant undoing any damage they received, to which I was like, yeah, I guess that's fine, but at this level I'm not going to let you play this game forever. Since they were unable to hit their flying opponent, I assumed they would have to lose eventually.

Not very impressed with her opponent, they flying contestant then just wished for better flight (that's what the “speed” means here) and laser beams. My conception here was just /Captain Marvel/. Most of the wish went into the lasers, only a little into flight improvements.

When the artsy shapeshifter fought Captain Marvel, I was really rooting for the shapeshifter. That kind of flexibility is awesome, and would have been really fun after another wish or two. But what ended up happening is despite a small stockpile of weapons and armour, and being able to turn into a gun-toting bird, it really didn't stack up to magical flight and lasers. After a LOT of missing their marks, and a handful of times the shapeshifter patched up wounds, Captain Marvel took the fight and decided she really needed a steady aim and less fear of stray bullets. Hence the next wish giving her sharpshooting and tankiness.

I'll note here a couple of important bits of information. First, most players were only making wishes that focused on one key idea, and this was on purpose. Felicity was the only one to make split wishes from the start. However, after the flying contestant wished for ‘Speed+Lasers' in a combined ‘Captain Marvel' package, it felt reasonable that she should have pushed a bit further here, which is why her sharpshooting and durability wish was a dual one. Second, she was out of frame when she entered the arena because she was flying high in the sky, not because of invisibility of teleportation or a specific displacement wish.

This is taking a while so I'll stop here and write up the other 8 later if people care.
