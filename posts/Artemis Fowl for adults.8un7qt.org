What I like most about these books is how Artemis managed to outmaneuver a whole society of supernatural beings, so basically I want to read about a genius protagonist that contact the supernatural for the first time and approach everything with science and rational thinking to survive or for personal gain.

- I have already read HPMOR.


** I think the Artemis Fowl series would be an /excellent/ target for a rationalist fanfictionalization for many of the same reasons you mention. It would be especially neat if the reverse-engineering supernatural technology plotline got explored in more detail.

** You might like Two Year Emperor, it's not /quite/ the same, but it has some similar themes going on. (portal fantasy where he munchkins the rules to great effect)

** You've read HPMOR, have you read Worm/Ward? They are very good, and typically enjoyed by the same type of person.

** If you replace the whole science thing with 'ridiculous scheming', Part 2 of JoJo's bizarre adventure fits.

** Artemis Fowl is YA, which doesn't actually have all that much to differentiate from "adult" fiction other than a lack of sex and cussing (extreme violence is fine tho) and a very slightly lower reading level.

So I guess the answer to your question is Artemis Fowl.

*** While not /in/correct, I think if somebody asks for "something like X", telling them X isn't...helpful.

I lol'd, though.
