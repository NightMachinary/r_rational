Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Here's a "superpowered" character to munchkin.

Name: Barbara Roberts

The character is a slender, young woman of average height with long blond hair. Whenever she dresses up as a member of any "profession" and surrounds herself with suitable props, she can perform the duties of that profession at the median skill level of the people who get paid to do it. This only works if people can recognize the profession she is trying to dress as just by looking at her - wearing a generic pantsuit is not enough to pass as a lawyer, for example, unless the rest of the context of the situation would let people immediately identify her as such without anyone speaking.

Some subtleties / Required Secondary Powers (or lack thereof):

Anyone who checks her credentials will find that she is qualified and licensed to do whatever she's dressed as, but she will not magically have an employer or any required insurance. (For example, if she dresses as a surgeon, she'll have the skills and credentials of one and magically be licenced to practice medicine, but she can't just walk into a hospital and start operating without having been hired and getting appropriate malpractice insurance.)

Being granted skills will NOT affect her physical strength and stamina. Being a slender young woman will limit her ability to perform duties that require physical strength; having the skills of the median professional boxer probably won't let her fight outside of her weight class, for example.

Does what she gets depend on the people who look at her? If, say, a mathematician looks at her writing on a blackboard while she's dressed as a mathematician, he could think from her writings that she specializes in algebra. Would she then get algebra knowledge?

Similarly, with a nice outfit she could pass as a "consultant" fairly easily, and thus be a medium expert in whatever her current context is.

Really, any outfit that makes people think you're omni-capable (lab coat, suit, astronaut outfit, uniform, any of the above plus hardhat and clipboard, etc...) would likely result in being non-specifically capable.

I understand the idea of kinetic bombardment but would that actually be possible or would the teleported have to "rev" it up? Mostly I'm just wondering if the teleported has to drop the tungsten rod from up high (and if so how high?) or do they have to speed it up.

*** Well, the higher you get from earth the less gravity. But at shorter distances say 200km, you can approximate it by acceleration at 1 gee or 10 m/s^{2.} So an object falling 200km will fall for 200 seconds, and be going at 2000 m/s if we ignore the atmosphere. The amount of energy contained there is about 2 MJ/kg, which is under a tenth of what gasoline contains when you burn it. If you change that to 2 km, it's only 20,000 J/kg, 1/100th of that. So a 1 mile drop won't be very efficient compared to 100+ mile. But if you can do it with extremely massive objects, it can still be quite dangerous.

Note that bombardment from orbit is much more energy per unit mass. 8 km/s is 32 MJ/kg, nearly the same as gasoline (45 MJ/kg).

I got the numbers by plugging in to these [[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/kinetic-energy][kinetic energy]] and [[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/free-fall][free fall]] calculators. The number for gasoline is from [[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ArthurGolnik.shtml][here]].

Note that if you burn a hydrocarbon like gasoline, it consumes more than twice its mass in oxygen to form CO2 and H2O. Depending on the hydrogen to carbon ratio this will be between 1:8 (pure hydrogen) and 3:8 (pure carbon). So if you want a wizarding rocket, you might want to adapt a bubblehead charm to get out of needing those heavy oxidizer tanks.

*** Sounds like it is possible to do. The height would have to be from orbit. There is high (36,000km from Earth's surface) , medium (20,200km) and low orbit (which the article I'm reading doesn't specify).

Seeing as no one has launched rods from god and physics isn't my strong suit I can't tell you what the optimal height is. The best bet would be high orbit with the densest and largest thing that the teleportation method in question can move.

As for application with a limited one mile radius (With the safe guard that you won't telefrag and assuming you can take people/objects with you).

**** The range limit of apparition in Harry Potter seems to be the distance between continents, like we see movements across hundreds of miles in the books, but Rowling mentions that it gets increasingly harder across larger distances and that only few wizards could apparate across continents.

It also doesn't necessarily require visualizing, Its mentioned that either visualizing or knowledge of the location are required, so probably knowing where a place is should be enough to apparate their as long its not too far away.

this is from Rowlings website.

#+begin_quote
  Apparition becomes increasingly risky over long distances. As with most magic, much depends on the skill of the spell-caster: Apparition requires knowledge of the terrain to which one is moving, or the ability to visualise it clearly. Cross-continental Apparition would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.

*** At ‘short' distances, energy is mass × g (10 m/s²) × height. This will work fine up to, say, low-Earth orbit. It's not very impressive.

At longer distances, you care about the total size of the potential energy well of Earth, which is GM/r (gravitational constant × mass of Earth × radius of Earth), or ~60 MJ/kg, or about 1 ton of TNT per 100kg dropped. This is particularly unimpressive given the force will not be transferred as an explosion, but mostly wasted in the atmosphere (as the object disintegrates) or, if the object is strong and aerodynamic, also dispersed into the ground. The object will be travelling around 11 km/s ignoring all friction. One ton of matter would equate to just 0.1% the energy of Little Boy, the nuclear weapon that hit Hiroshima.

In the video Tom Scott talks about giving yourself downward momentum using your superpower... only he says ‘a few hundred miles per hour downwards', which is about 1% of what gravity will already give you, so doesn't itself matter to the end result.

In real life, these weapons have been envisioned as bunker busters, not for large scale destruction. They act like very large, very fast bullets, not like grenades, and that's what they're good for. But as a superhero you'll be completely incapable of aiming them, so they're even pointless at that.

This particular proposal is a peeve of mine because Marked for Death players kept proposing it. They finally seem to have let it rest, though ;).

The ‘drop things through magnets to make energy' thing is also pretty silly.

*** You know the portal gun is basically a wmd with that in mind. All you need is a vacuum chamber with a couple of portals and a retractable arm holding the rod. Once in hi vac you release the rod and retract the arm, and to unleash the weapon all you need is a drone with a portal surface and the portal gun pointed at it.

**** This is a really interesting idea but it's going to take a lot of work, and you're not going to be putting it in a truck. If the portals are even nanometres misaligned from being perfectly parallel, you have issues.

Assume the portals are 1m apart and 1m wide. After 24h, the rod will be travelling about 0.3% the speed of light, or 1,000,000 m/s. If one side of the top portal is 1 nanometre higher than the other, the angle, too, is a nanoradian off. Thus after a second, or a million passes through the portal, the rod will have turned a full milliradian. Multiply back through, and that translates to a sideways velocity of 1000m/s.

Let's say you can get this difference down consistently to a handful of picometres. Your limit would be about a 24h charge, to a velocity of 1,000,000 m/s. If your accelerated object is 50kg, the resulting energy is approximately that of Little Boy.

On top of angle misalignment, you have translation misalignment, which is approximately as bad.

Note also that when you close a portal, the location from which the rod is shot will be similarly annihilated.

Of course passive control systems have been around for a century for that purpose (controlling the position of an object) with ongoing incremental improvement but we can use active ones if we really need to to really get that rod moving back to the center whenever it starts to drift.

Why would the starting location be destroyed? That's clearly a challenge that would need to be solved to build a portal gun in the first place.

My number of 1000 m/s sideways movement per second for a 50kg rod means your control system needs to be exerting about 50kN of force on the rod, continuously. If you ever stop, the system will self-destruct within about a millisecond. If you never started, you wouldn't get up to a millionth the speed I was calculating with.

So how do you exert 50kN on a rod going .3% the speed of light? I imagine magnets would do something exotic at this speed, but if they work you'd only need, well, a top end MRI machine? Not exactly low-end tech either.

I was actually mixing things up originally, so you're better off than I thought, but note that as soon as the object hits the new portal and touches the air behind it, that air is going to do extreme physics things which will come back through the portal. If the rod lands remotely close to the opening, that impact energy is also going to rush through the portal.

******* Every material changes shape on nm scale based on some external stimuli. Heat is most well known for that but for this I'd choose something that responds to an applied electric current. A pair of optic sensors (similar to a camera) captures the direction of acceleration and the current (or heat, of we must) is applied to adjust the angle to accelerate back toward the center.\\
Modern control theory can easily keep the rod's position within the generous tolerance of the portal.

As for the air rushing in due to breaking the seal, I've watched that happen to industrial equipment. The truck might bounce a bit. Good steel can handle the impact. Since this is a normal part of the weapon's operation placing some crumple zone material underneath the chamber to absorb most of the impact ought to be part of the design.\\
The rod would deflect some, like a bullet being shot into water, but considering the typical altitude of a drone and the expected size of the targeted area it's not going to deflect enough to matter.

The maximum amount of water she can control at once is equal to her own body mass. She can set the exact velocity of every molecule of water under her control, and her brain perceives time 60 times slower to handle this. How can you munchkin this?

*** 60x faster is not enough for perfect molecular control, as there would be ~2*10^27 molecules to control. On the other hand, 60x faster thinking is extremely overpowered regardless of what powers you do or do not have. The 60x speed doesn't really complement the water control enough to seem justified.

I'm going to assume that she has the ability to relinquish control over her water at will, or she would be a normal waterbender. A possible middle ground could be that she has to drop all her water at once if she wants to drop any.

If people touch water that you are controlling, then some of it will pass through their skin by osmosis, and you can very quickly take over the water in a person. Once you have water in a critical position (eg. the brain) you can relinquish control over the rest of the water in their body and divert your focus elsewhere.

In her place of residence, she can set up open water channels in numerous places that allow her powers quick access to any part. This can be for defense or for quality of life.

Can she control water vapour? If so, then she can fill spaces with water vapour to feel the presence of objects.

A water gun is a good weapon to have.

While swimming, she can manipulate the water pressure and movement around her to push her quickly in any direction. It would also be easy to move anyone or anything else which is in the water. She can move air bubbles around in the water to get herself oxygen. She can neutralise any attacking pressure waves. She can push away water contaminants. Light-based attacks can get through, but she can wear something to protect herself.

***** [for some reason it appears my comment wasn't saved, so I'm reposting]

Maybe you could justify it with something along the lines of how our body abstracts coordination of movement to a thought of what we want to happen. Either she has had/trained it long enough to develop the intuition, or there is a secondary intelligence that can mediate thoughts into precise control.

Can you give more clarifications on the ability though? Is it unlimited range? Can she set water to any velocity she likes? Can she forcefully retain or change its state (to ice/steam)? Can she control water in other people? What about plants? Does anyone else have water control like hers? Do other people have other abilities which interact with hers? What is the technology level of society (eg. can they harness infinite energy devices)? Any non-conventional goals (such as enemies to reverse-munchkin)? I only knew that she could sense foreign movements in her water particles after you gave examples that require them.

These parameters vastly change what can and can't be done. Limitations + objectives are what motivate creativity after all, and without giving them you increase the chance of getting unrelated or generic solutions.

Actually, play also motivates creativity, but cannot test out her ability for ourselves.

I like your munchkins though. Some more ideas

- She can leave water droplets on things/in people and track their movements. Droplets in the open may evaporate though.
- Hidden switches can contain some of her water. They can only be used by her, and if there is no distance limit, she can seal it permanently. (stolen from Mistborn)

  - can extend to arbitrary distance communication

- Anything along the lines of dispersing her water into a water supply. Even a gram contains some 3x10^22 molecules.

  - This could mean that any reserve tanks she has can contain a single drop of her water instead of the whole lot, for efficient access to water /anywhere./
  - A property like 'her water sticks together when not actively separated' can alleviate how OP this is

- She can use saliva to get water at any time if necessary. This means she never needs to get water by touching it, instead just sending over spit.
- Water is polar and she might be able to do something with magnetism, but I'm not sure exactly what the properties of aligned water molecules would be.
- Recycling waste water when needed is a given

So she can control the temperature of her water, creating ice and steam? Plasma?

How much force can she exert on the water? Is there an equal and opposite force exerted on her as a result? Could she strap some water bottles onto a harness for flight? Pressurized water lasers?

Depending on how dense water vapor in the air has to be to qualify as something she can control, she could potentially create very large areas in which she can take control of any water source ... hopefully, she can't control water in other peoples' bodies or else you're looking at blood bending that doesn't even require line of sight.

When you say water, are you talking h2o molecules only? If so, you could probably purify water with the ability. Is it possible to manipulate h2o without separating the molecules from whatever impurities were mixed with it? If so you could work with potentially flammable, acidic, or poisonous additives, which might not count towards the total weight of water you control. Mix your water with sawdust, then whenever you turn it into ice you'll get pykrete which is as strong as concrete and it floats.

edit: you could probably create magnifying and telescopic lenses as well. A cursory Google search indicates there might be some metamaterials you could produce with water. Generating sound should be possible as well.

If she can sense water, she can use this to spy on people; maintain a long but very thin line of water from her to her target, and sense the movement of their own internal body water.

Does she expand the amount of water she can control by gaining more mass?

By refusing to permit the molecules on the surface to move, she can make liquid water act like a solid - either as a shield or a club is straightforward. Depending on how thin she can make the edge, she might even be able to manage a monomolecular knife edge.

Can she break conservation of energy, or does the energy she imparts into the water have to come from somewhere? How much force can she apply with water?

As a secondary challenge, reverse munchkin the Gun of Wrath, with or without the other sins. Condition: You know that the wrath wielder exists, but not who.

Modifications:

- Ring of Pride specifically helps memory retention and recall, motivation and confidence. You will not forget skills. It won't directly improve your learning speed, but perfect memory will mean that identical repetition to memorise a concept is not required.
- Locket of lust will affect people at your will, to a degree of your choosing (still has to be opposite sex (not an equal opportunity sin)). It doesn't give you control over how they will react.

*** So I may be missing something, but what downside is there to choosing an item, other than no longer being able to pick an item? What does lack of a soul actually do? When you die are you guaranteed to go to hell, or is it something else?

Really the Ring, Gun, and possibly the locket are the strongest choices.

The locket really only if it works on the demon to give you the other items.

The Gun and the Ring, it's obvious for both. Gun is less effort but distasteful, Ring is more work but greater benefit. Gun is less risky in some ways, but if you choose the ring you're gambling on being able to figure out immortality whereas with the gun it's guaranteed.

The Ring changes your personality, so I might go for the gun. Just gotta be careful not to get caught. Then again, maybe I'd choose the ring. It's a tough choice.

If we consider objectives other than immortality (say you are highly confident that it's either impossible in your lifetime, or almost guaranteed to exist), the glasses and watch are also ridiculously powerful. For an unambitious person, the flask and wallet are extremely useful, practically guaranteeing an easy life.

I think the most interesting feature of this line up is that they are items, so they can be shared or stolen.

** I'm curious how you guys think Earth magic could be exploited. For the purposes of this post, let's say Earth magic allows you to move molecules of anything so long as their initial distance from each other (at the time of you applying your magic to them) is close enough that they qualify as a solid. Once you have suffused the solid with your magic, you can then move the molecules however you like. You can't actually control the molecules individually, but you can separate the material enough to create sand/dust, condense them to create stone(or some other solid), or vibrate/still groups of molecules to alter the temperature of the substance. Think of it like water benders changing water into mist, steam, ice, and snow. The one main rule is that you can't put earth magic into something already occupied with magic, and all macroscopic living organisms contain magic. I'm also interested in both how people and some entity like an Endbringer with superhuman intelligence might exploit this. Various ideas I've been toying with:

-*Bone Conduction* by placing a relatively small piece of earth near someone's temple and vibrating it, earth users could pass sounds directly into another person's inner ear.

-*Dry Quicksand*: I know blowing air up through sand or loose gravel can cause its properties to function like that of a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCiIUjPF060][liquid]]. Seems like the cause of this is more room between the grains of sand which should be replicable with earth magic. Could be pretty useful for traps and moving underground.

-*Laser*: making a bootleg laser out of a bunch of large magnifying glasses all directed at the same point.

-*Glass Dust Poison*: coating glass dust in poison might help the poison get into the bloodstream through small cuts in the lungs and throat.

-*Generate Electricity*: moving permanent magnets around conductive materials to induce a current.

-*Resonance*: Vibrating the earth beneath someone's feet could result in many of the same effects as sound-based resonance techniques.

-*Dust*: if you can sense the location of your magic relative to yourself, you could probably use clouds of dust and the way they are displaced by things in the environment as a sort of poor man's echolocation. Depending on how precisely you can sense the movements, you could place dust on someones face to help with lip-reading or noticing microexpression (with enough practice).

-*Lava*: vibrate the molecules of a solid to heat it to the point of it melting.

-*Freezing*: stilling the molecules of a solid to cool the object. Not really sure how useful this would be.

-*Metamaterial*: Are there any particularly useful metamaterials that could be produced with earth magic? Super lenses? Graphene?

This makes me wonder how super senses in general are supposed to work. It kinda feels like people's imaginations are so dominated by vision that they default to imagine a master at an alternative sense using it as close to exactly like vision as they can suspend disbelief for. However, vision takes up huge amounts of neural real-estate. Skitter's bug-senses have a shard of an extradementional demigod to handle the processing. I have not heard of studies finding that human echolocators repurpose unused visual cortex matter for echolocation, but it'd be more interesting if this were not the case, and echolocation is still far less detailed than vision (between the serialization of hearing compared to sight's mass parallelization, and the shenanigans that it would take to echolocate a visible mote of dust, never mind the different properties of sound and light, the difference will almost always be significant).

So I have to wonder how this sort of thing works neurologically. Is magic handled by magic that has an independent system that doesn't care about brainspace? Does it repurpose your least-used neurons for the job? I know people in real life have given themselves new senses, such as with implanted magnets, and adapt to those pretty quickly, so I can see it going either way, until we get to the truly impressive stuff that normally takes a large cortex to resolve. I kinda want to come up with a way to give people senses that could potentially give highly detailed information, and see how far they can take it and what it does to their brains, but this is starting to sound like the origin story of a supervillain.

*** Land combat against you would become impossible, because you can alter the hardness and stiffness of the ground at will.

You can probably make powerful airguns by making pockets of air aboveground, shifting them downwards, and squeezing with your power then expelling it through channels made through the power. This gives a lot of versatility and air combat potential.

If you can think fast enough, you can probably make an army of earth golems that go to combat with you. Also what about making the battlefield a maze of earth structures.
