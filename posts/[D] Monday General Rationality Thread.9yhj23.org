Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Does anyone know where they can buy tickets to the Secular Solstice?

This is the very first year since they started that I can be in NYC during December to join the celebration and I want to buy tickets for it.

But the [[https://secularsolstice.com/][website]] I found says it ended for 2017 and I can't find any tickets to buy for the 2018 celebration. Anyone have any more info on this?

From what I can tell, they just posted it a few days ago. So I was looking for it a day or two too early.
