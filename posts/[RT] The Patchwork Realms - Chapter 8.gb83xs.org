  "Hi everyone!" Murray translated, his voice becoming a gentle tenor. "I'm Athos and it's great to be able to talk to you at last! I'm so excited to be here with you!"
#+end_quote

D'aww.

I hope that Athos is able to corrupt Murray to the Good Boy side.

** Thoughts as I go:

Ooh, more dog!

bulbuous -> bulbous?

How can Athos tell visually that they're pipes?

"sniffed each other's tails" - continue to like the dog perspective and idioms.

Ah, visible poor people in fantasy city. Interesting that there are fae(?) in a demon city, but I guess that just shows it's a large cosmopolitan place.

Eugene continues being an asshole, but feels like less of one than previously - maybe he's not as angry any more?

"jittery malaise" - ooh, is there some kind of demonic mind-effect? ... yeah, as I go through this section it's fairly clear there is.

... translator? [[https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7261971.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Dug-pixar-up.jpg][dug.jpg]]

As we go through the city, I can't help but feel the alien-ness is a bit... underexplored?

Okay, demonic moneychangers, makes sense.

... Huh? Marza doesn't have whatever kind of soul these demons work off? Interesting but not really relevant yet.

Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.

Negotiation scene... eh. No feelings about this bit.

Murray has had three lines and I already like him. Probably a bad idea, since he's an infernal.

Fixed, thanks.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They're round, metal, and smooth instead of cabled or braided.

#+begin_quote
  "sniffed each other's tails" - continue to like the dog perspective and idioms.
#+end_quote

Thanks. I've been making an effort on that. The hardest part is colors; dogs apparently see in a spectrum of yellow and blue, which makes descriptions somewhat limiting.

#+end_quote

Yup, I was going for cosmopolitan. Also, I wanted to draw some pros and cons...open borders, inclusive of different cultures, open carry and no major limitations on weapons, lots of wealth floating around, significant (literal) market activity, at least some strong communities, limited or no social safety nets, large amounts of poverty and vagrancy. Classifying those into pros and cons is a highly political issue so I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader; the point is to show that it's complicated and to make the city feel real.

  Eugene continues being an asshole, but feels like less of one than previously - maybe he's not as angry any more?
#+end_quote

He's mostly gotten over his rage, at least as far as Athos can tell.

#+end_quote

I loved that movie.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Which alien-ness in particular? There's a limited amount that I can explore it just while characters are walking through the city not talking to anyone, but I did try to showcase it as much as possible.

#+begin_quote
  Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.
#+end_quote

Yup. I had originally had a vague idea about doing the standard "nomad warrior from far away, serves as a cultural contrast for the main character" but decided that was too on the nose and too clich√©. Instead, I decided to go for "starship engineer".

I'm glad you like him. He was fun to write.

**** As to the "alien-ness" I don't know how to express it - I'd just finished the latest batch of Worth The Candle before starting this chapter, so maybe it's just that the way it's done there resonates with me particularly well. I guess a lot of it fell into "standard fantasy city" until we started digging into the demon- or system- specific bits.

Thinking about it a bit further, I guess it's seeing the second-order consequences of differences between the alien races, but that's not something that Athos is likely to know about or observe at this point.

Also, large central landmark building in a fantasy city with unusual architecture? Ten mana says they end up going there at some point.

***** Standard fantasy city? Rats. I was making a deliberate effort to get away from that -- hence the science fiction tech, steampunk, visible poverty, no elves or dwarves, and starfish aliens.

Oh well. If I'm going to be compared to anything, I suppose WtC isn't the worst option.

****** I guess the scifi/steampunk stuff hasn't really had much of an impact, it feels? Athos has /noticed/ it, but not really /cared/ about it.

I don't think "visible poverty" is offbrand for fantasy city, though, but I imagine it's a broader label for me than what you were avoiding. Might be due to how I've been running D&D recently, since my players enjoy taking down corrupt nobles and the like, so visible poverty is basically dangling an easy plot hook.
