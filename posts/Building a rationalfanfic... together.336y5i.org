This subreddit sees a lot of talking about rational!this and rational!that. And then nothing gets done, because we're just spitballing and nobody wants to pick up the admittedly ginormous task of writing the durned thing.

A theory which I would like to test, by putting it to action, is this: If we know that something is going to be done with it, if a story is actually going to be written up and completed by somebody, then it is possible to build a sufficient amount of interest in spitballing ideas and building the world, plot, and even outline as a group.

When I have an outline I can write 1,000 to 1,500 words an hour. My schedule is wonky so I can do whatever I want on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and the weekend. Assuming that (1) the universe we choose to tackle is one that I am familiar with or can practically familiarize myself with and (2) we are able to build an outline, then I will have the ability to turn our world, plot, and outline into a full-fledged story.

*EDIT*: To clarify the previous paragraph, it seems that most fics, rational or otherwise, stall at the "turning the idea into words" stage. So I can precommit to handling that if we get to the point of making an outline (and, again, it's a universe that I actually understand).

--------------

First order of business: What universe do we want to play in?

Harry Potter's been done, and I'm reluctant to do a sequel for this project. Death Note, Pokemon, Terminator, Naruto, Superman, Animorphs, Frozen, and Twilight all have respectable r!fics.

(So does Christmas.)

Star Wars has been discussed in other threads. So have The Hunger Games, Fullmetal Alchemist, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Star Trek, Yu-Gi-Oh, Stargate: SG-1, Fallout, One Piece, and Percy Jackson.

Of these, only The Hunger Games and Star Trek (to my knowledge) were not discussed in the context of someone wanting to do a fic in that universe, so we might want to stray away from the others in order to avoid competing r!fics. The field is white and ready to harvest, after all. We have plenty to choose from.

If the redditor who had the idea for rational!Anakin wasn't interested in pursuing that, though, then that is totally an idea that I think would be interesting. Still, let's just bounce out some ideas first.

The challenge of an r!Star Trek is interesting.

Other possibilities to bounce out:

- The Marvel Cinematic Universe (being a lot smaller and easier to manage than the 616 comics universe)

- Firefly/Serenity

- Invader ZIM (okay, the idea is as insane as the show, but if we could do it, that'd be something amazing)

- The Mummy

[[/u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/Wertifloke]], "FanFicBias" on FFN (don't know zirs Reddit name), and that's just off the top of my head -- there's a bunch more that I'm not thinking of at the moment.

That said:

If you want it, I suggest writing it yourself. Writing by committee is hard for everyone, and we'd all like to read something new.

If you're going to do this, I vote Firefly. I love Firefly.

**** My point was simply that, if you're willing to be the writer, then be the writer. If you've got the chops to write a story then you've got the chops to do the worldbuilding.

Relying on a committee will just slow down and complicate the process. If you want help with early-on brainstorming and then you take it and run with it, that's one thing. If you want to have a group of people determining various things (physics? character traits?) along the way, then you're talking about an RPG thread, not a story per se. RPG threads are cool, but be aware of which you're doing.

** The MCU is already pretty unwieldy, with multiple films/year and three TV shows already.

Why not the X-men filmverse?

You'd need to find an excuse why Professor X isn't unbeatable; but other than that the canon is pretty clear-cut. Unlike the comics, there's no magic or anything else weird but "mutation", and there's no sliding timescale nonsense - the filmmakers took the excuse to clear up most of the issues with the original when adapting it.

But what really makes me think this could work is Rogue as a rational protagonist.

Rogue's powers are clear-cut and ripe for munchkinning, with their drawbacks and strict rules. But most importantly, they let her /steal other people's powers/. In a rational!rogue, you have an excuse to play with /every power in the films/ - while still not being too broken, because she loses them again.

** I'd have to say star wars or FMA(shameless self plug). In my limited memory of those threads, most of the others didn't get further than general world-building (feel free to correct me on this).

The three main protagonists suggested for R!FMA were: * Winry * postDublinth!Al * someone in the future

These three would be radically different. Al would probably start with him munchkining his new circle-less transmutation and then pretty much skipping to the boss battle with father. The random future person would just be a worldbuilding short.

** One technique that would be interesting: readers are randomly split into two groups representing in-universe factions and a game master carefully controls the flow of information between them until the end. That way you don't have to deal with the very difficult task of deciding whether you would have thought of a solution after seeing it / hindsight bias / etc. For phase one everyone does public brainstorming.

It would still be possible to cheat just by having two online identities of course, but it would prevent "accidental" cheating.

I suggest a superpower fic that isn't fanfiction. Everyone brainstorms superpowers then the GM hands them out and everyone does a massive online collaborative RP thing.

** I'm partial to a Star Trek: DS-9 rational fic, though I currently have no plans to write one nor do I have much time to collaborate. Feel free to use ideas, of course.

Advantages of DS-9 include a strong setting, lots of dynamic galactic events, and a wormhole that could lead quickly to parts unknown if the story isn't about that sort of thing, or it needs a brand new setting for something.

Some possible points of interest:

- The opportunity for a non-Starfleet Vulcan main character

  - Because who else is the MC in a rational Trek fic?
  - Vulcans later get heavily involved in plot events and almost start a shooting war with the Bajorans, so they are around and interested in the wormhole.
  - They are also limited psychics and have a great spiritual-system-as-religion that /almost/ seems to work as advertised.

- The chance to poke at the oddities of non-human humanoid species

  - It is obvious, for example, that every other species has, at some point, done at least some level of bioengineering for intelligence, longevity, and physical strength.
  - *Everyone* is stronger than humans, for example.
  - Vulcans are just better across the board.
  - And the Trill? We know from the plot that they are playing bioethical games.
  - Also, why so few cybernetic enhancements and replacements?
  - The Earth and their post-Eugenics war stuff might explain humanity not doing post-human bioengineering, but do Vulcans really not have the medical tech to do so? Or maybe they do, and don't use it because of religious reasons.

- The hows and whys of colonization in the /almost/ post physical scarcity culture of the Federation.

  - If someone just wants to round up a few thousand people and head off to settle down somewhere, what kind of forces would come into play?
  - The Federation isn't expansionist, because they don't have to be. They don't appear to need more planets full of people, or filled with weird metals or strange crystals. That sort of thing only comes into play in shows because they're usually so far away from supply bases.
  - How much does the Federation help citizens who want to strike out?
  - And what if someone wants to /leave/ the Federation with a pile of stuff and a few tens of thousands of people? Is that going to be a big deal, or does it happen all the time?

- Issues regarding robots and even weak AI: why isn't it everywhere?

  - This could get dark, fast.
  - Or it could be a simple explanation given in passing: /"AI is hard and illegal. It's easier to bioengineer a brain than program one--which is also illegal. Superhuman AIs are almost impossible. Even the Borg aren't superhuman, just very distributed. Data is an example of the best a single mad scientist can do at current (very stagnant) tech levels. Anything research more organized usually gets stepped on, fast. Time-travel-experiments fast."/
  - But why so few robots, even remote controlled ones? That's odd.
  - Maybe the Vulcan robots make people /really/ insecure, so they don't show them off. Vulcan ships might be stuffed full of the things, for all we know.

--------------

If I were going to write a rational DS-9 story, I'd write about a Vulcan bioengineer heading a group people who want to strike out into the wormhole territory to build an independent scientific research colony. Sort of a free port for those blocked from research by Federation cultural mores and laws, plus a jumping off point to exploring the secrets the new sector holds. Throw in all possible seasteading and sci-fi libertarian tropes for maximum fun.

Her personal goal is a functional suite of protocols for pan-species physical immortality, something Vulcan religions frowns on and most of the Federation publically bans for precautionary principle reasons--more secretly, this is really done for population control reasons. All of this is, obviously, /most illogical/. Biological organisms are fragile and can easily be made much less so. To her, the cost versus reward on doing so for intelligent life easily justifies the expense and effort.

The story opens when our Vulcan arrives on DS-9 and starts collecting materials, buying extra ships, arranging supply agreements, and recruiting last minute specialist personnel. All of the show's big names get involved or approached, of course. Everything has to be ready by the time the fleet arrives, a looming event she keeps referring to, much to the confusion of everyone else. Initially, because of her private and secretive ways, they think she's part of some sort of tiny Vulcan religious cult. They couldn't be more wrong.

First half of the story will be her bouncing off the confused Federation and station personnel and other major actors.

The Cardassians show up and argue that this is a sign of illegal Federation expansionism--they are confused when she shits all over the Federation in true bash-fic fashion and explains how they are actually leaving the "protection" of the Federation.

The Bajorans are faintly bemused by the whole idea, being themselves uninterested in colonization. They have spiritual issues with the whole thing and want endless meetings, but in the end are intellectually intrigued by the idea of unaligned people exploring past the wormhole and the economic possibilities involved. And in sticking it to the Cardassians, of course.

At some point, Starfleet mooks start poking around, trying to find any excuse to shut it down. This brings up all sorts of freedom and personal rights issues that should be interesting to explore in the Trek 'verse. Starfleet and the conservative factions trying to thwart the colony are the main antagonists. Personal drama is high, physical threats are low. Getting traction against the way the Federation works is the conflict that drives this part of the story.

This would end climatically when the "wagon train" fleet finally shows up, with tens of thousands of Vulcans and other humanoid scientists ready to set out. Before, people on DS-9 didn't really emotionally grasp what the fleet was. It looks like an invasion, with hundreds of huge ships from a mix of Federation worlds. All armed "illegally" to the teeth by their Ferengi investors, who we know from canon are much better armed and armored than the Federation usually is. They push through all opposition and transition through the wormhole.

That's the end of the first novel-length story (eight to ten chapters, about 60k words).

--------------

The second half of the story would have to do with the growing danger and climatic events related to the previously unknown threat of the Dominion. Also, some small town politics and radical libertarian cultural friction stuff while setting up the colony. Everything gets off to a rocky start, but eventually settles down as they get their power plants and replicators online.

Once the shit hits the fan, a strong feature would be how actually intelligent people prepare for ruthless interstellar war, and how dangerous it /should be/ to warp anywhere near a technologically modern planet's defense grid. Wolf 359 and later events showed how lacking the Federation is in that respect. Even DS-9 could do better, with shitty thrown-together automated mines. Siege warfare should be very, very costly in space.

The show's main characters can make appearances at various times, but I'd suggest focusing on mostly OCs with maybe only a couple of "defectors". I'd choose *Julian Bashir*, for obvious reasons.

Yes. Okay. OC/Bashir is in the cards. I'm not saying /pon farr/ happens, but I'm not saying it /doesn't/. And it would be illogical for such a predictable event to go unplanned for by the main character--we already know that cross isn't very fecund. Being pregnant would be awkward, so it makes sense. My ship has weapons armed and shields at maximum. You get the idea.

In any case, I think it would work to have Bashir sympathetic to the idea of the colony while flirting with the cold but pretty Vulcan scientist. He agrees with their goals, Starfleet mooks retaliate by making a big deal of his bioengineered past while questioning his loyalty, so he quits Starfleet and joins the science colony. He can then continue to talk to Sisko and the others, and be a link between canon and the AU-ness by making trips back and forth. At some point, the Dominion-lead Cardassians retake DS-9 and some of the main cast flees to the science free-port colony. Flavor with canon to taste.

The Dominion is huge but fights stupid, and is in general rather technologically decadent. It should still be a threat worthy of a single world full of rational actors. The Founders are the Death Star in this story--a foe not swayed by rationality or human goals, unreachable and unattackable. They want nothing less than complete order and total safety for their static, ingrown, xenophobic, fundamentalist culture. That means cutting the heads off tall dandelions, like the science free-port, as well as destroying the Federation and other nations on the other side of the wormhole.

The end game is the Federation eventually adopting the hard won techniques and minor technological refinements developed on the other side of the wormhole to fight the Dominion to a standstill and, after major cultural changes are forced on the Federation by their near destruction, the final victory of a more free-thinking and rational Federation. None of that War of the Worlds-esque, last minute, Hail Mary biotech solution nonsense that let the Federation win in canon.

That's the end of the second novel-length fanfic. Call it 80k words and ten to twelve chapters.

--------------

And then, of course, the Borg show up again. Or they are asked to assisting in figuring out a way to help the lost Starfleet ship /Voyager/. Or the Changelings start an insurrection. Or someone discovers an immortality planet, and they send a mission to study it. Or Lore gets loose again. Lots to work with. Could probably do a trilogy or longer series set in and around the science free-port. Just, for dog's sake, no time travel.

** One idea I've been mulling over is a rational [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_%281968_film%29][Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 one)]]. I've recently watched it for a second time and was struck by just how pessimistic and idiotic Taylor was. I want the stranded astronauts to be scientists (something not too far fetched) that can actually figure out what to do and how to negotiate instead of cuss at the apes until they get their hands on a gun and ride off into the sunset with their mute +sex slave+ love interest.

One of the main themes of the movie was institutional restriction of science; shown through Dr. Zaius, an orangutan who is both a religious leader and the scientific head-honcho, who is our main villain as the protagonists try to find out the truth. But the movie also argues for the restriction of knowledge by the reveal that [[#s][Really lame spoiler that's spoiled by the promotional posters]] I think this theme can be expanded upon and made more nuanced.

But mostly I just want to see an intelligent, rational person deal with being captured by apes that somehow have a reason to speak English 2,000 years in the future.

(Also the source material is only one hour and a half long move, so you don't have to watch a 15 season long anime or deal with extended universes or anything.)

**** Ok, I've mostly come up with questions but not solutions for stuff to change:

- The space ship: the ship should be a colony ship or have some explanation of it's purpose. The vessel in question is a small ship with four people in suspended animation: three males and one female, who dies while in transit. Taylor (the captain and sole surviving crew member after the other men are killed by the apes) says that the woman, Stuart, was supposed to be their "New Eve." Now this is probably just a case of Taylor being scuzzy again, because if they were actually a colony ship, then they should have more than just one female. Also, the ship arrives on a planet 2,000 years in Earth's future, thanks to relativity. With that kind of time gap any science vessel would be obsolete by the time it could send information back, never mind that the people on board aren't scientists. So the ship isn't a colony ship and it isn't a science ship, what other reason could NASA have for sending them out there?

- Let's go with the remake's reason that the apes can speak and humans can't: Alzheimers cure gone horribly wrong. Will the engineered virus still be around to endanger our heroes? I'll go with no.

- The apes speak English. While that's OK for Hollywood, It doesn't make much sense. Languages change over 2000 years unless they are dead and kept around for some reason. If the apes didn't speak English, then there wouldn't be the farce of Taylor being shot in the neck to prevent him from talking to the apes until the opportune moment. I would probably have my apes speak Old English or archaic German as an approximation of how their language would differ from that of the astronauts. I think that this is a more realistic communication obstacle.

- I'd kind of like to see it be a "Connecticut Yanky in King Arthur's Court" sort of story with informed tech and science sweeping through the ape's society, but it has to be done in a satisfying way. Namely the humans can't curb-stomp the apes and take over their culture. Looking forward to optimizing ape society would probably be the end state or epilog.

- I would want to go deeper in the talks with Zira, Cornelius, and Dr. Zaius about who and what counts as a person, better proof of reasoning skills, the concept of philosophical zombies, the treatment of lab animals, and other topics that the movie only hinted at.

Would we be drifting too far to reassign the ape castes in such a way that each species makes more sense? Frex, IIRC chimpanzees would be better soldiers than gorillas even though they're smaller and less physically imposing.

Could the ship have been a proof of concept of some sort? Either they come from a culture or program that is REALLY patient, or it's a good thing that somebody wanted to test the design because it did NOT work as intended.

****** So the ship could be a proof of concept but was supposed to only travel for 10 years or so and some how ended up going for 2,000. Maybe it got too close to a weird anomaly that sped it up to a much higher fraction of the speed of light?

The criteria for the ship's function/malfunction:

- Journey takes 2,000 years (or however long it takes to form an ape civilization, if we want to change that number)

- Arrive back at Earth with sufficient ambiguity on whether it is Earth or not. This includes the ability to land on a planet even if it was not the original destination. (The ambiguity is maybe not necessary, but let's keep with the spirit of the original.)

- 

  - If the mission was supposed to go to a different planet, there has to be at least some attempt at an explanation for why they are on Earth.

- Crash land in such a way that the ship can't fly but our heroes survive. (To put the astronauts on equal footing when they first encounter the apes.)

So something went wrong, but not /horribly/ wrong with the ship... unless the mission was to time travel to the future to re-seed the earth after a nuclear war. (But in that case there is no ambiguity about their location.)

******* Are we able to justify putting them in cryosleep?

Maybe the proof of concept was a long-distance journey, testing several systems before designs for a generation ship were finalized. The ship goes out, then comes back in, and... human civilization has fallen apart.

The ship's AI decides (there are several possible reasons) that the fall of human civilization is cause to keep the astronauts in cryo. Waiting for the situation to improve, perhaps. So it orbits for centuries until it becomes to fall into disrepair. The AI decides it can't wait any longer and descends, but in the process the damage which it has suffered is magnified and the AI is in no shape to explain much, if anything.

Perhaps try to come up with a reason for them to conclude, at first, that they are on a colony planet or something?

But really, they're /astronauts/. How do they not look up at the sky and see the constellations?

******** I agree. If we throw out the ambiguity, the problem gets a lot easier. The movie could obscure the truth because the audience accepted that Hollywood aliens spoke English and looked human; rationalfic readers would not accept that.

****** Good point. And if worse comes to worse, they could poach the best apes from multiple tribes. If we assume that Zira and Cornelius are not unique, I think that there could be quite a few young apes discontent with their current society.

Side note about Cornelius and Zira: Names are pretty hardy things, and can survive for a very long time. So it isn't ridiculous, either, that those names have survived for so long.

What kind of apes are we dealing with, btw? Are bonobos a thing? Or is this the gorilla-chimpanzee-orangutan triad?

******** The original village was made up of only gorillas, chimps, and orangutans. Let's keep the original village this way, but if the astronauts explore, they'll find villages with bonobos or villages made up of only one ape race. Different villages and nations will have different customs. Maybe one village has semi-sentient gibbons as slaves/pets instead of humans.

I definitely think that the story has potential. My main worry is that I would miss an Obvious Rational Thing or be unaware of some pertinent scientific fact, which is one of the reasons that I'm leery about drawing up an outline all on my own for this.

But I am definitely cool with putting it into words on my lonesome.

*** Keeping in mind though, that these apes in a political Dark ages, have a repressive religious order that intentionally keeps knowledge secret ruling the world, and a caste based heirarchical society, and (though canon didn't touch on this) may well have irreconcilable psychological differences which might make interacting with them difficult for humans. There might be several good reasons for even a more reasonable version of Taylor to hate them.

Also, it would be fun to explore the different psychologies of the uplifted ape species. We have orangutangs, gorillas, chimpanzees/bonobos (canon was written at a time when that distinction wasn't made). Canon implies that the current ape caste system has orangutangs as rulers, gorillas are military, and chimps are everyone else. The apes have to deal with a diversity of sentient species that cannot interbreed, which is more diversity than we as humans have had to deal with. This sets a nice precedent for human-ape relations actually, since adding humans to the caste tree shouldn't be that hard.

Other questions: Is the ape technology re-discovered, or did they take human tech and gradually decline from there? Clearly they /have/ scientists, so they shouldn't decline that far, but are they really as smart as humans were on average, and are they smart in the same /directions/?)
