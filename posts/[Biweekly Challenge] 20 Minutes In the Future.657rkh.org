[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62byv5/biweekly_challenge_weirdtopia/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Weirdtopia", and our winner was [[/u/CaptainLoggers]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62byv5/biweekly_challenge_weirdtopia/dg1ysjj/][their story]], "A Good Day's Work". Go read it now!

This time the challenge will be *Twenty Minutes in the Future*. Write a story set a relatively short time in the future, where changes to society are extrapolations on what's currently going on in the world of science, technology, politics, etc. The term "eerily plausible" often comes up for this kind of story, since they usually don't fall so far into the future that they're pure speculation. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, April 26th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:

** [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/the-facilitator-2099/][The Facilitator]] (5095 Words)

At the tail end of the 21st century, even AI designers are struggling to find work. Renée Souvicou is out of luck, out of money and running out of time. Her half-finished creation, the Facilitator, is her last chance to avoid a life of mediocrity. But she's about to discover success can be far more terrifying than failure.

*** The story is very, very good, as is the sequel. I have only on suggestion for improvement. In France, René is a male name. Renée is is the female name, although René can be used as a girl's name in places like the US.

Calling her René caused me to imagine her as a male until near the end of the story when she (in my mind a "he") seemed to be attracted by a male (odd but possible) and she was finally referred to as "her" on page 6 (obviously this only happened because I clicked the link that described you as winner instead of reading your comment in which you describe her as a female).

I'd suggest changing her name to Renée so that readers won't picture her as a male for 2/3 of the story :)

** Remoting (1179 words).

[[https://writingon.thepublicinter.net/story/remoting/]]

A vision of the near future where there is more and more political engagement, less and less political satisfaction, increasing authoritarian sentiment, a more literal vision of democracy as a system for nameless masses to have influence, and just a dash more technology.
