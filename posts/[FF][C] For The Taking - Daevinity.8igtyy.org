** An interesting one-shot where the protagonist lives in a world where anyone can summon demons. This story is about her decision to sell her soul and why.

I stumbled on this story while looking through past Friday threads and it looked interesting enough to share.

*** Not as good as the star-gate development notes, but I was tearing up with laughter by the end.

I kind of wonder if this is what happens when a Type-II Civilization leaves a real words interface to call them up in their virtuality and a running joke goes too far.

***** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][Stargate Physiscs 101]] A lot of it is software development jokes applied to stargate, so if you've worked as a programmer and or know and like the Stargate franchise I recommend not drinking anything while you read it unless you like performing spit takes.

TLDR: I think [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][this]] is hilarious!

** Huh, thoughts about how you could actually get that information in such a world? I didn't see anything about keeping the demon from lying in the bindings.

*** You don't. What's the point? If demons can always talk you out of your soul and souls are real, and they're just letting humanity fatten up... Well, you've already lost so why bother, just be happy that you've been born in the not-yet-malthusian era.

If they're not and this is a huge prank, why bother?

**** That's rather defeatist, given the usual attitude of this sub. Yes, one has to trust that the contracts actually work, or possibly some other fixed point, but that's still better than nothing. Doubly so given the horror of the malthusian era.

***** It might be defeatist but if demons are that much of a memetic hazard then you lost unless the first summoner gagged them.

However do demons want to be gagged why would they start a soul joke?

** I am getting to find the original work/setting of that story.

Google didn't help, any suggestion?

**** Okay so it's not a story, it's a worldbuilding exercise?

I did find that forum thread, however, I was confused by the lack of anything else.

***** It's totally a story... but it's a "collaborative roleplaying" type of story with multiple authors. The "original story" was posted to a particularly inconvenient sort of message board with weird formatting, but has since been reported in a slightly nicer format here: [[https://glowfic.com/board_sections/86]]

****** Thanks a lot, it feels like being given the code to a secret community that feels really really shady but isn't :P

Yeah searching for it was a nightmare, google didn't help much and all I found was extremely disjointed and all over the place.

I did understand that it was an RPG type of thing but I was completely lost, thank you so much.
