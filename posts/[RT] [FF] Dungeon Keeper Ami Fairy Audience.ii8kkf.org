***** I wasn't guessing at what you meant to type, I was guessing at what you /actually/ typed. R and T are adjacent on a standard keyboard.

** I keep trying to get past the first "season", and it kept feeling repetitive. How long does it take for the plot to pick up again after [[#s][spoiler]]

*** I would answer but the old spoiler link hack from before reddit had spoiler tags has never worked for me. I just get a link that refreshes the page and the hover text never shows. Why not just use the normal >! !< method?

*** I'm not really sure where you left out, but when does it start feeling repetitive? I feel like all the "arcs" are very varied and different. Just in the "first season" we have Ami being an adventurer, exploring the underworld, conquering a dungeon, making a deal with the dark gods, getting a new enemy-turned-ally from her world and finally facing a horned reaper in hand-to-hand combat in an underworld stadium.

Maybe it's not the story itself but the writing style that gets repetitive for you?
