*** What are people here's thoughts on the Laundry series? I thought they were alright, but have gotten pretty bored of them and not read the last few. I hate when an author I like gets obsessed with a series I'm not into. It's just like S.M. Stirling and those "after the Change" books that seem like they'll never end.

I can only imagine it's a vagary of the publishing industry that pushes people to keep churning out sequels in series that sell well, but I would certainly be reading more from those authors if they mixed it up instead.

**** In a word, yes. I don't know if [[/u/cstross]] wants to chime in here, but my impression is that he's a bit constrained in what he can sell at the moment. Without starting a new series, Merchant Princes: TNG and the Laundry are all that's running at the moment.

Halting State/R34 can't really move forward since they're no longer near-future, but alternate-present. Hard SF has spent the last decade masquerading neatly as police procedural, but only on television.

The Eschaton Agents series is also completed, but I don't remember the reasoning offhand. The Saturn's Children/Neptune's Brood series /could/ go forward, but isn't as far as I know. Accelerando /might/ have places to go, but the book itself is a pretty complete tryptic.

As for my thoughts on the Laundry, it's managed to keep itself reasonable as the story has moved to and through CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN. Stross has managed to do a wonderful job taking the Cold War fears of an impending end to the world and shifted over to having the protagonists getting by in a world they can no-longer trust in a War on Terror sense. Several of the in-story discussions about plans to move the Laundry through the coming period of change are sobering on a level that earlier stories weren't. Some of Stross's best writing has come out in this series, in my opinion.

***** It's a little but more complex than that, but essentially, yes.

The Laundry universe has a story arc roughly 12 books long; book 7 is in production and comes out this June (and is a major turning point) and book 8 should be out in June 2017. (Then I need to take a year off before my brain melts.)

There is a new Merchant Princes trilogy (books 7-9) in the works, but it keeps being pushed back and my US editor dying last month didn't help; hopefully book one of the new bunch will appear next summer.

Publishers like to buy long series works and if they succeed in building a following they're good earners -- which matters to the authors, when they hit middle age. (Disclaimer: I'm 51. Steve is in his sixties and I'm pretty sure his Change series is his pension plan: they sell /really/ well.) On the other hand, there's such a thing as too much of a good thing, so I'm in the planning stages of a wholly new stand-alone space opera at present (plus other development projects). Hopefully I'll have some concrete news to report in a month or three.

***** What's wrong with starting a new series? Or better yet, writing a novel that's neither part of a past series, nor an attempt to start a new one?

And I guess my answer to that question, informed in part by being a regular reader of Stross's blog, is that publishers really want series rather than standalones. I don't remember to what extent that is actually about series selling better, of if it's just that they mean you don't have to pitch a scary new concept every book.

**** I really like the Laundry series, but the latest books are working a little less well for me. Partly that's because they made a shift from being spy pastiches to genre pastiches, when I feel like they would have been better off just becoming their own thing. Basically, they now have too many ideas in them that would have been better unconnected from the series proper.

I don't know, I'll keep reading them, but I wish that Stross would just find the core conceit compelling instead of feeling the need to pull in other things.

***** Have you read Halting State? I consider anything less than "I'mma gonna write a 2nd-person Mundane SF story with a ZOMBIE ATTACK directed by AI at the climax cause I CAN!" to be a win for controlling that particular instinct. I think he may actually be allergic to long projects without some sort of thematic challenge.

**** I've enjoyed how it has been slowly circling into the horror that is the Lovecraft mythos. We laugh because it hurts, but then it hurts too bad to keep laughing.

***** Google "Equoid". The one Laundry story with Lovecraft in it doesn't circle the horror of the mythos at all.

I really enjoy every other book, apparently.

Atrocity Archives was great, Jennifer Morgue was okay but didn't really work for me, Fuller Memorandum was very good, I honestly can't remember a thing about The Apocalypse Codex other than being very underwhelmed, Rhesus Chart was good again, and then Annihilation Score had its moments.

** I remember this!

It's /incredible./ Really influenced a lot of my own takes on the Mythos.
