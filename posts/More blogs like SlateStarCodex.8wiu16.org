I've recently discovered SSC, and I really love it. So educational, insightful, and engaging (easy to understand, fun to read). I'm looking for more stuff like this. I know about LessWrong, Wait But Why, and Paul Graham's essays. Can you recommend more good similar rationality/science/tech related blogs?

Gwern, Scott Aaronson, and UnitOfCaring are all pretty great.

Have you read the sequences?
