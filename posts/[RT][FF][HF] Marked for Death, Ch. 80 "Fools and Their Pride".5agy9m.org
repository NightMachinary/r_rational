I totally failed to put a post up for Ch 79! Mea culpa. You can find that chapter [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7172445/][here.]]

 

The latest chapter by the incomparable [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] is *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7172445/][here.]]*

Today, our intrepid missing-nin team puts their plan for capturing their target into motion at last! Will they make it out the other side? (Seriously. Will they?)

--------------

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The story updates every Thursday ([[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]]) and Sunday ([[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] (of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 Year Emperor]] and [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html][Induction]]). Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

 

The first chapter is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][here,]] and the story-only thread (if you'd like to get caught up quickly) is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/][here.]] There's also a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/][guide to voting]] put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants.


** PSA: [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] has decided to mess with me by changing the chapter title to "Horrible Heights and Amazing Ambush", because he's a gigantic troll and knows I can't change the title of Reddit posts.

*** Heh.

Actually I did it because it was SUPPOSED to refer to the villain of the piece -- I had this scene planned for the case where you succeeded in capturing her, where the lot of you could banter back and forth and she could be prideful and arrogant despite being captured. Sadly, I did not get to that scene, so the title makes no sense. I didn't want the thread to think it referred to them so I changed it.
