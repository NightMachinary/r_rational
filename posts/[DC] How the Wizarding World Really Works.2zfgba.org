** Note that this was all written in 2004, so before Half-Blood Prince came out; nothing from the last two books seem to contradict his theories on the unofficial political structure of magical Britain, but by part six or so he's making some theories about Voldemort's plans that clearly have a horcrux-shaped hole in them.

Honestly, the whole thing's a bit overdone- yes, his ideas about a patron structure fit the facts as presented in the first 5 books, but in the end he's just applying a lot of weight to the idea that (politically) powerful wizards form clics/networks of people that owe them favors/groups of sycophants and trying to turn that into an unoficial structure to the side of the government. Which... yes, anyone who went to high school could tell you that people form groups like that, and yes, that's how people get ahead inside real-world governments, by forming groups of supporters/people who owe them favors who help them advance in hopes of advancing with them.

The idea that the death eaters were the inner circle and there were a bunch of other supporters was obvious even at that point in the books, and the idea that they were broken up into cells was obvious to anyone who thought for a second about how the first DE they caught didn't give up all the rest.

His thoughts on Percy's motivations and actions were the most interesting, honestly. The rest of it could have been a single post, and a lot of it was reading in things that I really doubt Rowling ever thought about.

*** Yeah, ever since Scott started blogging at Slate Star Codex, livejournal has seemed totally useless. Well, there is a value in keeping the old archives. ;-)

** Also notable is [[/u/Deggit]]'s excellent theory on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2mi8hr/the_entire_wizarding_world_would_collapse/][the economics of the Wizarding World]] (and, to a lesser extent, his speculations about [[http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2yqla1/muggles_dont_exist_and_that_means_albus/][the Wizarding Gene]]).
