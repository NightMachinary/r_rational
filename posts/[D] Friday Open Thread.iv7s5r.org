Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** When I upvote someone, I use Reddit Enhancement Suite to mark the subreddit, because it's interesting to see if I have any other subreddits in common with the person.

I've noticed that, no matter what the first subreddit is [typically [[/r/rational]], [[/r/kaiserreich]], or [[/r/geopolitics]]], the second one is almost always political.

How do you use RES?

*** I use RES to tag people, some for modding purposes, some just for general curiosity. I tag people from my (small) city if they post in the state subreddit or the city one, so that if I see them elsewhere I can think to myself, "hey, small world!".

The ability of RES to hide read comments is one of the only things that makes coming back to longer threads actually useful.

Tracking upvotes and downvotes on a person colors future interactions with them, in a way that I /generally/ endorse. It also helps names stick out a little bit more, because if someone has a [+30] next to their name, I'll make note of them.

There are a bunch of features of RES that I take for granted, and don't even remember aren't a part of the standard reddit experience, like Live Preview, which I forget is a thing until those rare moments I'm looking through reddit while signed out.

I wish it had the option to hide the totals for people with less than say, -5/+5 vote differentials. Highlighting people with strong +scores is nice because they're usually insightful or funny people, and people with strong -scores is nice because it's usually the result of something absolutely heinous that might need rebutting, but +1/-1 "was polite once" / "told a really tired joke" gets a very similar visual treatment.

For the night mode. :)

On a more serious note, I tend to mark people I've gilded. Not sure why, but it's a habit at this point (36 instances according to my page). I think I've seen another post/comment by a gilded person only twice so far (and one time it was [[/u/RamsesThePigeon]], who is super active on many large subreddits).

*** I tag content creators with what they make (good in their threads/communities, super fun when you see them show up somewhere else), people who told a particularly funny joke with a fragment of the joke (mostly to make my future self laugh), people who promote ideas about racial hierarchies as "nazi" (handy if they show up dogwhistling later), and people who confront those with something positive.

The +/- vote tool is also super cool. Though there's no way to sync it between computers that I know of, so it's been less handy for me lately now that I'm using two.

My favorite tag story involves tagging a user who spilled their guts about their life story, which shared a lot of uncommon hardships with mine, then seeing them become a regular on [[/r/rational]] several months later. (Not saying who since that's like, two people's privacy, but if you think that's you, hi! You're cool!)

*** I use it for moderation. On my alt account I'm a mod of two niche subs I won't link here (NSFW), every time someone breaks one of the rules they get a down vote, a warning and the comment/post gets removed.

When they get to -5 karma as tracked by res i can be sure that their disruption to the community is worth less than what they're contributing, so I'll switch to temp bans.

*** I started out using RES for marking people: When I was active on a fanfiction sub I marked people who said they were or were not open to a certain type of story recommendations, that way I would remember not to recommend them things they wouldn't like. I eventually started marking fanfic authors, content creators, people who participate on certain subs, people who recommend a certain kind of content, etc.

I also make frequent use of RES's ability to hide comments and to customize filters for posts on different subs. For example, RES is great for filtering out spoilers for stories I haven't read yet on [[/r/Parahumans]].

*** There's nothing out there as far as I know, and no easy solution.

You could manually copy-paste each chapter to a doc, then convert that to a PDF

or go [[https://pdfcrowd.com/][here]], convert each webpage to a PDF, then go [[https://combinepdf.com/][here]] to combine them, but the end result will look like [[https://pdfcrowd.com/genpdf/f7d89599785324f8bc1325d2b3976fdb.pdf?name_inline=docfuture_tumblr_com_post_34751426243_doc_prologue.pdf][this]], which you may hate.

** Does anyone know what happened to alternate history (the website)? And if there's any backup for it?

I've found more than a few recs to it, but it seems like the all of those links are dead now. It also seems to have less crossover for fics than usual (versus fics on SB and SV being frequently crossposted). I've been a fanfic/webnovel reader for years now, so it's surprising and sad to discover a dead fiction hub only after it seems to be gone.
