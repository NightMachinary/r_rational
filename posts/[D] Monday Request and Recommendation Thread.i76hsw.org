Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** What works are you folks following every update? Here's a list of ones that are active and I automatically click read when a new chapter is out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13420487/1/A-Rabbit-among-Wolves][A Rabbit among Wolves]] is a RWBY fanfiction that asks the question what would happen if Juane Arc became the head of the White Fang instead of attending Beacon. It's a popcorn fic that offers some solid laughs.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivator's Book 3 is being posted on Royal Road]]. Sarah Lin puts out two chapters of this urban cultivation novel weekly. It's a fantastic story of cultivation that avoids the standard cliche's that often come with cultivation based stories. Books 1 and 2 are available on Kindle Unlimited.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard][Confessions of a Magpie Wizard]] is a decent fantasy story of a demon who infiltrates a human academy and learns empathy. Pretty fun read.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice][Never Die Twice]] is a fantastic story about a necromancer who's goal is to kill death and give everyone the ability to live forever. His goals might be admirable, but his methods are fairly evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362076/1/Less-Than-Zero][Less Than Zero]] is a DC fanfiction where the author has inserted an OC character. The story follows Null as he discovers his powers and tries to use them to move on up from poverty. He tries to figure out where his ethics lie and works with villains and heroes alike. One of my favorite stories out there.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] is the story of a man named Carl and his ex girlfriend's cat as they fight their way through a murderous dungeon that exists as a form of entertainment for the rest of the galaxy.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]] started off as the story of a surgeon in a fantasy world, but now it's transformed into one of the best uplift fictions there is.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/paragon-of-destruction_12311119706248305][Paragon of Destruction]] is easily one the best cultivation novels out there. The story really starts getting good after the first arc ends (I got frustrated around chapter 30 and jumped to like 68?) and I haven't been able to put it down since. It follows a very standard shonen wish fulfillment power fantasy, but it does it well. The story has a cool magic/cultivation system, well put together world building and is quite well written.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]] is hilarious story of a thief helping a dragon navigate a world with litrpg mechanics in a goal to make the most gold possible. Fun in small bit sized bits. Can get repetitive if you binge through it in one sitting.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293][Ave Xie Rem Y]] is a fantastic story that follows a boy who wants to be a doctor in a world of cultivation. The standard xanxia tropes exist, but they're shown in contrast to the mc who's a breath of fresh air in this genre.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.10534/][Going Native]] is a DBZ/DC fanfiction where the mc is a reincarnated individual born as the younger brother of Vegeta. They're drafted into the Saiyan army and commit atrocities in Frieza's name. It's an interesting story that does a good job of melding DBZ and DC. It's gotten a bit boring as of now and I'm mostly waiting to see how the story will look once the mc goes to earth.

*** I've spent this past week binging a large portion of /A Rabbit among Wolves/' writer's (Coeur Al'Aran) works, and I have to say that a lot of them are good and even reasonably rational.

In particular, /Forged Destiny/ is the same type of rational-esque LitRPG as Delve, with a great premise and outstanding execution. It managed to run 1.1M words (being actually a complete series of 9 books) without running out of steam or becoming repetitive, staying gripping throughout. It's good enough and divorced enough from the RWBY setting to stand alone without any knowledge of the original show (which I myself haven't watched, but have picked up the general gist of from other RWBY fic).

Honorable mention is /Relic of the Future/, which is a Peggy Sue and therefore arguably rationalist by default by letting the protagonist preempt practically all idiot balls by foreknowledge, though it puts a twist on things by throwing Jaune so far back in time that the majority of the fic is pre-canon.

Lots of the others were also good, but not particularly rational. Many are guilty-pleasure types, self-indulgent, leaning heavily into tropes like the grimdark antihero/sympathetic villain (Null), angsty backstories (A Hunter or Something), identity porn (White Sheep, Forged Destiny), overpowered protagonists (/White Sheep/, /Null/, /Relic of the Future/, /Not this time, Fate/)... but always keeping it just grounded enough with reasonable stakes and challenges so as to not let it become actively cringey. The author is good at writing those viscerally satisfying moments---foreshadowed twists, important reveals, vicious beatdowns, things that /should/ feel like fanservice and powerwank but are well-written enough to /not/.

More importantly, it's all technically proficient with the exception of their earlier works, and even those improve quickly. (/Not this time, Fate/ starts with mediocre prose and an inability to properly punctuate dialogue, but ends its 600K-word run with basically novel-quality writing.) All in all, it was a pleasant way to spend a week's worth of commute, and /I'm not even done/, because holy shit, this person has been churning out fiction on a regular schedule since 2015 and they're /not stopping/.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]] Very innocent likeable MC has lots of bad things happen to them and has to figure everything out starting off not knowing anything. Slow burn. Prolific update rate. Semi-rationalist leanings as the MC figures out the world, although it's not competence porn - lots of mistakes.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun][Cinnamon Bun]] Isekai where the main character is very enthusiastic and naive. Has been described here as 'reasonableness porn'. MC tries to solve things with hugs where possible, but accepts that this isn't quite /always/ possible.

The author, [[https://www.royalroad.com/profile/147338/fictions][RavensDagger]] has a number of works on RR and his own following. They're fun, and I enjoy them, but also not what I'd call rational in general.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32617/solomons-crucible][Solomon's Crucible]]. System apocalypse. System tech trees include modern weapons, which the MC picks up. Popcorn fic. Enjoyable.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] - (NSFW, Explicit) Cooperative dungeon core story. MC gains power by doing magical experimentation, by gaining and supporting a +harem+ group of companions. Think dungeon core makes lasers and expands political influence + explicit scenes.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][Previous /r/rational Discussion]] - (NSFW, Explicit) Last updated Jan 2020, but I think worth mentioning since it's been so long since it came up in the sub - Also, I'm still binging. It's Rational Porn.

To borrow from [[/u/XxChronOblivionxX]] in the older thread:

#+begin_quote
  The thing that really stood out to me when I first started reading it was the depth of the MC's thoughts about the true implications of a power like this. The EroGamer power, as it's manual describes, has this casual and fundamental control over literally everything. History is rewritten, personalities shift and change, all to serve Cindy's little Erogame experience, and this is not lost on Cindy. It's surprisingly hard to describe this in detail, but people not shy about erotic fiction should absolutely give this a look just for that part.

**** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst][Ar'Kendrythist]] is a fantastic litrpg, with a social worker dad and his daughter getting isekai'd into a world with a system. Like Delve, it takes a deeper look at how a system would affect the world (logistics, warfare, politics, etc.). The system is very different from Delve though, it's more mystical and less "crunchy," but there is nonetheless a good exploration of how and why the system came to be. The worldbuilding and characters are really good. Highly recommend. Updates about 10k-15k words per week.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realms: Monsters and Legends]] is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. Like its name, the story happens on an infinite plane (think minecraft world), following two main characters and some side characters (and the occasional interlude). Very competently done. The characters are good and 3 dimensional, even the side characters. The power system is interesting, and the main characters are very interesting. At the start one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but starting from volume 2 the other character is getting development. Updates 3 times a week with around 4k-5k word chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge][Brockton's Celestial Forge]] is a worm tinker OC story with an SI being the passenger. The main point of view is the OC, who gets vague directions from his passenger which sometimes ends up screwing him over. The tinker power is basically Inspired Inventor lite, so it quickly gets very powerful (the consequences of which we're only starting to see). The characters are pretty well done and face actual consequences from their actions (even the protagonist). The tech jargon gets a bit much sometimes but the latest few chapters have been good. Updates once a week, ~10k words.

The MC is a self-insert into an original character, a 12-year-old boy who is sent to live with the Heberts. He is a Tinker who can access technologies from different fictional universes.

It's been fairly popular (for a quest) and spawned at least 3 other fics which used similar rules. Personally, I thought that the idea was cute, but the execution left me lukewarm at best.

**** Hah. I haven't gone back to Erogamer in a while, mostly because I became more aware of Cindy's horrifying lack of caution, especially when that one boyfriend talks about how his extremely conservative grandfather would use it, how he would test and test and test and never do anything that hasn't been verified to not go horribly wrong. Contrast to Cindy, who explains why fat people's consent doesn't matter when it comes to forcibly making them beautiful. It just started making me anxious, which admittedly isn't terribly difficult and probably isn't indicitive of most people, but Cindy is far from the ideal person to hold the reigns for the universe.

***** Perhaps someone who is up to date can comment, as I'm still only 30% through the story.

I haven't been turned off by the existential horror yet, but hey, maybe the Erogame just pre-emptively found just the right people in just the right situations such that it only had to nudge them and nothing has been rewritten and continuity has not been revised and [minor]the houses just happened to have been arranged for high heeled jumping before Cindy tried that run! The bushes too!

Otherwise I'll come back here and retroactively edit once I'm deeper into the fic.

*** Bit of a tangent, but it seems like every Rwby fic that gets recced here has Jaune as a protagonist? Why is that? I get that he has a disproportionately high amount of screentime in the show, but that's generally seen as one of its (many) /weaknesses/

**** There's a couple reasons.

- One of the obvious ones is that Jaune is a blank slate for authors. His portrayal on the show is is very meh while at the same time his backstory is fairly interesting. It offers a fanfiction author a lot to play with.

- Another is that many, if not most RWBY fics, like most fanfiction in general, are shipping fics. They tend to focus on the relationships more than the plot, For whatever reason, Jaune fics might have ships, but they're usually not the focus.

- Another is because of just how big an influence the author Coeur Al'Aran has had on the fanfiction scene in general. His works are extremely popular and he tends to use Juane as his go to MC which has inspired many others to write fanfiction like him. Like for example, I only got into RWBY b/c of his fanfiction and I'm pretty sure this is the same situation for many people.

- My last point one is more speculation than anything, but imo I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] tends to prefer stories written by male authors and male authors tend to write male MC's more often. I haven't checked, but from what I've seen, even the sotries with female MC's that get recommended on here are more often than not, written by male authors.

The best I can recommend that are similar in a broad strokes way are Paragon of Destruction (I recommend reading the first few chapters and then jumping directly to the end of arc 1. The quality is very mediocre in the first arc and picks up significantly at the start of the second. There's a summary chapter at the end of arc 1.)

**** I just read it and it's okay but at best vaguely rational. The MC is portrayed as smart but the character motivations, behavior, the plot, and the world building aren't consistent or sensible a lot of the time.

Way too overly complicated, unrealistic and frankly stupid plots are common. The MC who is portrayed as very smart and safe and afraid of death takes unneeded big risks constantly. Characters that the author has decided are important luck out page after page despite being repeatedly set up for likely death. Level 50 is extremely high yet even at the highest levels you get 3 levels per feat/fight. It's fun but no, I would not say it is all that rational.

I always found it strange that the Buddhist idea of meditating to eliminate the illusion of self and to relinquish all earthly attachments in order ascend to the next level of existence is twisted into xianxia's avericious, nihilistic, amoral race for ultimate power. Fodder for a humanities thesis.

*** At the beginning, it was all Chinese novels, web or otherwise. I don't have much knowledge about the popularity of xianxia in China.

Translation of Chinese novels to English began with wuxia (cultivation+martial arts) but it was a niche community, much like how anime was niche. I only got into it when the community branched more into xianxia (seeking immortality) and xianhuan (cultivation+fantasy), and around then it got a lot more popular. I was introduced with Coiling Dragon on [[https://wuxiaworld.com][wuxiaworld.com]] around 2015, and from what I've heard a lot of others were the same.

I agree with [[/u/CreationBlues][u/CreationBlues]] that English-written xianxia has since melded with Gamelit to an extent.

I started off by reading Tale of Demons and Gods' manhua on Batoto, got impatient for new chapters, and ended up finding the novel on Wuxia World which was further ahead. Qidian, Gravity Tales, Wuxia World, and Novel Updates helped make xianxia more available to the public.

*** I'm not sure. I think it's kinda a slow boil thing. Basically, xianxia starts as shitty translated webnovels, which started a while ago. They're aggressively bad, so they don't get a lot of mainstream interest. However, the ideas influence people, and more and more works are translated at (minorly) better english. Gamelit starts breeding with xianxia, which are written just as bad as the translation novels are but from actual english writers. Keep in mind, the entire time most works aren't disappearing, if they're good they stick around and people keep reading them.

Savage Divinity might be the first popular xianxia webnovel? It's written competently enough, and it has clear influence on it's system from xianxia. Asian aesthetic, tiers of practitioners, single unifying energy currency, body reinforcement, meditation, spirit weapons, etc. etc. etc. It's a lot lower power than traditional xianxia, but it's basically the same stories and systems.

The blurb on the cover describes the plot as "lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space" and honestly the only thing that description is missing is some truly atrocious puns along the way. It has a dark souls-esque aesthetic in which everything seems to be the decaying remains of a greater world. It also has some apotheotic themes which I suspect people in this community would enjoy.

My only complaint is that either the author or I am wildly incorrect in our understanding of how colons should be used.

Make a world where rulers are necromancers, extrapolate how society and customs would work given that, give the magic system some depth and utility, add some likable characters with a somewhat alien culture that has different views on death and you'd have a very good story in your hands.

On a mechanical level there is quite a bit of improbable encounters that both favor and hinder the protagonist.

Probably the most famous RWBY fic. Jaune awakens one day with the powers of a gamer. Great fic with lots of cool plot developments and worldbuilding. Diverges heavily from canon almost immediately as when it was written not much of RWBY had actually yet been made.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11822902/1/Not-this-time-Fate][Not this time, Fate]]

#+begin_quote
  When Jaune woke up back in his house with his sisters and family, all he could do was sigh. Every time he died he was forced to start over again, and this was what... the one thousandth time? More? If it doesn't matter how hard he tries, doesn't matter how much he fights. Then maybe it's time to just kick back and enjoy himself. Fate can find someone else to be its whipping boy.

One of many stories from Coeur Al'Aran and in my opinion his best. If you really want RWBY fanfics he has written several, and they are all competently written. I do think his quality goes down with later stories though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157764/1/Rush][Rush]] is another great White Rose romance story by the same author but is significantly less heavy than What Defines Us.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/1/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity][An Exercise in Stupidity]] is a Gamer SI fic, with the usual powerwank, but the protagonist is actually pretty fun to read. He goes full juggernaut, with high health and strength. His attitude is like that too, just butting head-on into danger and out of danger. His luck and intelligence stats are also 1, which should tell you a lot. He's not actually dumb, but let's just say he's a very impulsive guy. Pretty AU, but with some interesting developments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is also by Coeur Al'aran. Probably my favorite work of his. It's pretty much original, with characters from rwby. Takes place in a gamelit world where people are born into classes, which are divided into castes. From the point of view of Jaune, who was born a Blacksmith, but one day found an item that changed his class appearance into Knight. Of course, he goes into Beacon, the academy for training Hero caste (combat classes mainly) people to do quests. It's pretty good, although I found the last part a bit slow and formulaic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12909945/1/Professor-Arc-Student-of-Vacuo][Professor Arc: Student of Vacuo]] is a fanfiction of a fanfiction. Takes the premise of Professor Arc, one of Coeur's works, and makes Jaune's backstory real. He actually becomes a student of Vacuo, and then becomes a legit professor in Beacon. I remember it being pretty enjoyable, at least more so than Professor Arc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097232/1/Nevermore-Sweetling][Nevermore, Sweetling]] is a Lovecraft crossover, kinda. Follows Qrow Branwen, who takes care of cultists and dark rituals. I haven't read all of it, but it was pretty enjoyable. Funny too. Kinda like Dresden Files: RWBY edition.

With his profound wisdom, battle and life experiences, he seeks to overcome his foes with skill and wit! Ruthless and amoral, he has no need to hold back as he pursues his ultimate goals. In a world of cruelty where one cultivates using Gu -- magical creatures of the world -- Fang Yuan must rise up above all with his own power.

This has been a really cool litrpg with interesting applications of basics of science in a magic world, with a bunch of moral quandaries mixed in. A slow start in the first couple of chapters that rapidly ramps up with the character's power and access to the world.

****** Yes, children swallow whatever propaganda is fed to them and I would no less blame an american child from admiring the CIA than I would a german child in the 30's from wanting to join the hitler jugend. But the author is presumably an adult, in which case lionizing the CIA betrays either ignorance or endorsement of evil.

I say this as a citizen of a country that suffered for decades under a military dictatorship whose coup on a democratically elected government wasn't just aided by the CIA, it was instigated by it, and whose new regime's torturers and political suppressors were trained and indoctrinated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation][on US soil by it]]. The US president at the time even committed to an outright military aid(i.e. an invasion) if there was any pushback in order to reassure the conspirators, which luckily there wasn't. Regardless, the result was thousands killed and tortured, neutered and stillborn democratic institutions, and considerable economic and cultural development set backs.

The funny part is that because the CIA sowed so much chaos and caused so death, disorder and misery on false intelligence and harebrained analysis throughout the entire world that the above paragraph *does not narrow down which country I'm speaking of at all*. It could be indonesia, where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366][millions were abducted and secretly killed]], and their families didn't know for sure for decades. It could be Chile where the tens of thousands of political prisoners were tortured or killed, or a dozen other countries in central and south america, in africa or asia. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, there's no knowing how much shit they got up to that we'll never even find out.

In closing, if there's any justice one day admiring the CIA is going to be regarded by the wider public as only slightly better than admiring the NKVD or the SS. For many people that's already the case.

And therein lies your flaw: "lionizing the CIA" never actually happens. It's just a character detail, which you would know if you had actually read anything instead of instantly dismissing it. A detail which fits the character's personality and motivations. It is, after all, an isekai lit-rpg, and not a spy story or some other type of CIA based fiction.

I thought that the whole "I'm going into the CIA, and that's that" business at the beginning of Chapter 1 was pretty good. It provided a plausible reason for a 22-year-old college graduate to be "bodyguard certified and boot camp trained" and to be familiar with a couple of languages. It also introduced her insecurities:

#+begin_quote
  She added, half whispered, “If they'll have me.”
#+end_quote

(I am not qualified to judge whether this type of conversation between a new CIA intern and her father would have been considered a security breach in 2019. My guess is that it wouldn't have been a problem if she had been an analyst, but she apparently wanted to be a field agent, which is more problematic.)

Unfortunately, the rest of Chapter 1 -- the writing, the characters, the dialog -- didn't work for me, so I set it aside before the LitRPG part could really kick in. Perhaps I'll give it another try at a later point.

*** I'll second the recommendation. It's not /that/ rational, the protagonist becomes really powerful pretty quickly and receives some questionable powerups from dubious magicking. But overall it's a solid story all around. The worldbuilding is really well done, with an interesting and vibrant world with rich history. The system is really interesting too, but on a more mystical level than the math behind it. The characters are good, with most people being well rounded in flaws and qualities.

As for the quick powerups, it turns out later on that while the protagonist is technically powerful and an accomplished mage, he's pretty weak compared to his peers. He works to round out his flaws of course, and later on his power base is significantly more connection based than just raw power, as in his status allows him to make friends with powerful people.

The one part that irks me a bit is that Erick's success at magic overshadows his daughter's practical experience and min-max mindset. It's sorta explained in one chapter by "the mana loves Erick," but we're still waiting for a better answer to that. Besides, Erick is a terrible combatant, which I feel balances out his powerful magics.

My personal favourites: (descriptions from tvtropes or webcomic sites, with edits by me)

[[https://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1][Paranatural]] - is a comedy/action comic about a group of superpowered middle schoolers fighting evil spirits and investigating paranormal activity in their hometown. The art becomes full colour and VERY AWESOME in a few pages, please give it until that long. I love this one very much

[[https://www.daughterofthelilies.com/dotl/part-1-a-girl-with-no-face][Daughter of the Lilies]] - is a fantasy/ adventure comic. Thistle is a hooded combat mage on the run from her past. She's hired on by an Orc mercenary named Orrig to work with him and his rather fractious employees. The comic follows her adventures

[[https://blindsprings.com/comic/blindsprings-cover-book-one][Blindsprings]] - is a storytale/fantasy/adventure/mystery comic. Princess Tamaura survived a revolution by making a seemingly Faustian deal with mysterious, masked spirits. Pledged to them for 300 years, Tammy is about to fulfill her pact when a young man finds her and decides that she is meant to be saved, whether she likes it or not. His "rescue" pulls Tamaura out of her timeless verdant sanctuary and into a world that has advanced without her ... where war is brewing over the same magic that flows through her veins. How will her return change this new world?

[[https://www.farnorthcomic.com/comic/don39t-tell][Far to the north]] -   is a Fantasy comic. Far to the North follows Kelu as she runs to the monsters of her remote mountain home when her family is captured by outsiders.

The same writer also has [[https://www.tigressqueen.com/comic/page-0001][Tigress Queen]], which is fantasy/adventure. The tribal nation of Zizumbir has been fending off settlers from the Jaezian Empire to their north for generations. Kizarasunga, the current warlord of the South, has been invited to meet directly with the Jaezian Emperor to finally put an end to the bloodshed. The catch to the Emperor's plan for peace is that it requires a marriage alliance that no one is exactly keen on.

[[https://www.clockwork-comic.com/comic/page-1][Clockwork]] - is fantasy/ mystery. Cog Kleinschmidt works happily as an artisan within the stronghold of the world's leading empire, Mercia Fortress. He finds his life taking a screeching turn upon the arrival of a diplomat from the enemy Kingdom of Arcadia, who needs something from Cog - whether he agrees or not! Cog soon finds himself trapped in the faraway Kingdom of Arcadia - an aristocratic haven with rich history and even richer tastes. However, Arcadia heaves with creepy undertones and conspiracies, but the citizens seem willfully ignorant of the bizarre events going on under their noses. Cog finds himself getting pulled further into Arcadia's paranormal side, and decides the only way out is to solve the kingdom's mysteries himself - with any help he can get from Arcadia's stepford-like residents!
