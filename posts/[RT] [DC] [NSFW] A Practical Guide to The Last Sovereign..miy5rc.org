** u/ArisKatsaris:
#+begin_quote
  Use them all and save often, there's no autosave in the game!
#+end_quote

There is an autosave, the 100th slot is an autosave slot, saving at each new screen.

That having been said it won't be enough -- it'll suffice if you messed up a fight, but not for bigger strategic failures like misusing funds, failing to blackmail an official, or whatever.

It's a LONG game, and you'll sometimes feel like redoing an entire chapter if you got a suboptimal result, so what I recommend is using the 50 first slots or so at the beginning (or before the end) of each chapter/major story bit and *keeping* those saves indefinitely, and using the other 50 slots to save near constantly, or for alternate/experimental decision paths, etc

** Oh, I think I tried this a few years ago when it was still unfinished. Gotta be the same game with that combination of porn and the initial twist. The length was a huge problem then, I think I hit the end of the current game like two hours in. It definitely had enough promise even early on for it that I'll have to revisit it.

*** I tried it a few years ago too and got 12+ hours in without hitting the end, and it was text-only with no images in the scenes until like a yearish ago? You might be thinking of something else

** EDIT: I sit corrected. There's an autosave slot that does exactly what I'd expect, it just happens to be at the /bottom/ of the list of 100 save slots. +If anyone decides to give this game a try, I would want to point out that all saving is manual. I was having some fun, at least as much as with Final Fantasy games, for a few hours before I died and decided I would rather given up than start over and replay all the intro stuff again.+

**** That advice is not sufficient, because it could just as easily be describing a game with checkpoints or autosaves but where it's also advisable to save immediately before important and/or risky decisions.

I am astounded the game doesn't do checkpoint saves when moving between... whatever the term is for the story scenes within a chapter.

***** True, I'll add a line about that.

If you ever do decide try it again, one thing that might help is knowing that the majority of playtime is probably taken up by dialogue anyway. Just set it to Fast and spam A, and you can probably get through each hour of gameplay in like 1/3 of the time.

** Yup, having now played through the first and part of the second chapters of this, it's *great*. Fantastic dialogue and interesting worldbuilding, and a main character that really makes sense to me. I'm super into it.

Caveats:

1) The thing where XP is a finite resource means that it's very, very easy to accidentally get into an unwinnable state, typically signaled by a mandatory boss that you clearly have no hope of fighting. I got around this via, ah, vigorous cheating with save editors. This made me realize that grinding in most JRPGs is actually an important usability feature allowing players to implicitly tune the difficulty of the game to desired levels (since more time spent grinding=lower difficulty).

2) There are a lot of places where extremely important mechanics are just straight-up not explained to the player. I kinda regret not starting to read the walkthrough prior to getting midway through chapter 2, since I've missed a couple of story arcs and investment opportunities already by not noticing these mechanics existed.

*** Glad you've been enjoying it! Yeah, more and more I've been thinking that the "finite amount of enemies" mechanic has its own set of problems. It's a better system in most cases than infinite enemies, I think, but for people /trained/ in an RPG environment where grinding is the norm, the ability to skip enemies is just too attractive, and people end up skipping too many enemies without realizing how underpowered they'll end up being. For cheating, I definitely think it's a good idea if combat is what's keeping people from enjoying the story; just be careful of these particular anti-cheat measures!

[[https://thelastsovereign.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheating]]

As for missing stuff... yeah, I went back and forth on advising people to use a walkthrough, and feel like I should have emphasized it even more. I think most people, myself included, would prefer to play through games blind first, but this game is /exceedingly/ complicated compared to most games, and my read of things is that there's no way to really "explain" some of the mechanics without breaking immersion... particularly thinking of the time where how many places you travel to influences how much time has passed. But doing that at the same time when two characters can be recruited, making them permanently missable if you go straight for the goal but also costing you a lot of benefits if you don't know exactly where to go to get them and then move on, feels like a bad design choice that makes it more likely people are going to regret actions they take without any way to feel informed ahead of time.
