** Honestly, I think interest might ramp back now.

** I didn't post a link on fanfiction.net for the last update as I noticed there isn't as much enthusiasm for this story, so there are two new chapters up this time around. Just follow the link and it'll take you right to the first one.

Btw, I realize there's probably quite a few people who'd rather I update NTBS, so I'll be doing my best to get back into the flow of that as well. Writing/editing two stories at once proved to be a little trickier than I had hoped...

*** I have no interest in the source material and love your story to pieces, if that helps to reinforce in your mind the idea that people can separate the source from the fanfic. I enjoy reading this story quite a lot. I believe the sequel's â€˜growing pains' in terms of readership would not have been so apparent if Scar continued to be the protagonist throughout but then we'd miss this reveal that he's been working behind the scenes the entire time. Thank you for the time and effort you put into this story.

**** Thanks! Yeah, it's probably a mix of factors, with sequels always being less popular etc. as well as Scar lending a different mood to the story than this one, which is ultimately based on a children's cartoon after all. But in general, I'm guessing it's mostly a case of there not being a 'hook' to pull the reader into the story and really care about the characters. The original had Scar's villain appeal and The Lion King nostalgia: This one has neither.

I'm also wondering how many of the downvotes this story is getting is just from people who want me to write NTBS instead, as opposed to people who just don't care for it. :P

*** What

You mean I could have been reading this earlier?

It's a good story. And a small subreddit, which suffers from too little content. There's no reason not to post updates when they come!
