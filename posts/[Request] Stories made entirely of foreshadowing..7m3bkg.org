One of my favorite compliments I ever got on HPMOR was "This story is made entirely of foreshadowing."

What work that you've read, if any, stands out in your mind as having the second-highest level of this quantity?

More precisely, after HPMOR, what work has the greatest quantity of sentences that appear different on a second read? I'm not looking for a single big startling reveal like "Ohmygosh Alice was a traitor this whole time!", I'm asking about the density of sentences that read in a different light once you finish the book and know that Alice was a traitor, there never was a Ring of Meringue, and Bob was just three garden gnomes in a tall coat.

These changed readings will manifest from differently-appearing ideas and plot events, but I ask about the sentence level rather than the idea level so as to look for how much of the reading experience changes on a second read.

This is one of my favorite literary things ever, but you probably guessed that already.

EDIT: Also, not a written word story, but Vertigo is my favorite movie of all time and I think the single best example of this.

***** I don't believe so. The "Chapter 1" thing is just a function of the website. If you open any story on this website, it will say

#+begin_quote
  "Chapter 1: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author)
#+end_quote

And all subsequent chapters will be "Chapter x: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author).

I simply found amusement in that the first chapter of the book was named Chapter 3. This amusement could have also been experienced had I opened a brand new book and found "Chapter 3" as the title of the first chapter, even without explicit text stating which chapter it is supposed to be. Because of course it's supposed to be the first one.

This story does not rely on knowing the exact number of which chapter you are reading. It also does not take advantage of any of the website's functions, such as author's notes. I believe any alternate versions will be completely fine.

Reading Umineko a second time is like a completely different story.

I really like HPMOR, but regarding this quality, I think these stories outdo HPMOR.

The Higurashi anime adaptation is fine, but the anime adaptation of Umineko is terrible (critical pieces of information are left out, it feels extremely rushed compared to the original novel, and it stops before the 5th story arc which is one of the best parts).

So watch Higurashi and then read the Umineko visual novel (there's an English translation available online). I think you'd enjoy them Eliezer.

This story displays many examples of elegant and subtle foreshadowing and re-watching it is an entirely different experience.

**** Umineko, thirded. I suspect that a large part of that is inherited from the mystery novel genre itself (or in Japanese, 'suiri shousetsu'/'deduction novel'), it was actually my introduction to the line between stories like Sherlock Holmes novels, which show a detective pulling answers out of a hat, and stories like Agatha Christie novels, where the reader is challenged to pay attention to details, /especially/ the 'I am confused' moments, and trying to arrive at the truth before the grand reveal is made--I particularly enjoyed Umineko's meta-commentary about the trust between the author and reader (the trust that the reader will try to solve the mystery, the trust that the mystery can be solved), the mentioning of Knox's Commandments and Dine's Rules, et cetera. After Umineko, I began reading library-held mystery novels, gradually getting used to certain tricks, delighted when I missed something and later kicked myself over not realising its significance.

In any case, yes! Umineko was particularly delicious, in many ways, and the Higurashi/Umineko Question/Answer arcs' division is delightful.

(That would indeed be fun, if Yudkowsky were somehow in a spoiler-free box, keeping a diary of notes/impressions and thoughts about Umineko as he read through (challenged) all of it...)

****** See rotflol's comment about which is better. For the biggest 'answer' scene, I seem to remember that the manga gives a little more explicit information (about what was done how), as extra explanation for still-confused people (since published chronologically after the VN, I think), but overall I strongly recommend the VN.

I liked the animation, but for pleasure (at seeing and hearing it) rather than for challenging, so would recommend only watching it after finishing the first 4 episodes of the VN. I might be tempted to suggest watching it after all 8, as a reminder of all that happened, but going through the VN original episodes after finishing has much more in terms of thoughts and conversations to be reminded about...

To read, both the game (episodes 1-4 and 5-8 grouped) and the English patch (likewise) are needed (unless you can read a lot of Japanese very quickly and smoothly, otherwise the longer sections drag on), from separate sources. The patch should be here: [[http://witch-hunt.com/stage.html]] .

Other than a small number of low-importance selections in Episode 8, there are no choices--you read it through as though it were a book, screen by screen, though you can also (once available) review character information et cetera in a separate screen.

Important: The background music tracks are wonderful/evocative, and Umineko has at times been referred to as a 'sound novel' rather than a 'visual novel'. The combinations of different tracks with different scenes, and the changes from one to another as the emotions in play shift, add an extra dimension which would be muted (in all senses) if one were to read through without sound. In conclusion, if you read through the VN then definitely use sound!

Summary from what I can remember of the starting process: Get the games, get the patches, install the games (where desired), install the patches (according to instructions, should end up in the same folders?), run the desired patch executable. Running the gmae executable would run the Japanese-version game, with its own savefiles (stored/accessed separately from the patch's savefiles). From the title screen, choose to play and select the episodes (and in-between sections, I think) in order as you view them.

Each section/episode should be 'unlocked' once the previous is completed, and when a future section is unlocked a prior section allows skipping to set points within it upon a fresh start, like chapter beginnings. (Not as convenient to use as it might be.) Unlocking also changes the background image for the title screen. If reinstalling or installing on a fresh computer, it should be possible to manually unlock sections to match what had been unlocked by readthrough.

******** Thus the importance of reading in one's native language so as to be able to quickly process the less-dramatic bits... *guilty sympathy*

Thinking more on this, I should warn that the first as-a-character appearance of a witch is at the very end of the first episode (at the border between the first episode and the short section right after it?), with the second episode being the first one with the establishing of the dramatic truth-interrogating questioning.

The first episode has the introduction of all characters, and if I understand correctly (at least in the Japanese original?) deduction of certain mysteries is possible even with only that first episode, though the further episodes of course help (and are enjoyably dramatic).

If you feel as though you're in danger of shelving it if you don't have someone encouragingly pushing your back, you can tell me where you are in the game and I can try to encourage you about how much is left before someone dies. (That said, my own memories of game 1 have already gotten very fuzzy.)

********** (Second edit: Copied from this message's final paragraph: --I've talked too much. Summarised reply (Fourth edit: 'Regarding the timescale'): [[#s][]] *cheering-on encouragement*)

Is the 64 hours for Episode(/Game) 1, or for the entire 'Question Arcs' game(/program) which incudes episodes/games 1-4? Plus the time for the in-between sections, 10 hours for a single game sort of fits (keeping in mind that later games might have more fun parts..?), and intuitively feels as though it fits more with my own impression, though dependent on reading speed.

My native language is English.

Trying not to give any spoilers, why do you suspect George? *curiosity, while thinking back on own impressions at the time* ([[#s][]]?)

If I remember correctly (Third edit: 'regarding the timescale', the next two spoiler tags), [[#s][]]

Let's see... my initial impression is to recommend that you at least complete the first two games (and their after-sections) before deciding whether you're finding it interesting enough to continue. [[#s][]] can be taken as a barometer of whether the fiction is worth continuing to you.

In /Mother of Learning/, a lot of the foreshadowing just bogs down the movement of the early chapters, because it's totally irrelevant to that movement. Telling the reader "hey, this is going to be important later" seems really inelegant to me. This is in contrast to something like HPMOR, where a solution to a conflict early in the story serves as foreshadowing of a solution to a different conflict later in the story, or where lessons taught to a character include clues that get used later in the plot.

You've basically just described Worm in three sentences.

The world is fundamentally built on deception and secrecy. The protagonist is as much a newcomer to this world as any first-time reader. At first glance, the setting seems to be filled with tropes and ideas that are culturally familiar to the reader, and this familiarity lets the author subvert expectation in creative and interesting ways.

Characters introduced early on are more fully explored later, often in ways that radically recontextualize past actions and behaviors.

Okay. Working from memory to find examples of these, but here are things I think are recontextualized on a reread.

*Any scene with Sophia in it*

In example, the confrontation with Emma and Shadow Stalker at the mall in 5.3. On a blind read through, Stalker comes across as a tough but fair hero motivated by a concern for public welfare.

With context, the dramatic irony in this scene transforms it into something farcical. Stalker knows about Taylor and her history with Emma. She is motivated by helping Emma, and is intentionally trying to put Taylor in the most negative light possible.

The meaning behind all of Shadow Stalker's actions is recontextualized, making the scene feel fresh on a reread.

#+begin_quote
  Emma looked up at me, eyes wide, mouth open, one hand to the side of her face. I was as shocked at what I'd done as she was. Not that I felt /bad/. A large part of me wanted to laugh in her face. /Weren't expecting that? Miscalculated how I'd react?/

  Hands seized me with an iron grip and spun me around. Shadow Stalker. She interposed herself between me and Emma. Dark brown eyes glowered at me from behind her mask.

  [...]

  Shadow Stalker scolded him, “This is /not/ the time or place for arguments. If your daughter is this... unwell, then that's /your/ responsibility.”
#+end_quote

Shadow Stalker knows why Taylor hit Emma.

It has nothing to do with Taylor's concussion, but Stalker is playing along.

  I felt like laughing. Part of it was just being giddy at doing something to get back at Emma. The other part was that this whole scenario was so ridiculously upside-down. Shadow Stalker wasn't really anything special. She was just a /teenage girl/, lecturing my dad, an adult. The crowd that was watching was seeing Emma as the victim, me as the bad guy. *But if you stripped away the costume, if everyone knew the real story, this would all be playing out so differently.*

(Bolded emphasis mine) Taylor is more right than she knows.

This is a blatantly intentional author nod, when you have context.

#+begin_quote
  I pointed at Emma, turned to my dad, “You want to know why I hit her?”

  Shadow Stalker put one hand on the side of my face, forced me to look at her, stopping me from talking in the process. “No. I'm stopping this right here. No arguments, no excuses as to why you just assaulted someone. We're breaking this up now. Turn around.”

  “What?” I half-laughed, incredulous, “Why?”
#+end_quote

This can be read as the actions of an overworked Hero trying to immediately deescalate the situation, or as an attempt by Sophia to publicly humiliate Taylor.

#+begin_quote
  Shadow Stalker bound my wrists with what I guessed was a plastic wrist-tie. Too tight. Then she turned to my dad, and her voice was hushed. “Look at this crowd. These people. They're /scared/. A place like this, with this much suppressed panic, fear and worry, this many people close together? *I don't care if your daughter is an idiot or just ill.* She's proven to be volatile in a powder-keg situation. *It's both dangerous and /stupid/ to have her here.* You can cut off the plasti-cuffs when she's separated from anyone she might harm.”
#+end_quote

The verbal insults and put-downs are so /clearly/ in line with Sophia's character, but I don't think most people would ever connect these dots without the later reveal.

#+begin_quote
  My dad nodded, embarrassed. I felt bad at that. I felt worse at being led off like a criminal, while Shadow Stalker gave Emma a hand to help her up. Emma was beaming, smiling one of the widest smiles I'd seen her give, despite the red mark on the side of her face. *Smiling as much at the way things had turned out, I imagined, as she was at getting the chance to talk with the concerned superheroine.*

***** Yes, Sophia is a good example. And you can find foreshadowing for a lot of things abut Taylor's character that aren't originally clear. I'm not saying there's no foreshadowed twists in Worm.

But large segments of the plot and characters are just played straight; you find out something new that fits previously shown snippets, but doesn't really /change/ what they mean. The reveal is foreshadowed, and a re-read makes you notice the foreshadowing, but - for me at least - it doesn't make me "read [the foreshadowing] in a different light"

** If you like anime, FLCL is something along these lines. it isn't foreshadowing so much as everything in it makes sense in a certain context, and you don't have enough of that context until the very end. the first time through it looks like chaos and noise, but a subsequent viewing ends up looking much different.

that said, it is still an anime, and if you aren't into anime in general then I do not think you will enjoy FLCL based on this particular quality alone.

** The Shadow of What Was Lost does this well as it re contextualizes everything after you read the ending.

Wheel of Time does this well but the story drags on a bit.

Discworld series is great at this because it foreshadows further into the future than it seems because character traits are brought up in further stories that impact how you can predict a character to behave in other novels.

The Necroscope series turns decidedly darker when you reread each triplet of books. It doesnt necessarily foreshadow specific plot points but character motivations.

The Ringworld series is great for this too.

** Hmm. I don't know. I feel like a good many stories have high levels of foreshadowing that go unnoticed. Tons of foreshadowing doesn't make itself clear without good analysis and many re-reads.

The less foreshadowing a story has the more random it will be. Readers pick up on narrative cues, and without them stories tend towards being incoherent. As rationalist stories put a huge premium on internal coherency, they might have more foreshadowing than the norm. However, I think the largest driver behind so many people posting rationalist stories here (and indeed, your post) is because there's a community of dedicated and attentive fans who discuss and analyze the heck out of every chapter of a given story.

If you search for "foreshadowing" in any academic database for literary criticism, you will see thousands of essays detailing the dense foreshadowing present in hundreds of different works. I suspect the reason many posters here see such dense foreshadowing in the stories they're posting (and HPMOR) is because they really enjoy and /care/ about those stories, and perhaps more importantly they're part of a community that helps them ferret out all those hidden instances of foreshadowing.

Hence my recommendation: most of the literary canon.

--------------

*Edit:*

In the interests of being a good sport, I'll go ahead and shill for Malazan Book of the Fallen once more. The little passages at the beginning of each chapter have /insane/ foreshadowing. Moreover the world is just so complex and multifaceted that off-hand comments about events in one part of the world will have huge plot ramifications thousands of pages later when the story shifts focus to that part of the world. It's really quite mind boggling how rich and detailed the world is, the only stuff I've ever encountered that come remotely close are Worm and maybe Tolkien.

Since one is tossed into a complex world mid-flow and with exposition severely lacking, it's often hard to tell what is foreshadowing and what is world building. To a much greater extent than really any story I can think of, it's really quite a puzzle to figure out the exact shape of the world and the forces at play in the narrative. There's really no one character that can deliver a succient explanation even if they wanted to, so much is lost to time and chaos. So much knowledge lost to entropy, that even the most knowledgable characters are not much aware of the forces shaping their world.

To me this is great, I find too much obvious foreshadowing somewhat annoying.
