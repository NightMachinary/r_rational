** Some flashback/backstory on Tian to flesh her and the Cultivation world out a little bit more. Also, hopefully the logic regarding why she wants to be immortal makes sense. It is very much inspired by this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8][CGP Grey]] video I watched when I was 17 years old, which I could never quite relate to. Personally, I would never want to be immortal. I wouldn't mind living a little longer. Just... not dying sounds troublesome to me. What happens if you go insane? Lose your mind? Or what if everyone you know just... dies?

It just sounds lonely, to me. But how would a culture that can /actually/ cure death react to it? Certainly not the same way I would. Hence, the logic I hopefully try to rationalize here.

*** I think you may have missed the main point of the video.

Growing up in a society where death has so far been inevitable, it's natural that we come up with rationalisation as to why death isn't so bad after all, even desirable.

But for each probleme which death gives a solution, death is the absolute worst solution! (Overpopulation? Just kill some of them... Bored? No probleme just die before you had the time to explore 0.1% of what there is... and my favorite: people i love might die, well i guess i really should also hurry up and die as well so i don't get lonely)

Don't take the status quo of how the world i for how the world should be.

**** No, no. I got the point of the video. I just can't relate to wanting to be immortal. I understand its message is not that. Hence, why I am able to use that video to help me rationalize Tiao's logic in this chappie.

*** I think you nailed it, fwiw; as someone who feels that death is the end of the universe and mortality is the literal worst because I /won't get to read any more books/, I feel a serious sympathy with Tian's position.

*** Sounds interesting, I'll check it out... after it has over 50k words.

Any reason you put the chapter before the title, though?

**** It was automatically formatted that way, so I didn't change it.

*** You could go insane, your friends and family could all die, etc. right now, and then you're left in a situation where you have ~60+ years to live on (at 17).

And obviously, if you figured out a way to cure your own horrible degenerative disease, you'd try and apply the cure to your family, loved ones, friends, and then just sell it to people.
