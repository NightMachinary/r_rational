Yea they have normal good moments, but the relationship is messed up because of it. Not to the pint either of them wants to sever it, but we've seen cat talk about her resenting it.

  The Grey Pilgrim. Not only could I not kill the old hero, as the consequence of that would be a nearly Callowan degree of spite, I had to get him to back the Accords.
#+end_quote

I love the fact that you can piss off a entire nation to a seething rage, and it will only amount to /nearly/ Callowan levels.

***** How I think it would go:

Masego makes a spell to lift his corner for him so he can read in peace. Indrani immediately let it go in favor of scratching her bum. Hakram holds half the weight by himself. There is a pillar of pure gold on wheels in place of Vivienne, which is nowhere to be seen.

Akua is, of course, ahead of everyone throwing flowers to make a path. The fact that those are funerary flowers is completely accidental, she assures Cat.

*** Eh. Outside that one time when the rioters got the legionaries on leave (until the Procerans fucked it up), average Callowan's spite seems directed mainly at the people who /aren't/ occupying their country.

** The dispute between Razin and Elvera happened more quickly than I expected, and ended more peacefully too. Though I doubt we've seen the last of it.

I wonder how EE handles those off-screen conflicts, if he considers what each character would do and basically writes a draft without publishing it, or if he just throws dice or something.

*** Ever since Indrani almost died in the Everdark due to Wonter going crazy, she's been put in situations where her formidable fighting prowess can't save her if things go south. This is psychologically very difficult for her to deal with. Cat wants to make her deal with it because it's best for her in the long run. This makes Imdrani angry, in addition to how being put in situations like that makes her feel.
