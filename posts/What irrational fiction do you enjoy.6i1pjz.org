***** I don't know if it's better /written/, but I certainly find it more /fun/. Even when it pulls a Deus Ex Machina it feels intentional for a pulpy story like this, it's supposed to be kind of goofy. The action, comedy, mystery, and chemistry between the characters are all hugely enjoyable and know exactly how serious to take itself. I love the occasional shout outs to the penny dreadful.

*** I'd have to think more about WoR, but is Mistborn really /ir/rational fiction? I think it hits most if not all the sub's descriptions of RF:

- Sanderson typically uses "hard" magic systems, aka ones with very clearly defined rules, and sticks with them throughout the series (even if the reader doesn't necessarily know all the rules at the beginning).
- Problem solving is done through intelligent application of resources, particularly in the first book (there's a lot of creative use of very specifically defined powers, such as the ability to mentally push against metals)
- Factions are driven into conflict by their beliefs/values - one of the main themes of the series is exploring what actually motivates the "heroes" and "villains", and as we progress through the series its shown that with greater perspective, people become more defined by their beliefs than by a black and white morality. Not to get too spoilery, but [[#s][series spoiler]]
- I'd have to go back and reread to confirm, but I can't remember any character actions that occurred just because 'the plot required it'; to my memory, they all occurred for very plausible reasons.

Just because it wasn't explicitly written as RF, doesn't mean it couldn't be considered as such.

** I'd be hard-pressed to name an enjoyable book that was true nonsense or without reason, but for /alternative/ sense and /alternative/ reason, the obvious classical recommendation would be Lewis Carroll, e.g. The Hunting of the Snark (read it aloud!). Lord Dunsany is also good for this.

Longer books that make alternative sense: /A Wizard of Earthsea/ by Ursula K. LeGuin, /One for the Morning Glory/ by John Barnes. Those continuities both have consistent alternative epistemology that's depicted as working inside them, but isn't rational epistemology, but isn't horribly annoying either. Some elements of that in Terry Pratchett too.

And this is after we're repeatedly told, not shown, that he's supposed to be some super-intelligent wonderboy. Quentin's character can be divided into two parts - how he acts, which is pretty much just 'whatever it takes to drive the plot', and how he feels, which is pretty much just 'depressed/horny/depressed' with occasional breaks for alcohol or drugs.

...in summary, I don't really like Quentin that much. He starts off as an interesting and flawed character, then wallows in those flaws for two books without improving much. Every time it looks like he's taken a step in the right direction, he just backslides.

That's an incredibly broad description. It covers pretty much every possible action he could take other than going back to not being a magician (which, incidentally, he /does/ do at one point). Is being a drug- and booze-fuelled party animal an escape from the real world? If he were really trying to escape from the real world, why not join Alice in magical research at that point?

Quentin doesn't ever properly plan, is seldom aware of what he's trying to achieve through his decisions, is very shortsighted, and generally doesn't come across as competent or smart in terms of how he steers the plot.

**** I'm one of (what feels like very few) people on reddit that actually loved the books. There's something about the characters that resonates with me; maybe their terribleness, maybe their very human weaknesses. They aren't absurdly fallible. The threads of magic woven in are hopeful. The lost years after college when these ridiculously fortunate souls are adrift in drugs and alcohol and stupid lowbrow dramatic shit when they should be /better/, could be /better/. Janet. Especially that moment when she tells Quentin about what happened in the desert. The writing is very pretty, which helps me sink into it.

It doesn't feel hopeless to me. Honestly. And they do change. Quentin particularly towards the very end. Alright, I'll agree that the first book is a bit /much/ on the emo shit but by the end of the series he's very nearly an adult. I know people like the characters in the book. Sad, angry, edgy, fortunate people who have the chance to go on magical adventures but keep fucking up despite everything. And maybe one day growing up. Grossman taps into something real for some of us while letting the magic thrive.

I can get how it's not everyone's cup of tea.

*** I actually got most of the way through a rational alternate ending for LeGuin's /The Farthest Shore/ (third book in the Earthsea series). I might see if I can finish it today, but here's the work in progress: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/117SC9zOYhLX4mkyK3RBVV5HB0uDEm0i1gaIzMoIpTyQ/edit?usp=sharing][The Path to the Farthest Shore]] (4,400 words at the moment). Spoilers for the book, obviously.

I loved the series when I was younger, but /The Farthest Shore/ really annoyed me when I recently reread it. Much of the dialogue before the perspective character (Arren, true name Lebannen) interjects is directly adapted from the book, including how Ged treats one of his closest friends.

My take on it hopefully doesn't require any background for the series, but it probably helps. I tried to rationalise the characters rather than the setting, because the setting's irrationality is part of its appeal.

** Quite enjoying Malazan Book of the Fallen. Here's the opening of the current chapter I'm on. No spoilers.

There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one's own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage along a foul, tortured path -- made foul and tortured by our own indifference -- is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come.

I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us -- each of us, my friends -- to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing -- all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve.

The Apocryphal Teachings of Tanno Spiritwalker Kimloc\\
The Decade in Ehrlitan

It's a pretty close articulation, if not perfect, of one of the major issues I have with an afterlife which I don't think very many people religious or otherwise even are aware of or accept.

Anyone who can memorize a few dozen words can be a doctor and a farmer, and in that sort of world there is no reason to charge for either service. If not for the intervention of the aforementioned "international system of governance" (intervention which may or may not be ultimately beneficial or necessary) a great deal of material suffering could be alleviated. So the stance of the characters is a possible rational stance given their information. Does the fact that Harry in HPMOR reaches the conclusion that the government of magical Britain ought to be overthrown make HPMOR an iconic work of fiction advocating for the overthrow of any real life government?

  Punch up.
#+end_quote

Holy fucksticks, let me address this before we do anything else. No, don't fucking "punch" up. Or to the side. Or down. Don't "punch" at all.

This concept that it's somehow okay to attack people physically for the crime of wrongthink is how you get the berkely riots, or the current fracas at Evergreen college, or the "bash a fash" mentality, or any of the other nonsense going on.

You're not helping anyone get better, just dragging others down into the dirt with you.

With that out of the way, let's discuss.

It's not that I dislike "social justice nuts", as you succinctly put it. My SO and I are fairly liberal (in the classic definition; in support of free speech, free thought, and all that horrible, horrible wrongthink nonsense) and left-leaning (we support things like UBI, single-payer healthcare, mental health treatment for criminals rather then incarceration, prison reform, etc). And yet, we hate the modern left and the social justice causes with a passion.

Which is weird, you'd think. On paper, we should be a perfect fit.

But the problem is that social justice activists seem to share you "punch up" mentality while attempting to dilute many complex social problems to as few centralized boogeymen as possible. Everything wrong is because of "misogyny", or the "patriarchy", or "white men", or in some crazy circles "men" in general. You can't be racist against white people, they say, because racism is "power + privilege" (which may be true in a vaccum of academia, but in realistic practice is horseshit; I can't wander into certain neighborhoods in my city because I'm the wrong color, and I'm white). The patriarchy is keeping women down with institutionalized misogyny, they say, ignoring the fact that the majority of college degrees are now earned by women, and the fact that, despite being from the same disenfranchised generation with few real prospects, there are initiatives that prioritize getting women into jobs (never dangerous jobs like welding or difficult jobs like garbage collecting, but jobs like managers, executives, etc) on the basis of sex alone, so that a checklist of "diversity" can be marked. Men are the cause of society's problems, they say. We gotta teach men not to rape, they say. I'm not even going to touch this one, it infuriates me so much.

There's no social outreach here. Everyone is either with you, or against you. You can see it very clearly in our recent election, where we were forced to choose between president Agent Orange (Trump) or president Shit Sandwich (Clinton). Despite the fact that both were terrible candidates (though I'll be the first to say that Clinton, while Terrible, was the Less Bad by far of the choices), there is a nasty culture war between both camps, and both camps hate each other. Neither tribe is willing to even attempt to understand the other.

The crux of our problems is in the fact that our economy and media is controlled by a few elites and conglomerate. That we have no prospects to escape a corporate dystopia future in a blighted and flooded world, that every bit of "race war" is just class conflict, and social justice activists want to fucking tear down those who they should be standing shoulder to shoulder with.

So, yes. I have some issues with socjus cancer infiltrating even what I considered, and I use this term with the irionic grimace of realizing whose terminology I'm borrowing, a safe space of rationality and meritocracy, not "muh feefees" and "socjus bash the fash whitey is da devul", to use a crass metaphor.

#+end_quote

Firstly, piss right the fuck off here, mate. No, I am not part of any goddamned group with "blood on their hands" because of my goddamned phenotype, something I have had zero input and zero fucking control over. I am a first generation immigrant, the son of a poor russian and a poor jew. We have seen exactly none of this magic "white pirivilege" that everyone espouses. We had to learn the language, adopt the cultures, and work our assess off to be considered americans. And we worked our goddamned asses off. My grandfather, before he died, became an aeronautics engineer at NASA. My father owns a string of stores, and my uncle is a senior network engineer at a large corporation. None of this shit was handed to us for our "whiteness".

As for "blood on our hands", fuck that "sins of the father, sins of the son" bullshit. I'm ethnically jewish by blood, and I don't give a rat's ass about the holocaust except so far as that it happened and we should work to prevent such a thing from happening to any group of people again. And let's not forget it wasn't just the jews who suffered and died there; the actual, real life nazis killed homosexuals, retards, and others. I have never, in my life, looked at a german and thought "you are part of a group that has blood on their hands", because they fucking don't. They were never part of the group that did it, they would never consider being part of the group that did it, and most of their current population wasn't even alive at the time.

So, kindly piss right the fuck off with that.

You godsforsaken loon. Slavery happened to EVERYONE. Segregation happened to EVERYONE. Lynchings happened to EVERYONE.

Police officers killing black people on the street? Hah. Fucking where, mate? Are you seriously trying to use the small number of newscast high-profile police killings (more then half of which were voted "not guilty" by a grand jury afterwards, but that's not interesting news when your intent is race baiting) of black males as evidence?

No. We definitely have massive issues with police accountability, but they fuck everyone over. We definitely have perception issues on the police forces of black americans, but that's the end result of a hell of a lot of shit (including on-the-job training and experience) that needs a major overhaul of poor american black culture AS WELL AS american police culture to even begin to be solved.

And, if you consider massive public outcry, riots (that destroyed the business of people completely ininvolved), and an endless media circus to be no repercussions, I don't know what to say to you.

As for "pay gap", there isn't one, not really. People who invented the pay gap to feed to war machine of the culture wars compared average incomes (which include billionaires and multi-millionaires) instead of median incomes, and failed to factor in job types, hours worked, and dificulty of work. surprisingly, when you account for everything, the pay gap shrinks to 1-3% at most, and economists who actually study such things argue endlessly about statistical drift.

#+begin_quote
  This is demonstrably false. Women want to be welders and garbage collectors just as much as men do; but both jobs are so heavily entrenched as man-professions and so much more based in tradition that it's slow and hard work.
#+end_quote

Oh, haha, thanks. I needed the laugh.

Oh, wait, you're serious.

Man, I'm laughing so much it hurts.

Mate, the reason these jobs are male dominated is because they require long, arduous hours, and jobs such as welding are dangerous as fuck. Women generally don't apply for them, because a desk job as an HR something or other doesn't occasionally explode or drop I-beams on you, nor does it require getting up at the crack of dawn to haul tons of literal garbage out of filthy cans into filthy trucks, and the desk jobs pay well enough. Men have to take them, because we're expected to provide in this country.

** I keep coming back to Doctor Who, though that may be childhood loyalty as much as anything. What I find in general is that I can stand scientific implausibility, and even self contradictory implausibility, and I can stand idiotic protagonists up to a point, but I can't stand protagonists who always fall through the same emotional flaws time after time after time, especially when ordinary people I know are capable of doing better. This is what ruined The Flash and Supernatural for me (as well as the whole 'literally Hell' deal in the latter)

*** I loved Doctor Who, but dropped out after the episode where the moon hatched and laid an egg of the same mass as the moon. I didn't like most of the Moffat era and that was the straw that broke the camel's back.

**** I hated that episode too and found nearly all of that season to be an endurance test, but the episodes since Clara left are worth watching. Not that all of them are great, I've found most of them to be just okay, but I've yet to see one I didn't like and that's still a big step up. At the very least you should watch The Husbands of River Song, that episode is fantastic.

**** I was surprised that it was even possible for something to be that terrible. Here's the most unlikable girl ever also she's future president even though that's directly unconstitutional. Gravity isn't working in this room, touch my yo-yo! Watch out for moon spiders! Here's an ethical dilemma that only the most hardcore Kantians would have trouble with and comes off as a pretty heavy-handed pro-life metaphor which the writer of the episode said was accidental.

** The Nier games aren't rational (too much absurdism) but I think plenty of people here would enjoy them, especially Nier: Automata. They're fairly unique in their storytelling methods and themes.

** I can't believe nobody has said diana wynne jones. Chrestomanci? Howl's Moving Castl? Nothing is less rational than most of the things that happen in all of her books, but they're magical and glorious and the main characters have spunk and wisdom and genre-savviness and they are /the/ books to read to your kids, just saying.

** /Dhalgren/ by Samuel Delany is set in a world that makes absolutely no rational sense. One of the many things I enjoy about it is how the communities in the story exist in spite of that.

I also enjoy the short fiction of Jorge Luis Borges.
