I'm trying to get better about following politics and this will be the first time I've voted with the benefit of caring about rationality. Who, if anyone, should I keep my eye on?


** Being as apolitical as possible ...

If you care about your vote, start looking into local politics - the more local, the better. You're one of +300 million+ ~240 million eligible people / ~130 million actual people voting for President, and we use both Electoral College and plurality rule, which means that unless you're in a swing state, your time and effort are best spent elsewhere. If you're trying to maximize your values, look to your state and local legislatures.

The other really important thing is that voting is one of the least meaningful acts when it comes to politics. If you really want to engage in the process, write letters to your politicians (state and local), volunteer for campaigns, or volunteer for non-profits that are trying their best to influence politics. Talk to your friends and family about who they should vote for, go door-to-door for a campaign, call people up, etc. Just going to the polls on election day is a good way to maximize the appearance of civic engagement for minimal effort, but it's not the best way to maximize political change in whatever direction you prefer with the same minimal effort. Same with donation - unless you're stinking rich, donate time instead of money, because your time is probably more valuable to a campaign than the equivalent amount of money you would be willing to give.

*So the problem of vote maximization is what we're left with* - and again, I'm going be as apolitical as possible, because I think you can rationally hold a whole host of political beliefs depending on your terminal values. What you're left with is a game theory question.

1. We live in a society that has first-past-the-post voting, which is a terrible system. In that system, you want to find the largest collective of voters that roughly align with your beliefs and vote with them so that the other largest collective of voters doesn't get their guy.
2. One caveat to this is that some election funding depends on the percentage of votes gained, so it's sometimes in your best interests to vote with a different collective in the hopes of electing someone better in the future and/or influence how future voting collectives form. If you can find a voting collective large enough to do that (you'd have to look up state and federal guidelines and get some data) it's probably worth your while. (/edit: At a federal level, 5% is the minimum to gain access to FEC General Election Fund money./)
3. Another caveat is that our voting system sucks in a number of ways. It might be in your best interests to align with a voting collective that's for election reform, even if you disagree with their other policies. The most important aspects of voting reform are getting rid of first-past-the-post in favor of something better, reducing the impact of money on politics, reducing corruption, and reducing gerrymandering. (Good luck.)
4. Get in on the ground floor as much as possible. Attend a primary or caucus. By the time it comes down to either the Republican or Democrat, most of the election game is already over.

Or vote your conscience to make a stand, if you want. The system might actually work if everyone did that, but there's a strong incentive to defect from that collaborative strategy. (/edit: Though then you're left with the fact that first-past-the-post fails on the "independence of clones" criterion, among others, which would cause the voting system to run into failure states even if no one was engaging in strategic voting or strategic nomination./)

This is surprising to me -- if the average person can do more good for a campaign by giving time than money, that means the campaign would be in a better position if it used its money to buy peoples' time. Is it a regulatory issue that stops this from being the case, or something more akin to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect][overjustification effect]]?

One other possible interpretation I see is that people will consider that 3 hours of their time volunteering is equivalent to a $10 donation, but will only work for a single hour in exchange for $10. This would surprise me a little bit, but I don't know if that's just because money and time are extremely fungible in both directions to me.

**** A lot of what you do when you volunteer for a campaign is go door-to-door or get on the phones, if you're at the lower levels. If you just walk in the doors of your local political office, you already /probably/ have a bunch of things that a prospective employee wouldn't - an honest desire to see the candidate elected, an understanding of the candidate's policies and platform, and enthusiasm for the campaign. If you're talking on the phone to someone and they ask "Are you going to vote for him?" it's important that the answer be "Yes" (and I'm sure that you can understand why asking employees to lie would be a political disaster in this case).

So it's not really a simple case of "time is money". There are also some confounding variables - there are startup costs associated with a new volunteer, so if you value your time at $20 and only want to give $5 to the campaign, cash would be preferred to those 15 minutes. But in general, yes, you need to have a pretty sizable income before your money is worth more than the equivalent time. Campaigns also don't have to pay taxes, healthcare, etc. on volunteers, so there's less overhead in many respects.

And that's all without getting into the potential ability to use personal skills that would bill at a much higher rate. I'm a software engineer who works on contract (through a company), and my time bills at some ridiculous amount. That amount factors in managers, rent on my office, utilities like a fat internet pipe, healthcare, retirement fund, taxes, etc. I haven't inquired into the numbers lately, but for every dollar spent on my time by the company I'm contracted out to, only a fraction of it comes to me after my company and the government take their cut. So if I volunteer for a campaign building them a website, I'm cutting out a huge swath of middlemen and accomplishing a whole lot more than if I had just gone to my job, worked the same number of hours, and handed over the money after getting my paycheck.

(I was trying to find a source for what the tipping point is in terms of the value political campaigns place on a volunteer-hour and failed, because people talk about money in politics too much and it was crowding out my search results with mostly irrelevant links.)

** Real-world politics is a long game, and the President/Prime Minister is usually the equivalent of either the King or, if you have a strong head of government in your system, at best the Queen in chess.

Of course, in politics, you need your man/woman to hold lower office before higher office, in most cases, so it's as if you needed to move your preferred piece from pawn to bishop to knight to queen/king throughout the game. At any given time, the opportunity to make a very good piece into the queen/king /appears/ to have a high marginal impact, but /in fact/ you needed to strategize by raising and keeping whole cohorts of strong pieces /the entire game/.

So while I will be supporting Bernie Sanders with my own money and efforts, I think that the /real/ way to win is to vote, donate, write, speak, and volunteer for whole parties or movements at once. No individual politician can swoop in and messianically save a party/movement whose organizing infrastructure, power base, and local activism have gone to rot.

I'll now enumerate my priorities for this election year:

- Minimize Republican office-holding. I know this is going to sound ever so depressingly "Blue Tribe" of me, but sorry, if your party runs and governs on a platform of religion overriding science on matters of civilization-scale risk and damage (in this case, global warming), then you are /strictly/ worse than the party whose weird pseudo-religious leanings override science on matters of personal health or purity (ie: GMOs, NIMBY, vaccines, etc).

- Other than the specific candidates I favor, I do believe the Democratic Party sucks too, and feel uncertain about the Green Party (though they are a superior alternative where you can vote for them without screwing the Democrats). Technophobia is fucking irritating to hear about on GMOs, nuclear power, and vaccines. Technophilia for the "innovation industry" is /massively/ fucking irritating /because I work in the tech industry and it's not fucking like that/.

- The rational thing to do is pick sane, forward-thinking candidates and movements at the primary level and act there. In particular, gerrymandering has decreased swing elections, but opens incumbents to "primary attacking". This can and should be used to strengthen movements outside the party establishment.

- Push hard with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to strengthen socialism and social-democracy at the national and local levels, along with the new labor movement at the "bottom-up" level. I have it from an actual sociologist that things like the "Fight for 15" and improvements to unionization laws are the maximally effective points of attack for a pro-labor voter or activist, as electoral labor movements /can't/ function and win without a tidal force of local and workplace-level labor activism beneath them.

For everyone else here, I simply strongly recommend attacking anti-science candidates and religious candidates, and supporting pro-science, secularist candidates. If you want to open the debate over socioeconomic systems and ask why I support the partisan wing I do, fine, and I can hear why you support the wing you support. But generically to "rationality", the important thing is to have secularism and science on the move, and to attack the global warming problem as fast and hard as we can.

*** In order to evaluate a presidential candidate on a rational basis, you have to look at their actual record (votes cast or laws signed or vetoed in lower offices) and behavior prior to any ambition toward the presidency.

The structure of the presidential campaign encourages a number of anti-rational behaviors:

1. Tailoring the message to the audience, saying one thing to one group, another to a different group (aka lying).
2. Vagueness (to avoid offending any potential supporters, but alienating those who care about meaning)
3. Capture by special interest groups (this is where the campaign money comes from)
4. Disenfranchisement (only a small number of states matter, the rest are certain to go one way or the other)

In order to be a rational choice for president (or any other office), a candidate must advocate and support a rational government. Essentially, a rational government protects its citizens from force and fraud, both internal and external. It interferes with the lives of its citizens to the minimum extent necessary to achieve this goal.

1. Each person has the right to their own life. WIthout this, nothing else matters.
2. Each person has the right to act freely so long as that action doesn't impinge on the rights of others.
3. Each person has the right to perform productive work and to keep the result for either current or future consumption.

***** Which of my statements is in error?

The problem with socialism (any variant) is that it denies my right to the results of my labor. This, as a necessary consequence, denies my right to life (by denying me the right to support my life by productive work).

Utilitarianism as a government policy suffers from the problem that it grants group A (the many) the right to enslave group B (the few) as a matter of principle.

Consider the statement: "Let's put Bill Gates to death, negate his trusts and estate planning, confiscate his fortune and spend it on feeding the poor." Using utilitarian principles, how can you say that such an action is wrong?

If we are to live together in a peaceful and just society, the wants of the many do not supercede the rights of the few.

** Here's the long form.

Before the candidates are decided, 55 dead men from over 200 years ago eliminate nearly 7 billion contenders, by requiring that the president have been born in the US 35 years ago.

The next narrowing is also historic, in that the only "serious" contenders must be a member of one of the two major parties, and have some degree of favor with the party leadership.

Now we're probably down to a few hundred contenders. So we select "those who want the job". Which is a terrible thing to select for.

"It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams

So now we have the dozen or so people who want the job and meet the eligibility requirements and are in favor with the party leadership. Next stop, the primary.

I believe Iowa is the first state. So in Iowa, the dozen or so are narrowed down to 3 leaders for each party, and the media adopts the narrative that those people are the only real contenders for the position. For the rest of the election, everyone acts as if this is true. By the time even the primary in your state shows up, your choice is fully constrained to a few pre-approved options, none of whom are actually going to have anything in common with you, or your interests.

After the primary system, the only real contenders are the red guy and the blue guy, and at this point it is a matter of "Are things bad enough that the people reverse direction?" If things are good, the guy of the color currently in office has the advantage. If they are not so good, the other guy has the advantage. There's some variability, based on what kind of noises come out of the mouth of the approved guy because people think the mouth noises mean things, but it's inconsequential in the big picture.

Your vote doesn't even matter, except in aggregate.

A CEO can be viewed indirectly by what their company does. What policies does the company hold? How they treat their employees? Do they meet their goals?

A professor? No. Simply no. Not unless they went WAY beyond being a professor, or the opposing candidate is truly atrocious. A professor that became a university president? Perhaps.

** I did a quick look through the thread and it seems like hardly anybody tried to answer your question, preferring instead to wax lyrical about how neutral and objective they are. So I'll go ahead and tell you that the correct person to vote for is probably Hillary Clinton, for reasons of competence. Third party is also arguable, due to game-theoretical reasons, but I don't think this works for US politics as the country is so divided.

I would also like to note how utterly disappointed I am at the rationalist community for failing so badly at politics. I mean, if you are incapable of telling which of 2 options is preferable, based on limited information, then what the hell have you been learning all this time?

Politics is a litmus test for rationality, and it seems obvious to me that the rationalist community has failed completely.

That's why good rationalists make it their own responsibility to try and change their own minds: That's what I meant.

But my initial post was written while irritated, so please allow me to rephrase: The final election will most likely be between Hillary and a Republican, in which case Hillary will turn out to be the better option because the republican candidates are all nuts.

********* You are getting into mind-killed politics mode. Break "global warming" and "belief" or "skepticism" into distinct propositions, and let's talk about probabilities and expected utilities.

[[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html][The experts give a >95%]] [[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1s1-6.html][Bayesian (probability of an event, not =1-p(event | H_0)=) probability]] to global climate change due to forcible addition/retention of energy in the Earth's climate system. I encourage you to read the applicable sections of the report yourself.

Now, given the observed damage that has /already occurred/, and which provides strong evidence that further damage will occur, you can:

- Declare you've got some very low prior on the IPCC being honest (conspiracy-theorist mode), and combine that to obtain a much lower probability of damaging global warming.
- Argue with the IPCC's data as an honest scientist, using your own data, leading to the probability again being updated downward.
- Argue that global warming exists with the probability given by the IPCC, but that the damage estimates are overblown.

Everything else is quibbling: /shut up and multiply/. If you think that UFAI/FAI issues are more important, you're not getting out of this one, because FAI is damned cheap to fund compared to dealing with global warming, so we can /easily/ do both, and dealing with global warming keeps more living creatures alive to enjoy whatever will happen when your FAI plan works. In fact, by refusing to take action to deal with the /expected negutility to life-kind/ of global warming, you are basically just dumping a load of shit on the FAI and saying, "/You/ fucking handle it."

I, personally, believe that the best I can do, epistemically, is to believe the experts here. I am not personally competent in climate science, but I understand scientific methodology well enough to say the official work seems to have been done by the normal methods, to my knowledge. So: >95% probability of significant global warming for what look to be anthropogenic reasons, with large expected damages. This is a civilization-scale challenge which, in its potential to save or damn billions of human and nonhuman lives, plainly dominates any expected-utility calculation you may want to do about upcoming elections.

True. I'm skeptical on CC myself, as well as the ability of government intervention to reverse the course, should it be both occurring and anthropogenic in origin.

The Climate Change question is complex. In order for anthropogenic climate change to be a true propisition the propositions must be satisfied that A) humans have the technology to gradually (in human scale) alter the climate, B) that humans can do so through an unintentional process, C) that humans have done so.

To use government intervention to fix the problem requires A above, as well as D) humans can reverse climate change through some course of action E) the government can intervene to reverse climate change, F) government intervention is the best way to reverse climate change.

To select a politician on his climate change stance adds the further proposition that G) the politician in question can cause the government to enact policies that reverse climate change, and H) the politician in question can cause the government to enact the best set of policies to reverse climate change
