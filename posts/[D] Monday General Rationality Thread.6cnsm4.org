Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** ^{^{WARNING:}} ^{^{AMATEUR}} ^{^{STATISTICS}}

I have some interesting statistics about [[/r/rational]]; about our regular threads such as this one, to be specific.

First, sources. [[/r/rational]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/][wiki]] has articles with convenient links to every previous weekly thread (thank [[/u/ToaKraka][u/ToaKraka]] for keeping them up-to-date). I've used them to gather the following information about each thread: date, upvotes, number of comments, number of top-level comments. (In ideal, I should've also gathered number of unique usernames for each thread, but that is too much work.)

You can access the result here: *([[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfpw8x2pu1smmjt/Weekly%20Thread%20Statistics.ods?dl=0][.ods]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/jAQeuIE.png][.png]])*.

*Conclusion:* the most popular weekly thread by far is Friday Off-Topic Thread (8190 comments across 101 threads); Monday General Rationality is the second (4388 and 91 respectively), Wednesday Worldbuilding (2180 across 54) and Saturday Munchkinry (1644 across 39) share the third place, and Sunday Writing Skills (156 across 14, discontinued) is the last.

Amusingly enough, it doesn't quite fit with the results of the recent [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67kiqb/how_old_are_the_members_of_the_rrational/][survey]]: according to it, General Rationality should be far ahead (301), Munchkinry a distant second (54), Off-Topic and Worldbuilding far behind (34 and 26 respectively).

But enough fun.

I regret to inform you that we are in a decline. I put the data points onto a graph, with thread number as X-coordinate and upvotes/comments/top_comments as Y-coordinates, then plotted lines of best fit for each combination.

Result: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrid2jq4e7cv0b7/Weekly%20Thread%20Statistics.grf?dl=0][.grf]], created using free [[https://www.padowan.dk/download/][Graph]] application.

Some illustrations of choice: *[[https://i.imgur.com/tsi2LQn.png][Monday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/JN5syNr.png][Wednesday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/AuIQgnT.png][Friday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/LIp2FoG.png][Saturday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/sgoJ5B9.png][Sunday]] | [[https://i.imgur.com/nay4PY9.png][Lines for Comments]]*.

As you can see, the number of upvotes was rising for Monday and Friday's threads and decreasing for the rest, top comments stayed more-or-less constant, while the number of comments in total for each weekly thread has been steadily decreasing.

Which is concerning.

I don't actually know what to do about it; thought I would share.

*Edit:* [[/u/blazinghand][u/blazinghand]] voiced the possibility that number of comments in each type of thread was decreasing because with time, new types of threads /appeared/, and the discussions were split between them. He appears to be right: I summed upvotes/comments/top_comments for each week across all threads, and the numbers indeed increase *([[http://i.imgur.com/zr0eMov.png][graph]] | [[http://i.imgur.com/3zZS2Tj.png][table]])*.

I hope someone with better statistics skills could get more information out of this. Maybe try to find correlation with seasons? Or important world events?

Speaking of more statistics, [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]], [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], do you have access to data regarding the subreddit's number of subscribers over time, and posts/links statistics? It would be a helpful addition.

Any easy way to analyze the usual contents of the Friday off-topic threads, see what other categories of things we should encourage?

Probably not. That sounds like satisfying our relevant value (increasing quality threads and quality comments) with some sort of fake stand-in (increasing threads and comments of any type).

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6aruc6/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dhh8eq9/][Last week]] I said I would start posting a story. This turned out to be untrue, after receiving feedback and also learning of the [[http://www.armscontrolwonk.com][Arms Control Wonk]] blog (an enjoyable read for this kind of stuff). I expected the chapter to only be 7k words, but it's at 10k and counting at the time of this writing.

Maybe I'm overdoing it. I have to ask: how much research is even worthwhile when writing rational fiction? I haven't hit a point of diminishing returns yet, but the research hasn't /changed/ the story, so far it's been to verify that wasn't doing something totally preposterous. It's still more than I've done for any other paper. There's a saying that "work expands to fill time allotted." Is there an equivalent for writers, that "story expands to fill information known"?

*** I think the big diminishing return on research is how much of the audience you're working for. Basic research satisfies 90% of the audience, advanced research satisfies another 9% of the audience, and exhaustive research /might/ satisfy that last 1%. So at a certain point, I just pretend to run the numbers and find that it's not worth it except in the sense that I get a warm feeling from both research and getting things right.

Research does have other story benefits, like uncovering interesting directions for the story to take, or being able to edify readers, but that probably has diminishing returns as well.

#+end_quote

Yeah, that's pretty much where the majority of research comes in for me :P And I /still/ manage to miss things, like the "[[https://forum.kingdomcomerpg.com/t/dead-mans-ten-realism-of-deadly-injury/21771][dead man's ten]]" rule that a reader recently pointed out.

It's hard to give any specific advice without knowing the story or what you're researching for, but it kind of sounds like you're expanding the chapter based on the more you're researching? Which may be a bad sign that you're including too much of the research itself, which could be a bit info-dumpy depending on how you're doing it.

If the research isn't changing the story, where are those extra 3k words coming from?

**** Specifically, I needed wordier explanations to more accurately describe certain phenomena. I'm having to make the call between shorter but possibly confusing chapters and longer but more thorough passages.

Edit: It's like, I can't drop the phrase "quark-gluon plasma" because the reader may not necessarily know what a quark is, or a gluon, or a plasma, and those terms have to be established before they can thrown around.

***** Not necessarily: you can and should mention things that aren't explained on the spot, because to explain every single thing that comes up as it comes up is what weighs narrative down, particularly in sci-fi and fantasy. If it's important to the plot, then yes, you should explain it at some point soon, but you don't have to do it right away unless it's immediately relevant.

People go into fantasy and sci-fi accepting that there will be some jargon that won't be immediately understood, whether they're proper nouns specific to the fictional world, techno/magic babble, or just generally concepts that start out mysterious but are explained later.

On the far side of things, HPMOR has the line "Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling!" in the second chapter, and never explains what any of that means, leaving it as an exercise to the reader to research what that means on their own if they want to. That's because it's not necessary for the plot at all, so it's just there to signal that Harry is intelligent and hint toward what kind of story this is. (This may not be the /best/ example to follow because I know quite a lot of new readers who found that line off-putting, but the point is that you shouldn't worry about dropping science terms without explanation if the explanation isn't /needed/ yet.)

I'm tentatively excited. I know it's not going to play out in any of the ways we've expected - that pretty much never happens - but it seems like it'll play out at least as far as expected within my lifetime. I'd even bet on human-equivalent* within 20 years.

- I doubt it'll resemble a human - current trends, I'd expected the A in AI to be "augmented" rather than "artificial" - but something roughly (but again, extremely differently) as capable as a human.
