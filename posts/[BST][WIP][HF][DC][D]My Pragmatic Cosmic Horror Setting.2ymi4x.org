This is a VERY broad summary of the mechanics of a setting I am planning to use for a project in the next few years. Feedback or thoughts would be appreciated. And hopefully the ideas are entertaining in and of themselves.

*The big lie/assumption about the universe for this setting is*

There is a phenomena called the abyss, potentially anything can interact with the abyss and become ‘abyss touched', That which is abyss touched becomes capable of performing actions which effectively break thermodynamics by creating energy.

Abyss contact seems to be more likely with living things or stuff about as complex though.

The capabilities/actions that are taken by abyss touched although effectively unbounded by energy requirements ARE bounded by the need to distribute entropy.

Human/human like abyss touched are the primary concern of the story and also in story have further classifications to describe the kind of result their contact with the abyss has caused.

In humans traumatic events, deep contemplation or over meditation on the nature of the universe can lead to abyss contact events.

The results of abyss contact in humans is broadly split into four categories, but the borders between these groups are not sharp or definite.

- Broken: In roughly 99.9% of all abyss contact events the human being ‘breaks'. some aspect of their psychology, memory, personality, random piece of physiology or the traumatic event ends up acting as the ‘seed' for an entity referred to as a broken. The entity that results can range from nominally functional/undangerous (example: an individual whose body becomes a skeleton which proceeds to scream on the spot for the rest of eternity). To the actively malicious or dangerous, (example: murderous force which terrorizes it's victims before enacting the circumstances of it's creation and may or may not be contagious). Broken are thankfully exceptionally crippled entities/phenomena and while they often can perform apparently impossible things they are also more often than not arbitrarily unable to do many other things (such as act on a anything surrounded by a circle of seasalt or effect some one wearing a particular shade of pink).

- Dreamer: In roughly 0.09% of humans that encounter the abyss the result is an individual who has obtained a form and repertoire of abilities that correspond to a fiction they have adopted in light of their experience of the abyss/trauma. This can manifest in many ways, from a child ‘animating' puppet versions of their parents and others after witnessing their deaths (and during their contact with the abyss denying anyone can die) to an individual adopting some form of ‘magical powers' that they actually produce via the near infinite energy capacity of the abyss but also with specific limitations/procedures necessary to support it (because they attribute their powers to a fictional ruleset). A dreamer is vulnerable to experiencing a second Abyss contact event if their ‘fiction' is sufficiently ‘disproved' to them. They normally become exceptionally dangerous forms of broken when this occurs.

- Stalwart: In roughly 0.009% of human abyss contact there is no apparent change in the individual. They may continue through the rest of their lives and never discover what has happened to them however they are now incredibly resilient/resistant to the abilities of other abyss touched and can no longer experience another abyss contact event. They may pursue exploring the nature of the universe without fear of becoming a monster. But everyone around them is not so safe.

- Shuraheima: in very rare instances of 0.001% or less of abyss contacts a conflux of traits, happenstance and accident will conspire to create what is called a shuraheima. Notable for being an entity that is actually aware of HOW it is performing the abyss touched abilities Shuraheima can learn, design and construct effects across all spectrum of possibility that their ability to distribute entropy allows. Technically they can do ANYTHING any of the other human derived abyss touched manage but in most cases the entropic cost to do so is personally unacceptable. (In order to perform some of the things that a broken does would require a shuraheima to BECOME a broken in the process of paying the cost).

*Spellwork basics*: Technically all abyss touched are performing spellwork. But only shuraheima have access to it's full range of possibility and clarity of it's construction/methodology.

- Spellwork has no upper limit for the amount of energy it can involve/produce.

- Spellwork does have comparable entropy that must be put into the universe when a given effect is created/caused.

- Spellwork effects have no spatial or temporal limits in and of themselves, but abyss touched do.

- Spellwork is always a personal act by the individual abyss-touched never a process that can be set in motion and left alone. (all instances of an abyss touched being contagious is the abyss touched actively supporting all instances of itself simultaneously).

- Spellwork requires awareness/perception and ‘coordination' to aim. As such it /CAN/ be performed through a telescope or a video recording if the viewer can use that to get a relative position compared to themselves. That said properly aiming from the surface of one whirling planet to another whirling planet in another galaxy is so incredibly complicated that most Shuraheima don't have the attention spans to bother when it's easier to make a rocket.

- Spellwork is notoriously ineffective against other abyss touched (especially stalwart) this often gets into the realm of the ridiculous, two shuraheima can chuck relativistic death beams at each other and barely impact either's defensive measures but everyone for light minutes around them will be de-atomized (except for some of the stalwart and broken).

And that covers the broad basics.

*TL DR on Spellwork*: Shuraheima find summoning explosions of any convenient energy trivially easy but need to spend decades to master creating a spool of rope out of nothing that doesn't come either immediately on fire/exploding and or tied into an unbelievably confusing mass of knotted madness.

The results is worlds where human society is surrounded by monsters that require enormous layers of arcana and defenses to be placed to secure safe redoubts. Where people need to try and avoid even thinking about things too deeply most of the time and the few who are capable of performing wonders can do a distressingly mind numbing amount which for good manners needs to be avoided because being too flashy and disruptive with the spell work can create a literal tide of monstrosities you will be ill equipped to face.

Things I have notes for but not gotten into in this post because we are getting really long as is:

- Broken/Abyss Touched Derived technology.

- Ridiculous Time Shenanigans on a civilization scale.

- How to make a space/time opera setting out of Shuraheima and the above two.

- The fact everything important happens in almost-suraheima-only societies and their culture.

- The sheer SCALE of things; actually doing the math on galactic scales of time and space being traversable, and the resulting numbers of absurdly rare things that end up gathered in one place.

- Abyss touched things that were never human, like for example corporations, or memes, or animals, or software.

- A huge elaborate timeless economic system of "fate markets" where the currency is bits of outcome pumping.

- The ridiculous stuff you end up with in places time travel is as locally cheap as taking an elevator and used massively at all scales.


** I'm getting darker than black vibes here. DTB contractors are basically your dreamers to a T.

I'm assuming that humanity is vastly expanded beyond earth at this point? With your Shuraheima rate, if my quick math was right, you'd get 70000 with JUST earth's population. And EACH of these individuals is capable of world-destroying shenanigans without even trying? Like, if they mess something up too badly? I'm not sure this universe you've built is going to be around for too much longer.

Side note: your equivalent entropy limitation is vague. Specify and give examples.

*** Never read or seen Darker then Black, but interesting I'll have to check that out a bit. The entropy measure is a little bit black boxy on my end but I've teased some stuff out from asking "what happens when you do this".

So some mechanics I do know: You could compare the entropy of an action as roughly equivalent to if you had just had some power source to do all of the work related to it in the first place assuming you/your body is the zero/origin/reference point for all events being done.

So if I wanted to lift a bucket of water up to a height and then pour it over a water wheel using abyss touched powers. I would need to shed the heat equivalent to some kind of engine or machine moving that water up to that height and position as it is relative to me.

If I wanted to do it faster I'd need to shed more heat/disorder.

Where this heat or entropy GOES is one important balancing trick for shuraheima.

Without them doing something extra otherwise all of the extra entropy/heat/disorder that their spell work is 'building up' is going to be dumped right into their bodies.

A shuraheima that is untrained and tries to do something big is liable to vaporize, fission their atoms or collapse themselves into a lump of iron.

If their not particularly trained a shuraheima will either kill themselves or turn into a broken long before they can crack the planet open.

Especially because most of them don't even understand what is possible when they first 'wake up' to their abilities.

This is less like a human from modern society getting the powers of a god, and more like a possibly well educated craftsperson during the middle ages getting the powers of a god.

And the fact new shuraheima are initially ignorant of what their own potential could be is part of the safety measures to deal with their existence.

**** Hmm. So all effects produced have waste heat? What if you're using the energy to cool something? Waste heat in the area AROUND you?

From there, seems like a simple jump to invisible heat dump chute first into a lake, then miles into the stratosphere, because infinite energy! Then all it takes is an idiot trying to make lots of dirt into gold and venting all the heat into the upper atmosphere to cause major climate change and destroy the planet.

I don't think ignorance as a limiter is feasible, especially if this shit has been around a while. First, there would be groups or individuals looking to invest in shuraheima for profit. These individuals would seek to track down and contract with shuraheima, perhaps educating them (in a controlled fashion) about their powers, perhaps drugging them, whatever, in order to use them to generate economic returns/influence/military power. Then you have a government, with all the resources and minds that entails, with the power of a god. How long does it take for two such governments warring with each other to destroy the universe?

Alternatively, law of large numbers. If you have 20 planets with 5B people each, that's tons of shuraheima. All you need to destroy the universe is one who's a reasonably intelligent sociopath who experiments a bit with his powers before trying anything huge. The tools are all there. There is literally nothing stopping a single person from ruining everything as you have it laid out.

And why it is in the interest of any shuraheima that don't appreciate all their toys being broken to locate every shuraheima that occurs and get to them first.

*** That is a little complicated. But one of the ramifications of the Time shenanigans and fate markets stuff that I mentioned at the end is that it's very hard to pin down precisely what the beginning of anything even is.

The 'territory' of the civilization as a whole is bordered by regions of space/time that no one ever comes back from. And within those regions there is a lot of interference from both the future and the past.

The broad 'earliest' border of the whole thing is roughly equivalent to the start of human beings being able to create and respond to visual depictions.

So the beginning of how all of this started as a human phenomena could be said to come from a bunch of early tribes of human beings finding tablets that had instructions for how to create a magical circle and receive some one to get them working on whatever was the most economically useful to get started at the very dawn of human civilization (a surprising amount of which is burying things in the ground for some one later).

And yes it is intentional that if you think too long about the larger structure of this entire 'universe' it gets horrifically bleak and soul crushing.

** With 100 times more Dreamers than Shuraheima, I'd expect them to contribute just as much to the tech and the magic. Someone who was making use of Abyss technology would surely have much more use for a few people who believe in fairies and weave straw into gold or do other things of that magnitude, than for a single uncontrollable demigod.

Broken even more so, of course.

*** Broken have the disadvantage/advantage of the majority of them being effectively none-sentient or severely damaged/impaired sentient minds. One of the foundations of the magitech of the setting is indeed using broken or their byproducts to produce various effects. Most of the means that are used to rapidly transport individuals is the use of specific broken or groups of broken in conjunction to perform the necessary infrastructure for magical transport circles and the like.

Dreamers are tricky to use in large groups because breaking their worldviews can lead to making a particularly nasty form of broken.

Not all dreamers have compatible 'stories' pertaining to what their power is/does and as a result what the very nature of the world is.

So they need to be handled gently by any involved.

The shuraheima are indeed uncontrollable as far as a human is concerned, but not un-containable for other shuraheima. Which is what a good majority of their culture is about.

Not being 'rude' enough to simply pop all of the mortals in a given continent.

Still good catch on some one wanting to utilize the dreamers who are at least moderately controllable instead of trying to wrangle something comparable to a poltergeist or infectious psychotic rage spirit (broken). The goal of the setting is the shuraheima occupy something between classic pre-harry potter wizards and the great old ones like cthulhu. And then there are things in the universe even more uncaring of mortal humans (comparable to the outer gods of lovecraft lore, but far more impersonal)

** While this seems interesting at first as I think about it more and more it seems like you would need so much hand waving and statements about "rudeness" that the world seems unreal and silly.

I'm desperately trying to think of ways to fix it but i'm not seeing very many. Perhaps what the main group (you should seriously change that name) doesn't create spell effects on the fly but has some way of constructing the spell effect in the abyss then using it, that would take out all the "stray thought" and "if they aren't careful" stuff which would destroy the universe long before anyone could do it on purpose and leave you with the creative stuff. Thinking about it that would make an interesting way for the other two groups to come into being, the dreamers (this is an ok name) stumbled onto a preexisting set of abilities that someone left behind using their personal style and the broken hit or accidently created a big pile of junk code. I also find the dreamer drawback really strange, if I can do fucking magic what are you going to show me that means i'm wrong about there being magic? When skeptics ask for proof, the ability to shoot lasers out of your dick and spit wormholes would pretty much do.

*** Hmmm I agree with you on the creative side of things, stray thought is a bad way to describe what they are supposed to do anyway. They are SUPPOSED to be about the ones that consciously control the nature of the abyss because they 'understand' it and can make it perform the acts they want.

It is a good distinction to make that they 'engineer' the spellworks before hand and then use them as needed.

The freedom/power they get as a result of their approach though is still a pretty solid part of the way the heirarchy settles.

Do you think keeping the process wholely and very strictly intentional/designed/engineered would really resolve the problems you had?

In the case of dreamers they don't precisely pick what the basis of the fiction that they explain their powers with is.

it is generally that they used their ability to get something that is not present in the world, They create a dream to blot out what is lost. The easiest example of this to take apart is the child who cannot believe anyone around them dies. So they animate and puppet the fallen around them. They make a very good effort of it. Their expending immense amounts of energy and no small amount of their own 'sub conscious' focus.

But the people that child is 'keeping alive' are still puppets. The child only can only manifest what they KNEW about the people before they died.

Prove to the child that he never successfully brought his parents back, or strain him to the point where he cannot maintain the puppets and you get the child suffering a second breaking.

It is not precisely easy, but it is ABSURDLY dangerous.

**** For the first group yes that would make a lot more sense, the way you were first describing it was kind of the concept in a fic (edit: [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][it is saga of soul]]) but the way they solved it is that there were people monitoring universes for magic and enslaving or murdering anyone who gets it because the typical result of magic is the destruction of at very least the planet the wizard is on but typically the entire star system.

As for the dreamers, I guess that makes more sense? The way it is described at first makes it seem like most of them are like wizards who believe that they can cast spells if they talk in bad latin and wiggle their fingers. I am not sure how you would disprove that.

As for the names, maybe sticking with a theme would help a little. How about broken, patched, and weavers? There are a few ways you could go on that but making up a word or using a long foreign word always makes it sound silly and/or pretentious.

As I think about it, I kind of like the idea that the "abyss" is just full of random crap, just filled to bursting with junk code so much that it is spilling out. Maybe it is just the internet of beings that exist on another plane of reality and the fact that it touches our world and we can interact with it is just coincidental, like radiation coming off of powerlines.

***** Hum, I actually put quite a bit of thought into how that word was being constructed, but I can understand the sentiment of not wanting to just use endless chains of foreign words.

The trouble is that at the same time you can end up with your story/setting full of descriptive nouns.

Not the most pleasant solution either.

I'm not sure that the Shuraheima name is actually in consistent circulation/use and I kind of want to fit several words to represent each type, from different cultures and linguistic roots. For example an entirely cliche description to give the Weavers or 'Awake' abyss touched is to just simply call them Wizards, Magi or Magisters.

Pretty bland really but it fits, however just as viable a name for any that meet one after it's done with the awkward decades of figuring out how to design and formulate their abilities might as well call the things gods, angels, demons or elementals.

Originally I called dreamers Angels and the spellworking ones Demons but that seemed absurdly cliche and also not quite accurate.

I got the current name by crossing Hebrew/judaic words for demon/men and some of the linguistic extrapolations for Asura and related entities in the myth from india.

** What is the base rate for an abyss contact? It must be a low percentage, because you need a working society. If 90% of the population experience an abyss touch, then 0.9*0.999 of the population is Broken.

It seems humans can force a touch, but probably not perfectly reliable. This would suggest one or more organisations (monastery, military, secret order, secret service, etc) to exploit this systematically. It makes sense to hide it from the general population, because it is obviously dangerous. There are still the occasional trauma-touched, which is a great start for drama.

With a 7 billion population and a 0.1% touch rate, we have 7 million touched people, of which 6300 are dreamers, 630 are stalwarts and 70 Shuraheima.

*** My expectation is that unless the people engineering the technology are high functioning broken or the more benign versions of the other groups It would be difficult to attain a population as high as humans have on modern day earth on single planet without really upping the population density. The existence of broken are liable to be known and protected against in SOME form, even if those protections are dictated from some kind of authority or by trial and error traditions.

Abyss contact is mostly a factor of lifestyle, personality and happenstance. It is relatively easy to induce intentionally but doing such has a lot of cultural discouragement.

In a similar way that one does not appreciate their fellows setting fire to their own house, signs of some one showing risks of inducing their own contact with the abyss are discouraged.

The degree to which there is actually a masqurade is more of a 'local flavor' for the setting and probably has a great deal to do with occurrences.

Likely no matter the degree to which the existence of the abyss is nominally "out" or not to the population at large I expect 0.1% touch rate is an idealized fantasy for most populations of humans and in particularily bad parts of the setting it can be as high as 5-10%. Much higher then that and it sort of cascades and the entire population can end up being triggered by the horrors of the rest changing.

Leads to messy messy situations, but potentially very valuable/useful broken may be able to be found in the wreckage after all the dust settles.

The event itself is deeply chaotic and trying to instigate one to swing one way or another is a bit like trying to predict the equivalent of spatially 12 dimensional weather to the hour twelve years in advance.

Even if they know EXACTLY what would cause a particular person to become a particular kind of abyss touched it is not reliably possible without effectively having to utilize the rest of the entire universe.

A story element I suspect is that the societies that exist and the precise makeup of normal human brains and bodies is actually tailored to make the occurrence of the various types as positive/useful as it is already and trying to push things much further gets diminishing returns.

That said in setting the only Shuraheima that actually live as god kings among humans are viewed somewhat similar to a bum that likes to live among pidgeons.

It's a sign that particular individual is abjectly a failure in shuraheima society at large.

Shuraheima have their own society between themselves (mostly because their not delusional and also because it's somewhere they can do crazy things and discuss the universe without accidentally breaking a human), in which their roles and positions fill out an enormous breadth from business tycoons to simple 'laborers' (the labors they undertake are the kind that semi godlike beings are capable of, but over the breadth of the setting there are enough shuraheima to support personal heirarchies of wealth and power).

If you were to describe the Shuraheima as gods then the pantheon of the setting could be viewed as one that is dictated by the economics/exchange of their labors/time with one another.

The fates are literally dictated by a marketplace, not by anyone's grand plan.

On the nature of the abyss. It is in story terms a kind of abstraction of what dealing with life the universe and everything DOES to people. Sometimes life just breaks you, some times you hide from it. Sometimes you find yourself strong.

Sometimes you figure it out/are lucky and 'succeed'.

As that being the metaphor, the abyss in universe is utterly prevailant.

The entire universe IS the abyss and you cannot actually hide from it anywhere. it's sitting there waiting to be discovered and 'contacted' it's hiding beneath the fiction of your life waiting to be noticed.

the abyss is not 'seperate' the separate thing in the setting is the little story humans tell themselves inside their own heads.

After all we are talking COSMIC horror.

The abyss is what really is, the way people are used to dealing with things comfortably is the lie.

****** Reminds me of Terry Pratchett's depiction of knurd. "The opposite of being drunk, its as sober as you can ever be. It strips away all the illusion, all the comforting pink fog in which people normally spend their lives, and lets them see and think clearly for the first time ever. Then, after they've screamed a bit, they make sure they never get knurd again"

******* Yes that is much the point. Cosmic horror and all that.

Although in this case only a lucky few manage to regain that nice comforting pink fog (dreamers), most either go crazy (broken) or find some way to deal with it (stalwart and shuraheima).
