  Alyx cut Charlie off mid-sentence.

Ok now what? Anybody got any hacker ideas or maybe a way to find a secret text or something like that? Either that or I am missing something obvious.

EDIT: forgot to add the link, sorry

There doesn't seem to be any hidden text. I'm guessing that the story follows Charlie in a way that keeps the narrative from continuing if Charlie would also be unable to continue narrating. Alyx cutting Charlie off mid-sentence may actually involve Charlie being incapacitated.

  Now, can you stop wasting time, please? Alyx may have taken the liberty to stop Charlie from wasting any more time.

Although, I gather that they are still on a beach around other people and I have a mediocre track record figuring out what's /really/ happening in stories like this.

*** I thought the same thing as well since authors only ever post single sentence chapters if it's an extremely shocking twist as well. Eliezer did the same thing with HPMOR's chapter #99.
