** I have finished reading the prologue and first chapter.

This appears to be the story of a man, born from the unholy union of a Harem Protagonist and a Yandere, with a correspondingly traumatic childhood.

He is Transported to Another World shortly after becoming a NEET.

I have not seen this particular mix of tropes before and am mildly interested.

I will continue reading for the time being.

**** (Not OP)

I think it's probably a matter of expectations. By light novel standards the translation is pretty good. I enjoyed the small amount I've read so far. But not everyone reads light novels, and so they go in with expectations set by the fluid prose of English-native novels. Even professionally-edited LN translations can't do that without essentially rewriting the story, since what works in Japanese/Korean just /doesn't/ when it's ported into English. The languages emphasise different things.

To anyone unfamiliar with the writing style and the quirks of translation, stuff like awkward pronouns ("That person surely did..."), stilted dialogue ("I treated you like an accomplice of equal standing, and yet, did you not look at me as if you were looking at trash?"), lack of environmental or personal descriptions, etc. are all very common features of the format. Anyone used to reading light novel translations wouldn't blink at them; they're not a sign one way or another of how accurate the translation is. But if you haven't read one before, they make the text seem amateurish.

***** This is exactly it. I'm reading shalvation's translation and it looks pretty accurate so far. However, that accuracy is the reason it doesn't flow well or sound good in English, a common problem for light novels. Rewriting (or localizing) Japanese text is the only way to solve the issue, but fan translators often either prefer a direct, accurate translation or just won't take the tame to do it, which is understandable since they're not getting paid. Still, so far this story is much more readable to me than some of the other LN translations I've seen like Mushoku Tensei.

Another problem is that light novels by nature are, well, light. They don't use enough description to give you a clear picture of what's going on a lot of the time, and you're more likely to get a narrator telling you what happened instead of showing you. It's the nature of the genre, unfortunately.

**** Shalvation is the one I found. It's legible, but it doesn't flow very well since it's often phrased awkwardly and is riddled with minor grammar errors. It's either written by someone whose first language is not English, or a native speaker who got 'C's in English class.

***** That's nice how people comment about my grammar, when most of the time, anything that seems like a blatant grammar mistake is actually the author's style of writing. It's done in order to emphasize points or is literally just a line said in one's head that wasn't meant to be grammatically correct in the first place.\\
I translate in order to keep it as the same feel as the author intended. There are lines that require certain parts to remain in the back for an atmospheric effect, which is what makes certain lines seem awkward.\\
If you're going to complain about my grammar, then I'd love to see you guys go read other fan translated LN/WNs and see how that fairs you.

****** I'm sorry if I offended you, I wasn't trying to be mean but I guess looking back at my post I kind of was, so sorry for that. I'm very grateful that people like you exist, otherwise it wouldn't be possible for me to enjoy all of the great media that is made in Japan.

Nevertheless, I still can't enjoy your particular translation of Dungeon Defense. Maybe the author writes weird, maybe you just write in a different style than I prefer, ultimately it doesn't matter whose fault it is. I'll go read a different series and enjoy it, and all of the people who like your style will read your stuff and enjoy it too, and that's okay.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I couldn't help it!

But, more seriously, I think your work is fairly solid, especially for a fan work done as a hobby rather then a professional effort with an actual staff being sold for money. There were what looked like a few homophone confusions (there/their type of stuff) and a wee bit 'o th' old "Thous and Thees" when transcribing some more esoteric or formal stuff, which isn't the best approach (though I will say that most people who don't attend technical writing classes aren't actually taught why not), but it was, outside those issues, a very solid effort.

******* Or maybe, just maybe. The Korean language writes it in that specific manner, so I try to adhere to that writing style instead of westernizing it too much. Although it doesn't seem like much, it most definitely changes some subtle descriptions and foreshadowing if I were to change those.

******** Using the wrong preposition for a verb isn't a style and doesn't have anything to do with foreshadowing or subtle descriptions. I'm not talking about awkward phrasing (although there's plenty of that too, I acknowledge that it can't be helped).

If you're willing to wait a little, I can go look through it again and give some examples. It's not widespread, but it's still noticeable.

******** Just went through the tutorial chapter, here's a list of examples (while I did find quite a few mistakes, there weren't as many preposition mistakes as I remembered, if there's anything I misjudged in this list please tell me):

#+begin_quote
  "Just now, other adventurer parties has invaded the castle.”
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "There was a lot of complications for me in this chapter. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "here was a thick cavern wall between each routes. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  "They trusted the Demon Lord Dantalian when they should have been hostile against him. "
#+end_quote

Preposition

#+begin_quote
  "Only one of the two future existed. "
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  " I had bit down strongly"
#+end_quote

participle

#+begin_quote
  "However, your enemy wasn't only the golem that had suddenly appeared."
#+end_quote

(I concede that this one might be style choice, but the narrator is was speaking of them in third person before, so it doesn't really make sense to suddenly switch to you)

#+begin_quote
  O-Okay. I understand.”
#+end_quote

This one is just missing a quotation mark at the beginning. Just thought I should let you know.

#+begin_quote
  The instincts, that was implanted into me since I was a child, whispered to me.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  The man fell to the floor. I wonder if the blade had sliced his lungs. His last breath just now was wheezy.
#+end_quote

Again one of those things that seem weird because he's suddenly using present tense.

#+begin_quote
  Now everything will be over once I got rid of Riff's group.
#+end_quote

Should probably be get.

#+begin_quote
  I wonder if they had noticed that the atmosphere was grim. Wonder is in present tense again, though at this point that particular one seems more like a style choice, as if he's wondering it while telling the story.

  But, unfortunately, the aim was slightly off so after scratching a bit of my forehead it had flown passed me.
#+end_quote

past, not passed

#+begin_quote
  Where'd the man who kept lowering his head like a small fry disappear to?
#+end_quote

Small fry is uncountable (no singular): [[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/small-fry]]

#+begin_quote
  The words the Demon Lord had said while he was being cynical was right.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  1 second, 2 second had passed before my mind started catching up to what had happened.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  For an animal that was unable to recognize a predator, the only fate that laid in wait for them was death.
#+end_quote

lay vs lie

#+begin_quote
  It was the aftereffect for running my brain on full throttle for 3 hours straight.
#+end_quote

preposition

#+begin_quote
  All saintesses in every shrine worships you.
#+end_quote

singular/plural

#+begin_quote
  Hade's Eye(S)
#+end_quote

Should probably be Hades' or Hades's

#+begin_quote
  I plan to lay around and sleep all day.
#+end_quote

lie vs lay

#+begin_quote
  According to my other friends who had read this book, they all said that the first two chapters weren't even the best chapters.
#+end_quote

Might want to rephrase that a little.

In additon:

Using past perfect when it's not appropriate also occurs a number of other times throughout the novel. It didn't really seem like a style choice to me.

You should expect around the same amount of mistakes for all the other chapters, from what I remember it didn't suddenly stop.

********* This doesn't seem like a proper place to be commenting this. Either leave a comment on the chapter it's on directly or message it to me in Discord.\\
And why the hell will you point out a grammar mistake in an ending TL note where I just write without any restraint while not minding my grammar at all?\\
Also, some sudden changes in perspective happens often in the novel, the author did do that. He does it often.\\
Furthermore, the first volume I literally did with absolutely no editors. I wrote that by myself without anyone going through to point out the errors until later on when people would comment them. But of course, people skip over minimal things that don't hinder the story whatsoever.\\
And you're being rather serious about a FANS TRANSLATION. Where it's not official. I may be doing my best, but that doesn't mean I'm perfect and can at all times have perfect grammar in some cases.

*** Possibly. I would have definitely gone for that save feature just so that I could shout "LOAD GAME" after every mistake--even if you have to repeate 9.9 years of flawless play to undo a last mistake, it'd be worth it to have a perfect life. But I wouldn't ever try to rely on being allowed to continue if I fully died. What if the game resets, but this time you're not posessing the demon? What if when you die, you're just dead and it's someone elses turn? Too risky.

Almost that kind of feeling, right? I get that the protagonist is playing to his strengths, but not choosing the ability to save is definitely suboptimal. It's not like he's really getting anything out of his chosen ability so far.
