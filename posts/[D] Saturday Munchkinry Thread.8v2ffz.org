Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** How about the final boss of the story I'm never going to write? This is a reverse munchkin scenario turned up to 11. Hopefully I can just dump a ton of the relevant worldbuilding, since I don't think anyone could figure this out without the background.

*Setting*

You're in a world where, rather than magic being a feature patch on top of physics, physics is fundamentally a result of magic. Things work differently here; eyes work by sensing objects directly, not through transfer of light; there is neither air nor air resistance, but there is a fundamental speed cap that some things hit, like missile weapons and people specialized in the magic; and nigh every aspect of the universe can be molded at will by sufficiently skillful mages: if a property varies, there is doubtlessly a magic that affects it directly.

Magics are rather mechanistic in nature, more science than sport, but the personal benefits from being a skilled mage and the very un-Earth-like nature of their reproduction─one literally builds the child out of their own torn flesh, and donates to it some substance of one's own mind and magic─results in guilds and lineages taking strong precedence over prototypical scientific establishments. Most mages specialize in a few specific fields, because the art is difficult and power scaling is very nonlinear; the downside is that specialism in a branch of magic results in increasing value drift towards exploitation of that ability. This world's natural disasters happen when somebody achieves too much in the wrong thing. Much of the society's resources are keeping at bay the many shapeless extensions and copies of the first (and only) divine shapeshifter, who figured out how to perform mitosis and transform himself arbitrarily─nearly all of the world's natural fauna and flora has been replaced by thick forests of his mindless lovecraftian mass.

*The protagonist and antagonist*

Your primary claim to power is your divinity in Will, the magic that affects the inherent randomness effusing the universe to achieve your outcomes, a kind of "luck", if you will. The divinity placed you in a Groundhog-esque time loop, starting at a given point─currently locked at the moment you gained your divinity, but you can bring it forward permanently if you so need─and ending at the point of your death. As a result of value drift, your place no particular ethical weight on the continuity of others' lives, so it does not bother you that restarting the loop kills everybody else, except inasmuch as you valued those people in particular. Since your are simulating this character, you should keep this in mind. Having a divinity in Will gives you effectively limitless time to learn any other magic to any degree of proficiency, though keep in mind that certain kinds of value drift make certain skills dangerous to learn beyond a certain point.

Most people think your adversary is god, but you now know that he's actually "just" an old mage from many generations back that acheived through some means, as best you can tell, all the known divinities. Of note, he has maximum strength, and is unaffected by physical forces, poisons, or fire. He can move at the speed cap and split into multiples; not the unrefined trees of flesh that have invaded the world's borders, but a clean, idealized reproduction. Mind magic doesn't affect him, just like the other properties, since a divine can at worst draw in their own field. Even if you could bypass these, he has an immortal's regeneration, and should you somehow kill him even then, his time loop almost certainly precedes yours, wiping you out of the equation and doing little to him. Most powers you can learn would only allow you to tank his blows, rather than vice versa; having a divinity in strength would make you immune to his punches, but do nothing to stop him being immune to yours (I suppose you could headlock him, if not for him being able to shapeshift, burn you to death, move much faster than you, and mindrape you into compliance if those all fail).

The first time you spoke with him you threatened to loop on him; he laughed and said that if he was worried about that he would have just made you immortal. You don't know whether he could actually do that. When you spoke to him in later loops, he seemed as though he followed you through. You now believe he was just reading your mind and acting as if he knew about them all along. In all, he would almost certainly be afraid of true death, but which particular instance of him is the living one seems to be unimportant.

You want some form of leverage over him. You don't need to actually hurt him, but you do need something that threatens him. At present you have nothing. You should have at least enough here to find my solution, but I'd be interested to see what others can find.

*** Get a divinity in mind magic first as a matter of course so you can't be mind controlled.

This dude has got to be pretty bored. Spend a few loops coming up with a really interesting game with a ridiculous amount of depth, then a few more loops getting ridiculously good at it. Offer to play with him, and iterate on design until you find something he likes, then play regularly until it's an established part of his life that he enjoys.

If he ever does anything you don't like, heavily cut back game time. If he tries to force you to play suicide. If he works out a way to force you to play anyway play badly. Ideally none of that ever comes up and now both of you have something interesting to do as down time.

Try not to get more attached to the game than he is, just in case.

*** How exactly does your time loop work? Does it really kill everybody else? Including the old mage? If so, doesn't triggering your time loop already kill him and replace him with another version of himself? That's a pretty effective threat right there.

You just need to keep yourself on the verge of death 24/7, so you can commit suicide faster than the old mage, meaning he can't trigger his time loop to erase you before you erase him.

Alternatively, if it turns out that your belief is wrong and that the old mage actually loops with you whenever you restart, the above strategy still works. That's because you can threaten mutually assured destruction by bringing your time loop starting point to just before the moment of your death, effectively creating an infinitesimally short time loop that the old mage can never escape from since there's no time for him to kill himself to escape via his own time loop. So you'll both eventually go insane from the never ending unchanging repetition.

Oh. You can disable your time loop. I thought that once you brought your time loop starting point to right before your death, you were screwed forever and unable to escape the loop either. Is there any way to disable your ability to disable your time loop then? Because it would be hard to convince the old mage that you wouldn't break mid-loop, but much easier to convince the old mage that you're crazed/emotional/irrational enough to trigger an inescapable loop that effectively ends the universe.

Now you probably wouldn't be able to say blackmail him over little things like demanding money/power or you end the universe. But it does grant you leverage in some ways. By informing the old mage of this threat, you let him know that if he pushes you too far or tries to erase you, you /will/ trigger the inescapable loop in a fit of rage/spite, damn the consequences.

******** Apologies, I thought I'd mentioned they can be disabled. There is the other escape clause from gaining divinities until you escape that fate; living with a rock lodged in your head is a good─if painful─way to practice recovery magics until you're an immortal. It's hard to figure out what kind of things don't happen over arbitrarily long timeframes to be honest.

Maybe if you got a mind mage to fry your brain beforehand, but they'd need to leave you in a state that didn't count as killing you (else you'd loop on them, which wouldn't be stable), which means you need at least some useful faculties left.

I'll think about this, maybe I'm being overly pessimistic about it.

***** Timelooping working that way seems very poorly thought out. That's literally the most powerful magic possible. It instantly and overwhelmingly overwrites everything everywhere. At that point, why bother with other magic? The only important magic is figuring out how your time loop does that, and how you can adjust it to say, reset only /part/ of the world.

I assume that there are magic attacks and defenses, except it sounds like this super special time loop power effortlessly cuts through all of them.

IMO, change the base mechanic that time loops work on rather than actually physically altering the world: Precognition, quantum immortality, alternate dimensions, etc..

*** Why would immortality prevent your reset? Anyone's immortality preventing everyone's reset seems to contradict his words.

A simple way for him to permanently calm his fear of death is to send a copy out at maximum speed, then permanently advance the checkpoint to just after that in case someone convinces him from his ways in the future.

This value drift appears to simplify. Conjecture: Magic's primitives/divinities correspond one-to-one with the components of the human value system.

If you can save/restore another's mind state, teaching a divinity to a subordinate preserves your values. The antagonist might still value that which one can have a lackey sacrifice without rendering him uncontainable.

You can save/restore minds with strong enough mind magic, but that's extremely rare.

That sounds difficult.

E: I think I misread. Are you saying you would teach the divinity to the subordinate, and copy that mind of theirs from one loop to another? Then you can exploit their abilities without suffering the drawbacks yourself. That does make sense.

*** The first step is to achieve proficiency in deception and broad-optimization magics.

By "deception" I mean improving yourself until you can reliably fool the enemy into not realizing the existence of your time loop. Achieve divinity in mind magic (mind shields? decoy minds?) first. If there are related social magics (e. g., an actual "deception" magic?), master them too; if there aren't, become the best actor a human could ever be.

By "broad-optimization magics" I mean magics akin to Will, which seems to globally optimize events according to your utility function. What others are there? The Enemy has all of them, and they're likely to foil any plan against him if you don't have a symmetric advantage. If further improvement after achieving divinity is at all possible, try to /surpass/ the antagonist in them; spend several googols of years on it if necessary (modify yourself to have infinite patience if necessary).

Once those are achieved, the preparations are complete: you're at least as "lucky" as the enemy, and you have an information advantage in that you know he is in a time loop, while he doesn't know about yours. That information advantage can grow.

Use your time loop to carefully mine his instances for information. The full extent of his powers, his personality, his contingencies, why he made the crucial mistake of allowing the world to remain in such a state that someone with your power was able to appear, et cetera. Use the standard timeloop precaution of killing yourself the moment something surprising happens, obviously.

Eventually, you will have a complete picture of what he is. Use it to manipulate him.

He can't be mindraped or killed, but I assume he can change as a person^{1}. Since you have a timeloop advantage over him, that means you can manipulate him into anything.

Spend some time (a decade? a century?) learning how to get him to develop a minor habit (e. g., a preference for certain speech patterns). Then how to cultivate a major habit. Then an opinion. A belief. A different belief. Two beliefs. A set of beliefs.

Use however much time you need. Thousands of century-long loops for a minor habit is acceptable.

Once proficiency in manipulating him is achieved, shape his personality into whatever form you find convenient, over the course of an arbitrarily long loop. Optionally, get him to not resist while you use mind magic to erase his mind.

A global victory.

^{1. This is actually a major assumption, now that I think about it. If he has divinity in every magic, he has value-drift from every magic.

Just highlighting this because it's insightful.

There is a major issue with your plan: spending a thousands of centuries around someone who can maybe forcibly make you immortal is a lot of risk, especially as being unreadable makes you much more of a perceived risk than when you were a transparent book.

I won't rule out the possibility that you could erase his mind this way (it does seem more a job for a superintelligence, but I'm probably underestimating what you can do with megayears of experience), but what if there are clones of him? I think the end goal would have to be more sophisticated than that.

Well, the premise is quite risky to begin with. Be very, very careful, and hair-trigger suicidal?

Regarding readability, is it at all possible to fake it? If mind magic doesn't allow decoy minds, can you use ~biology divinity to implant yourself a fake brain, and ~space divinity to fold your actual brain into a pocket dimension, or something? Or communicate with the antagonist only through proxies/mind-clones who honestly believe they're whatever role you're playing this loop.

#+begin_quote
  What if there are clones of him?
#+end_quote

Well, then instead of erasing the mind of your enslaved instance of him, have him loop--- Ah, damn. It wouldn't work unless all of his instances are dead, would it?

Okay. I considered doing something like this at the end of my initial idea, but decided it was superfluous. Apparently not.

Enslave an instance of the antagonist as per above. If there's a "hierarchy" of instances, try to get one as high up the chain as possible.

With his help, engineer circumstances best solvable by time travel. Burn the whole planet down, fake an invasion of cosmic horrors, create grey goo, crash the simulation, pretend to be a /more/ powerful god with 30+ divinities but no Will divinity, whatever. Target and destroy something the antagonist cares about, or present an insurmountable threat that could be easily solved with a century's forewarning.

Upload your mind into slave!antagonist's mind. Depending on how the Will timeloop works, either rewrite his mind with yours entirely, or add a "memory packet" with a snapshot of your mind (as high-fidelity as possible).

Use slave!antagonist to send messages to his other instances, informing them about the threat/disaster, and strongly advising them to kill themselves. Wait an undefined amount of time, until you're pretty sure all of them received the message and killed themselves. Order slave!antagonist to kill himself. After he loops, he will rewrite the mind of the person closest to him with your mind. Now you're at the dawn of time, where life was (presumably) simpler.

Assumptions:

- There are circumstances in which the antagonist would consider using his time-loop a rational course of actions.

- The antagonist is singular at the start of his loop (no clones), or at least murderably-plural.

- Time loops for the instance of the antagonist that dies last; the rest get erased.

- All instances of the antagonist could be messaged to.

At which point this would fail?

Minor issue: Assume he copies your mind, and kills himself a minute later. The "real" you half a minute after he has copied the past you is no longer copied, so would die when he loops. You end up being your own adversary!

I don't think your plan survives these clarifications.

--------------

I didn't think it would be relevant, but some context is important here. The antagonist originally wasn't going to fill the "final boss" role; he played his part in the story but for a while I didn't expect there was a clean way to force his hand on anything important. And this holds here too: not contesting him is a reasonable, if suboptimal, alternative. If your best plan involves burning down the earth, getting yourself time-erased, or spending a googol years hoping your reflexes are fast enough that you don't once trip up, maybe it's a game more risky than it's worth.

Stepping back to the meta-level, generally the reason I'm not hot on your plan is that you have a lot of conjunctions. Eliezer's post [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Yq6aA4M3JKWaQepPJ/burdensome-details][Burdensome Details]] expresses my feelings here quite well. If you can simplify things to something a little more likely to survive contact with the enemy, it'd be much more likely to work.

However, on such time scales, virtually everything that could theoretically harm you should be considered a threat --- the antagonist isn't /special/, from this perspective, you'd need to figure out how to protect yourself against black swans anyway.

Oh my. That... wait, that actually makes it way easier. Mindrape one of his instances, upload yourself into him, loop him, download yourself into the past. Find an older instance, mindrape him, upload yourself, loop him, download yourself. Repeat until the oldest instance is enslaved.

No need for the complicated self-destruction gambit^{1}.

Hell, you could try to figure out what his oldest instance is, and focus all your manipulation efforts on him from the beginning. It's so comparatively easy I feel like I missed something.

Meh. I'm inclined to agree with the antagonist here: as long as one instance survives, it could be assumed that my self survived as well. Unless this setting contains a more explicit seat of consciousness?

I suppose you could try to make a destructive upload, i. e., have slave!antagonist gradually erase your mind in the process of copying it --- this should ensure the doomed you doesn't develop any independent memories. Or do it while asleep, or in a (magical/) coma...

#+begin_quote
  Burdensome Details
#+end_quote

Well, I simplified in the light of the new information. I don't think it's that complicated at its core? It basically consist of the following steps:

1. Preparation. Make sure you're actually /able/ to successfully act against the antagonist.

2. Information-gathering. Figure out the enemy's powers and personality.

3. Learn how to manipulate the antagonist. Then do so.

4. Find a way to use the antagonist's loop to send yourself into the past.

5. Repeat 3-4 until you've dealt with all of his instances.

Given the flexibility of the abilities (time travel, mind magic, clones) and the power levels involved, I think it's simple enough.

*Edit:*

I could try to make it even simpler, though riskier in some ways:

- Become a divine mind mage. Help several loyal people ascend to divine mind magic as well, and preserve them from loop to loop as per [[/u/Gurkenglas][u/Gurkenglas]]' suggestion.

- Find one of the antagonist's instances, assault him mentally. With a time loop to save-scum and your mind mages for help, you should win. Enslave him.

- Proceed with the iterative looping gambit.

How? Have the mindraped clone play his part for a time, then separate from his creator and consult you for further instructions. There's no need to make his older instance aware that anything strange has happened.

That said... I imagined further loops would be easier, since you would begin them with one instance of the antagonist already enslaved. He would be as powerful as any of his other instances, /and/ have a multi-divine mage in your form for help --- I thought it would be sufficient to ensure your victory in any given engagement. If that's not true... Well, it's still not impossibly hard.

Whyever would you make him aware that you're seeking him? Have a proxy approach a random instance, become his known acquaintance. At some point, casually inquire about the antagonist's self-replication abilities, try to steer the conversation towards his "personal" age and his closest "fork". Maybe phrase it as a philosophical discussion about continuity of consciousness, or whatever is context-appropriate.

It does heavily depend on the antagonist's personality and the context of his interactions with the protagonist, I'll admit. How did they meet? How frequently does the antagonist interact with other humans? What form do these interaction take?

What would you consider a sufficiently simple plan? I don't think mine has that many moving parts.

Becoming divine in mind magic is possible. Having an enslaved person save and restore your mind is possible. Spending extraordinary amounts of time near the antagonist is less risky in these circumstances, since the correct method of derailing your plans is pretty counter-intuitive; it could be ameliorated even further by usage of proxies. Most of all, time loops are nearly /peerless/ among information-gathering tools.

The only real problem lies in attempting to manipulate one of his instances into slavery, but it's not /that/ hard given all the advantages you would have: a time loop, borderline-inhuman deception/manipulation abilities backed up by divine mind magic insights, and extensive knowledge of the antagonist's personality and behavioural patterns.

The /core/ of the plan is to become the antagonist's friend, backstab him the moment he lets down his guard, then hijack his time loops to get rid of his clones. All complexity arises from the need to circumvent his various abilities. Is that still too complicated?

He loops back to the instant he was created, and has no a priori reason to prevent himself from being mind read by his creator at that time. That in itself confers a high probability of instant disqualification.

Relying on convincingly acting out your own actions from hundreds of years ago, not being observed when you go off-script and repeating the whole convoluted plan is another large risk on top.

EDIT: For a current of one amp, the principle is the same, except you should now use it on an insulator, which gives you an enormous potential difference and therefore an enormous power dissipation.

*** 1 amp through a large x-ray tube would make for a reasonably effective weapon.

But since we're talking take-over-the-world, how about some classic rules lawyer munchkinery?

1) A sustained electric current is always a loop, since electron density can't go below zero

2) The power produces a current with a hard distance limit of 8 feet, so no outwardly directed current extends beyond the 8 foot limit.

3) The return current must therefore also have the same distance limit.

4) By basic geometry, the closer we get to the 8 feet limit the tighter the turns return current paths have to make

Enter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung][Braking Radiation]]! Electrons making turns emit electromagnetic radiation, with frequency (and energy) a function of the the acceleration involved. So as the turn gets tighter the radiation will go from radio waves to visible light, ultraviolet, right up to X-rays and gamma rays.

Gamma rays can be ridiculously energetic, and by pushing the current to /juuuuuust/ under 8 feet we can make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_gamma_ray][ultra high energy gamma rays]] even more powerful than the most energetic cosmic rays. In principle each photon could have the power of an artillery shell.

This should work without any special equipment but will be most effective when the turn is made in a vacuum so the electrons can travel faster. I.e. an X-ray tube without a conventional anode.

The neat thing about this is that if the electrons are fast enough the radiation will be directed away from you, so with some shielding against backscatter it might even be possible to survive the experience.

Pushing this to the limit, you could hold a country to ransom with a few milliamps and a "surrender or I will irradiate your largest city" speech. Either do that until the world surrenders or take over US/Russia/China/other space-faring country and threaten thousands of square kilometers at once from orbit.

tl;dr: Abuse the hell out of the specific wording to make a synchrotron death cannon.

** You secrete a substance that can allow you to animate, control, see, and hear through objects coated by it. "Animate" allows objects to move within their normal range of flexibility and then some. For example: if you animate a marble, it can roll at walking speed; if you animate a stick, it can bend slightly to crawl like a caterpillar; if you animate a suit of armor, it can get up and walk and fight clumsily. Your control is roughly equivalent to Skitter's control of bugs in Worm; that is, pretty much absolute. It also grants the appropriate level of multitasking ability - you can act simultaneously from as many controlled objects as you like. Your secretion is permanent.

Limitations: Simple soap and water can remove your control-substance from almost anything. Control and flexibility weaken the larger the ratio of mass-to-secretion; a drop of secretion can only viably control about 100 grams of object. You get more fine control with more secretion, but diminishing returns apply. The best control you can expect is to be able to move e.g. a mostly-coated suit of armor as if you were wearing it. You cannot control living things (but you can control their clothing). If a non-coated piece is cut away from a coated object, you lose control of the non-coated part. Stiff objects move slowly, if at all; supple objects like cloth have plenty of motion but are relatively weak. Small objects also move slowly.

Circumstances: For further "creative narrowing," munchkin within these constraints. Assume no technology higher than medieval (no gunpowder). You are trying to defend a castle against humanoid invaders. You have years of prep time if you need it - long enough to coat just about everything needed, but not enough to generate pools of the secretion (not that you'd want to). Your attackers know your power, but haven't seen you use it. The spying applications of this power are trivial to abuse; I am interested in the combat applications.

- I suspect that armies of bows effectively maximises firepower.
- Traps can be controlled with small quantities of secretion, since you only need the lever to be active. They can also be autonomous.
- Having an automated factory is probably extremely useful.
- Threads with poisoned needles on could be deadly en mass, since they can crawl under armor, and jab weak points directly. They should probably be fired from the aforementioned bows.
- If you're alone, your castle does not need entrances or stairs, since you don't need to support a population; fill those with rubble and get a rope to let you up when you come and go. Put contraptions around the top of walls to knock off ladders. Grow masses of thorns around the castle.
