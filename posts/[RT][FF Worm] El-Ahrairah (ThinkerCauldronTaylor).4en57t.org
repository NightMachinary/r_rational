** It looks like this is pretty popular on spacebattles, but I haven't seen it linked here and it definitely should be. The fic provides an interesting take on the internal workings of Cauldron ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/][Agent of Cauldron]] is also good for this), and generally the non-combat-oriented side of Worm. I was consistently surprised by how reasonable everyone in the story is (even Danny! Even Piggot!!), but this doesn't get in the way of the tension or conflict (which is largely but not exclusively political). The writing is strong, particularly in representing long, complex trains of thought in a compelling way and in quickly setting up relationships that seem honest and even heart-warming. All of the struggles are well motivated; everyone is competent; and Taylor reminds me of HPMOR!Harry in a several subtle and not so subtle ways.

A++ would recommend. (So I did.)

**** Tertiary rec. When arc 3 started, I reread the first two. Still one of the top 3 Worm fics I've seen.

******* I have to echo Fugu. ACP was the one that came to mind as the third, but I was convinced there were other contenders I wasn't forgetting. Weaver 9 is definitely one of them.

******* Weaver 9 is great and all, but it's pretty short. A Cloudy Path really goes the distance and it does it with style.

********* Should do, yeah, in the way that most things about a fic of that length improve as the fic goes along. It's been a long time since I read the whole thing, so I can't exactly give a fair comparison between the start and the where it is at the minute. I don't know if I'd say the dialogue ever becomes its biggest strength, because that's the combat, the storyline and the tinkering, but it does improve.

******* Yeah, the premise is basically "Taylor gets a tech tree from the (rts) game as her tinker specialty". Since it's not from a game in setting, you learn most all of the relevant bits when she does.

** This is some good rational material. The background changes and justifications as well as other character behavior is both rational-ish and in character with their original canon.

Arc 3 really kicks into high gear with Thinkering and power legality/rulings and classification.

Be warned that MC might seem like a Mary Sue due to excessive power usefulness and application, and of course the resulting character changes that would prevent silly mistakes like canon characters making decisions for plot. This is a good thing in concept, but the execution sometimes dips into fixfic territory.

*** Indeed. Came in for creative-thinker!Taylor, was disappointed when she morphed into Jedi!Taylor. With all major parahumans at her beck and call, too. I'm hoping that the Endbringers and/or Scion will break pattern soon to bring a credible antagonist back into the fic.

** It's cool story, but it strikes me as kinda aimless. See taylor powerset is a world level thing, which is an awesome change from the standard worm fanfic, but we really have very little info on the world stage of Worm. Agents of Cauldron as previously mentioned is a good comparison, it went the direction of large amounts of original content, El-Ahrairah has up till now largely worked in the boundaries of the canon worm, despite taylor's goals and methods require her to work outside said boundaries. You can argue narrative reason of why this is, but the author has yet to demonstrate the ability to paint a larger world, which is crucial to the story's long-term/completion viability.

*** This is a fair criticism. The story works for me because 1) I find the characterization and interpersonal relationships interesting and entertaining and 2) the story seems to me to be going somewhere. It's relatively young, and everything points to an expanding scope; the plot/conflict we've seen so far makes sense to me as the first set of challenges for this Taylor and she's an ambitious enough character that I expect the plot will continue to progress well.

That said, Agent of Cauldon does an amazing job of expanding the world with original content, and I don't expect this fic to meet that standard.
