[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d7nx2/biweekly_challenge_inexploitability/][Last time]], the prompt was "Inexploitability". Our winner is [[/u/Laborbuch]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d7nx2/biweekly_challenge_inexploitability/dq8e5pi/]["Fall Guy"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/Laborbuch]] for their win!

This time, the challenge will be *Mimicry.* I'm leaving this relatively wide open to interpretation, though there are lots of canons and genres to draw on if you want to do fanfic, pastiche, or draw inspiration from somewhere. John Carpenter's /The Thing/ or the recent videogame /Prey/ might be good places to start, though "mimicry" has pretty wide bounds. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, December 13th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

Next time, we will be doing ultra winner [[/u/vi_fi]]'s choice, *Self-Destruction*.

"The theme I would like to see [[/r/rational][r/rational]] work on is Self-Destruction. At first glance, this prompt can be understood in two ways. On one hand, it can be about the self-destruction of a character. The first question that comes to mind is whether self-destruction can be a rational course of action. On the other hand, it's also possible to understand the prompt to be about the trope of the Self-Destruct Mechanism. In that case, a driving question might be why (and how) a rational supervillain might implement the self-destruction of their doomsday device. Of course, these ideas are meant to inspire, not to limit ;)"

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/13.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will be up shortly.

This is the first thing I've actually written out in years, and it popped into my head pretty much fully formed when I saw this prompt. I hope it's at least moderately enjoyable but I'm happy to accept even mean-spirited criticism.

I can offer half-baked criticism! Is that acceptable?

1451 words are not a lot, even when you try to illustrate only one concept (a [[#s][spoiler]] using a rather well-known setting (classic DND fantasy). You use the minimum amount of words to introduce the entire party, which is rather economical compared to something like this paragraph, which re-states the same thing quite a few different times, and is really unnecessarily rambling at this point, by which I mean to say, I liked how /compact/ your story was.

The one thing I would like to nitpick is that it lacks a bit of polish, which is not uncommon for these challenges. For example, the beginning sentence of the fourth paragraph ("And yet..."), is not unambiguous in its meaning, as well as somewhat complex, which made me stumble over it. Since multiple editing passes are the only cure for something like that, it's an understandable imperfection :)

All in all, excellent work, keep writing if you have any more clever ideas, and have my upvote.

*** Why not just feed it cattle or something? That seems a lot less risky than adventurers, and the cost is trivial for anyone that's not a commoner. Is the idea that he's training the mimics as well as breeding them?

**** That is something that did not occur to me until you just asked, but after giving it some thought I believe I'll find some way to include that feeding them livestock makes them too docile or something.

*** (I wonder if the 'orders' are Mimics themselves (and for what use if so?), or objects with their own functions imitated by unchanging Mimics. --Ah, and one could compromise by having Mimics which constantly imitate, say, helmets, but (wouldn't be much use in a fight and) don't reveal themselves until their pre-set assassination target puts them on (since the floor shows that 'stickiness' is voluntary).

Given the 'poking', I found myself wondering why the last part was done piecemeal, rather than suddenly slamming shut the walls once they were in deep enough. (Mobility, in that the walls themselves were so coherent they could barely move? Still, the door seemed able to change rather fluidly, even if not move around by itself; lots and lots of spikes (or blunt-ended ramming pillars) all at once, say..? Or perhaps it could be a maturity matter, that the breeder-level cannot itself move, only remain stationary after formation like an ant or termite Queen served by many mobile workers/guards/drones/servants/children.)
