** I just love the last few lines:

  /I created this list in five minutes. Until I came into this meeting I didn't even know what Project Ground Effect was./

  /A human being?/ Draw up an international treaty outlawing that tosh. God help us, there isn't a worse idea in the world. We just created a brand new superpower and you're talking about bestowing it on a /human being?/

** Is this referring to some movie I haven't heard of?

Larry Niven did this one of the "Gil the Arm" detective stories, /ARM/. Covers about half the tropes listed here.

Actually, I recommend all the "Gil the Arm" stories. Pretty much all of them are about munckining superscience.
