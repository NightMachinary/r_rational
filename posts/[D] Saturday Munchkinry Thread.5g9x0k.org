Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** LOW-END SPEEDSTER: You can - switching on and off at will - move, think, and act at four times speed. From your point of view it is the rest of the world that slows down, so you require none of the concomitant increases in strength and durability that speedsters tend to require and you are otherwise an average human being.

Only your body's living, nucleic cells are affected, so your clothes, outer skin, hair and most bodily fluids operate at regular speed other than that the rest of you drags (and pumps) them around. This has some awkward biological effects - slow digestion and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorheology#Blood_viscosity][high blood viscosity]] for example - that make it difficult and potentially harmful to stay in the state for hours at a time. This largely prevents you from noticing that you age four times faster while speeding.

Oh, and from your point of view gravity seems about four times weaker but all momentum (except your cells') seems four times stronger.

**** I'm not a doctor either, and that's what I thought at first, too. A little armchair research has convinced me that the heart and lungs can handle this intense a blood viscosity change, and most of the molecular activities on the exterior of cells are strong enough to deal with similar momentum shifts.

Almost all of the body's second-to-second interactions happen inside cells where time is operating normally. They'll run out of resources if you push yourself, but not immediately.

So long as you're not speeding in moments of extreme stress, and haven't got latent circulatory problems this really oughtn't be a killer. Seconds should be easy (if weird), minutes sustainable with care and training, and half an hour possible but risky.

But hey, at least this version doesn't involve [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ezte9/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dagojjy/?context=3][surgery to your urinary tract]]!

** You have the designs for an antigravity device.

It's about as expensive and difficult to build as a nice TV; You won't be making one in your garage, but it can be mass produced without too much trouble by a fairly small business. The minimum size of the device is about the size of a skateboard. It can be made larger, to increase the load-bearing surface or for other engineering reasons, but its size doesn't significantly affect its operation.

The device can be activated by pumping energy into it and deactivated by pumping that energy back out. It requires no power to stay on. You can get almost all of your energy back, but there are some efficiency losses. While active, the device doesn't go up or down. It is locked onto its current shell of gravitational potential. It basically just hovers, and it can slide around frictionlessly at its current elevation. If you try to move it up a hill, it will go up slightly, to account for the hill's gravity, but not by enough to actually go over the hill. It'll crash.

The device isn't actually /completely/ locked. It acts more like a spring, and the stiffness of the spring is determined by how much energy has been pumped into it when it was turned on. If you put weight on it, it will sag, and if the weight is removed, it will bounce up and down around the elevation it is locked at. The energy in an electric car's batteries is enough to stably support a car. However, the device can't "see" anything more than the gravity in its local area. If you set it on Earth and pull it past the Earth-Moon L1 Lagrange point, then the device will snap towards the Moon. The transition will be violent.

Every bit of energy pumped into the device ties it to its elevation at the time the energy was put in. If you anchor it weakly at a high height, pull it down, and then pump a lot more energy into it, it will not strengthen the current anchor to let you shoot it upwards cheaply. Rather, the new energy will anchor it to the lower height, and counteract the original setting. When energy is removed, every current anchor is weakened exactly in proportion to how much energy they have.

While in operation, the device emits a variety of exotic particles that barely interact with normal matter, preventing it from violating conservation of momentum. If the device is damaged or tampered with in any way while in operation, it explodes. If different parts of the device are pulling it in different directions, it can tear itself apart then explode.

What horrible consequences does this have?

*** You can use them to harvest tidal energy from the moon. Simply charge one at ground level while the moon is on the far side of its orbit, put a mass on top of it, wait 12 hours, then drop the mass off of its new, elevated position (it gets lifted in the same way that water in the ocean does).

You could build a pretty impressive launch pad with one. Simply bolt two anti-grav devices together, one set at 1000 pounds of force going towards 1000' elevation, and the other charged to 1000 pounds force going towards 1000' /depth/. Detach the bolts to fling something into the air (or violently smash it into the ground.

Similar to the above, you can build rechargeable arbitrary-elevation anti-grav devices by having two: one charged up high, and one down low, and selectively discharging one or the other to raise/lower the net target elevation.

An anti-grav device set to deeper than surface level would be useful for cars, acting like a spoiler, but better.

Littering would /suck/. There's no reason why an abandoned anti-grav device would fall down, so they could just clog up the sky and get into collisions with things until they explode.

**** The antigrav device actually runs away from the Moon. As the Moon's gravity cancels some of the Earth's, the antigrav device thinks that it's too high up the gravity well, and lowers itself to where it should be. Of course, your scheme still works, just 12 hours different. Thanks, I hadn't thought of that.

The problem with the slingshot and the arbitrary-elevation set up is that an antigrav's ability to pull you up is exactly equal to how hard it was for you to drag it down. But then I guess it's still a good slingshot that can release all that energy really quickly, so it's still a good thought.

Spoilers may be a bit tricky, since tidal forces change the antigrav's set height. Setting it deep enough that it will always press down may require it to be pulled so tight that it puts enough force on the car to cause problems.

Littering is another good point I hadn't thought of.

You can do this step-by-step: Lift both to 1000', charge device 1 with 100 pounds of force. Drop down to -1000' (fighting against 100 pounds of lift), charge device 2 with 200 pounds of force. Lift to 1000' (fighting 100 lbs of net weight), charge device 1 with an additional 200 pounds (300 total), then repeat as needed.

Couldn't you just reduce the force if that was a problem? Let's say that the moon changes Earth's gravity by +-30' relative to the surface (which seems high, but whatever.) An antigrav device set to pull towards a point 1000' below itself wouldn't change force very much between 970' and 1030'.

Also a fun use: Since their weight and mass are not proportional to each other, you could make some funky pendulums.

*** I could easily see ships getting replaced by anti-gravity sky boats.

You could probably use them as a nasty explosive. Just pump them with power and destroy them at the target to release the stored energy.

Depending on their reliability and human stupidity/sanity it would be likely be used to make blatantly unsafe building designs viable.

*** Earth is on a slightly elliptical orbit. As we get closer to the sun, does an active antigravity device rise off the Earth of its own accord? What about the galactic/intergalatic scale, and does this device prove that the universe as a whole is not accelerating towards some ridiculously far heavy object?

**** As we get closer to the Sun, or the Moon, or anything else, an active antigravity device actually hovers a bit lower. It "wants" to experience a very specific gravitational acceleration. As the Sun/Moon/whatever cancels out more of Earth's gravity, the antigravity device will get closer to the Earth to make up for it. They will hover 130 meters closer to the Earth at perihelion than at aphelion, if I've done my quick math right. That's certainly not insignificant, if you want to leave one running for multiple months. The Moon might make a difference of 3 meters on top of that, and rest of the Milky Way is a rounding error.

The device doesn't quite prove that the entire universe is or isn't accelerating. But it does prove that any such acceleration is constant at all points in space, and therefore doesn't make any difference when the device compares its current gravity with the gravity that it wants, since the same acceleration is factored into both.

***** But points of equal gravitational potential are not the same as points of equal gravitational acceleration. On a lagrange point versus some other random point in the solar system of equal gravitational potential, the latter is 0 in the first case and nonzero in the second.

Can we make a generator out of having the moon's gravitational tides pull an active antigravity device with enough energy in it up and down a linear crank of enormous torque? (If there's a reaction force to this, this draws energy out of the rotation of the Earth, but then so do the tides.)

If you try to activate it on a spinning space habitat, it would anchor itself to whatever the habitat is orbiting, and it would probably be pretty unwieldy. But it could absolutely hold up a spinning habitat without the spinning doing anything bad to it.

***** Given the whole basis of relativity, is that being in a box accelerating upwards, is the same as feeling an equivalent gravitational force on the ground; I'm certain this violates /something/.\\
Or maybe the device would just have to be vastly more versatile, since you can't distinguish between gravity and certain types of acceleration.

Damn somebody competent in physics really needs to look into this, because something is definitely /very wrong/ with the way the device falsely distinguishes between gravity and acceleration but I don't know exactly how.

I also have a strong suspicion that you could somehow get free energy out of this device, because it doesn't treat acceleration and gravity equivalently, even though the rest of reality disagrees with it.

** You have a counter that tells you how many living people you have had physical contact with. Reasonable Fermi estimate is that that number is pretty high. Upon looking at any given living person, you can instantly recognize whether you've touched them or not.

Tomorrow, you're going to be stuck in a 24-hour time loop. During that time loop, you must try to kill everyone you've ever touched. When everyone you've ever touched is simultaneously dead, the loop ends.

When the loop ends, every human will be tortured for e^{n} subjective seconds, where n is the number of cycles it took you to end the loop. This includes all humans who have ever died, who will be temporarily recreated.

How do you minimize suffering? "Keep the loop going forever" is exactly the wrong answer, because there's a tiny but very real chance on any given iteration of the day that factors outside of your control will end the world, killing everyone and ending the loop anyway.
