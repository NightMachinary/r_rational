** This is pretty good, if really angsty. The pacing suffers at times, especially when the main character is not in immediate crisis, but for the most part this is a captivating read.

No knowledge of the setting was necessary when starting from book 1 for me. (I tried reading the original books after the first 2-3 books of this fic, but couldn't really get into it)

*** Yeah, I think my pacing sometimes suffers from the fact that all of my beta readers are selected for being unnaturally fast readers, and/or enjoying hanging out with the characters while they do mundane stuff just as much as I do, and thus have very little incentive to tell me to cut it down ;P

**** I dunno, the first one or two volumes I couldn't wait for the action to start, but after vanyel got dragooned all I wanted was slice of life. I really love this fic, but I have been taking breaks here and there. Super excited to finish off this volume.

** Author's note: this is part 6 of a reaaally long series. Doesn't require having read canon.

It's a fairly nonstandard example of rationalfic, and takes its time building up - book 1 in particular is guilty of being slow and starting off in a totally different genre from the rest. IMO the first 11 chapters of book 1 are skippable, especially if you're read canon and/or don't feel like slogging through a whole bunch of angsty teen romance; it may also be feasible to start at the beginning of book 3 if you've read Magic's Pawn or skimmed a summary of it.

(I'm planning to create an abridged version of the entire series once I've written to the ending.)

** This is really, really good. I read the Valdemar books as a teenager and they are of a genre I call, "Candy fantasy." They are angsty but dramatic angsty and the good people are good, the bad people are BAD. And things always work out.

This fic starts in that universe and is essentially Magic's Pawn for the first few chapters. It starts diverging and essentially takes the BAD person from the original series and makes him what the canon version of him should have been all along. He is rational in a way that doesn't scream, "I AM RATIONAL"

*** Oh man, that is super flattering, aww. Said character has been really interesting to write, but also one of the biggest challenges I've attempted. I have really enjoyed the arc where he starts out rational and the main POV character /doesn't/.

...Uh, I would not quite describe the original trilogy as "things always work out", though.
