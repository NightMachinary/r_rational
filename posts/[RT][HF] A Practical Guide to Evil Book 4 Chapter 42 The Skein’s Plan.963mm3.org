Thief is inside the threefold reflection and unaccounted for. Archer is somewhere, probably geting let in via the staff entrance by Thief right now.

The many complex plans with a convergent end point was a trap to get the Skien to notice the convergent end point and stop trying to channel surf all the complex plans so he wouldn't notice that one plan started late and DIDN'T converge on confronting him in a boss battle.

** How do you stop a Seer from weaving plots that interfere with your assassination scheme? By getting into an extended brawl with it.

I'll note that the Skein said the options were sending Malicia to +Cat's party (Cat, Masego,+ Vivienne, +Akua)+ or to Hakram. Indrani is unaccounted for. She probably has no orders or plan at all (not that she would follow them anyway) but she'll happen onto Malicia and go "don't mind if I do". The undefeated Fuck-The-Augur style of the East, designed by the Dread Empress and now used against her.

On a completely unrelated note, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seKaU-qQuts][Akua as a helpful fairy makes too much sense]].

EDIT: re-reading this, the Skein never mentions leading Malicia to Catherine. He says "The Empress escapes, yet dies to a blade of stolen moonlight." The only person with such a blade is Vivienne, who just acquired it from Spellblade. So Thief is actually gone to do her things, not just hiding. And the Skein doesn't seem to consider Catherine escaping his trap to be a serious proposition.

******* First correction:

Soldiers, siege engines, a wall, and heroes. Not just soldiers.

They Lycaonese have a fortified position which they defend (rather than wandering into their lair and tryign to stab them), and a strategy of containment that combined with the chain of hunger's willingness to eat each other likely serves to reduce the frequency of large powerful ratings like Horned lords. Also dealing with big single threats like a Horned Lord is something heroes are particularly good at where villains tend not to be.

Similarly Black is attacking the parts that aren't defended by the huge array of static defenses that keep the chain of hunger at bey so of coarse he isn't having as hard a time as the Longtooth Lord did.

Second correction:

Soldiers fight in armies to exploit force multipliers. Fighting an army is an entirely different game than fighting a band of Named. If Cat had the 15th with her the Skien would be facing very different tactics. (I mean Cat could have just tossed goblin fire into the room than held the doorway Spartan style for example)

Third Correction:

"happened once in living memory" is not even close to "all the time", Hailie's Comet has a period of 70-ish years so the last time it was visible was within living memory but it's still considered a "once in a lifetime" sight, not something that happens "all the time". The last time a Horned Lord showed up being say 20 years ago doesn't mean it wasn't a hundred years after the one before that, or that there haven't been spans of more than a century between some and only a couple decades between others.

******** Did you not read the chapter I literally godsamn quoted at you? They didn't hide behind the wall, he charged into the army of ratlings, and the horned lord, with his own army. Names were not involved; we know Klaus disdains them, and if he had to rely on them for crises he's practical enough that he'd be singing a different tune.

I'm talking about Black vs Klaus in the mountains. Not black's sack prover plan, although that has other issues.

Part 2: cat has demonstrated a level of power that makes armies laughable as a threat to her. She was literally only stopped from soloing the proceran invasion force by opposing named; the guide tries to say that soldiers are super able to kill them, but much like the claim “heroes are OP” it only happens offscreen.

If callow can be said to fight off invasions alll the time ( and it has in story) despite often spending far longer than that between attempts, then it's entirely fair to refer to the lords attacking the principate the same way.

E: adding on to part 1, names and mages are super rare in the principate, and in addition to klaus' statements about not relying on named, we know that he didn't need any to take on the horned lord. His force was 200 heavy cavalry when he fought horned lord + ratling army.

“Wolofite records agree with the Lord Warlock,” she said. “There are scrolls dating back to Triumphant's campaign in the region that speak of a time in the life of their kind called the ‘metamorphosis', where ratlings will transition from bipedal beings of observed sapience into the animalistic large creatures called the Ancient Ones. The few of those beings that manage to consume enough quickly enough while in that state are speculated to undergo a second metamorphosis into the elusive Horned Lords of lore.”

“Those Horned Lords,” Vivienne said. “Back on two feet, about sixty feet high, antler-like pairs spouting from the head, capable of human speech?”

Unless it named itself as a ratling, and they remembered that when it hit ancient one, /and/ called it that? That seems like a huge stretch to me, especially since she's callign it that in a monologue years later, but doesn't have any name for the ancient ratling in the narration.

The Skein is anything but weak though. It is a shadow of what it once was, but "what it once was" is a demigod. Save for Edward VII (who's likely there because the Dead King was feeling pissy), every revenant we've known by Name or backstory was an A-lister.

Even if this is stronger than average, though, and is still stronger than average afterwords, that still shouldn't matter. Klaus Papenheim is able to take on and an entire army of ratlings and a Horned Lord with 200 horsemen (no named, no mages worth the named, and priests who can't kill even if they're evil). The fact that his forces are struggling with black after a showing like that is a joke; if you're able to go toe to toe with godzilla, the fact that your lines break when facing the legions is ridiculous.

*** The situations are quite different.

The ratlings might be powerful but they're a known quantity. A soldier fighting against them will know exactly what to expect because there's a history of doing it going back to before the Principate.

Meanwhile, the Legions are exactly the opposite. In the assault on the Vales they: redirected a mountain lake and peppered the crusade with goblinfire and munitions, dropped a mountain on the northern pass and used a dragon twice.

It's a different type of war as they're fighting against an intelligent opponent, they're not defending from a wall and their army is primarily composed of levies and mercenaries - not professionals.

The Saint of Swords is known as the Smiling Iron among the Chain of Hunger so Named definitely do come up there on occasion. She also went "up north" to perfect her craft - three guesses as to where that is.

The Ancient Ones are specifically referred to as siege weapons and in the quote you've referred to, the rattlings are trying to breach a wall, so they definitely do defend from walls...

As for named, well,

"Heroes were rare in Procer, at best a once in a generation appearance, and they were treated with distant awe. By most, at least. Soldiers tended to be sceptical of them, given that the Principate had face both heroes and a handful of villains in battle and come off the better without any Named of its own. There was an institutional contempt for nations like Callow who relied on heroes to fight the enemy." - Warden 1

Procer doesn't really use seige weaponry. Seriously, look at their engagements shown in warden. Them going after the walls is not the usual, and fighting away from walls and artillery is their standard tactic. That's not to say they don't make heavy use of the walls (they do), but even before the civil war (fought, as is standard for procer, far away from any city walls) they had plenty of experience fighting without fixed fortifications. "[Klaus Papenheim had] fought ratlings by the shores of Lake Netzach many a time to prevent them from putting enough warbands together to threaten Hannoven." - Warden 2

** Random thoughts:

Curious about the bones. Undead don't (need to) eat, right? So the Skein either retained his hunger after death/Revanancy, or he does it by habit, or all those bones were already there. Considering Edward VII said that the Skein replaced the Bloody Sword, and only Ed and Thief of Stars have been in place for more than 100 years, the Skein must eat a LOT of things to get bones 70 feet deep through his boss chamber.

Also, pretty irrelevant, but I now am nicknaming Edward VII as "Ed the Undying" in my mind. As he's, y'know, undead. And an Ed. Anyone else play Kingdom of Loathing?

Finally, gosh darn it, I'm really liking Ubua lately. Her sass was on point in this chapter, enough so that it even caught Cat flat-footed. Or maybe it didn't, and Cat's purposely playing the straight man and holding herself back from bantering, as she knows leaning into it will bring them closer? Either way, Ubua the banter fairy is a lot of fun to read.
