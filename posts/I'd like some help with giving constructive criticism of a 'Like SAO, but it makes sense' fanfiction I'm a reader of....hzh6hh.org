So one of the authors I follow is making a 'It's Sword Art Online, but it makes sense!' Quest (think slightly interactive fiction) that I'm enjoying reading. However, for the last several pages of the thread, there's been a bit of back-and-forth about, uhm, what 'makes sense'. I'm not really the most articulate at getting my point across, nor am I the best at understanding some of the issues of human psychology under stress that have come up recently between me and some of the readers and the author. Could I get some help? I think the rules say I'm not supposed to link, as this isn't explicitly rational fiction, but it's the 'Swordland Revisited' quest by Birdsie in the Quests section of the Sufficient Velocity forums. The only relevant bits to the discussion I've been in are on pages 89-94 of the threads so far. Thanks!

Edit: In one of the bottom replies, I posted some of the things that the author said as far as themes, many of which I had a problem with.

He's not a misanthrope like 8man from Oregairu, so why would he not notice the multiple women crushing on him? SAOAbridged at least puts that misanthropy in the context of Sachi, which Source!Kirito seems to forget 5 minutes down the line.

** Never made sense to me that the VR gear could kill you, if you tried to remove it.

Like..... short of a small explosive, I wouldn't see how that would work.

And it was disappointing that we never saw people just disconnect/shatter when someone from the outside world called that bluff. Abridged addressed some of that, with the girl having a bad internet connection living in permanent fear of a disconnect.In Abridged this was due "to an unforeseen bug", though. But you can't just cause a mortal fit of epilepsy in just anyone with perfect reliability. (at least, so far noone has managed that, afaik)And since it wasn't intentional, it seems that frying the circuitry with an EMP should do the trick at least in the Abridged-universe.

In SOA they show the next generation being much less bulky. So the whole helmet form factor was apparently just there to trap you?

I just don't see how anyone would fall for that. There must be some of the headsets that were bought, but the buyer didn't have time for the launch date.\\
And for any electronics device you can find a teardown video that would have revealed the explosives.

Microwave ovens work by vibrating water molecules to heat things. It seems obvious to me that applying the same principle to water molecules in the brain at a certain intensity would result in catastrophic damage. No explosives needed.

That would have only happened in the first few hours before Kayaba's "tutorial" when the knowledge of its lethality wasn't widespread yet. And if anything like that was shown on-screen before the "tutorial", the narrative couldn't have pulled off the twist so nicely.

Since the SAO world version of VR is wireless interception and interface of nerve signals sent from the brain, it wouldn't be out of the question for the helmet form to be thought as a way to secure the interface from being misaligned and/or intercepted. Whether it's true or not, it was pretty new technology, so probably very few people knew for sure. (They do mention in the novels that the NerveGear's successors tend to be less satisfying to the senses, though that might be more due to the signal being weakened for (perception of) safety rather than because of loss of the full-head coverage.)

**** Hmm yeah.... a microwave, I suppose. But it has to be a battery-run, microwave which is not trivial, I think. Also it has to be a Faraday cage good enough to withstand whatever EMP-device you could use against it and still have enough charge to microwave the hostage's brain. Also while the outer layer of the headset is sprayed with liquid helium.

#+end_quote

That actually reminds me, I think the novels mentioned that most of the bulk and weight of the NerveGear was from that battery. Though I don't remember exactly where it said that...

I think it's already possible to build a battery-powered microwave oven in this day and age, though (but it's probably still impractical). I think such batteries would be comparable to the batteries used to power an e-bike's motors, which works well enough.

#+begin_quote
  EMP-device
#+end_quote

So I took the time to look up what exactly an EMP would do to electric devices on Wikipedia. While the answer doesn't seem clear-cut anywhere, I think the basic gist of it is that an EMP just /damages/ circuitry, not reliably de-powers it. In those incidents I hear of solar-flare-originating EMPs blacking out entire neighbourhoods, I think what actually happens is that the EMP damages circuitry on multiple locations on the grid and the safeties on the grid trip to prevent anything that's wall-outlet powered from being damaged themselves. Assuming that's true, it's actually the safeties that shut down electronics, not the EMP itself. So an EMP that's powerful enough to break through the standard shielding an electric device has for "natural" EMPs like solar flares is just going to end up damaging the device somehow, and then it's probably fifty-fifty on it just shutting it down or making a fire start somewhere in the device (or outright exploding the batteries)...

And even if an EMP reliably shuts down instead of damages a device, there's probably a logistics problem in managing to do so on all 6000+ players at the same time (otherwise the game's creator might start executing players to get the jailbreak attempts to stop), and in moving all the players somewhere where the EMP attack can take place (since using EMPs on the hospitals they're placed in is probably a bad idea...)

#+begin_quote
  liquid helium
#+end_quote

Not entirely sure, but I'm assuming this to mean an attempt to freeze the machine and its circuitry? Leaving aside whether you'd really want to use something so damaging and seemingly hard to precisely control nearby a victim's relatively unprotected head, would this really work on the NerveGear quickly enough that it doesn't realize it's being tampered with and flips the kill switch before it loses power?

And, again, logistics.

--------------

All this said though, the VR experience in SAO was a speculative science originally written in 2001 (and originally meant to be set in 2012 rather than 2022). Your initial impression on a VR gear's ability to kill someone might've been biased by your prior impressions from the VR gear actually developed in recent years, if I may be so bold to assume.

Also, Catsy's SAO one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle][Man in the Middle]] precisely about trying to break into SAO for a rescue attempt comes very highly recommended. (And I'm fairly sure Catsy was the first one to point out the logistics problem, if not in some forum tangential to SAO then at least in this fic.)

This is a large scale terrorist attack on the level of (and in the worst case far exceeding) 9/11, the national and international response would be extreme.\\
There's no rock Kayaba could realistically hide under, or a country that would allow him to defect. [noone likes to be bombed and China or Russia still have reputation to loose]\\
Everyone would fly in/volunteer personell and specialists from all over the world for that, to keep those people alive for as long as possible. Mostly those are young people so they'll last a while, but in the end, there's going to be attrition of people slowly dying, anyway. [or a MRSA outbreak just killing everybody, if they're sloppy/unlucky]\\
But once someone dies ingame, they die in real life, so you can harvest dozens off the Nerve Gear helmets without any additional risk.\\
You can even rebuild them, disassemble them, test all kinds of attack vectors in a large Faraday cage on the corpses for safety and speed.

I just can't imagine that future tech created by a lone mad genius could resist all the future tech funded with hundreds of billions of dollars, the power of nation states and every technically minded person on Earth having thought about it for a couple of minutes at least once.

Hospitals are built to take patients, and there were some allowances in the death game (described at least in the novel if not the anime, I'm sure) that made it easier for responders to move patients to hospitals without too much risk of accidental death. I think it's another thing entirely to allocate resources and infrastructure out of thin air for a solution to a one-time problem, and all the more so if they want to avoid getting Kayaba's notice in the process, since it's doubtful he'd look kindly on attempts to subvert his death game.

#+begin_quote

I'm not sure I agree with the first part - though Japan is tiny in land size compared to the US, I'm pretty sure there's still plenty of rural/undeveloped areas that would be hard for the entire police force of Japan to search exhaustively (if they were depending solely on witness sightings and physical searches, at least).

As for the latter part, I disagree with the sentiment by the reasoning that sometimes countries and leadership can be really stupid, or at least, they either don't see or don't care about reputation in quite the same way as other countries or other countries' people do.

#+begin_quote

I agree with the idea in general, actually. There probably is one or more ways to be found or developed that can defeat the NerveGear's anti-tampering features. Though again, logistics - it would take time to deploy /en masse/, it'd have to be evaluated to see what are the chances of accidental or unforeseen failure, and how that stacks up against the risk to players of simply letting the game be, and it'd have to avoid possibly making Kayaba shift to more active methods of defending his system, which probably means its highest chance of success is if it's applied to every player at once, somehow. The question to ask isn't whether it's possible or not, because it's most likely possible, the problem is whether it's practical or not - specifically, whether the solution can do the job well enough that implementing it is likely to save more lives than allowing the status quo to continue.

(Though, no offense, the suggestions you were giving before definitely seemed like the kind of suggestions you toss out after less than a minute of thought, with disproportionate focus on the failure modes of the NerveGear problem in comparison to the failure modes of the proposed solutions. I thought those suggestions in particular weren't sophisticated enough to be close to a possible solution, which is why I jumped in with my objections.)

******** Yeah, that's fair. As a person, I do lack sophisication in those EE areas. Even if I wasn't though, there's little point in being sophisticated about what's basically a black box full of cutting edge future mystery tech. Though I wouldn't believe this to be possible, it's not a bad plot device for the kind of setting the anime wants to establish.

Death Note doesn't suffer from the fact, that no outside power even threatened to nuke or invade the Kanto region or at least cut them off from the internet. I know, I know, more unsophisticated one-minute ideas :) Not everything has to be a global simulation for it to be good. It's okay to just roll with a premise and focus on some implications, ignoring others. I did enjoy SAO (and especially the Abridged, which is head canon).

** I've read a lot of stuff on SV, including the quest you're talking about. I assume that you, like me, have the same username here and there.

I haven't read all the discussion pages referenced, but I did skim a few. I think I got the gist of it though.

Essentially, you see the opportunity to make an early intervention and set up a long term plan which will further the goals of the MC and make the quest more enjoyable for you personally.

You are right that you are having trouble communicating. But it seems like part of that at least is not really understanding or at least not addressing the fairly diverse objections you are getting. They include things like:

-There are low hanging fruit that we should get now -All easy options for influencing psychology have already been taken -General distaste because people keep using the word cult -Belief that the guild is a better option than starting something new. -Belief that the existing psychological services are better than starting something new.

Your best bet is to come up with specific actions and rituals that the guild can do on its own to reaffirm it's belief in and desire for the outside world. And abandon any hope of getting the rest of the quest interested in turning the game into a paradise post escape. SV doesn't do that sort of long term goal making, they fight enemies, grab shinies, and Make Hard Decisions.

The AI rights situation will start getting actions once the QM writes a scene with a sufficiently sympathetic and in depth NPC. And not before.

***** Basically, it's a sort of collaborative writing thing based partially off of tabletop role-playing games, and partially off of old text-based adventure games.

The QM (quest master) makes a post on a forum or whatever, detailing a scenario. For example:

#+begin_quote
  You awaken in a jail cell. You are on a bed. You don't know why you are here. What do you do?
#+end_quote

The players then respond with commands, like:

#+begin_quote
  Try to break through the wall!

  Do we have a cellmate? Try and talk to them, if so.

  Examine the cell, looking for anything we can use.
#+end_quote

The QM then picks whatever was most voted for/whatever they like the most/whatever meets their criteria, and then writes the next post using it/them.

#+begin_quote
  You try and strike up a conversation with your cellmate. He says to leave him alone. However, after you spend the next few minutes checking every nook and cranny of the cell for useful items, he seems to be curious enough to talk to you. "What are you doing?" he asks. How do you respond?
#+end_quote

And then this goes back and forth over and over until the quest ends, be it because the players won, lost, or the QM got bored.

A few I would recommend if you want to try reading one:

However, the way you phrase your question (i.e. "Do they gain anything from hearing your unsolicited, probably bad ideas?") makes me think you're referring to a specific form of criticism which while, granted, is often unhelpful, is not the form most criticism takes.

Criticism is about the critic sharing their opinions about the piece, not their ideas. Someone suggesting alternative forms the story could/should have taken is generally bad criticism. It looks past what the work is and only focuses on what it could/should be.

** *Disclaimer:* I almost never give feedback on stories I'm reading, and when I do it's mostly things like "This is a good story" or "I really like this story". But it doesn't seem like it'd be too different than something like figuring out what you like/dislike, and why you like/dislike it, then explaining the results of your introspection. I journal, so do this sort of thing but with my life every day, and I think strategies I use can be applied in this case also. So here's my techniques for doing that, adapted to the context of providing story feedback:

--------------

You could try making a list, or just writing down what you like, and don't like about the story. To do this, you may want to reread it, and take notes on parts that you thought were clever or you just thought were cool or especially emotionally appealing. If this seems like too much work, you could try summarizing the story, spending extra time on things you like, and noting things you didn't like, along with a reason why you didn't like that and/or a recommendation for an improvement. During this phase, you are just trying to figure out what you like, and while it's better if all your thoughts are fully fleshed out (for instance: you may not be able to come up with an alternative to a part of the story you didn't like), the main goal is to figure out what you like.

Often, I get caught up in thinking something along the lines of "what if my thoughts are super dumb, and this plot point that I didn't like was completely necessary for this other thing I loved!" or "maybe I'm being too critical with the author here. I have no idea what I would do different, so it's possible this is the best it could've been." (that is, if I'm trying to write a review that goes beyond "This is a really good story"). If you begin to feel similarly and it holds you back from writing a good review, I think the best thing to do is ignore the thoughts entirely. It would be nice if you made all your opinions 100% consistent on your first pass-through, but really your job here is to decide what you like or don't like about the story. Maybe take note of the notes of discord, but otherwise just push through and try to get a good representation for your preferences.

From here you have two choices: a) just post your raw thoughts, or b) edit your thoughts so they actually make sense. If you're anything like me, b is the way to go (or you could sneak-edit your post later on and hope no one notices). But here is where things will be different for most people. It's even different for myself at different times of the day. How do you turn stream-of-consciousness writing into something that makes sense? My main strategy is to completely rewrite/summarize my stream-of-consciousness multiple times, but do whatever feels right to you.

If I understand your previous comments correctly, then your goal in giving feedback here is to argue in favour of a particular path the Quest story will take. Here, I'd recommend doing something similar to what was described previously. That is, write down what you do and don't like (or maybe just what you don't like) about the path the story's taking presently, and where you think it's going. Engage with arguments against your position. Explain why you think they're wrong about psychology stuff or why you think what they're proposing wouldn't make a good story or whatever. Point to specific points they're making that you disagree with, and try to [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FhH8m5n8qGSSHsAgG/better-disagreement][steel-man]] their argument into something they would agree with & think is better than their own argument, then refute that argument.

Also, understand that you could be wrong about your preferences. The author(s?) and community have done a good job of predicting them in the past (or else you wouldn't still be reading). Your goal should be to try to /improve/ the story. You learn your preferences so that the story can be made better, you communicate those preferences so the author(s?) know how to make the story as good as possible for you, and you argue with others about various proposals so that members of the community can make an informed decision.

*** Well, it's a story-game-quest thing that has participants... So there's that.

Also, like I said before, I'm looking for help getting across my opinions/arguments that players murdering other players and forgetting there is an outside world and becoming despairing layabouts and similar things is an unrealistic theme, not how humans react to stressful external threats to life and limb, and not a good way to ramp up tension, and wouldn't be fun to read about. Can I have help with that?

**** What is the actual theme that people are arguing for? It doesn't seem like others on the forum would phrase it the same way you are.

***** Here are some responses from the GM regarding themes and such in the story:

"A part of human nature is that humans take on the qualities of their environment - if you live in an unstable, chaotic space, you're going to be prone to chaotic, unstable responses. Likewise, someone living around compassionate and caring people is far more likely to be compassionate and caring.

.....

I expect if the game lasts for longer than four or five years, players might start questioning if there was ever a game to begin with. Was there really an Earth, somewhere? A place with no magic, and no system that runs things? Perhaps Earth was an ephemeral dream, and everyone in reality truly is a higher-dimensional being, merely afflicted with memory loss and higher spiritual order paralysis? This would be especially true for kids who were around ten years old when the game began, or people who are already either unstable or seek escapism from their old life.

It may also develop into a form of deadly sloth, where people refuse to challenge Adversaries and Lord Radius to escape the game, since... well, there's no game to escape. What's the point of trying? Let's just live."

(On the suggestion to start a cult to fix things) "It's never too late to become a crusader, laddie! In all seriousness, if you decide to seriously pursue a religious cult, I will not stop you - keep in mind at this point it would mostly be a memetic idea and pursuit, and religious fervor, if any, would only come into play later on, as people begin to lose their marbles.

It's also, quite obviously, a trade-off. If people fervently believe in the idea of the outside world and reaching it, they'll work towards that. This means anyone who disagrees is a heretic: adherents will find it easy to justify, say, the murder of such heretics and forceful seizure of their property. If they weren't prepared to help achieve the Goal, they weren't worthy of life to begin with. You can make tenets about not killing people all you like, but Christianity also has its rules, and Christians are still going to violate them - often in the pursuit of faith, as the aforementioned crusades have shown. There is no perfect religious person, because no person can be perfect."

"Otherwise, I've planned a theme of insane detachment from reality that develops over time, as well as escapism to the point of borderline sloth. You're working on a clock, quite literally, because eventually people just won't care enough to even attempt escape. Why bother with boring, conventional reality, when you can be a demigod in a land of eternal legend? Another theme is going to be searching for the anchors that keep people attached to their past."

(On plans to derail the sloth and lack of cooperation theme with education and propaganda) "Derail it? Probably not, unless you act on it further. Impact it? Yes.

Setting up NATO isn't enough to stop war, conflict, and terrorism; it only acts as a deterrent. At best, those activities change their scope from military to political, which can still cause problems. You're fighting the symptoms with mild effectiveness, and the source of the disease with minor effectiveness. It's just not enough."

(On how people wouldn't descend to PK/murder relativley early on, just because some asshole put a bomb to their head) "You have a very optimistic view of mankind.

Some people are going to be thankful to Kayaba, and outright support him, while fighting any attempts of ending the death game scenario. As I said, escapism is a bitch: SAO is a world whose realism nearly matches that of the real world, but it offers incredible, superhuman power to its prisoners.

Unlike in the real world, the disenfranchised can easily become leaders, masters, and powers to be reckoned with inside of the game - the only cost is for them to ceaselessly grind or murder other players if they're truly desperate. There will be no one to unplug them, and the ability to interact with other, real people, who are weaker than them adds a degree of sweetness. For those who desire total supremacy, you have the NPCs, who are totally inferior to players in most aspects on average.

I'm using a lot of these to justify Laughing Coffin later on. We're going to tone down the "psychotic serial killers because killing is fun and I'm crazy," aspect and instead favor the theme of, "being in this game lets me be powerful, and having power over other people feels fucking good."

And as the person above said, this isn't America after Pearl Harbor. There is no national identity, propaganda, or history to pull people together. Being a gamer doesn't constitute the kind of togetherness a country has, especially in the case of gamers who all come from divergent cultures and places, and each have their own spin-off beliefs on top of that.

This isn't Pearl Harbor; this is a bus crashing into a building. Some people are going to rush inside to rescue survivors, a couple will call an ambulance, but most are going to stand by and watch it happen while scratching their balls in a collective action paralysis; and there's bound to be at least one psychopath - probably more - who's going to gleefully raise his phone to record it, and then post it on social media for the reactions and retweets."

"If [philosophical themes rather than humans being terrible] is how you want it to go, sure. But I'm not seeing many paths for this other than turning this quest into Detroit: Become Human, where lots of people act like dicks to NPCs for no reason other than being dicks, to the point of enslaving them in droves, while other people fight that. I'd normally use this on a lesser scale and shift attention to it only as a side-plot. Transhumanity was already going to be a heavy concept, and related to the entire thing where people start wanting to stay in the game because it seems better than reality. The next update will have a vote that asks players where they want the story to go."
