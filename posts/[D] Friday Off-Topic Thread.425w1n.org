Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I'd like to renew the recommendation for [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/][Undertale]] on Steam. Do not read any reviews or spoilers for the game, unless you're VERY sure the reviewer won't spoiler you. This game is much, much better if you're not spoiled.

Here's what the author put as the description:

#+begin_quote
  Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.

  ((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))

  features:

  - Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.
  - Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.
  - Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality.
  - Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.
  - Created mostly by one person.
  - Become friends with all of the bosses!
  - At least 5 dogs.
  - You can date a skeleton.
  - Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...?
  - Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton.
  - I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.
  - If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.
#+end_quote

I consider it game of the year for 2015, and so do the good game reviewers (like that guy on youtube who never breathes). It's one of the best games I have played.

The nature of the game prevents me from giving it a stronger recommendation, because anything more convincing gives away info about the game, making it less fun. Don't look up reviews, don't look up the OST, don't watch a let's play of it or get ANY info about Undertale. Just play the game.

People on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] who liked it, make comments saying you liked it so that people get an idea how awesome it is without learning more details about the game! That should work!

Get it on steam. Worth the money. Worth the time.

**** Let me make sure I have this straight:

Your priors were that the games that lost were much more popular and should have beaten Undertale completely.

A point of data appeared, Undertale winning the contest, which did not match your belief.

Instead of experimentally verifying this by playing the game yourself, you went looking for evidence to support your prior belief.

You found a sounding chamber that supported your prior hypothesis, most likely consisting of the people who raided the Undertale subreddit after said contest. This group of people confirmed exactly what you already knew to be true, so you continued not playing the game.

You then posted on the rational subreddit that you were not going to test your beliefs but still felt comfortable expressing them.

Is that about right?

***** Didn't really find any sounding chambers, per se. I did research, and saw plenty of salt, but I wouldn't say it helped me validate my own beliefs overmuch.

I never had an overwhelming urge to play Undertale. I was a bit curious, because I'd heard it was good, but I wasn't going out of my way for it. I don't currently care enough to bother playing Undertale to confirm whether my dislike is justified or not, it's mostly a whim, and I would never use the Gamefaqs competition in a serious debate about the merits of Undertale, outside of stating that the results left me, a long time gamer, feeling quite salty and biased.

And yes, I'm more than happy posting unverified beliefs about a video game on the rational subreddit. Again, I never claimed that Undertale was a bad game. I merely showed how my experience in a recent popularity poll affected my previously neutral stance on said game. Which, I'm fine with. It's just a game, after all.

** I'm a big fan of stories as circular, mostly because I like parallels, symmetries, and palindromes in my fiction. I recently read a Dan Harmon post on tumblr ([[http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57779240046/could-you-explain-your-story-breaking-process][this one]]) that clears up a few things about how to make a pleasingly circular story.

So think of a central idea, then break it into halves that please you in some way. One half is your overworld/underworld divide, the other is your revelatory divide.

If the central idea is "Stories" then our overworld/underworld split might be "False Stories" and "True Stories", while our revelatory split might be "Reading Stories" and "Telling Stories".

This gives four simple phases:

1. Our hero starts off as a reader of fictional stories. Then something happens and ...
2. Our hero starts reading /true/ stories (histories, biographies, science books, etc.). Then something happens and ...
3. Our hero starts /telling/ true stories. Then something happens and ...
4. Our hero starts telling /fictional/ stories.

These phases don't have to be (and probably shouldn't be) equal in size, and I'm leaving out the important "something" that happens during the transitions, nor the character stuff that propels our character through their thresholds (and obviously structure is just a suggestion to be junked when it starts getting in the way of the actual story). But I think this is a pleasing way to arrange a character-driven story, especially a longer one.

I've been trying to look for pleasing divisions that work well using this method, which means those that have identifiable and interesting halves to them (preferably more than one). Politics is easy, since there are already lots of two-axis models to pick and choose from. Science also seems like an easy one, since there are theoretical/practical divides and soft/hard divides.

One of the interesting things about this particular structure is that the shape of the story /completely/ changes depending on what order you put them in. Once you're slicing up political thought into four quadrants, you have eight different ways that you can circle through them, each with their own "natural story" of character growth.

*** This might be a very basic question, but Google didn't turn up anything useful, so I'm asking you. What do you mean by "overworld/underworld"? From your example, I gather that the "underworld" is whatever the protagonist travels through during the story?

**** *tl:dr; Yes, the overworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists was in, while the underworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists travels through.*

To back up a few steps, in 1949 Joseph Campbell published /Hero With a Thousand Faces/, which was a theory based on comparative mythology which posited that most myths have a common structure to them. Lots of people expounded on this, including TV writer Dan Harmon, who took Campbell's descriptive monomyth and decided that if stories share a common structure across so many cultures, maybe this is just how stories should be shaped to hook into something elemental in the human brain.

The Harmonian monomyth forms a circle. Starting from the 12 o'clock position and going clockwise, a protagonists is in a place of comfort, something is wrong, they get the call to adventure, they go down the road of trials, they have a death and rebirth, they get some kind of boon, they make their way back, and return, having changed.

The top half of the circle is the world of the known, the natural world, the ordinary world, the protagonist's home, etc., what I call the overworld. The bottom half of the circle is the world of the unknown, the unnatural, the special, the place to be journeyed through, etc., what I call the underworld (and often, especially in myth, it's literally an underworld).

So for some examples:

- In /Die Hard/ the overworld is the office party and McClane's wife. He gets the call to adventure when terrorists attack and goes into the underworld, which in this case are the unfinished upper floors of Nakatomi Plaza. He goes through trials and tribulations, shows his wife he really does love her, kills Hans Gruber, then returns to the overworld again, wrapped in a blanket and surrounded by civilization.

- In most sports movies, the overworld is playing for fun and the underworld is serious competition. Usually the call to adventure happens when they need to raise money, or they get challenged, or something like that, and from that point on they're going through these trials and tribulations until they have the metaphorical death and rebirth, after which they win the championship and return to the overworld, sometimes with promise of another adventure in their future.

- In /The Breakfast Club/ the overworld is normal life and the underworld is Saturday detention, where our heroes get broken down and come out the other side, having changed.

So depending on how you align your axes, you can make pretty much anything into the underworld. If a starry-eyed teenager joins a political campaign and quits in disgust after he's been disillusioned by the election process, the campaign office can be his underworld. Or if we're watching someone take hard drugs until they suffer a near-fatal overdose, after which they battle addiction until they can return to a normal life, the underworld can just be drugs (or addiction). We can make the soft sciences into the underworld by following an undergrad who gets seduced by not having to use qualitative data, until eventually he loses his grasp of the truth and comes to his senses at a crucial moment of change, then returns to the hard sciences (the overworld), having changed.

** Does anyone here have any regular meditative or ascetic practices?

I meditate somewhat regularly and fast very occasionally (~24 hours each time) and have found the former to be very important to my emotional well-being. Also it has lead to weird and wonderful near-psychedelic experiences.

A friend and I are planning on a longer 72 hour water-only fast together mostly to see what its like to be without food for a while and also to see how it affects us mentally. Will we crave food? Will we feel clear-headed or experience brain fog? Etc.

I recommend trying some secular (or religious, if that's your preference) practices like this. They're interesting experiences, and meditation has some cognitive/emotional benefit.

As someone with superbad appetite who as a result does a lot of intermittent fasting... Nobody can tell you that. These kind of things are very different from person to person. Totally depends on your individual reaction to low blood sugar etc. If you dont react badly to 24 hours you should be alright, I suppose. Hope your friend has experience with fasting already?

I'd keep some fructose ready in case things go badly and you really need to get some sugar for your brain right now. EDIT: looked it up, science says glucose is a lot better than fructose for replenishing glucogen storage; only advantage of fructose is that it avoids the insulin spike from too much glucose.

The experience of a 24 hour fast has varied each time for me, though some consistent experiences for me have been that:

a. not eating at all is much easier than small meals or candy during the fast

b. fat can stay off hunger far more effectively than equivalent calories of carbs.

c. meditation help me with the mild hand tremors I get from fasting, and meditating helps me with the unpleasantness of fasting.

*** I've done intermittent fasting (1 meal/day) for a little over 6 months now, and have done around 4 48-hour fasts during that time period, just for my own personal enjoyment. I also did a couple 72 hour fasts 4+ years ago, when I was still religious.

I don't feel hungry at all when doing intermittent fasting normally, but neither have I felt hungry when doing 72h fasts. I personally really enjoy drinking tea (or hot water, if I'm doing a water-only fast) while fasting, much more than I do when not fasting. I generally feel (all at once) light and happy and serene and foggy and like all of the world's problems can be solved by friendship and self-sacrifice when I have been fasting for 36+ hours, and this sensation is heightened when taking casual walks, and diminished when playing games or being unproductive online. I definitely recommend doing this fast over a weekend (eat your last meal before the fast on a Thursday evening, so you can eat again on Sunday evening). This will allow you to distract yourself with e.g. games if you want to.

Regarding clear-headedness vs. brain fog, my experience is that you feel a sort of pleasant fogginess (the same one I described I described in the paragraph above) that you can recognize as such, but that feels, ah, um, /righteous and correct/ if you're in the right state of mind. This fogginess is somewhat conducive to meditation.

Obviously, your mileage may vary, and this is all just anecdote on my part. 72 h fasts can be rewarding, but if you feel like doing a 48 h fast first, that could be a good intermediate step. Good luck :)

**** My meditation practice is anywhere from 10-20 (used to do longer, but I've fallen out of the habit this year) minutes of focusing on the breath.

I put earplugs in, find a nice quiet spot (ranging from the library to a big community garden to my apartment), set a timer on my phone after putting it on Airplane mode, and sit with a straight back. Then I close my eyes and focus on the sensation of my breath going in and out. That's it. I spend a lot of my time being distracted, wandering off into other thoughts, etc. but I always try to bring my awareness back to the breath.

[[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][Description and discussion of the underlying mechanics]] (warning: 933×10959-pixel image)

In a nutshell:

1. Person A asks a question, which is labeled with an ID number.

2. Person B gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

3. Person A gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

[[http://i.imgur.com/oRSHNws.png][Example image]]

A participant can ask or answer multiple questions in the same message, as long as each inquiry or response is labeled with the proper ID number. It's recommended to set solid guidelines for frequency of participation--e.g., "Each participant should ask and answer at least one question every three days." The questions can be delivered through any text-based medium: My own first six "friendships" were/are conducted through Facebook messages, but two ancient precursors to this system were conducted through emails, and "Friendship" Seven was conducted through Reddit messages, whose formatting I absolutely /loved/ after dealing with Facebook's plain text for such a long time.

Obviously, this arrangement offers over ordinary friendship (as far as I'm acquainted with that system--which isn't very far) the advantage that upon neither party is imposed the burden of participating in disliked activities at the demand of the other party. What could be a lighter task than asking and answering questions? Who doesn't want an opportunity to say what he thinks, or to extract the thoughts and opinions of a fellow human? And coming up with even many /hundreds/ of questions isn't /too/ difficult--I am /by no means/ an original person, but I've still managed to think of several hundred unique questions over the three years during which I've been conducting these relationships.

--------------

A quick overview of "Friendship" Six, my most productive:

- Part 1 (721 questions between 2015-02-20 and 2015-08-24, averaging 3.9 questions per day): [[http://i.imgur.com/whHrWCn.png][Graph of question-asking ratio]], [[http://pastebin.com/5UFFzJst][list of asked questions]]

Here, there was a hiatus because I was both low on creativity for thinking of new questions and disgusted with myself for putting up for so long with so many people for whom I had little personal liking--so [[http://i.imgur.com/GH6Kux6.png][I ended all three of my active "friendships"]]. Soon enough, though, I found the social contact available through my semi-regular participation in [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to be insufficient, and was forced to come crawling back.

- Part 2 (198 questions between 2015-10-14 and 2016-01-19 [the day on which I typed this comment and uploaded the following three items], averaging 2.0 questions per day): [[http://i.imgur.com/0vaDkWA.png][Graph of question-asking ratio]], [[http://i.imgur.com/iqiHXgh.png][record of activity]], [[http://pastebin.com/t3X32v5r][list of asked questions]]

--------------

My plans for the future of my social life are somewhat uncertain ([[http://i.imgur.com/tZ3U3kO.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/aF9QZyw.png][2]] [[http://i.imgur.com/TwikKNt.png][3]]). It's most likely, though, that I'll try to go after a "Friend" Eight a few days or weeks after "Friendship" Six eventually ends.

*** I've looked over what you've written, and have become fairly confident you are either socially starved and have warped views of socialization due to inexperience, or have a mind that values other intelligent beings in a way that neurophysiologically differs from most humans.

If the first, follow my other advice. If the second, I think you should consider what you desire in human companionship. Is it intellectual validation? Is it just people with whom to share your accomplishments, thoughts, or opinions?

From what you've written, it appears you feel curiosity for other humans, but do not empathize, sympathize, or otherwise care for their well-being; for example, if the sole life goal of someone with whom you had spent quite a bit of time was to revolutionize the field of knitting, and that person were to gain renown by succeeding in a knitting competition, would you feel genuine, visceral joy for their accomplishment?

Even if the answer is no, it doesn't mean the above supposition is correct. It might, however, inform your introspection and recollection of what you value in companionship, and help target your efforts towards more directly and efficiently satisfying that value.

Some hypotheticals and a corresponding suggested course of action for each:

- You want to share and have others recognize things you spend effort in producing: use LW study hall or join a related forum in which to post your progress.

- You would like conversation partners for discussing anime you enjoy: ask people in the LW IRC channel, or the people of the IRC channel dedicated to that anime, whether anyone would wish to join in such a discussion (careful not to interview).

- You enjoy the intellectual stimulation of engaging in interactive discourse with other sentients: take improv classes.

*** Have you ever had RL friendships that don't rely on dialogue?

I have friends who I rarely, if ever, have extended conversation with-- instead we have shared activities we do together that bond us together in a nonverbal way.

Examples: biking, gym, playing music together, cooking food together, etc.

I obviously also have friendships that are based mostly on shared interests/obsessions we can argue and discuss together. Examples: a friend I discuss effective altruism and morality with, a friend I discuss drug use and weird states of consciousness with, a friend I discuss social situations and gossip with, etc.

And then there are the rare friendships that encompass both shared activities and interests, both nonverbal and verbal interaction.

Have you tried developing nonverbal (by which I mean not based on conversation, not entirely quiet) friendships in real life?

It has purpose beyond fun and friend making: it'll anesthetize you to ugh-fields regarding in-person social interaction. Don't plan on making friends - rather, don't go in with that as an ulterior goal constantly in the background of your working memory - but if you find you enjoy talking to someone there, and feel you can continue to do so at an outside venue, tell them you enjoy your conversations and ask whether they like to do activities that you may do together. In actual conversation, that sentence might look something like, "This is fun. I enjoy our little conversations; want to meet up and get some calories or liquid, so we can talk more than once a week? We can do other things too, but I don't really get out much."

One of the nice things about a good friendship is that the other person knows you well enough that if you decline to participate in a particular activity they'll think nothing of it and invite you to do something else later. Also, while real conversation involves more than just a reciprocal exchange of questions and answers, this works in real life too. I've made friends with strangers by just walking up to them, introducing myself, then just asking a question that interested me about their field of study or how they dyed their hair, then continued that into a conversation. Questions are good ways to meet people, but friendships should eventually evolve to be more than just that. Glad to see you're trying though.

It's not intimate; not personal or sensual. It's almost anti-sensual. The details you include are all logical, spatial, and mechanical. Why is this girl talking to herself? Who even talks like this? It's blatant puppetry, and smacks of, well, masturbation.

Question 76b was "How would you compare self-pleasure, intercourse, your favorite candies, and your favorite foods?" "Friend" Six, Kira bless her heart, went above and beyond by providing /in a spreadsheet/ an exhaustive list of methods of self-pleasure and intercourse, equated with various foods. Among these methods was "Self-stimulation of general crotch area with pillow or blanket", which was rated at "2 to 3 out of 5" on "level of pleasure". This generated from me the follow-up question of which the screenshot captures a portion. In the screenshot above, I included only (what I considered to be) the feelings-heavy part; it started with "Under what situations would 'stimulation of general crotch area with pillow or blanket' even occur? (As I said before, ..."

*** This is really interesting, and I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.

It's been my experience that because people seek out particular benefits from their connections, rewarding relationships arise when both partners' objectives align. Verifying (either by asking or through a test) that a friend's motivations are in line with your own creates trust- which allows further interactions with less degree of risk. You wouldn't ask someone you just met to help you bury a body, as an example, but instead work out an arrangement with someone doesn't want to see you arrested.

Would you say your relationships are driven chiefly by the participants' underlying curiosity? Do you have a selection process in place to adopt friends who value that exchange of information as opposed to valuing something else, like physical companionship?

*** Referring to them as "Friend 1", "Friend 2", and so on seems a bit dehumanizing/clinical, no?

I any case, I think lists of questions are great under the right circumstances -- I've made ample use of them on long road trips and hiking trips on occasion, and they've provided a springboard for plenty of 10-15 hour long conversations. I think one issue with the ones you're using is that a lot of them are really boring and don't really provide fertile ground for followup discussion. I've probably most enjoyed going through Greg Stock's books (e.g. [[http://smile.amazon.com/The-Book-Questions-Revised-Updated/dp/0761177310?sa-no-redirect=1][1]], [[http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Love-Sex/dp/089480619X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][2]], [[http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Business-Politics-Ethics/dp/156305034X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][3]], which you can pick up used for a few bucks each), as well as the [[http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=if...+questions&rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aif...+questions]["If..."]] series and books of [[http://smile.amazon.com/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453572385&sr=1-1&keywords=pig+eaten+thought+experiments][thought experiments]]. Each question usually provides 5-120 minutes of conversation, with median time being, I dunno, 15ish minutes.

And I'll second recommendations on getting out and doing other things while conversing with people *in person*. It doesn't have to be too active -- a walk will do.

*** I don't have enough books (I have, including my college apartment + home, maybe 2 full large bookshelves each bookshelf having 5 rows, each row ~ 15-25 books per row) to need a really grat system.

How many books do you own?

I find having a running GoogleDoc of great quotes, arguments, etc. is great for having stuff I reference over and over again. Also using my Goodreads as a repository for my thoughts on book in the form of reviews helps.

And I use Anki to remember information I really like.

**** FYI The universal metric for "amount of bookshelf" is to give a length. Easy to calculate most of the time.

*** I don't; I just have electronic copies, because physical copies are too expensive for my tastes unless I explicitly want to show the author my appreciation in some way.

I organize my books by using Calibre which helpfully sorts it by title, author, size, or by custom columns for me.

However all of my books are sorted into 'libraries' which are shown below. '->' means what subcategories I further divide a category into.

- Fanfiction -> Fandoms
- Series -> Lengthy (5 books or more), Short (4 books or less)
- Comics -> Manga, Non-manga
- Webserials (SB, SV, QQ, or just copies of online stories)
- Stand-alone Books -> Some popular authors, some are sorted based on protagonist's age (it's different when reading about an adult versus a child), some are more typical genres

I'm probably going to eventually resort the 'Stand-alone Books' category since there are too many books in there.

I have another library where only my absolute favorites are stored and one for only rational fiction. They are different because they can include stories that I already have in other libraries.

TL;DR - I sort based on what tends to be the most memorable characteristics which for me, is where did I first find the book?

**** What's the best way you've found for creating electronic copies of webserials, out of curiosity?

Ficsave is the only usable tool I've found so far, but unfortunately it only works on Fanfiction.net

***** [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] works best for downloading the most fanfictions since the plugin, FanFicFare, takes care of that for you. However for most webserials, I just make my own copy in Microsoft Word through copy-and-pasting. Although, the most popular ones like HPMOR, Ra, or With This Ring will have an offline copy available by the author or by the fans.

***** Um....I don't understand what you mean by your question or why it's in spoiler text. Are you asking for recommendations of my favorite stories from me?

*** I usually manage to separate textbooks from fiction. I currently have insufficient space for everything, though, so my method is cardboard boxes.

*** Unfortunately, in order to maximize use of limited shelf-space, my books are currently organized by physical size, which upsets me greatly but it's the only way to make sure they're mostly all visible.
