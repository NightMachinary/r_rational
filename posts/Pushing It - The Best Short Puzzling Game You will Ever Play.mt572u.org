** Ehh...we might let a game submission slide if the /narrative/ was rational fiction, or if they were doing something particularly clever with the game design on a meta level or something.

Merely "needing to use brains" applies to every puzzle and strategy game ever made, and that's too low a bar for submissions here. We'll stick to rational fiction.

Feel free however to post in the Friday Off-Topic threads about it, however.

** It's short with only 12 levels, but unlike most other games where they baby you by taking several levels to introduce each new mechanic, this game will ramp up the difficulty and creative puzzle design at a very quick pace.

Why am I posting it to here? Because I figured you guys liked using your brains and this really is one of the best short games I have ever played.
