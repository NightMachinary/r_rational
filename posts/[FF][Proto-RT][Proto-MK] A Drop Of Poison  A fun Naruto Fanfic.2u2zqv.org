** First, thanks to Draconomial [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2tww4h/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch3/co449dc][for the reccomendation]].

This is another fanfic where Naruto uses shadow clones to prank people in progressively more amusing ways. I put "proto" in front of the RT and MK tags, because while he does munchkin and use the scientific method the fic pulls tons of random stuff out of its hat (mainly to give Naruto things to play with). Enough that it doesn't actually explore the space of things Naruto could be doing better or more intelligently with the original constraints.

It feels like an [RT][MK] Naruto, but really it's a different optimization problem altogether. I found it a ton of fun but there are some issues. Namely there's a notable lack of copy editing, and relatively little effort put into characterization of secondary and tertiary characters. When Naruto has a cool idea, others seem to go along with it with surprisingly little resistance.

*** I'm on chapter 8 right now, and enjoying it very much. There are a few power ups that I wish were not there because I think they are unreasonable, make things too easy, and there's no justification for them. Specifically:

- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]
- [[#s][]]

These things bug me when I trip over them, but if I make the effort to let go on those issues then the story is a lot of fun.

**** Same feeling I had; it has a very slight touch of Mary-Sue where everything feels just a biiiiiiit too conveniently easy. There's a particularly glaring bit a few chapters past where your examples end and I had to take a break and read something else for a while, but like you said, a fun read overall.

Interestingly, I've read one of the author's other works, and now that I think about it had just a little bit of the same problem.

***** Which bit was that? The gambling bit? If so, yeah that's a bit much. (Unless later on there's an explanation? Just now reading that bit, so might be an actual justification later?)

*** I am reading this right now. You are right in that it could do with some revision but it is amusing to read none the less.
