Right now the top post on HN features 2 websites I think you will find interesting:

[[http://www.hnreads.com]]

[[http://ramiro.org/vis/hn-most-linked-books/]]

(first one mostly fiction, second mostly nonfiction)

  Are hackers (or maybe just *software workers)
#+end_quote

Or possibly *people who spend a whole lot of time commenting on Hacker News.

(I'm not serious. /Many/ other hypotheses exist, e.g. maybe you'd see the exact same thing in the book list of any community, maybe the rate of depression is standard but hackers are more likely to seek books about it, or more likely to settle on one specific book as a community... Way too little data.)

**** Another theory that immediately came to mind is that a programmer might approach depression the same as any other issue in their profession and try to solve it via research/books. There's no other field I can think of that has as many self-taught professionals alongside college educated ones, and everyone of these are(or should be) used to looking up any problems that arise while coding in order to solve it themselves.

*** Hacker news is very oriented toward startups and founding a startup (or working in one) is very much a stressful roller coaster... There's been quite a few discussions over there about depression, anxiety and burn out because of that. So it's not that surprising that a therapy book would be relatively high.

**** Hacker News is very oriented towards the Silicon Valley crowd. Go there thinking, "This will tell me what the Silicon Valley crowd thinks and is into right now", but assume that they're in a privileged little filter bubble.

***** I have observed a higher-than-normal occurrence of privileged little filter bubble posters on HN than on other sites, yes. There are a lot of people on there that say things like "Just follow your dreams, you'll have a lot more fun and do something worthwhile with your life while you're at it, I wonder what awesome things we'd have if people didn't watch TV all day and did things that they actually enjoyed". Their viewpoint is still poison, just a different kind than you usually see.

****** I'm always a little weirded out by the tacit assumption that my dreams are to live in Silicon Valley, found and run a VC-backed software startup, and bring it to exit.

#+begin_quote
  As for the top book, "The Rent Is Too Damn High," has anyone here read it and found that it actually has worthwhile implications?
#+end_quote

It's short but well-researched and pretty accurate.

** Meta level question, why should I expect recommendations from hacker news to be better than from any other site?

*** An average [[/r/rational]] reader is probably much closer to an average HN reader in intelligence, mindset and tastes than to other random internet communities.
