** Chapter two of Spellcraft and Heavy Artillery - hope folks enjoy it. As time goes on I will be going back and doing some edits... however these come out pretty raw. Basically, I've corrected anything spellcheck identified, and that's about it.

** I've got to say, this is probably the best Fantasy work I've read all year. I'm looking forward to more. If you launch a patreon I'll definitely pledge.

*** Thanks, that's awesome! I have a patreon account, but it's not really set up yet. Still trying to decide on what my offer is, and my overall goals.

The plan is a new chapter every Friday... I'm a few weeks ahead right now.

*** Alright, I did get my Patreon up and edited, so that it makes sense... guess I need to publicize it now. Anyway, here's the link - no pressure or obligation of course. [[https://www.patreon.com/logic11]]
