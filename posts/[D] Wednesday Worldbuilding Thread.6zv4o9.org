Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Anyone up for brainstorming spells? I'm working on a system whose spells (1) are usually minor and even niche in utility and (2) require rituals to perform (meaning that there's set-up involved in casting magic and you have to plan ahead). I've got ninety or so spells so far, some pretty good and some pretty bleh, and I'm hoping that the subreddit might get me thinking in directions I haven't considered yet.

Examples of what I've got so far:

- Drop individual thoughts in someone's head (nothing more complex than a couple of words, so this is best for emotions or very simple concepts), once every few seconds for as long as the ritual is performed.
- Notice if someone is doing that (or something similar) to you, or has done so recently.
- Call animals (mouse-sized or larger) to your location, with extra work to fine-tune it what you're calling (usually down to a particular species, but one magician uses it as a lost pet finder). The animals aren't controlled by the spell, just called, so beware of calling e.g. bears. The ritual must be performed for as long as it takes the animal to arrive, and the animal will not forgo food or sleep, or enter into danger, to answer the call (so expect delays if it isn't reasonably close already).
- Temporarily revive a dead person in order to ask some questions (but be quick about setting up, because you're talking to a decaying brain, not an immortal spirit).
- Transmute blood into a multicolored substance that doesn't really have any practical purpose, but makes for a hella neat oil paint.
- Immediately learn where your keys are.

*** - Appear in the dreams of everyone sleeping in a several mile radius. However, their memories of the dream will usually be vague unless they wake up while it's ongoing.

- Turn lead into gold coins stamped with the enchanted runes of a bank. You can use this as currency, but the runes will instantly alert the bank, and you'll eventually have soldiers trying to arrest you for counterfeiting. Creating gold without the runes is easy, but as a result, isn't used as a currency except in distant lands where the spell is unknown.

- Take a spirit from limbo, and trap it in an animal body. You can't specify which spirit, but most were alive in strange alternate universes, so if the resulting intelligent animal is cooperative, you can often learn about scientific or magical discoveries unknown in your own universe. Most familiars are created with this spell.

- Restore ruined buildings and furniture to the height of their grandeur. Restoring entire large buildings is very time-consuming, so you'll sometimes see wizards living in single opulent towers emerging from the ancient ruins of a palace or temple.

- Continuously perform a ritual that allows you to go about your daily life- eating, sleeping, working, even performing other magic- but which constantly requires some very strange behaviors and complicated taboos. While performing this ritual, you won't age.

I like this one. I feel like it has potential as a self-insert uplift fic. You travel to a fantasy realm and have the goal of getting them to industrial age or further, but are hindered by being a rat or something.

*** - A spell that slows down how fast fluid flows through a pipe. (Don't use it on people's veins. Unless that's why you're using it.)
- Flips every coin in a small area exactly once. (Think tabletop simulator, if you've played that.)
- Instantly drenches someone in sweat. Difficult to aim.
- Identifies every book on a bookshelf with something wedged between the pages, by throwing those books on the floor.
- Causes both the target and the caster to have difficulty distinguishing left and right.
- Makes something fall up temporarily, but the ritual involves dropping something heavy and thus the spell doesn't violate the conservation of energy.
- Causes all of a target's clothes to average their cleanliness. (Great if you spill ketchup on yourself, but you'd best still do your laundry.)
- Transfers the carbonation from a fluid to another fluid. If the second fluid doesn't have a decent capacity for dissolved gases, get ready for a mess.
- Gives you a tan, but not an even tan.
- A spell that is cast on an individual. When cast on a woman, it reveals the time since she last ovulated. When cast on a man, nobody wants to tell you what it reveals but it often says â€˜less than twenty four hours.' On some people (children for example) it does nothing.
- Randomizes your hair color. Can only be cast once per day.
- Teleports small change on the ground into your hand.
- Transmits the force of a punch a short distance.

However, I think there's a distinction between "very useful" and "very powerful". Doing this to someone else is basically no different than setting up an email that will be sent to someone at a particular time-- the contents of that email might be extremely important, but it's not a difficult or complicated thing to accomplish.

****** Ok Brain-google, remind me to head back and retrieve the magic sword of destiny which is the only weapon that can stop the evil dragon and save the land. Because I have attention problems and without a reminder I might forget to retrieve the magic sword until it is too late and the kingdom will be DOOMED. I would let someone else handle the quest to defeat the dragon and save the land in my place, but I am the only one capable of wielding the magic sword of destiny because it is magically tied to my bloodline and I am the last surviving member of my line so no one else is qualified. What do you mean, reverse engineer the sword and make copies? The magical sword of destiny kills anyone who touches it who isnt part of my bloodline. Yes it does, it's a defense against greedy thieves who might try to steal the sword. I know it's barbaric, this sword was forged a very long time ago and their ethical standards back then we're different. I would reverse engineer the sword myself, but I don't know how the sword will react to that and we don't have enough time! The dragon's undead hordes will be attacking the kingdom of light in only a week, and if they fall there will be no kingdom left that can stand against the dragon and his forces! Not to mention the crown princess will be either dead or married to the dragon by then.

How do I remember all this? I take mental notes! And the reason I don't forget them is because they're magically preserved mental notes!

Tldr: you underestimate the power of automatic reminder setting in a slightly more realistic medieval fantasy world. You think if LoZ were real that Link would remember every single McGuffin he needs to collect without writing it down on that inventory page he's always carrying around? Or without Navi to remind him?

But you know, I do basically that on my phone every day, and it hasn't made me superpowerful or anything. Nor does it take a lot of effort. I really think there is a difference between "really good" and "really hard to do", and this falls into the first category but not the second. The OP put "speak with a recently dead person by accessing the memories in their decaying brain" as "relatively minor", and there's no way a system of magic requires more work for a delayed message than to animate a entire brain's worth of neurons.

*** - Temper a piece of steel. Takes a few hours but if you know what you are doing for it can make the most of a piece of metal or much easier to ruin the temper on an item. While I like crafting/industrial magics that aid or replace a crafts person their use in a game can be limited. Dry wood, harden clay, fix cracks, connect/cut two pieces of similar fabric, and so on can be game relevant examples.

- Control Fire. Can control a fire to make it burn hotter or colder using more or less fuel respectively. The fire can also be directed like it was in a moderate wind. The effect lasts until the fire burns out or the ritual is stopped. But by adding small amount of specially prepared powder can cause colour changes, images to appear in the fire, to burn with no smoke, to be extinguished, or other magical effects. Each effect takes its own unique powder. The larger the fire the longer the preparation required.

- Preserve food. A set of symbols drawn on an object to preserve the organic materials within, the final rune seals the object and will be broken when it is opened. Most commonly used along side other methods of preservation as it extends the shelf life by half. Some magical ingredients cannot be used with it as it changes their nature while other alchemical recipes require such treated reagents. While it is the same ritual to preserve a body for funereal rites most people are not aware or do not talk about the overlap.

- Drive out vermin. Spread the smoke from incense over an area by walking through it. Once all the incense has burned small animals and insects will be driving from the affected area and will typically flee some distance if able but are only prevented from returning until the incense has dispersed. It can be used anywhere but wind will quickly disperse the smoke rendering it ineffective or requiring large quantities of incense to be quickly burned.

- Find north. An object will align itself with north as it floats. It must be able to freely move such a leaf floating on calm water or a feather falling in still air. There is a companion ritual that lets you set a large object as a companion by inscribing runes on it so you can choose to have it point there instead. The ritualist either needs a specially prepared "needle" or a copy of the central runes from the companion.

- Cure a specific disease. Each disease requires a different ritual. An example might be to draw water from a blessed well each day at noon to wash yourself and then throw the water into the ocean at midnight. If any water is spilled or uses that bucket other will contact the disease as well. Best to burn the bucket once done.

- Create a ritual area. Designate an area to confine a ritual to. Draw a circle, scatter ashes, sprinkle holy water, cast a spear into the middle of a battle field, travel a path while bleeding between dusk and dawn, or what ever. There is a lot of room to play around with this one and likely a number of variants for different groups and uses. Possible effects 1) other spells effects are stopped from entering 2) rituals conducted within it can expand to cover the whole area 3) Rituals cannot affect or leave the boundary 4) only those permitted can freely use magic. I took inspiration from Shawdowrun's wards and D&D's Guards and Ward spell.

I had an image of a wizard running down a path in the woods trying to cover all of the ways to his home dripping blood before he is caught. Then being able use other rituals to hid that path from others, scry his enemies along it, call up the plants or animals to attack travelers on the path, and otherwise use it to defend himself.

- Lose an object - If a person has an object on them they will lose it. Forget to pick it back up, put their keys in an odd place, or dropping something while fumbling in their pockets. This can be targeted at a particular item you are familiar with, can see, or just to make a person generally forgetful about a few items of opportunity. The target will be forgetful of or maybe not recognize the affected object until shortly after the ritual ends but another person can remind them about it normally.

- Calm an animal

- Protect you from the sun or keep you warm. Spells for general protection from the environment.

- Crate a ping. Set a specific condition or name a person and when it is around you you know it has happened. A specific ritual or effect used against you, that asshole Bob is near by, the fire had gone out. You don't know any specifics, just that it has happened within the limitations of the ritual.

- Break a spell. Stops a spell from current effecting you and gives some protection from that spell affecting you again in the near future.

- Spell resistance. Makes a talisman that provides some protection to you from spells and breaks when it fails to protect you. The stronger and more magically resistant the materials used to make the talisman are the better it works. The maker can choose to shatter at any point and time that they wish to. Or maybe it protects you from everyone but the maker.

Do you use sympathy and contagion in you system?

- A ritual to see if an antidote will cure a poison, it does not tell you what the antidote is only if the ones you have on hand will work. Takes a minute or two to start but once going can check different cures quickly.

- Was a particular weapon used to make a particular wound? The connection between wound and weapon lasts a couple of weeks for an inanimate weapon and a dead body but less for living tissues, if cleaned or disturbed, and can be broken by ritual cleansing.

- Keep a person alive. Connects a person to a living organism such as a tree or their bodyguard so they share life. You will last longer and be tougher but are still most definitely mortal. This can be one sided in a recipient/donor setup so the recipient does not suffer over much from the donors injury or shared equally between them.

- Write a victims name and a curse on one side of a tablet and you name and grievance on the other side and place it in the drink. This can be as general as a well or as specific as a wine jug. As long as the victim has drunk from it, the tablet remains in place, and the spirits that govern these things find you grievance true the victim will be cursed.

- Rituals to cleanse yourself or break you connection to a specific item so things do not trace back to you.

*** - A basic illusion, clearly distinguishable from reality because only the outlines of the object are visible (like a wireframe). Won't fool anyone, but useful for a mage who needs a visual aid or to draw runes in the air. Fades over the course of several minutes (depending on humidity) or pretty instantly if it comes in contact with water. Theoretically lasts forever in a vacuum (or literal zero humidity).
- A null ritual. It does nothing, but it remains a ritual (albeit a brief one). Always succeeds.
- Another null ritual. Also does nothing. Always fails.
- A ritual that specifies two other rituals and succeeds if and only if exactly one of the two specified rituals succeeds (i.e. it fails if both rituals fail or if both succeed).
- A conditional ritual. You would need to first perform the conditional ritual, specifying the conditions; then the (a) ritual; then the (b) ritual. If the conditions are true, the (a) ritual activates; if the conditions are not true, the (b) ritual activates. (One of the null rituals may be used as either (a) or (b) if desired). Conditions are limited to what could be discovered by scrying (i.e. can't depend on anything magically shielded or that has not yet happened). It also can't read thoughts very well.
- Scrying. As long as the ritual continues, you can observe an image of the target in a bowl of water. Sound is not included (but you can attempt to read lips). The target image cannot move, relative to the ritual. (Not-so-wealthy merchants entering into sensitive and secret negotiations will often do so in a moving carriage to prevent being scried on. Wealthy merchants will hire anti-scry spells. Wealthy paranoid merchants have anti-scry wards placed on their carriages.)
- Anti-scrying; no scrying spell can target inside the area of the ritual. Scrying spells targetted outside the area can still look in; this is therefore usually extended to an area a little bigger than a sealed room.
- Charge transfer; electrons are magically attracted to or repelled from the target, causing it to develop an electric charge (and the surrounding area to develop the opposite charge). Famously used to defeat the Invincible Black Knight in a severe (nonmagical) thunderstorm.

***** If many people know about the ritual and it is simple, it is in practice almost useless, since you don't know who sent you back the color, and jumping back might only undo a few seconds.

A big council of mages can probably put enough weight behind their intended use of the spells to gain enough divinatory information to pump enough money out of the stock market to keep running.

If the world starts out casting more of the first spell than of the second, but eventually starts casting more of the second than the first, that will keep time trapped around the point where they are cast equally much, until the world is outcome pumped into casting the first spell more, but from the perspective of the "last" timeline this is just another Fermi paradox, perhaps with some bits in the past that are about as important as Prophecies.

The setting might be /warped/ to look different than it otherwise would, but the average citizen or protagonist might not think about it much, much like IRL most people don't care about AGI, even though our setting is about it.

** Thinking of a magic system where spells are cast by drawing runes onto objects. The runes act as a conduit for the magic, the caster provides the energy but the effect is limited (not completely determined) by the rune. The closer the rune matches the effect the more efficient the spell is. The exact nature of the effect is determined by the casters intentions. The rules for runes:

Must be composed of colored lines representing spell elements. The lines can bend at 90 degree angles but can not intersect any other lines, including themselves. Each elemental line can only be used once in a rune.

Must create a perfect, filled square. The square can be any size larger than 1x1, though 2x2 runes are usually inefficient.

The effect of the spell is limited by the type and amount of each element used; this is limited by having spell effects that don't match the rune be inefficient (energy usage to spell effect).

The runes are drawn by finger, and must be drawn on a reasonable flat surface. The elemental lines are just glowing light that fades after the spell is cast.

"Rituals" are possible where multiple casters contribute to a large rune, the spell will take energy from each of them proportional to how much of the rune they drew.

There are many elements, some used more than others. Heat/fire, water, earth, air, velocity, and light and thought are the most commonly used.

A typical fireball spell would be a 4x4 with two 3x1 lines of earth and velocity (create a rock and throw it away from the caster) with fire surround them (10 long line of fire/heat to heat up the rock and set it on fire). A master caster would be able to make the rock out of a flammable solid that they were familiar with. Complex materials like wood are extremely difficult to create, but not impossible.

Thoughts on this magic system? Ways it could be abused?

*** Well, as a reader, it's hard to tell what the system allows or forbids. The fireball 4x4 runes seem like they could easily be turned to firing a spray of flaming gravel, like a napalm shotgun. Or it could be a shaped charge tungsten jet (pure metals seem easier than wood or multi-element rocks).

Would that be more or less expensive than the basic fireball?

Sprays of acid also seem favoured. One line of water, one of earth, one of velocity, say a 3x3 square. Most acids are pretty simple.

Since velocity is an element, what else is? Is, say "rot" an element? What if I draw a 3x3 spiral of rot? Does that give me a death touch spell?

For that matter, is "death" an element? What about destruction, or light? Useful lasers are actually pretty low power, just high organization. Can I draw one line of light, one for velocity (or maybe one for position) and aim a bunch of laser at my enemies eyes?

Can spells be mostly or completely predrawn? It might be difficult or too time consuming to draw a fireball as the dragon is swooping down on me.

If position is an element, multiple casters could get together and draw a big square of earth and position and drop city-killing rocks. That's a lot of power for a small group and there doesn't seem to be any sort of surveillance spells directly available.

**** The caster can make any material they want, but has to be very familiar with the material and how it reacts to basically everything. You can't just say "make me acid" you'd have to know either be very familiar with the acid and have a strong concept of what the acid is, or you could create the ingredients for the acid in the same space (would have the same restrictions on the ingredients). Basically, a student couldn't look at some acid in a vial and create it, but someone who cleans glasses with acid daily would be able to create the cleaning acid.

I should have been more clear element wise, elements are basically things that make up the universe without being composed of other elements. Death, life, rot, etc would not be elements since they don't actually exist, they're just concepts. I'm still waffling on time, it really should exist, but it would be really powerful. If it did exist it would be extremely difficult to use. Position does not exist, all creations materialize very close to the rune in any medium less dense than the created material. Velocity is really kinetic energy.

Also, something I forgot to mention, a line can not be parallel right next to itself, it has to have a different element between it and itself. Can't make a massive square out of just one element.

Spells can be prepped for a while, but each line of a rune that has not been completed drains some energy over time. You couldn't hold 99% of a rune to massively heat something right in front of you constantly, though you could hold it for 5 mins pretty easily.

You are right on with the casting time being an enormous issue. Anything larger than a 5x5 gets pretty difficult to cast. There would be two different styles of casting: large runes with explicit effects for when you have time, and smaller, faster runes for combat.

Also keep in mind that energy still limits a spell no matter how efficient the rune is. You couldn't mimic a volcanic eruption no matter how large of a rune you used, that just takes too much energy.

You can have multiple people for a large rune, but each person has to understand exactly what the part of the spell they drew does. You couldn't just have them mark out lines and complete it yourself to use their energy.

  If position is an element, multiple casters could get together and draw a big square of earth and position and drop city-killing rocks. That's a lot of power for a small group and there doesn't seem to be any sort of surveillance spells directly available.

Since metals are simpler, and size of the created object probably increases cost it would be better to create a rod of tungsten or something similar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment][in the space above a target]]. Anyway my point is that if you can use this system for teleportation or creating objects at a specified location away from the caster then it means this setting is going to be dominated by WMD's.

** About 3 years ago, I was a big fan of the SCP wiki (I still am, but my fandom is much more tempered now).

And during that time, I created a character with the help of a professional artist.

We brainstormed the character and the universe, and decided on a setting similar to "The Real" from [[https://artists-at-the-ready.deviantart.com/][artists at the ready]]- a setting containing a 'fictional' universe, where there are 'judges' who portal-fantasy the artists into "the Real", who then, using some object on their person, summon their 1-3 OCs. Holy shit you /have/ to read the [[https://sircyodnad.deviantart.com/art/Intro-Page-Zero-365363027][winner of tournament #3's story]]... Here's my [[https://sircyodnad.deviantart.com/art/Round-5-Part-5-459234584?q=sort%3Atime%20gallery%3Asircyodnad&qo=1][most convincing reason why.]]

The idea for my story was that all fiction exists in their own multiverse. Established fictions have more solid barriers, pillars. Some times, fanfiction and bad tropes start to get mingled with the multiverse. When this happens, [[https://le-mec.deviantart.com/art/MagnusVonKilroy-462560125][Magnus von Kilroy]] and his crack team of (also fictional) troopers go in and try to fix the problem, by going to the source and fixing it. He's armed with:

Chekov's Gun, Occam's Razor, and Reality Anchors (which remove all non-real influences like magic, curses, etc for an area. A dragon would biologically function, but if it's not correct, within that anchor's range, they would land on the ground and not be able to move/fly because of bad anatomy....)

Never went anywhere with this fic, but if you like it, I hope you come up with something interesting in its vein.
