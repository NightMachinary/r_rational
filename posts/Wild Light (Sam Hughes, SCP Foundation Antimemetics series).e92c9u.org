  "We could immediately terminate and suppress all memetics and antimemetics research worldwide," Hughes says. "We would have to systematically dismantle the whole scientific field forever. Stop all the experiments, scrap all the research, brainwash all the researchers. If nobody actively researches this field, nobody will ever find SCP-3125. It stays buried in the farthest reaches of ideatic space indefinitely, like radioactive waste." He looks up at the ceiling. The problem is interesting. "Ironically, the most practical way to do that would be to develop an artificial meme. One which encodes the idea that memetics research is intrinsically worthless and harmful. Enrich it with religious or pseudoscientific virals and release it to the general public. A year after it got out we'd be tearing our own labs down."

#+end_quote

I think of it as a real field, albeit one not often studied under the name "memetics". But engineering ideas specifically to spread, get inside people's heads and affect them a certain way isn't anything new or fictional; it's what advertisers are paid to do. As memetics slowly becomes more widely accepted to exist, I expect we'll slowly edge closer to genuinely dangerous memetic hazards, though I doubt we'll see anything on the level of the stuff on SCP wiki.

Antimemes are probably also technically real, but only very weak ones. Antimemes by their very definition inhibit their own spread, and so they work towards their own destruction. Thus, any significantly effective antimeme would be too short lived to notice even if we COULD work around its antimemetic effect in order to realize it's worth paying attention to. But technically, all you have to do to make a weak antimeme is just be boring. If I post hundreds upon hundreds of random characters here, that text is probably less likely to spread than other "ideas" because there's no meaning to it and no reason for anyone to talk about it or bother remembering it. We are more likely to remember things that interest us, and less likely to remember things that don't.

This is why none of the antimemetic SCPs are pure antimemes, they're real objects (or mostly-non-antimemetic memeplexes, etc.) that have antimemetic properties. Because if they exist outside of just being ideas, they don't have this same restriction; destroying all knowledge of an idea kills the idea, but destroying all knowledge of an object leaves the object extant.

  "Bart Hughes wrote the file. He's dead," Marion says.

  "What happened to him?"

  "You don't want to know."

  There is a very long pause while both O5-8 and his assistant react to this. In fact, they pass through a long, discrete sequence of reactions. Indignation at the seeming rudeness; confusion at Wheeler's incaution in front of sinister superiors; surprise at the magnitude of the claim; pure disbelief; comprehension; and finally, horror.

  "What..." O5-8 asks carefully, "would happen if we did know?"

  "It would happen to you as well," Marion says, levelly.

** I have three sets of thoughts on this, and one is so long that I'm going to make it its own post (can I do that here? Is there a better place?). The other two are:

· My reaction and few nitpicks about this specific story

Really enjoyed it! I love the spooky but very on-theme backdrop of the SCP remains as the containment chamber. It follows the broad structure that makes SCP entries so satisfying: the lead up of paranoid containment procedures to produce suspense, the reveal of the situation (in this case where this story falls on the antimemetics timeline, and a chilling example of how fragile the counteroperations are), and additional flavor and twists. Very solidly executed.

The main thing which bugged me was the timing of Li's assassination attempt. If he had access to a "thick report" authored by Hughes himself saying that he's the only one who can do this, he wouldn't need to confirm it with him in person. He could have done it more easily and without blowing cover any number of other times and ways (as Hughes's direct superior). Having it happen "onscreen" was very cinematic, but I think a few details could be mentioned/changed to make it more logically consistent.

· My thoughts about the merit of the antimemetics stories in general and responses to a number of the comments here

I saw some criticisms about how grimdark it is and the lack of progress (go easy on the "diegetic", juniper), but personally that doesn't bother me, at least so far. A story can have merit and be interesting without promising or offering hope of a resolution. There are plenty of tragedies structured around the audience knowing it won't end well and just seeing the process, or watching the characters struggle and fail due to circumstance or their own flaws. There can also be smaller victories which make interesting stories within greater losses - I think this is particularly common with stories like this one where it's essentially a prequel. We already know that Anakin will become Darth Vader. The amount that a prequel or side story can "progress" the main narrative is necessarily bounded.

For my part, I enjoy the mental contortions involved in combating antimemetic threats, the types of dramatic reveals the setting almost uniquely allows, and the sense of slowly getting more pieces of the puzzle over the course of multiple works.

The thick report may be out of date; best to check with the principal to see if anything's changed, at a time when the principal will be grasping for any possible solution to the problem and will be most willing to spill knowledge of other people at his level of ability.

** Interestingly enough, it seems to me that the best technology to counter the threat would be to create improved transhuman humans with improved ability to handle amnestic effects and the ability to separate parts of their own brain like an integrated version of the germs that can be discarded once it begins to be compromised.

So many of the core issues stem from the simple fact that they are but humans with no real enhancements.

*** I'm not sure how viable any of that would be with biological neural networks, but it definitely seems extremely challenging. Furthermore, the time required to grow, test and debug such approaches would likely be centuries at least, even if you set aside the ethical concerns regarding such experimentation.

A better approach might be to have an extremely high-density FPGA-based artificial neural network serving as a brain emulator. [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00213/full][This study]] was able to model 2.6B neurons in real-time on a Stratix V FPGA. A cluster of 32 of those would just about get you to the number of neurons in a human brain, and a cluster of 64 would just about double the number of neurons. While it seems possible to emulate human brains with current technology, it's definitely too pricey to implement on a wide scale at present (~$6K/Stratix V), but within the next two to four decades at current rates of development we will probably have affordable FPGAs with enough programmable logic blocks to emulate human brains. From there, theoretically all you'd need to do is learn to reliably install neural interfaces and then use the data from volunteers to train the neural networks to act as brain emulators, taking the same sensory inputs and learning to produce the same motor outputs.

Once you have viable brain emulators, it should be fairly easy to add a secure backup/revert system, and challenging but probably feasible to add monitoring systems to identify certain conditions which would require a revert and then carry it out automatically, as well as the possibility of emulating drug effects or carrying out specific brain modifications. For one easy example, this kind of setup could conceivably enable the detection of a seizure within milliseconds and then revert to the last backup from 5 seconds ago while adding the effect of an anti-epileptic medication as if it were immediately administered prior to resuming brain function. You'd then get a little popup in your visual field indicating that you just recovered from a seizure and lost 5 seconds of memory, but at least you're not dead or injured.

In the hypothetical scenario of overwhelmingly potent and rapidly-acting mind-subversion memes, the sudden and drastic changes in the mental model between backups should make it relatively easy to identify and trigger an automatic revert. Slower and insidious changes would still be a threat, as they always have been with cultural memetics, so that's a far harder problem to address in a reasonable manner.

*** In reality, antimemetic effects are extremely limited and flimsy, mostly they work by stimulating the kind of pathways that biobrains use to pre-process visual input more quickly - the same pathways that optical illusions toy with. It's a kind of "invisibility through inconspicuousness". And the conscious slow-circuit thought completely bypasses it so it's immune to such effects by default. So not only do the anti-memes only work mostly 'by accident' they fail as soon as you are aware they exist.

As for retro-active deletion, like affecting your memories of having been consciously aware of something, it's nearly infeasible AFAIK because the brain stores memories along the processing circuits in a distributed way, and not in separate neurons dedicated to the task. It means you'd have to suppress the processing of the signal to make the memory of the specific signal go away, and as I understand it the only working method for such suppression is to create an encapsulating memory that actively reminds you you should avoid remembering. That's typically how [[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160125-the-blessing-and-curse-of-the-people-who-never-forget][people with eidetic memory]] manage to "forget" things: by remembering they ought to to not remember that thing. It requires conscious effort, and cannot be done unwillingly.

Aside from these considerations, one can teach their own brain to purposefully ignore or emphasize a specific signal, through auto-hypnosis. I've been toying with this, experimentally I can consciously skew or outright reverse the result in those "subconscious/implicit bias tests" that were popular around last year. By willingly hijacking your emotional responses you can literally train your brain into memetic immunity or extra-sensitivity for /anything/.

The autohypnosis thing is temporary (it lasts for as long as you maintain the conscious effort to divert), but if you repeat it often enough it can become permanent - e.g. I trained myself to un-notice Youtube adverts and click-bait titles, it's pretty trivial to do. Now my eyes glaze them over reflexively and after they're gone I cannot remember fnord their content even if I try. I know I can reverse the effect by consciously placing special emphasis on those things, a couple weeks of this and I would be seeing them again.

Any computerized systems that mimick / simulates accurately those biological systems would also be affected by those same features and quirks.
