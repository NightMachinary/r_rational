** I actually started reading this story this week and i think its really hard to read because of its writing style, very chaotic and way to much action focused. So my question is does it get better (around chapter 20 right now) , because if the story stays the way it is I feel its neither rational nor greatly written so...is it worth it?

*** I think it mostly stays the same. The writing gets a little bit better, but there's still a heavy focus on action, which doesn't really do much for me. I do really like some of the ideas in it, and the weirdness of the premise, but plot progression is slow, and people have forgotten important things one too many times. There's a little bit more character interactions, which helps a bit, and some deepening of the mysteries, but it's still somewhat slow, and I think if you read it, you're probably reading /for/ those action scenes.

**** Thanks for the input, and yeah I had the same impression so far , the ideas and weirdness is getting you hooked, but the character and plot progressions and wiritng style just dont hit it of for me. The action focused writing style really ends up in being kinda chaotic. In one sentence they talk about running back to the entrance they are hurt and want to escape so they run , next paragraph they are under some table resting talking and then fighting again... adn then in detail the fight then some weirdd paragraphs and like then 10 paragraphs later " Oh yeah we should go back now because we are hurt and shouldnt just fight even more" ... and the actuall munchkiny stuff gets kinda scraped and forgotten way to much = / . So this story is not for me.
