Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Has anyone here read Seeing like a State? One review:

#+begin_quote
  Subconsciously or not, most of us presuppose malice behind failure. This goes doubly for historical failures, and quadruply for political failures. The daily form of this hisses about “corrupt politicians” (past and present), perhaps about “businessmen and special interests”. The more extreme forms fall into conspiracy theory. Often this is diagnosed as a form of pessimism, especially “pessimism about politics”. That's wrong; it's optimism.

  The pessimistic view is this: “Everyone is just trying their best.” If the horrors of history are the result of /ill will/ then we should take comfort. It may not always be possible to avoid evil dictators, but at least we know that human agency has some power. An evil person realizing their evil machinations implies that /perhaps/ a good person can successfully realize a good plan. Stalin may have been /mean and bad/, but if we just get the right people in there (read: me), then surely The Good will result. But if everyone is just “trying their best” then none of this is assured. Indeed -- something is so broken that our best intentions /still/ produce misery. So... what happened?

  Seeing like a State sets out to answer this question. Namely: why do we see large state schemes cause /so much misery/ even when guided by good intentions and (seemingly) careful design? And that also explains its subtitle: /How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed./

** I recently had a (possibly somewhat wrong, but interesting) insight that could be summed up as Everything Is A Skill.

Being a great writer (or even just a hack who can churn out a story from start to finish on demand)? Skill.

Having original new ideas? Skill.

Resisting food cravings so you lose weight? Totally a skill.

Being skeptical of extraordinary claims? Also a skill.

Habits and skills are almost the same thing, i.e. sets of conditioned responses. Some are aided by instinct, but most can be learned by repetition, and can be formed more easily under certain drugs (nicotine for example). Some sets of responses (those that produce negative outcomes, like smoking or overeating) may also be thought of as anti-skills, although these tend to be categorized as habits due to their relatively low complexity (which I think is because they are the kinds that are formed by accident, which usually filters out more complex habits).

A writer instinctively models their story arc and characters, and responds with predictions about what they will do that could make a great story, a person who successfully loses and keeps off weight responds to hunger cravings with a distraction or inhibiting thought of some kind. They do this mostly at the pre-conscious or unconscious level.

Newbies trying to gain a skill tend to have to use the conscious level, which makes them feel incompetent because the conscious mind doesn't have that much control and is easily distracted/bored. Depending how you react to that feeling (which itself is a skill/habit) you might tend to drop skills before getting competent with them.

I also think social incentives to learn a given skill have a lot of leverage because we tend to do things that are socially approved of even if we don't feel like we are doing them well. However this only works when the social incentive is to perform an action integral to the skill, as opposed to actions that superficially resemble the skill.

#+end_quote

No, of course it isn't. I was going for shorthand though, not tautology.

Everything Is A Skill => Many more things are trainable mappings from experience to behavior (skills) than one might think.

Making mayonnaise from raw ingredients is obviously a skill, but making a sandwich from mayonnaise by spreading it on with a knife is a skill too (it's just so super-easy to learn that we all tend to learn it and forget there was ever a time we couldn't do it).

The main point I had in mind is that most human behavior is the result of or at least strongly influenced by skill levels. This is interesting because when we think of self improvement we often think in terms of specific outcomes (lose weight) instead of trying to practice up a skill (resist food).

That isn't to say you would be likely to train 'resist food' without 'lose weight' in mind, but it is a totally different way of framing the task -- grinding rather than questing, if you will. I suspect it is a perspective that factors a lot into why some people are more persistent than others; they view the attempt and experience gained as itself valuable, so there is a mental reward for each additional try.

** I sometimes hear people empathizing the difference between intelligence and wisdom. Usually 'supported' by some lame quasi-deep quotes like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/325uep][here]]. Is there an actual difference if we adopt a rigorous definition of intelligence, i.e. the ability to maximize one's utility function? It seems to me that there isn't, and what is commonly referred to as wisdom is simply greater levels of intelligence, stuff like accounting for longer-term consequences, accurately modelling other actors or responses of complex systems, etc.

*** "Intelligence" as "fitness for a goal" probably isn't a very good definition. I'd just use "ability to precisely (without introducing additional noise in the inferential process) manipulate complex (high K-complexity, many bits to encode) cognitive representations (generative models)".

Under this definition, there is a difference between intelligence and wisdom, but there are also multiple kinds of "wisdom". Wisdom could then consist in fluidly trading-off precision, complexity, and accuracy/utility in one's representation (knowing when /not/ to overcomplicate, or when it's useful to do so), but also in having certain /a posteriori/ knowledge that closes off possibilities and saves on deliberation ("a tomato may be a fruit, but it just doesn't go in fruit salad").

Why are you think-computing in the first place? Presumably you have a goal you are trying to archive, and you want to archive it without extra work.

*** My preferred (quasi-deep?) aphorism is "A clever man gets what he wants, but a wise man knows what's worth wanting." If I were to make this rigorous, I would say that "wisdom," used colloquially, corresponds to having strong heuristics that cut down the search space to just the things that are important for achieving long-term goals or ultimate values. Whereas "intelligence" in this sense is a strong reasoning ability towards achieving short-term or mid-term goals. Of course, at the end of the day, it's all "intelligence," but wisdom is still a useful term for high-level heuristic pruning. So my view is essentially a combination of [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s

#+begin_quote
  B) Intelligence in how to imagine and synthesize the overall long term big picture of different competing goals/views
#+end_quote

and [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s

#+begin_quote
  Wisdom = having "good" goals.
#+end_quote

For example, let's use a quote from the AskReddit thread you linked:

#+begin_quote
  Intelligence is knowing that Frankenstein was the doctor. Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein was the monster.
#+end_quote

To know that Frankenstein was the doctor is to have technically accurate propositional knowledge, useful for making pedantic points in debates about Frankenstein, not all that useful for much else. To know that Frankenstein was the monster is to make a moral judgement, thereby allowing a deeper understanding of the literary point and enabling the metaphor to be applied more generally.

It's like the difference between tactics and strategy in chess. An intermediate player notices the tactical themes on the current chessboard, but a "wise" grandmaster sees the long-term strategy and can instantly focus on the right moves without an easy propositional explanation. Wisdom, almost by definition, must be on the level of holistic pattern recognition, attainable only through experience.

*** Ultimately I think pretty much every kind of function the machine we call the brain can do is capable of being boiled down to a form of intelligence. But the label of Wisdom is just the box we draw around some combination of:

A) Intelligence in how to optimize actions to coincide with particular goals/beliefs

B) Intelligence in how to imagine and synthesize the overall long term big picture of different competing goals/views

C) Intelligence in specific domains that are separate from "traditional" intelligence domains, such as empathy and navigating social situations rather than memorization/mathematics/etc.

And maybe D) Intelligence in perceiving differences in various domains of intelligence. Plenty of very smart people win awards and get accolades for their work in a particular field, and then start speaking authoritatively on fields outside their expertise rather than recognizing that they're not applying a proportional level of time and effort and skill in those areas.

** So, veganism is surprisingly popular in rationality circles. I've been vegan a couple of years now (and cooking exclusively vegan for ~4.5), I'm passionate about cooking and eating good food, and I'm a very small way through a bachelor's degree in nutrition.

I don't want to start a debate - there's [[/r/debateavegan]] if you're so inclined, or have a read through [[http://www.yourveganfallacyis.com][www.yourveganfallacyis.com]] - but if you have any genuine questions that can't be easily answered on google, I'm happy to help out.

The more specific the question is, the better. (e.g. "my diet looks like this. what are some high value changes I can make?", "Can you tell me how to enjoy tofu?", "I've heard that vegans don't get enough protein. I'm guessing that's not true because vegans are not dying en masse, but what's the deal with protein?", "my favourite food is X. Do you have any vegan recipes for X?")

Some recommendations for improving the environment, animal welfare, and your own health that will not change the quality of your life:

- /Try unsweetened almond milk/. Next time you're at the shops, get a carton of it and give it a try. When I first tried it I found it was /so much better than cow's milk/ in cereal and hot chocolate. It is also very low in calories, which might benefit people trying to lose weight. Subbing cow's milk for almond milk at your home is an easy change, doesn't require a lifestyle change (I mean, order it at cafes when you can, but you'll still be able to go to cafes and what not). If you can't stand it, then you're not forced to keep drinking it. But give it a try. (Tip: get the cheapest, most processed, least "natural/organic" brand you can. The expensive organic brands tend to have a poor texture).

- When you're eating out, genuinely consider the vegetarian menu option. People tend not to choose from the vegetarian section if they're not vegetarian because they don't consider it "as good". Check it out and see if you could go without meat for that one meal. Meat is very environmentally destructive: eliminating meat from one meal saves more greenhouse gases than eliminating /every single one/ of your food miles for a week.

- If you bake, buy "egg replacer" powder and use it in baked goods (pancakes, cakes, etc). In Australia there's a brand called Ogran, and I believe in the US there's one called Ener-G. They're very common. It's a white powder that you can get in health food sections in supermarkets, 1 tsp powder + 2 tbsp water can replace an egg in most baked goods. Nobody makes a chocolate cake to get that eggy taste. It's cheaper than chicken's eggs, and I doubt the difference is noticeable in a baked good.

- Just avoid eggs in general. They're one of the worst possible things you can eat, animal-welfare wise. I'm not asking you to eat scrambled tofu (though scrambled tofu is nice), but if you're ordering a burger that normally comes with egg, maybe ask them to leave it off?

*** What are the highest impact /and lowest willpower/ changes? Or would that vary too much based on personal preference, personal diet, and personal values?

One of the things that I find strange about vegans is that the arguments come from all over the place; in one sentence it's about the environment, while in the next it's about animal welfare, and then it quickly switches to health benefits. For most people these are contributing factors, but it brings in so many different debates at once.

Like, if I /only/ care about animal welfare, I should still be able to eat things without nervous systems, and if I /only/ care about the environment I should be able to hunt, kill, and eat deer, or if not that then kill and eat animals that I'm growing on my own land (or, if not even that because a humane death is still a death, then my pet chicken surely can be allowed to feed me eggs).

I don't know, I used to work at a food co-op and thought a lot of the veganism stuff was just horribly muddled. I also worked on a farm for a while and it's hard for me to connect too much with the animal suffering aspect, since /factory farms/ are a whole different thing. I tried veganism for a few months, just to see what it was like, and didn't really care for it.

**** Low willpower: I think replacing all the milk in your house with soy/almond milk is an easy way to make a low willpower change. You really can substitute them freely for cow's milk in recipes and whatnot, and you really do get used to the taste (I used to drink a really bad tasting brand of soy milk because it had the most fortification, and I got used to it). Request soy/almond when it's available, and when it's not, don't. That said, I think animal welfare wise, milk is the least of our worries not because the dairy cow has a pleasant existance (it's not), but because the dairy cow produces so much cow's milk that an average american probably causes about 10 days of dairy cow suffering drinking milk per year, whereas if you eat a chicken you're causing 60 days of chicken suffering /per chicken/, which is qualitatively probably worse.

More low willpower changes can include things like if you are buying nuggets, try buying the vegetarian/vegan alternative. They are processed out the wazoo anyway so you will notice minimal difference. They are slightly more expensive though.

Another low willpower change is something like "meatless monday" or "vegan before 6pm" type things. Or just find and add a few vegan dishes into your regular rotation, or if you're going for fast food, go to places that you know have a veg option that you like rather than a veg option you'll accept.

RE muddled messaging:

I think the big thing with veganism is that there are so many reasons. Health (admittedly, the "objectively healthiest diet" is probably vegan + fish, but vegan is probably better than what most people reading this are eating now), the environment, animal welfare. So vegans, I guess, try to attack from all sides. If I'm in "advance the cause of veganism" mode, I'll go for the environment because health has people asking dumb questions ("where do you get protein?"), welfare has people making dumb statements ("being a dairy cow isn't that bad!"/"how do we know chickens have feelings?"), whereas the environment is pretty uncontroversial and the average liberal youth cares about global warming a great deal.

Unless you have a very specific type of land, you'd get more calories by growing vegetables on that land, but I know you were just giving examples.

This was back in 2004, so a long time ago, and a very different life than what I have now. Mostly it was a lot of work making sure that things were actually vegan instead of just "not obviously made of animals", but partly it was that nothing tasted quite as good. I blame some of that on marketing: a lot of vegan stuff is labeled something like "vegan brownies" but it's not actually a brownie, it's just a poor substitute that I'm now comparing to an actual brownie (which the vegan version simply cannot compete with unless you've forgotten what a brownie tastes like or have a very different palate from mine). I had that experience repeated over and over.

It's something that I could put time, effort, money, and unhappiness into again. I guess I could run the numbers some afternoon.

On brownies: that's the bane of my existence. Vegan becoming synonymous with gluten free somehow has destroyed me because it's so hard to get anything decent in the dessert department. But you can get vegan chocolate flavoured almond milk or coconut water from time to time as of very recently! It's made me so very happy as I don't drink caffeine and I try to avoid fizzy drinks because of the sugar content. Used to not be able to get chips in anything other than original flavour, but now there's a variety of milk-powder-free flavours (not all of them, but some!).

I recommend this brownie recipe: [[http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2016/10/13/sweet-potato-brownies-recipe/]] - yeah it has sweet potatoes in it and I was skeptical when I made them but I did it on strength of the reviews, and they're probably the best vegan brownies I've made, and I struggled so hard to find a good recipe. Still not perfect though, but not bad.

More generally, you can do the whole "vegan at home" thing as a good "stepping stone" so to speak, and do whatever standard you want out of the house.

Indeed -- I have seen this confusion as well. The phenomenon is a bit strange, and I have pet theories for why it's happening. However, [[https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism][veganism is, and always has been, the philosophical position that other animals deserve equal ethical consideration]]. By adopting that philosophy, one becomes a vegan, and by /extension/ of becoming vegan, they're also helping the environment, human health, etc. However, adopting a plant-based diet (e.g. for health reasons) doesn't make one vegan per se; that would be kind of like deciding to keep a kosher kitchen and then self-identifying as Jewish without ever adopting the tenets of Judaism. Likewise, avoiding animal exploitation out of a concern for the environment in and of itself also doesn't make one vegan.

This isn't meant to take anything away from environmentalists who avoid animal products out of concern for the environment, or from health-conscious folks who adopt a plant-based diet. More power too them! However, until they actually adopt the philosophy of veganism, it's actually a misnomer for them to self-identify as being vegan.

I'm primarily concerned with eating natural and healthy food in reasonable amounts and being satiated enough to continue exercising and losing weight.

**** I'd say, just replacing your cow's milk with almond milk would be great from a weight loss perspective, though almond milk is lower in protein and fat and may not be as satiating - but one glass of it probably won't make much difference. Soy milk is more similar to cow's milk nutritionally, so it might be a better substitution if you find almond milk doesn't satiate you as much.

How are you preparing the chicken, eggs, etc? What are you eating them with? Do you cook?

Butter and yogurt can be bought in vegan versions pretty easily now: replacing butter with a vegan equivalent (I believe Earth Balance is the most ubiquitous American brand) is an especially good idea as butter is high in saturated fat, which is not very good for you.

In terms of replacing the chicken, without knowing how you prepare it I can't give you great instructions. If you're frying it, replacing it with some tofu or tempeh would be the way to go.

Tempeh has a very strong taste and some people don't like it - it took me about 10 years before I started enjoying it, and I think that's more because I started buying a different brand. It can taste very bitter, but steaming it first seems to fix that - doesn't really make things "easy" though does it?

Tofu has a bad rap, try pressing it, marinating it, etc. I like to pres it, marinate it, coat it in cornstarch, and then fry it in canola oil.

Looking at the nutrition information for chicken breasts: ONE chicken breast has 120% of your daily protein needs, so if you're eating two... that's an awful lot of protein, and too much protein can actually be bad for you (i'm guessing you are not an internationally competitive weight lifter).

Tofu over chicken breast, assuming about the same number of calories, has about the same amount of fat, about half the protein (but still plenty; the amount of protein you're eating is kind of excessive), the /tofu/ has more iron, also more folate, less sodium (by a huge margin), more magnesium (common deficiency).

Honestly, thinking it over, I'd say if you replaced even one of those chicken breasts with a grain or a tin of legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans, etc), you'd not be compromising any of your goals (unless you're an international weight lifter), you'd save money, and my husband has been known to eat a tin of legumes straight out of the can with some hot sauce, so it's a time-saver, too. That's not an 80/20 intervention, though: maybe a 20/40? :P

Per my OP, I'd be more interested in getting those eggs out of your diet, but without knowing exactly how you're eating them it's hard to give you a specific bit of advice. (That said: you can replace them with cereal, a protein shake, or the aforementioned tin of legumes)

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/6jijbn/what_is_in_your_headcanon/djetby7/][I like this headcanon for the Emperor of Mankind.]] Not only is it suitably grimdark, but it makes actual sense for where his sort of character comes from.

Normal humans, even superpowered ones, just don't decide to become galaxy-conquering ubermenschen, especially not galaxy-conquering ubermenschen who sabotage themselves by sheer lack of ability to understand regular humans.

However, if you're in a situation where you're never sure if He really accounted for this or not, where everything may just be according to His design, where nothing can make Him give in or trade off, where only on one super-pressured occasion is He ever seen to /lose/? He's probably not a normal human.

[[#s][/Master of Mankind/]]

Or more probably, the writers had to give Him /just low enough/ Charisma, Empathy, and Diplomacy scores that He would /lose/. Because lacking those, He would have gotten what He wanted and beaten the gods -- for humanity, whatever humanity was in Him in the first place.

*** If I remember correctly, equations of general relativity won't converge to Newtonian physics. Best case, you will get tensor equations that still have several differences from equations of classical mechanics. Worst case, general relativity formulae will diverge.
