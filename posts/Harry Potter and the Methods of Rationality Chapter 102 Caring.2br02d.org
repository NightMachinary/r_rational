*** 2YE and Nat20?

I'm caught up in all else. I could use some new reading material.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]. Both are munchkin D&D stories, so your mileage may vary. I enjoy both of them a lot.

***** Will 2YE be enjoyable if I liked HPN20 but never played D&D before? I know the basics, but am I going to miss many references?

****** I don't think you'll miss a huge amount. Most of what happens is explained pretty explicitly. You'll only lose out on the fun of coming up with new interesting D&D based ideas yourself, which isn't the main point of the story anyway.

********* Yeah, I'm enjoying it, the only bad part is the constant 4th wall breaks.

**** [[http://dkami.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Story_Chapter][DKAmi]] gets increasingly munchkin as time goes on. Also updates get increasingly slower, unfortunately.

** Man, Quirrell's description of horcruxes SCREAM deception. "Oh no they're totally not cool, here's a perfectly sound reason why SMART people don't pursue them, people like you or I." He's also programmed Harry to mistrust/dismiss the Killing Curse.

So now Harry is mentally headed down the completely wrong track on Volde's two biggest threats- his horcruxes and the Killing Curse (aka the CTRL ALT DLT of the wizard world).

The odds are stacked against our hero- WILL HE PREVAIL?
