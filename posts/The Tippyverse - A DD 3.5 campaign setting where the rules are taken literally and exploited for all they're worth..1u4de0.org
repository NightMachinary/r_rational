** As a big lover of D&D, I really enjoyed this ... however, I have a couple quibbles (which might be answered in the linked forum threads, I'll have to read those later).

I don't really understand why anyone would ever make a second city after the first one had been founded. Permanent teleportation circles are /incredibly expensive/ (they need an 18th level wizard, 1,000gp, and much more importantly, 4,500xp). You wouldn't make one unless you were linking together two points /and/ could make a profit doing so. However, the only way to make a profit is if there are goods to trade, and given the fact that agriculture is essentially eliminated (albeit with a fairly large initial capital investment) along with the creation of most mundane goods ... what goods are there to trade? Pretty much only those associated with material components for spells, or those that can't be created through magical means.

I sort of fail to see why you would ever have two linked megacities, especially since it requires the creation of not just one but /two/ permanent teleportation circles, /and/ a spell like dimensional lock can be used by either party at either end to block the route completely until force is applied (which costs more money than it seems like you'd be able to make, with again some return on investment problems). So with that said, it seems much more likely to me that there would just be a single megacity, rather than dozens or hundreds of linked cities. Perhaps there would be guarded teleportation circles acting as outposts/feeders for the megacity, but they'd be entirely linked, and they'd need a ridiculous ROI in order to be worth it.

Tippyverse also has a couple of things that I think are somewhat questionable but maybe defensible - it seems to assume that XP is rather cheap, what with lots of high level wizards walking around and blowing XP on all sorts of items and spells. It also makes heavy use of "traps that aren't traps", which requires a fairly *ahem* elaborate reading of the rules as written.

Then again, it's a fairly optimized and coherent setting based on an inherently incoherent ruleset whose economics were laid out by a group of people who seem to only have the vaguest understanding of how economics actually works.

Edit: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=247468&page=1][This thread]] is my favorite so far, which contains some good debate:

#+begin_quote

  1. Tippyverse rules are not universally accepted
  2. Given the rules, Tippyverse assumptions are not universally accepted
  3. Given the rules and assumptions, Tippyverse outcomes are not universally accepted.
#+end_quote

Edit 2: Having read through most of the threads, I would suggest not reading most of the threads. It seems to descend into the typical char op arguing about RAW v. RAI v. what a reasonable GM would actually let you get away with for pages and pages. If you go by RAW, the first person to chain-gate Solars gets an infinite number of wishes and wins forever, which is certainly rational and optimal, but not actually very interesting. Hell, by RAW you can have infinite wealth at level 7. The Tippyverse, at its best, seems to me like it works by removing most of the completely broken stuff, and you can see that in the threads where there are things that work by RAW but completely break the Tippyverse; people don't like them, and will make shitty justifications for why it's not so. Tippyverse is better if it's just a formal list of magics available and the consequences of them, instead of just saying that it's the rules taken to their logical conclusions, because that results in derailing conversations about the somewhat incoherent rules of D&D when seen without a dungeon master there to mediate. It's an interesting setting as an exploration of how different reality-breaking spells interact with each other, given people thinking intelligently and a boatload of assumptions about how XP accumulation and D&D economy work.

*** XP is cheap. It simply is, by the rules. First of all, there is the whole "experience is a river" concept. But beyond that, 4500 XP is a relatively small amount for, say, a 17th level character, who has hundreds of thousands of XP.

Besides that, Thought Bottles exist, so... XP costs aren't really a thing.

Also, the Dungeonscape source book is very clear that you can have "traps", using the trap rules, without them being hostile traps.

How much does a permanent Teleportation Circle cost? (Note by the way that you only need 17th level, not 18th as you wrongly described.) It costs: 17/10/9 gp base to hire someone to cast a 9th level spell (by the PHB), plus 1000 gp for the components, which is 2530 gp.

To pay for the permanency: 17/10/5 gp base, plus 5*4500 by the rate one must pay for spells with XP costs. This totals 23350 gp. If the caster uses a Thought Bottle to reduce the XP cost to 500 XP, it totals 3350 gp instead.

Thus, total price to hire someone to cast the spells for you: 25880 gp, or 5880 gp if a thought bottle is used.

This is a trivial expense for a high level character, even without the Thought Bottle, and definitely doable even for a mid-level character. Thus, I can simply say that you are strictly /wrong/ about it being "incredibly expensive".

**** NPC wealth by level is 220Kgp at level 17, so making a single TC is more than a tenth of an NPC's wealth, which is not what I would consider cheap, especially since you need to cast it twice in order to actually make a path between cities. A fifth of the wealth of the richest people in the world is /not/ cheap. 4,500XP is also enough to drop you about a third of a level down to 16th - casting two of them drops you two thirds. Sure, you have hundreds of thousands of XP, but you can't spend it without gimping yourself. I also question how cheap XP is, given that the DMG explicitly says that an encounter so easy that it uses up none or almost none of the PCs' resources shouldn't result in any XP reward at all. But if you're a character optimizer like Tippy, you tend to go by the charts and numbers instead of anything that the DMG actually says.

If you assume the broken abuse like Thought Bottles for (basically) infinite XP, or infinite Wishes, then I think the setting just breaks, even given the assumptions underpinning it. There's really no reason for trade when you can conjure an unlimited number of magic items from the air. Tippyverse /says it has/ trade between distant cities, and with infinite material wealth I just don't see that happening - the only things that you'd be trading are information and service, and with the existence of perfect automatons and spells like mind rape I don't see that happening either. But again;

***** See, the thing is, the Tippyverse is what you get in a nonbroken way then you allow all those crazy things the rules allow. The basic premise is one of Thought Bottles and "infinite" wishes, and the whole setting comes as a consequence of that.

Basicly, you can say if you like that Thought Bottles are broken and that any sane DM would ban them, but of course that doesn't matter here, does it?

And about the cost: Even with the higher, non-Thought Bottle figure, it is, as you say, only a tenth of the wealth of the richest people in the world. (Well, actually not, because the wealthiest people would be PCs, but let's leave that aside.) I say "only" for good reason: Let's take the real world as an imperfect analogy. The richest group of people are billionaires. (We are not looking at the single richest person here, like we are not looking at the single top person in the Tippyverse, but rather the handful of top players.) Thus, let's say a real world cost of $100 million.

Imagine you could build a real-world Teleport circle for a mere $100 million. Think about the implications. The world would be crowded with them. Perhaps not because billionaires are building them, but because other (rich) entities (governments, corporations) are. $100 million is a drop in the bucket to the budget of the USG.

The point is, with big government you have wealth vastly more concentrated than that in the hands even of the richest. I see it easily being done.

I was the one who put together this pastebin, so since you've read most of the material, I have a question. How would you improve it? I pasted the 3 largest blocks of concrete info I could, and linked to any threads I could find with extra material, but I wonder if there could be a better presentation.

**** I think that it was good and comprehensive, the only problem I really have is with some of the discussion, which veers wildly off into rules geekery pissing matches and/or discussions on the nature of what makes a good setting, along with the very occasional shining gem of insight or setting gold (which is about par for the course in any discussion that gets much longer than two pages, no matter what it's about).

Most of the improvements that I'd want to make are in more coherently laying out the setting details, as well as laying bare the rules and assumptions that Tippyverse operates under, but that would require doing some rewriting, and collating the information found in the threads. The big problem is that Tippyverse isn't actually coherent - it's just an idea, not an actual setting, and pretty much every time it gets brought up it's in a different form. If you follow the pastebin, it's more of a progression of thought than anything else, and things that are stated early on don't really hold true by the end.

As it stands, I think that the pastebin is good, and a good introduction, but I guess what I'd really like is a redone Guide to the Tippyverse which arranges the lines of thought based on starting assumptions, rules, and outcomes - something like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Kardashev scale]], but for high-magic D&D settings. The Tippyverse is really a collection of possible rational worlds that are clustered together based on similar characteristics, and I feel it would be better presented like that - but without rewriting much of what Tippy's laid out, I'm not sure that's easy to do.

***** Yes, I've been limiting myself to copy-pasting, which I suppose makes the introduction a bit worse than it could be. I'll think about this and maybe create a new version later. Thank you!

** Oh, this reminds me: I've been meaning for a while to post in this subreddit a link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]], a quite awesome D&D fanfic, in which the antagonists of the story are basicly the Tippyverse.

** [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=222007][Here]] is the thread where Emperor Tippy lays most of this out. The pastebin stuff seems to include the essential parts, but the whole thread is a good read, and I actually would suggest reading it first as an introduction before wading the the assorted pastebin stuff.

** The thing about the Tippyverse (TV) is that Teleportation Circle (TC) gets all the press but what actually drives the TV is the spell traps. Spell traps are simply engines that cast a particular spell every round; they are built using the "boon traps" rules from Dungeonscape. Tippy calls out traps of Create Food and Water as being how people are fed, and Fabricate as how things are built.

Problem: as far as I can tell, this doesn't work.

Boon traps very unambiguously target a /creature/, and only a creature bearing a specific Arcane Mark on its body (not on its clothes or gear). For an example of why this matters: Create Food and Water has no target, so it can't be put in a spell trap. Fabricate targets the raw materials that are to be fabricated. It explicitly cannot transmute creatures, meaning that it effectively cannot go in a spell trap.

Am I misunderstanding something? Are there relevant rules that I'm not aware of? Because otherwise the TV simply doesn't work, and it's too cool to let it die.

*** Create Food and Water traps are definitely the sort of thing that few DMs would allow (and even the character optimization guys raise an eyebrow towards), because they depend on a very Jedi "from a certain point of view" reading of the rules.

However, they're not actually the lynchpin of the system, since there are some other ways to eliminate the food problem. Clerics can cast /create food and water/ to feed fifteen people (when they first get it), and you can get a magic item like "Cauldron of Plenty" in order to feed more. It's far more expensive than the trap, but you can still virtually eliminate the farms, since you'll eventually pay off the magic item.

Alternately, you can use [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Estimating-Magic-Item-Gold-Piece-Values][the rules for creating a new magic item.]] Tippy (and the other char op guys) tend to assume that those rules don't exist, because they're too open for abuse, but there are already magic items made using /create food and water/ and assuming that you can't use those rules to make new magic items - at least when it comes to worldbuilding - it somewhat strange. By those rules, /create food and water/ is a third level spell, with a caster level of five and a duration of 24 hours, which means that if you give it a command word activation the price is 3 x 5 x 1,800gp x .5 = 13,500gp. This compares to 500gp × 3 × 5, 40xp × 3 × 5 = 7,500gp, 600xp = 10,500gp for the Create Food and Water Trap.

The core conceits of Tippyverse as I see them are large, highly-defended and interconnected cities of high level, with low level wilds outside them. I think you can more or less get that to work without the cheese (like traps that aren't traps and abusing infinite loops) so long as you make some assumptions about the level distribution of NPCs.

**** No argument on the cities. If you have Teleportation Circle that's definitely what you get. But the universe doesn't fundamentally break unless you can cast spells effectively for free. (*)

Unless you assume that practically everyone is a mid-to-high level caster, the amount of magic that can get into your setting is sharply limited, and most things will remain cottage industries. You can't, for example, buff your entire army before 'Circling in to your enemy's capital.

But, as soon as a caster can set up a fast-resetting magic trap, the caster has effectively solved one problem and can move on to the next. You've now industrialized magic. That's where things fundamentally break.

(*) Oh, also, the food traps aren't really all that important -- multiple castings of Plant Growth will render your fields crazy productive. I was just calling those out as an example.
