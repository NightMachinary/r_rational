Are you a ratfic author suffering a writers/worldbuilder's block you can't quite tame?

Are you a potential author who has a grand idea for a ratfic that you can't quite get started with?

Well, I have a proposition for you: how about a co-conspirator? Someone to egg you on, someone to throw your ideas at, someone to throw ideas back at you?

Fortuitously, such a person exists: [[/u/ArmokGoB]]

Co-conspirator and considered invaluable in the creation of [[/u/Nighzmarquls]]' [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure][Deep Rise]], [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dream-Time][Oh My, Generic Monster Girls]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/search?q=Fate+Market+Nighzmarquls&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][The Fate Market (unwritten)]], [[/u/DataPackRat]]'s [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZcUba_GKVCm_i2VeGrfSBBxC8pR6VZC5VBBUVKKxYk/edit][S.I.

Armok is a mad worldbuilding genius who likes to work in Google Docs, and over Skype, he has enormous amounts of free time, and he is very, very, bored.

If you think you could use his help, feel free to message him.

*** I'd be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month][pretty surprised]] if you could put a group of twelve authors together and increase speed on a fiction project. Even if it takes 9 months for 1 woman to produce a baby, it doesn't follow that 9 women working in concert can bring a baby to term in 1 month.

Without doing any research, I'd guess that having more than two people helping you write a novel doesn't help, and probably hurts, and even that, a team of three is a stretch. If you compartmentalized enough, you could make a team with a visionary/worldbuilder, a writer, and an editor, maybe.

I'd guess most of the time the real issue is getting over the initial hump of sitting down and writing. This is very difficult.

**** Ah, sorry, I said that really badly. I meant that in the sense of the twelve forming into six pairs, each of which writes a story.

However, to pick up your metaphor, our problem isn't a late baby so much as a lack of one. We're talking about the proverbial pandas of rational fiction. I'm wondering whether more pandas per book means more books overall, or, conversely, too many women conceiving the same baby ruins the soup. So to speak.

***** By most accounts, most writers worldbuild constantly, so they probably enjoy it as well. There's a reason one of the industry slogans is that ideas are cheap. Stephen King again (/On Writing/ is a spectacular book) anecdotally got the idea for /The Mist/ based on a shadow he saw out of the corner of his eye while walking home from the store. He also blasts loud music while he writes, which is usually something people do to reduce perception of time, which would seem to suggest that on the Want Like Approve continuum he wants to write and approves of it, but doesn't especially like it. This is backed up by his tendency (since kicked) to write drunk, which again reduces perception of time.

This is not the ONLY situation that causes failures but I feel like there is a misconception that good works are created by genius springing fully formed from the heads of zeus and then restricted and corrupted by outside influence.

** I have a few ideas bouncing around my head, for original-but-inspired-by fiction. One thing I'm having trouble deciding is the type of story to go after - particularly, whether or not to aim for young adult, and then, what that means. YA novels have particular plot structures and archetypes (I think, basing this off HP, Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and that other one with four +houses+ I mean groups set in a semi-apocalypse future). Or maybe there's something to be taken from Name of the Wind, Lies of Locke Lamore, etc?

I guess there's the possibility for a deeper question here - what are classic plot structures, and how to do they respond to rational'ing?

*** So I thought about this some more, and when I thought over the prime examples of, specifically, highly successful YA, a major trope jumped out at me. I don't know what TvTropes might call this, but for now I'll call it the Attribution Error Trope.

Basically, as HPMOR points out pretty damn early, HP didn't do anything to earn his fame. When you look around, this is a common factor: the main character has something special about that that's "inherent" and/or unearned. Katniss (Hunger Games) is probably the most "earned", but she still ends up being more the rally /point/ for the rebels rather than the rebel herself. (Then again, I haven't actually read it that closely, sooo)

This strikes me as indicating an interesting desire for the YA audience: They want to be inherently special in some way that they can neither avoid nor lose.
