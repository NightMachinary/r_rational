You're being subsidized. Okay, that's not what the letter you got today says, but the thought occurs to you after you realize it's not a scam. The US government has decided to offer you, as a citizen, what is effectively a one year trial of Guaranteed Basic Income. You'll be part of a carefully monitored group of individuals given a monthly allowance equal to the median income of whatever city "in which you are currently located." Just the median income, not matched to age, gender, race, nothing except the locality. You made sure to read that paragraph carefully, and it really didn't mean city of residence after all. You can go anywhere, and your monthly allowance will be adjusted to your location automatically whenever you attempt a transaction from the account they give you. They'll monitor your location by GPS, using an app they will install on your phone - and if your phone doesn't support it, they'll give you any phone you choose that does. You read a lot about monitoring in this offer letter. Your social media presence, your transactions, GPS location, cash withdrawals over $100. And they require an opening interview, at the start of the process, and a closing interview at the end of the year. And you'll sign a non-disclosure agreement and stay inside the US at all times, of course. So. You're being subsidized for a year as part of a trial to learn what people would do with Guaranteed Basic Income. You can go anywhere, do anything (unless you run out of money for the month and that "anything" has a price tag.) They'll watch and learn, but you can do anything you want on the government's dime if it's within the law and the contract. You put the letter down, and then - Then what do you do?


** joking answer:

I put down the letter and seriously re-evaluate some core beliefs I currently hold about the government, especially in the areas of its willingness to help its citizens and willingness to conduct experiments and accept evidence.

more serious answer:

I look for an inexpensive dev bootcamp in an area where [median income for that city] >= [cost of living]. with a list found, applications pour out, then move and attend. within half a year, I'd have a better, permanent job in a better area.

** There's really three ways for me to approach the situation, given my current financial situation (comfortable) and political preferences (highly in favor of a program similar to this, even if I don't personally need to benefit from it).

Realistic: I would move to a nicer condo in downtown Chicago, and otherwise continue living my life as I currently do, including going to work, saving, etc. A program like this would cover the opportunity costs that are currently standing in the way of my doing this today, and since it's only a year long, I need to still have a job afterwards as well.

Charitable: I don't actually need any of the money, so I realistically should donate it to someone else or start my own program to fund two or more others in a lower cost of living area for the cost of my own area. This is less likely because I'm not currently especially charitable, but it's what I'd say I would do to give myself warm fuzzies.

Munchkin: Try to discover what is required to create a new municipality. Create it, and then test what happens for the following situations: I set my salary as mayor equal to double the median salary of the town; if that doesn't work, I recruit foreign investors by offering to pay them 1.5x their current salary to live here, and spend half of my newly increased funds to do just this.

There are many times in my life where this would have been life changing, but right now, I'm living well below my means and banking quite a bit of my money. Honestly, I would try and find some way to make UBI more likely to be implemented for everyone before I would use it for excess personal gain.

** My first thought is that the government has gone insane. This experimental model is terrible. The NDA is never going to work; even if I don't do it, someone else in the group is going to anonymously leak the contract. If they're really selecting randomly, and their sample size is large enough to be meaningful, they're going to get someone who's dead-set against GBI and wants to sink it. Further, you can't present someone with an offer and then have them sign an NDA as part of it, because if they refuse the offer they're not bound by the NDA. Either the government is having people sign an NDA /then/ giving the offer, which means selecting for a certain type of person, or they're using the law in a highly unconventional way that I'd find pretty troubling. More worrying than the fact that the government is doing experimentation on its citizens is the fact that they're doing this in secret.

So the experiment is probably going to end within the first few weeks, if not sooner. The costs associated with moving are so high that I can't actually change my location in order to take advantage of a place with a higher median income, and that's if I had any confidence that the experiment would last. There are also costs associated with quitting and starting a job, so I'm not really going to change my employment. Cost-of-living is highly associated with median income, so I don't really see much benefit in moving anyway, though I suppose I could run some numbers and figure out if there was a place I could move that's best on some income/cost index. (And I probably still don't move, because I've put down roots.)

** I'm not sure this is the best sub for this since it's more a political question than a story question. Most answers that people would give would not be story ones.

At any rate, giving someone a trial of guaranteed basic income wouldn't work like the real thing. For instance, if I had a minimum wage job, I might quit my job because GBI would allow me to hone my skills such that I can get a better one. If the GBI is a trial and has an end point, it would be stupid for me to do this since the trial could end before I gained the skills and found a job.

Also, much of the effect of GBI, both positive and negative, would happen because of how the market reacts to it. For instance, minimum wage employers know that their employees will still be able to eat if they are fired, which affects how they treat their employees. Since this is a trial and done in secret, and doesn't apply to most people anyway, that won't happen.

A political question can also be a story question; some of my favorite stories are political in nature. It's not a terribly great story prompt because it encourages answers like, "I do X", which aren't really stories. A better prompt (if the aim is to get stories) would be, "The government begins running random trials on its citizens in secret through a 'dark' fund", because that's more broad and offers more possibilities. Even, "the government begins a trial with the following rules" would be more likely to get a story, because we wouldn't be penned in by having our protagonist and setting decided for us. (For example, my story would always have to start with a married 29-year-old software engineer living in Duluth who shares my values, unless I wanted to go off-prompt.)

**** There are still outlier municipalities. For example, Hidden Hills is a town in California with a median income above $250,000. It's got a small population (about 2,000) of very wealthy individuals. Same goes for Chevy Chase, MD, pop. 3,000 and median income >$250,000.

The trick is to find one of those outliers where there's not a correspondingly high cost-of-living.

You assert that Hidden Hills has a small population of wealthy individuals, because there are less than 2000 of those individuals in the city.

I assert that Hidden Hills does not have a small population of wealthy individuals, as 100% of its residents are wealthy.

We don't actually know this; all we know is the median, which as you said, removes outliers.

Otherwise you're correct. I (and presumably the parent poster) are using "small population" to mean the population of the municipality in comparison with other municipalities.

We also know that there are no significant outliers on the low end, as the last census said that 0 residents were in poverty.

(I can also offer a small bit of anecdotal evidence as I used to drive past Hidden Hills on a near-daily basis during my commute, and there's nowhere in the area that you could live if you were less than middle-class and not homeless.)

But yes, you're correct in that the statistics only allow us to formally assert that less than 50% of people make less than ~$250k.

Anyway, my mistake was forgetting which sub I'm looking at, because plenty of other places on the Internet would have people confusing median for mean without realizing it. :P

** What? /What/?

I'm attending college right now! My experiences will not be demonstrative of /anything/ relative to the average citizen! Either I'll save it all or I'll spend it on random crap because my scholarship already takes care of my basic needs.

Alright. So I have an extra $26,000 (people don't make a lot over here, since half the population is college students). Uh... I'll see if maybe I can arrange to just take a year off and go down to San Francisco. That gives me an extra $53,000 (seems well worth it) and gives me the opportunity to establish residency there so that I can pay less tuition when I move on to getting a Master's.

And then... going to save a good portion of it, going to invest some of it in my writing, and (obviously) going to spend some on food and housing. I'll probably still save most of it. I can live off of $15,000 a year if I chop out all of the unimportant stuff, so if I save $40,000 then that still leaves me with enough for a (tight-ish) year in San Francisco, including enough to invest in my writing a little bit.

I still probably won't be a very good example of the average citizen.

If it's guaranteed minimum income, I shrug, refuse the offer, and go on with my business. I make more than my city's median salary, so a guaranteed minimum income wouldn't pay anything to me in my present job. It would allow me to drop my income by a large amount and gain back ~40 hours a week, but I can't afford that.

If it's basic income, I shrug, accept the offer, and put the money into savings. It should see me retiring a year earlier.

If it lasted for life rather than just one year, though, I would continue working but retire appreciably earlier. Or maybe I'd just take a few years off to work on my own projects. Yes, I'm boring.

Half the people criticizing US welfare think it's too tough on recipients and not accepting enough. Half the people think it's too generous and we shouldn't be giving handouts to people. Some say it's not standardized enough. Some say that large companies like Walmart are using government assistance programs to reduce the amount they have to pay in salaries -- they have employees sign up for EBT to avoid having to pay a wage that people might actually be able to live on. Some say that welfare discourages working (because your value as a person is bounded by your economic output, of course). Some point to welfare abuse, citing one person in the 1970s who signed up for benefits under several dozen names (and assume that we've not become any more adept at catching fraud).
