** I just caught up on Mother of Learning. This seems less well followed... but it is long, and I like that.

Can someone give me a one or two sentence review/spoiler-free-summary?

*** Two people summoned into a fantasy world, each try and change the world for the better. I like it especially because of the tech uplifting by Cato.

*** A more realistic approach to economics than usual.

sorry to deviate, are there any other similar ones (to Mother of Learning and A Hero's War Chapter ) (other than paultwister)?

*** I like it now that I'm caught up, but it's not as well written as Mother of Learning. As somebody trying to get better at writing that isn't meant as criticism and there definitely seems to have been extensive plot planning, but there have been multiple times when the same thing has happened in two different chapters and characters have acted like it's the first time.

** Caught up, 20 hours of reading and 3 days later.

I'm sucker for competence porn, so even if the story has some issues, as others have said, I enjoyed it a huge lot.

It is very unpolished, though. Once it's finished I hope the author will go through a good editor and then publish it.

** I like Morey. He's humble and smart enough to acknowledge Cato's contribution to the cause.

** Wow loved the story. Thanks for the post!! I picked it up thanks to the post. The story was well researched, and the characters are lovable. Some parts of the story feels abit inorganic however thats due to the amount of information needed to be process. However the story is still absolutely awesome!!!
