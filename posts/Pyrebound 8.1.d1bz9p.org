In which our hero munchkins a wee bit.

For people just discovering this, PB is the story of a young man trying to make the best of life in an absolutely terrible fantasy world. It might not be exactly Ratfic depending how you parse things, but the worldbuilding is deep and consistent, and nobody important is a fool for plot purposes.


** I just started the story cause it sounds cool, and I love it so far, but I wanted to ask, is it progression fantasy/does the main character get anything interesting, or is he just a kid with a sword and shield?

*** It's not progression fantasy as you're probably thinking of it--as I understand it, that's something close to LitRPG, with a strong emphasis on characters gaining new powers and using them. This is a different kind of critter. But no, he doesn't remain just a kid with a sword. Weird things happen.

**** Okay, I am interested, mind if I talk to you about it when I get farther? Also, does it continue to make a big deal about gender?

***** Always glad to hear from readers; it's a serial so I can get feedback. I don't know what you mean by making a big deal about gender; where in the story are you at? The magic in this world (at least the human kind) is linked to biological sex, and this is a conservative society with traditional gender roles. If not exactly healthy ones, much of the time--hence the eunuchs.

****** Oh, I don't mind the magic part, I meant the "be a man, men don't give up their ideals" stuff. That's just a personal thing though, it's not a critique of the story. Didn't realize you were the author! I like it! I'm currently at 3.4, and enjoying it a lot. Any critique I have is just personal preferences, and I love the world system.

******* Ah, I get you now. Belemel is not a major character; not surprisingly, Ram does not drag his disabled and bad-tempered father around with him on adventures. OTOH, he was Ram's primary male role model. He has significance that way.

******** He does, it's simply a pet peeve, when half of his motivation for what he does in the bazu place is "I"m a man, and men keep their debts". I don't mean to trash on the story, I'm really enjoying it, and I appreciate that he gets called out for things(the girl in 4.2), rather than being hailed as some chosen one. To be clear, the "man" thing isn't a writing flaw, it fits the world and how he grew up, just an uninteresting motivation.

** I'm not sure I get where Rammash is going. He says he'll get killed "if" he ever goes back to Dul Karagi... but he's obviously going to sneak back in the city, to overthrow the government or something. So why does he act at the end of the chapter like it's a permanent exile that he can't do anything about?

Overall, I like the general shape of his relation with Darun (it reminds me of Fenn in WtC, except everyone involved is shaggier), but it is starting to feel a little... not grating, but painful to watch. Rammash still doesn't have any friend or positive relationships with anybody he respects. Darun and Rammash's relationship seem to end at her trying to get into his pants, and him treating her with contempt. I hope they move past that at some point.

*** It's not a typical relationship, for certain. I've deliberately omitted the gorier details of Darun's past on "rather too horrible to read about" grounds, but she's a very damaged human being who doesn't entirely know what she wants. (spoilers for this update, sorta) She was not sincerely coming on to him on the boat; she spent a lot of her childhood powerless and being used sexually, and enjoys using her sexuality to get power over people, in this case by needling Ram's more conservative hearth-reared mores. But even cheating at tiles, or shaking down male customers, is more of the same. Maybe this doesn't come across very clearly, IDK.

Ram is, at present, confused about his place in things. This will not repeat NOT last much longer. But the present goal is to get to Imbri and ask for her help puzzling things out. For the time being, he's an outcast. I hope this isn't too downbeat--I try to keep a full-chapter backlog (five updates), so reaction to reader feedback is greatly delayed.

**** Yeah, I got the "uses sex as a means to get control because ex-prostitute" part. But... I mean, that's really the sum of their relationship so far, her trying to an edge on him, and him basically slut-shaming her.

I get that it's realistic, but it's kind of bleak for that to be the only interaction we see between the two main characters so far.

***** Noted. Anybody else agree, disagree, what-have-you?

EDIT: The Ram-Darun relationship is going to evolve, of course; they've only really known each other for much less than a year, and there are substantial hurdles to trust on both sides. It might be somewhat slower than you like, and even I don't have a firm idea where it's going to end. To be honest. Also, as to slut-shaming, he dislikes her mostly for her persistent dishonesty (she was robbing customers the moment he met her) and the part where she goes out of her way to be hateful or dismissive to everyone, including him. The sexually aggressive aspect is somewhat unnerving, but he hasn't internalized his mother's values all that strongly. Which is why he went dancing, drank greenbeer ...

***** Okay, I've thought it over, and tweaked upcoming chapters a bit. Not a lot--I'm bound by my own conception of realism in relationships, here--but the trajectory has changed significantly. I'm kind of surprised how much readers (not just you, but in general) seem to like Darun. She's more likeable than she was in the first draft of the story, when she was just an irredeemably selfish troublemaking bitch with barely any backstory, but still, I never thought of her as fan-favorite material. Maybe it's just because she takes such a prominent role here.

****** In a way I think its because of how things are set up. Right now we just have two characters to focus on, pretty much.

​

Personally I actually like Darun, because generally in books unless they really hone in on the misery they've caused with their actions or their actions can easily be imagined to cause misery (rape, murder, etc); I give a lot more leeway in the things they do. Also her mix of flirting, competence and desire for adventure/freedom is compelling - to me at least.

​

Also great job! really enjoying this. Though I do feel like its lacking a defined goal at the moment, because to be honest them toppling the leader of country seems pretty unreachable right now and thats the only goal/direction that is available right now.

****** I'm not saying she's likeable; I'm saying her being unlikeable is a problem when she's the only character that protagonist regularly interacts with.

(although the general story is still enjoyable)
