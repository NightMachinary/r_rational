Anyone know what happened to S.I. by datapacrat? Was it dropped?


** Here's a link to the Google Docs with the index of all ten of the books for anyone who wants to read them: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZcUba_GKVCm_i2VeGrfSBBxC8pR6VZC5VBBUVKKxYk/edit]]

I think the books are planned to be continued, but datapacrat is probably spending some time away from it to work on other projects.

** I remember that thing! It was about an irrational aspiring rationalist adventuring through an irrational world having just enough intelligence and thought put into things it break them horribly and for his/her hubris the SI is violated in every imaginable way and several that can't.
