** I think I'm at the point where I just have to drop this. There's been far too much naval gazing for so long, too much dragging the story by bogging down the chapters, and we finally get another blue and it's underwhelming because we've already been told that nothing will happen without certain levels being reached, so we know we're about to have to sit through more of the same stuff again, and I just can't get excited for the weekly chapter of this anymore. I think I'm just going to sit on this until next year before I bother picking this back up. It's got so much potential waiting in the background, I just don't want to sit through the most boring training arc ever, especially since it's taking place in the title-naming location and it's somehow still boring

**** A lot of people say that, yet somehow the author still has 2200 patrons (meaning probably about $7,000/month) and an incredibly active comments section and discord server.

Shoot, I even agree with the statement, yet I just finished reading the chapter and now I'm in the comments. I was a patron for a while before finally giving it up because I just didn't care that much about the story and got tired of being teased. I left it for a long time then went back when it popped up here on r/r.

What is it about this story? Large, LARGE sections of it are incredibly boring, the pacing is glacial, there's no particular conflict, the protagonist isn't particularly proactive and hasn't had much of any character evolution, the worldbuilding hasn't evolved much in fifty chapters...yet somehow we're still reading. Seriously, what's going on?

***** I'm reading because it's free and sunk cost fallacy kind of, it's also not awful, it's just too slow to be especially interesting, meaning i'd never recommend this to anyone and i'd probably give it 3 stars right now.

basically it's not bad, but it have fallen to mediocre due to shooting its pacing with a shotgun and forgetting it was a thing that ever existed.

i like how the system is build up and how the world works, but its too slow for me too feel the author will ever do anything with it, honestly if i dropped this and found it again in 2 years i'd be like "sweet something nice to read", and then be disapointed by the fact 100 chapters just amount to them doing a half delve in this dungeon.

many novels do have the opposite problem where they are too fast and keep escalating until the world no longer make sense, that is also bad, the middle road is usually the best one.

He's not really doing that to be combat effective, right now the reason he's going to be picking 3 more damage auras is simply that he already picked two, and by the rules by which he expects rare classes to work, he absolutely has to pick 3 more or he shoots himself in the foot.

If you pick my argument rationaly, then offencive auras are powerfull enough to compete with dps classes or they don't. The first option will lead to OP main character because is aoe and he can avoid frendly fire, also combat would be very dull. The second option would make the skill allotment a waste of actual skill point to be expended in support skills. The same argument can be have with the wards. AoE skills are very difficult to balance in games for a reason. Thats why most aoe classes are support, they make the everyone else do their shit better, period. In the end we would get either an OP MC or an hippicritical MC with a "do what i say intead of what i do" motto.

  Are we reading different stories? The linked chapter only says diplomacy is not an option. It says nothing about their intelligence or lack thereof.
#+end_quote

I don't want to quote the full context because it's long, but it's the six paragraphs that start with "Tallheart blinked. “A normal monster might recognize a weapon and choose to keep it, but not a mere stone. It would perhaps use it as a tool, but then it would discard it." The clearest part is here:

#+begin_quote
  *The chapter said:*

  The implications were unsettling. The existence of a hyper-violent pack of roid-apes was horrifying enough without them having learned to make tools. It raised terrifying questions about just how intelligent a monster could be. A few months ago, Rain might have had qualms about killing such creatures, but no more. He didn't trust the opinion of just anyone, but he trusted Ameliah. If she said diplomacy wasn't an option, then it wasn't, end of story. The smarter a monster was, the more urgently it needed killing.

  Monsters were monsters. They might act like they were alive---eating, sleeping, even playing and forming complex social structures---but they weren't.
#+end_quote

It's true that what I wrote is a meme and not a literal quote, but I think it's a fair representation. Rain, Tallheart, and Ameliah are in the deeps, far from any human settlement that might be endangered by the Hababas, so they don't have the "proactive self-defense" excuse. Our heroes are here solely to kill things in order to level up and they are keeping the deepstone club heads from the Hababas that they killed yesterday. Therefore "it's okay to kill them and take their stuff."

As to the 'all it said is that diplomacy is impossible' element, if that's the only part one leans on then that just makes it worse. Try substituting it with a different group: The +monsters+ African tribesmen can have a society, play, use tools, wear clothes, understand the significance of a crown, and build structures...but +they totally aren't intelligent and self-aware+ diplomacy is impossible, so they aren't people, so it's okay to +kill+ enslave them and take their stuff." See how it becomes much more obvious that this is not okay?

***** But the excuse was never that they're not intelligent. In fact that whole section (the one starting with "Tallheart blinked") goes on and on to make a point of how much more intelligent these hababas or their leaders are likely to be than their more typical counterparts, because a =blue boss= must be properly introduced.

The reasons I see presented for killing them are:

1. The primary purpose of the trip is to hunt and kill monsters.
2. The way down is still a mystery and this group of hababas is particularly dangerous. The kind of enemy that you don't want to stumble upon while exploring (as we saw last chapter), or worse, blocking your escape route(as has been discussed in previous chapters).

****** Yes, exactly. The team has ample evidence suggesting that these creatures are sophonts, albeit primitive ones. The monsters are living on their own in the depths, no threat to anyone, but it's okay for Rain et al to show up and kill them so that Rain can level up.

We as the audience are supposed to be okay with it because the monsters aren't human and we are strongly invested in seeing Rain gain levels. I'm simply pointing out that there's a serious moral issue here.

EDIT: I didn't respond to your second point, sorry. I don't think that it would be a good excuse to say "I wouldn't want these French people blocking my escape route, therefore I will kill them before continuing."

The info about monsters, abberants, and unique names was really interesting. I wonder why such special monsters would eventually be named by what is essentially a facet of reality itself, and what's really the truth of the system. And I don't think it's a planet-sized energy harvester this time.

It's a decent 50-100% all-around bump but nothing major. Suppression is a good addition. Max DPS without Extend goes from 3.5k to 5.7k at 18m radius.

In contrast, level 26 has a max DPS without Extend of 586k using the combination of 5 elemental attacks at once, at 62.5m radius, with Wards and Suppression active. This does exhaust his mana in a single second but it refreshes multiple times a minute.

The only real advantage he gets before 26 is getting to choose new offensive auras.

******* Yeah, that's a good point.

I went back and looked at the [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/627111/133-breaking][fight with Hegar]] and I think he might have been able to kill Hegar if he had Shroud/Radiance/Ethereal Aura. He does 10k DPS for 2,700 MP and it brings Hegar [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/631237/134-unbreakable][down below 6k HP]]. I suspect if he weren't worried about mage burning himself he could have opened with 2 seconds of 10k DPS, which looks like it would have killed Hegar outright.

Anyway... I also forgot about the synergy skills. Aura Synergy will go from an 80% boost to a 140% boost at level 24 (with maxed aura skills), which ain't nothing.

******** I wonder what level Hegar was, Rains build in theory should be quite bad at 1v1 since auras are specialised at AoE. I always assumed Rain's primary advantage over Hegar is equipment and just outlevelling him.

** I did try to follow Delve, but surprisingly there is a lot of dislike for the story to be posted here... Shouldn't those that do not like, just downvote and let the process sort this out?

*** I think a major problem a lot of us have is that it's good for a lot of it, then it just starts dragging for no real reason. There's so much potential for a great story, but it just feels like the author is bogging the narrative down. I think people complain because they want to see improvement, a return to form from earlier parts of the story where there felt like actual progression after a dozen chapters, rather than the same internal monologue on repeat for weeks on end. I feel a downvote isn't needed if it still fits into the category of the subreddit, which it does, and would only serve to discourage the author or make them double down instead of seeing that many people have valid criticisms that we hope get addressed
