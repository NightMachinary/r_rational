** It'd be interesting to read a sequel/alternate, where the Reaper reaps the last thing in the universe which could be considered "life", but is still surrounded by leftover constructs of civilization which are sapient or super-sapient in and of themselves.

Would Death have to stick around until the universe itself ran out of energy, and thus the potential to accidentally recreate life, no matter how lowly? Or would he be able to hang up the cloak and scythe, put the chairs on the tables, and switch off the light as he left?

** I'm a stickler for the metaphor so I wonder what this would look like with the classical interpretation of the four horsemen: Conquest on White ("conquering, and to conquer"), Slaughter on Red ("that they should kill one another"), Famine on Black, and Death on the Pallid Horse. Probably Famine would be first to go?

*** Is Red as Slaughter really the classical interpretation? I thought that Red was /Civil/ War (as opposed to White's imperialistic War Of Conquest), hence "that they should kill /one another/".

And if one takes this view, then War of Conquest is already on the way out in our time. Unless we suppose that there is alien life to be cnquered, it'll be long dead by the time humanity gets its act together well enough to end famine and disease; in an enlightened age any war between human factions would be more of a Civil War than any kind of "War of Conquest" as the Greco-Roman world would have understood it. So, had a horseman of Conquest existed in the world I sketched out in my ministory, they would quite probably have been the first Horseman to go.

**** Both Slaughter and Civil War were common readings, AIUI. Slaughter is more, hmm, thematically resonant, so I prefer it.

I don't think Conquest is going to die any time soon. We have reined it in somewhat, but that mostly just means that it has to either pretend not to be conquest (Russia w.r.t. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Crimea) or be groups which flout international norms (ISIS). Conquest will be multi-planetary unless there's a successful singleton established before that /and/ it prevents violent struggle within its hegemony.

***** Author here and I think you've got me wrong. Pestilence dies a handful of thousands of years after the Fall of Rome. Death is looking back on that event from a time very, /very/ far in the future, when Humanity still endures and has outlasted the Earth.

  "Ride", I repeated with a chuckle that came out as more of a sob. "God, we had some good times, didn't we, the four of us? Remember the Fall of Rome? What a night. What a ride."

  "Oh, Death. That was three millennia ago," said Pestilence. "Or was it four? Look at us. Look at me! I can't even remember. High time I left the battlefield."

You may want to change these two lines. They state that the fall of Rome was only three or four millennium prior to this conversation. Loved the story, btw.

  "Hello, old friend. It's been a while." It had, of course. We had last met two centuries ago, when the Moon had died.
#+end_quote

So the moon died 2 centuries before Pestilence. And Pestilence dies 3 or 4 centuries after Rome fell? So the moon dies something like a 1000 years from now? That seems strange. Especially given that War is already gone, so that can't have been the cause of the moon's destruction.

******* Aaah, I see the confusion. My artistic vagueness comes to bite me in the rear... The Moon as a celestial object was not destroyed. I was trying to suggest that the /first human colony on the Moon/ had been wiped out recently (presumably by a plague outbreak of some kind), and this is what warranted a ride of the last two Horsemen --- much as it would have been the deaths of the Romans themselves which summoned them to the Fall of Rome, not any loss of physical real estate incurred.

End of Pestilence, t=3000-4000 years

End of Famine, time unknown but after the End of Pestilence

End of Earth, not explicitly stated to be after the End of Famine but implied.

Humanity forgets the location of Sol, unknown time but presumably after the End of Earth

Death takes the Horses for walkies in the empty void where Earth formerly orbited, on the spot on its surface where Rome formerly stood. Many centuries after the Fall of Famine, probably much later.
