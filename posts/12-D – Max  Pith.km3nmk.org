** So in previous comment threads it has been asked who it is that we would want to see "win" here. Well, after this last Interlude it seems clear that the real protagonist has been Maxine Clive all along, and I really want to see where her story is going. Regardless of atrocity and cost, I'm rooting for Clive and Tunnelvision now.

  A rage-filled, indebted freak was what the Corsairs called a ‘perfect hiring opportunity'.
#+end_quote

Frontline infantry!

What's with that huge gap after "The Corsairs punished insubordination" - is it a formatting error, or something else?

.

Anyways, this was a hell of a chapter. Paragon's hijacked the /entire government/ and nobody's the wiser. There's an entire shadow government/council out there pulling the strings, like they always have.

After all this, I really hope Grace and Max live to the end of their revolution. True, their society turned them into monsters, but what they're fighting it so much worse.

**** Can't humdrums learn anti-nudging? So it would be possible, just needs education

It kind of parallels the real world where people aren't taught to think critically and so can often be manipulated

***** It's not just about education, there's a power asymmetry in favor of offense. Someone like eg Honeypot can come up with a new means of hijacking the entire government, but you can't defend the government against every potential hijacking technique, especially since you don't know them in advance.

Oof, yeah. Not that guy's Vocation or anything, just something anyone could learn if Paragon hadn't locked it up from most eyes

**** Not necessarily. Just because nudging /can/ be defended against, doesn't mean it always will be. That defense is a skill that has to be taught and practiced. Given the degree of control Paragon has, it's quite possible that they only let people become members of parliament if they haven't learned how to defend themselves in that way. Also, Buttercup Lodge used drugs that made people more vulnerable to nudging in order to secure their long term control over the prisoners. I wouldn't be surprised if Paragon used similar techniques here.

  Tunnel Vision clenched her teeth. “I won't be lectured by some half-witted Humdrum.”
#+end_quote

Wow. This was what early Tunnel Vision was like, huh?

Sadly, she didn't improve that much since.

#+begin_quote
  A few minutes later, the woman took the next prisoner in line. Then the next. Faint orange sunlight shone over the top of the makeshift walls, and faded into evening, then pure darkness. And the scientists kept taking prisoners, one by one, like they were all waiting at the doctor's office. And none of them came back.
#+end_quote

Human sacrifice?

There's /something/ going on with that black pool, and it's not just a scientific experiment like the surgeries.

Actual sacrifices seem a little too fantasy-ish for this story, but this whole section has a really Lovecraftian feeling, so who knows.

#+begin_quote
  “Most people wouldn't have spit in that scientist's face,” he said. “Most people would have stayed in that pit, watching the guard, waiting for someone to save them. Another thirty seconds down there, and you wouldn't have made it. But here you are.” He stepped to the side, off the path. “The rest is up to you.” “You have four minutes and thirteen seconds to leave this island,” he said.

  “And ruin all the fun?” The man looked offended. “See you later, Maxine Clive.” He strode into the dark cloud, out of sight.
#+end_quote

Whatever the deal with this guy is, I'm not sure I like it. The story so far feels mostly organic, the natural result of societal trends and powerful people following their incentives and all that.

Having an Ellimist/Outsider/ROB-type character who just makes the plot progress for idle fun kind of undermines that.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm sorry, Maxine,” said the scientist, with his mouth, but not his eyes. “I'm so sorry.” His voice stayed calm and steady. The other man's hand had almost reached the clicker.
#+end_quote

Man, feels good to see some payback at last.

#+begin_quote
  As usual, management had no idea what they were doing.

  “Fire me, if you want,” said Captain Reddish. “Court-martial me. Put this in my quarterly performance review.”
#+end_quote

Man, this got even Cyberpunk-ier.

(What even is Pith? Biopunk? Gasolinepunk?)

#+begin_quote
  The boss clenched his teeth, furious. Then he put his hand on the captain's shoulder, and his rage melted into a smirk. “Please? Inspire them.”

  Captain Reddish straightened himself and saluted. “Yes, sir!”
#+end_quote

Man, the last moments of that captain must have been horrifying. Complete confusion, all the while knowing he was leading his own soldiers to their deaths.

#+begin_quote
  “We believe that cooperation, not conflict, is the best road forward.”

  Max screamed through her gag, and one of the soldiers punched her in the solar plexus, knocking the wind out of her.
#+end_quote

This story seriously got its corporate tone down. The mix of bland cheeriness with implied or overt violence feels very accurate.

#+begin_quote
  A series of gunshots rang out. The man and woman carrying Max fell next to her, letting go of her. Then, Commander Hibben fell on top of her, splattering a warm liquid over her face.
#+end_quote

What was that line from FMA?

"Half of all officer deaths on the battlefield are attributed to assassinations by subordinates"?

I get the feeling the statistics for Corsair commanders are similar.

#+begin_quote
  Max pointed up. Tunnel Vision followed the direction of her finger, gazing towards the top of the seaside cliff.

  A dozen snipers lay on their stomachs, green circles tattooed on their hands, aiming their rifles down at Tunnel Vision.
#+end_quote

I don't really like that bit.

It feels very close to an anime twist, "I was in control the whole time" and all that, not to how actual soldiers would react. In a world with guns and superpowers and mind-control, experienced snipers wouldn't wait for their boss to give them a signal while she's being thrown off a cliff.

A sniper either takes the shot when they have one, or they die.

#+begin_quote
  Pictogram stared at his feet. “A disgusting, evil policy, made by a government that no longer exists. A leader, the Black Tortoise, who no longer rules the nation. Our fight is righteous, now. We battle against the Principality, against imperialism and cruelty.”
#+end_quote

Interesting.

We get more hints at Shenti politics.

#+begin_quote
  Gage, on the other hand, would be much simpler. They just had to kill her.
#+end_quote

"Meh, we can take her."

#+begin_quote
  Gage opened fire, and Grace dove behind a bookshelf, projecting into Max's clothes to drag her into the same cover.
#+end_quote

/Dammit/, Ana.

--------------

Overall this chapter is a doozy, like much of this story.

I feel so bad for Max. She tried so hard and she got so smart and she played her hand so well, and in the end all it took was for Evil-Superman to go on a rampage and all her efforts went in smoke in a few minutes.

  /Gage/. Why had Max ever thought she could recruit her? The thick-witted idiot would sacrifice herself for the elites at Paragon, again and again, no matter how many times they kicked her.
#+end_quote

Damn, even the people in the story are saying it now.

Alright, I know I've said "maybe this will be the thing that changes Ana's mind" about a hundred times by now, but I feel like Paragon's hijacking of Parliament is different. Not just because it's completely beyond the pale (although it is), but because now is a very narratively appropriate time for Ana to realize that Paragon are the bad guys. After all, she just helped them beat Commonplace, something they very well might not have been able to do without her help. What better time to have her realize she's been fighting for the wrong side than after she just secured their victory?

On a related note, I worry that Paragon's mind-controlling of Parliament being made public is going to cause them to go completely mask-off with their authoritarianism. When they've lost even the appearance of legitimacy and restraint, what's stopping them from responding to public unrest with mind-controlling the agitators and brainwashing anyone who speaks out against them?

I'm not sure they made it public yet. Ana's team killed the Radio Man, and Max's narration was ambiguous as to whether they actually managed to transmit it to a broad audience. Also, Kahlin and Verity are still stuck in the building.

I think the green hand survivors are going to try to negotiate with Ana to let them get the message out.
