Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power to continually reincarnate after brain death. You'll be born from a random human mother and will contain none of your past lives' memories until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you. This password, chosen at your first incarnation, unlocks your soul from your unconscious mind.

The password must be unique enough that you wouldn't be unlocked by a mundane word and something that could be more or less spelled out phonetically by most literate people just by hearing it said.

When unlocked, you gain your first incarnation's memories as well as the memories incarnations where you were unlocked. This includes their learned knowledge and to some extent skills that they learned. The process is spontaneous, but automatically, "smooths" things out to prevent you from suffering much trauma from being unlocked or any other consequences of having lifetime(s) dumped into your mind.

However, being unlocked also gives you the acquired, treated/untreated psychological trauma of your past lives and you won't be entirely protected against feelings of loss and other attachments.

Your innate personality remains constant across all incarnations, even if they're locked.

How would you munchkin this power?

How would you reverse munchkin this power? Your only knowledge is that there was a egotistic rationalist currently living who'd found a way to unlock three previous incarnations with the goal of obtaining power over humanity.

*** I think we need stricter definitions for what the password can be. What is meant by “mundane word”? I think I'd go for something like “scalene”. It's probably obscure enough, and I'd expect it to be activated in every lifetime that I go to school in childhood, even in the future. Probably activates around age 10-13? If I never go to school I could realistically not hear it until late in life, so it's not ideal. “Algorithm” is also pretty good for a teenage start, don't know if it passes your phonetic test.

If it's needs to be a one-on-one conversation and teachers won't work then I'd choose something related to reproduction, get activated during the Talk. I'm also assuming this is working across languages, because I think the phonetic restriction doesn't make sense otherwise.

**** You could potentially set up a challenge with a reward (like the millennium problems) but instead of solving a maths problem which someone could theoretically beat you to, you can instead have the question be “decrypt this message”, the message being encrypted with a one time pad, you being the only person in the world with the key and can pretend that you cracked it somehow, this would result in you looking like a precocious child genius(and the fame which results from that label), getting your money from your previous incarnations and then you can make a similar seemingly philanthropic challenge in the name of encouraging development of the field and continue passing the money down (maybe there is a rule that states that anyone who accepts the prize must setup a similar challenge with a prize pool of atleast equal size, that way if one of the people looking after the unencrypted answer leaks it or cheats by abusing their position somehow, you won't lose the money it will just be inaccessible for a lifetime). Instead of having future knowledge you can instead use your wealth to fund the passing of laws which censor information to prevent the growth of future technologies and decrease future discoveries, this means everyone else in the world will unfortunately have no improvement to their quality of life or life expectancy but you could get continual growth of both of those things.

****** Climate change would be difficult to deal with... it would be difficult to get humanity to stop using environmentally unfriendly stuff and living lifestyles which create a lot of waste but if I am worried about knowledge advancing forwards without me being awakened then the solutions would be slowed by my censorship of information. Maybe the creation of a terrorist organisation which is essentially eco warriors that assassinate CEOs, destroy factories, etc. Of non-environmentally friendly organisations would work if that can scare company leaders into changing direction for fear of assassination and destruction of property causing the eco-friendly alternatives being more profitable and the eco-friendly factories being a safer (and therefore more desirable place to work, even for lower wages) place to work. In order to succeed in this reincarnation you'd have to achieve the creation of a terrorist organisation without doing the challenge to pass your money down or else the ethics of the challenge could be called in to question, putting unpleasant suspicion on you in future reincarnations and potentially having your way of transferring wealth outlawed since it can result in the wrong people getting power (if society sees it facilitates a terrorist organisations creation, you could try to be discreet and ensure no one finds out the organisation was created by you but then growing it into something that dangerous would be hard since recruiting would be hard and if you fail, even if you die or kill yourself the body can be used to identify you). The biggest problem with this approach is the trauma associated with it, this is clearly highly unethical and could cause a heavy mental burden for you, even if change was fast the amount of deaths would be high. I realise the goal of world domination is for reverse munchkin but since I'm new here I don't know if the goal when thinking as the munchkin is different or the same, I assumed it was the same but perhaps I am wrong? If it's the same then someone attempting world domination having the weakness of accumulated trauma makes it seem like the munchkin has highly contradictory internal motivations, I think it's an interesting scenario because of that but also really difficult to think of how to achieve that goal. This “solution” to climate change whilst suppressing information about future technologies is a massive reach in my opinion but it's what I came up with for the time being, if I think of something else I'll reply to this one :)

****** Since we're dealing with reincarnation, I used the model of ensoulment of the majority of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Daoists, Druze, and other worldviews that believe in reincarnation. Plus from a more scientific standpoint, it makes slightly more sense in-universe.

One's innate personality is largely a product of their nervous system, the nervous system is the product of one's genetic code.

Of course one's genetic code is the source of a sperm and egg, and we could go further back up the sequence of origination, but reincarnation hijacking the chain at conception seems the path of least resistance as opposed to effectively phasing in a different baby later on in the process.

Speaking about the abortion debate specifically, I'd say that one's life does start at conception if you have to pick a starting point as neutrally as possible. It's not the start of consciousness or the ability to feel pain, but that's not what how we define an individual, even if it's part of how we discuss matters of ethics. This is assuming we're defining things by what's closest to the truth rather than what creates the best outcomes.

(I still have those misgivings from before tbh. Does saying the soul shapes the foetus but not inhabit the body until birth work under your system?

*** It is simple enough to choose a common brand name as the password. Like "America", or "Google". The problem is they won't last forever. After a few millennia, they may no longer exist, and then your password will never be said again.

Which suggests another approach: using sounds that will never die until humanity goes extinct. I'm thinking either "AHHHH!" or "ssss", which are sounds that people make occasionally and will never go away completely. They are not mundane words, and they can be phonetically pronounced.

The problem then, is this constraint:

#+begin_quote
  until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you.
#+end_quote

What does that "intentionally" actually mean? Do they have to be intentionally speaking to you specifically? So it doesn't work if they are speaking to a large audience or in an online video clip? Do they have to intentionally speak your password while KNOWING that it is your password? But how would they know they know your password and it isn't just a lie your previous incarnations told them? Reincarnation could be treated as a hoax after all.

Also do they need to know what exactly the password is for or will do? What if you just trick the world's mothers into thinking your password is a magic word that will make babies who listen to it become smarter? The mothers would 'know' that they are speaking a password to their babies, but they wouldn't know what that password is really for. Would that work?

You couldn't make a big company that popularizes its brand name or a catch phrase that includes your password, because then the name/phrase becomes very "common" and so very "mundane" and then the password wouldn't work anymore.

The restriction is presumably a restriction on the choice of password. It's probably not a magical clause that, if contradicted for a given period of time, cause the password to not work for that period of time. I see no reason to read it like that other than to bring up this objection.

********* The problem here is, if the 'mundanity' is defined only with regard to the current time, that means you can cheat by turning your password from a currently-not-mundane word to a future-mundane word. As in, changing mundane words like "the" or "you" or "table" into your password. For example, you could set your password to a slight mispronunciation of "the", then start a mass-misleading program of making people think that "the" is actually pronounced as the slight mispronunciation that is your password. Then your password would effectively become the mundane word "the", and be said nigh constantly in mundane usage, which would be incredibly strong.

The other solutions like making your own brand/company/country/whatever, will create passwords that are only mentioned when someone talks about the brand/company/country/whatever, so the solutions are effectively limited to the lifespans of those brands/companies/countries. A mundane word like "the", barring the deliberate and expensive intervention that you did and that is utterly pointless for anyone else to do, will outlive the others by orders of magnitude.

I don't see the problem here. You're certainly allowed to make people say your password more often, including by engineering language. Although... If anyone here had the ability to make their own internationally famous brand/company/country/etc. they would do so, and substantially modifying the pronunciation of a common English word is similarly not a reliable plan.

To reverse munchkin I would probably try to wipeout humanity or instead would try to create a global secret organisation or secret society that gives tests to children across the world (similar to a mandatory IQ test), these tests would contain questions that someone their age wouldn't know the answer to but someone who lived during the time would e.g. something popular during the 80s, 90s, etc. Or would use psychological manipulation maybe using leading questions to trick them into accidentally revealing themselves and then torture them their entire life and hopefully that will ensure that whenever they reincarnate and awaken they will probably be mentally broken, this approach relies on them awakening at an early age, they're likely to do that at least once, especially when they make their password a popular word. Another approach (wouldn't use this in conjunction with mandatory test as the pitfalls would be more obvious) is to spread the info as much as possible to prevent them from suppressing it without drawing suspicion, would be hard since you'd probably sound like a lunatic trying to convince someone that was true. Perhaps one way of dealing with it is creating a highly successful work of art that spawns its own sub genre of dystopian, a book where the protagonist utilises human-computer interaction to live out their life by experiencing the memories of anyone jacked in to the system and all the horrible trauma associated with living out another persons life, or perhaps make it unethical where a malevolent force, creature or person utilises this or a similar ability to kill humanity or some other great evil, demonising them in the process, perhaps a video game like prey with mimics that can become anything and... ------------------SPOILERS FOR PREY------------------------------------------------------- the antagonist can become a human-mimic hybrid like the protagonist does and then commit atrocities, the implantation of the mimic DNA being what causes this change making their nature pure evil an unempathetic . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the goal of this is to make everyone hate things that can perform similar feats and see them as evil demons and hopefully the constant anxiety about someone finding out and constantly being portrayed as demonic would be enough stress to mentally break them eventually even if it takes way longer than my lifespan.

** For any piece of armor you wear with a volume bigger than 64 cubic centimeters, you can pick a specific material property to be applied over your whole body. So if you wear a boxing glove, anyone punching your body would feel the padding on the gloves. If you wear a shin guard, punching your body would be akin to punching a person wearing hard body armour composed of that shin guard.

Some rules:

- For every piece of armor you wear beyond the first one, you must pick a specific property (chemical or physical) that would then be applied across your whole body. For example, if you wore a titanium bracer, you could pick titanium's toughness or stiffness as the property to get applied. Toughness would result in being able to take impacts better (would result in less displacement of your body), while stiffness would result in having a body that is harder to deform (harder to break bones, pierce skin, etc). You could wear ceramic kneepads for better heat resistance, or an aluminum foil hat to radiate away some heat energy so that you don't overheat as easily when in proximity to high temperature objects.

- When you pick a specific property to be applied, it overwrites any other piece of gear that had the same property applied. For example, if you wore aluminum and steel kneepads, you would only be able to pick one of the objects for their toughness, or stiffness, or conductance.

- When damage is applied to your body not covered by the piece of armor, the damage is instead dealt to the piece of armor whose property contributed to its blocking. For example, if you wore steel and ceramic. Steel would block blunt/sharp impacts while the ceramic would block or resist heat. With enough damage it is possible to break the armor pieces. It is also possible to target the specific armor piece, which could also break with enough damage. In the previous case, a hard enough hit to the ceramic piece (something beyond steel's ability to absorb) would break it, and you would lose the protection of the ceramic. With enough heat the ceramic would melt, and you would lose its protective properties.

- While you do gain the protective properties of each piece of armor you wear, you are still a human on the inside. It is more akin to being covered by a layer of the material over your whole body, that has the same thickness as the piece of armor you wear. Except that layer is solid, and yet you can move your body around as you would normally. A hard enough hit to your body will still kill or injure you. For example, you may be able to survive getting run over by a car, but the shock of it would still give you a concussion.

Which materials do you choose if you have $1000 to outfit yourself? What about $100,000? And what about if you have infinite money and access to all the possible scientific materials (that are available in quantities above 64 cm^{3).}

Barring protection, what are some cool/interesting things you can do with this power?

Step 3: ??? Turn excess skin into armor without it ever going further away than 1cm???

Step 4: Recursive Profit!

Memes aside, what I mean by "parts added on" are things like skin grafts. Ways to surgically increase your body size so that the effect becomes applied over a larger volume of "body". So, as a kind of mundane example, suppose you surgically add a really long rope of skin to your body. Can you then apply your armor effects to this rope of skin, and so gain a really strong/tough/sturdy/etc. whip?

If the "whip skin" notion works, can you keep surgically adding more shapes and structures to your body for the magical effects to apply to them too? You could make entire unbreakable buildings and cities out of your skin (that would still be attached to your body, but could be done through loose and thin ropes). There may even be a way to munchkin up an entire space elevator, surgically implanted into your body.

*** Would that mean If I wore a silk shirt my whole body would have thr flexibilty and tensile strength of silk?

Would a ring of rust let me burn my hair to produce molten iron and oxygen?

Would a 90s rave braclet with drugs in it let my spit get people high?

**** See point 4, it's more akin to being covered by a layer of the armor material that has the same thickness as the piece of armor in question. A ring of rust wouldnt work since it has less volume than 64 cm^{3}

*** Since no one else has pointed it out yet, just having to put on a few pieces of a suit of armour to get the benefit of wearing an entire one is a big boost to dexterity. If the definition of "piece of armour" is also generous enough all you need to do is strap a chunk of relevant material somewhere where it doesn't impede your motion, like tying ropes or fabric to a chunk of thin metal to wear as a backpack and distribute the weight (although the rope wouldn't be durable itself, so you'd need durable bindings and all).

Also what counts as 'wear'? If you surgically implant enough material in your body, would that count? Do prosthetic limbs count as worn? Do your bones? Even just getting an extra layer of bone is a defensive layer that's easy and inconspicuous.

**** Prosthetic limbs do count as worn, but you will have to pick a specific property from any of the multiple materials that make up that prosthetic limb. Something is worn when it contacts your skin and you are able to walk around with it on (and the item doesn't leave farther than 1 cm from your skin at any contact points). By that metric, an exoskeleton would count as worn, but not a car, or a building. A cardboard box would also work as "worn."

****** It won't count as worn unless it contacts your skin somewhere else, yes.
