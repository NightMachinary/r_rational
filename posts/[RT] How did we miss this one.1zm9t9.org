** ...In real life, I'm pretty sure most criminals do not spontaneously decide to confess after they're presented with flimsy physical data. This happens a lot on Law and Order SVU, though I can't recall if I've seen it a lot on the original.

*** In real life, psychologically manipulative interrogations often work as well or better than gathering forensic evidence. I'd actually be quite interested to see the statistics.

**** In real life, psychologically manipulative interrogations work really well at getting a thing similar enough to a confession that you can tell a jury it was one. In fact, they work so well that you can get one whether or not the person is guilty.
