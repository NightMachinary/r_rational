Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** /Thing of Things/ on [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2020/10/28/thirteen-things-i-hate-about-cthulhu-mythos-stories/][Thirteen Things I Hate About Cthulhu Mythos Stories]]

#+begin_quote

  1.  “Is the Mythos real... or am I having a psychotic break?” is the worst plotline.

  2.  “The protagonist's best friend who doesn't believe in the Mythos” is the worst viewpoint character.

  3.  No more writer protagonists.

  4.  H. P. Lovecraft should not exist in universe as a character whose short stories are entirely accurate descriptions of what happened in the real world, unless you have a REALLY good explanation.

  5.  Christianity should be false.

  6.  Do not systematize the horrors beyond our comprehension.

  7.  No wars of good versus evil, DERLETH.

  8.  NO ELEMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS, DERLETH

  9.  Make your tomes in some way different from the Necronomicon.

  10. Before you describe something as an unknowably evil horror, check that it is actually an unknowably evil horror, and not instead a totally knowable horror.

  11. You should not write entire paragraphs in italics.

  12. No long racist screeds.

  13. No takes on the Mythos that are exclusively “Lovecraft is racist.”

*** Re: Christianity. If you consider it God already has pretty much all of the hallmarks of a cosmic horror actually.

Vastly powerful and mysterious beyond human comprehension? Check.

Humans literally die if they see his true form? Check.

Has minions are obviously Lovecraftian (like a flaming wheel covered in eyes) to the extent that they are more Lovecraftian than most actual mythos monsters? Check.

Send his half-breed child to earth in an attempt to spread his influence? Check.

Has plans to cause/allow the Apocolypse when the signs are right? Check.

Steals souls for his own designs? Check.

Hell, even the cross is just a mystical symbol that has great power against other otherworldly beings, but this time it requires you to believe in a specific cosmic horror, which again, seems pretty lovecraftian.

*** Regular racism in Lovecraft is just unimaginative. I'd like to see something that flips it, but keeps the theme. Something like a black linguistics professor spending a summer on a fact-finding mission in deep Appalachia, and slow-roll horror as he pieces together what exactly these fucked up, inbred hillbillies get up to deep in the woods when the stars are right.

Objection: in the time it takes to come closer and check, the evil horror, being a evil horror, might as well decapitate you with a bite, turn your brain into a swarm of ants, or do other such horror-like things, regardless of its theoretical epistemological status. The wise man doesn't waste time better spent running the fuck away.

** So apparently, kombucha is a thing, and it's a thing that is delicious.

Also apparently, it can be made at home, provided you are willing to put up with a [[https://kombuchee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Guide-To-Scoby.png][bacterial and yeast clump]] sitting in a jar while it ferments tea for you.

I think this is a thing that I will do things with.

*** Welcome to the pandemic fermentation rabbit hole ;)

I haven't gotten to Kombucha yet. It is a multi-stage process, and aerobic fermentation means stuff can go wrong (worms, flies, ...) whereas anaerobic fermentation seems to be pretty much fool-proof (but you get alcohol).

My tips: Just buy a starter culture/SCOBY from e.g. a web shop and don't try to make your own. For example, I bought a Ginger Beer Plant SCOBY.

It is hard to beat active dry yeast. Mix tea and apple juice directly in a plastic bottle. Add a small amount of ale yeast (e.g. S-04), then fully close up after a certain amount of time (e.g. one day... depends on desired sweetness, content, yeast amount and temperature), then wait ~another day till the plastic bottle doesn't give when squeezed then put in fridge. You get something with ~2% alcohol but it works about the same every time.

The main issue I have is that most/all the commercial stuff is force carbonated and equipment for that is expensive. Using bottle fermentation for carbonization you get something that is either dry (or artificially sweetened), or that you have to store in the fridge (or you do an error-prone bottle pasteurization). Then depending on the nutrients in the ferment, yeast, bacteria, temperature etc. you might get a sulfur smell in the captured carbon (search for "rhino farts").

*** I have a huge kombucha habit, I really enjoy it - hits the sweet spot of low sugar / low caffiene readily available beverage for me.

It's very expensive so I considered making it myself but I realised there'd be issues with flavouring it (I like lemon and ginger flavour, and I'd need to work out how to add that), and also apparently if you make it at home it can end up being alcoholic? Which is not something I want to play with, ha.

**** Ginger is apparently hard to get "right". Apparently the ginger doesn't form a cohesive taste normally. But lemon I would think is as easy as adding lemon juice before the second fermentaiton.

As for the alcohol content, it's technically always alcoholic, but ones sold in stores are less than 0.5% alcohol, which means they can be sold without a license. Google suggest that home brewed kombucha can get up to 3% ABV, which is less than a typical beer, but on average, it is only at 1%. And, this can be controlled by the way you brew. More bacteria means less alcohol; more yeast means more alcohol.

** I've been reading the Breath of the Wild fanfic '[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/again-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild.883292/#post-70489646][Again]]' lately.\\
It has some cool scenes so soft recommend for Legend of Zelda fans.

However, it's Friday not Monday and what I really wanted to discuss is its first chapter. The author's own pre-story summary basicly goes: Link beats BotW, credits roll, story begins. Then the first chapter is 9k words of 'Link beats BotW', when we could have just started at credits. This chapter's writing feels very sparse on descriptions, rushing through the plot points. It appears clear to me that the writer knew we didn't really needed/wanted to read most of it. I started skimming pretty early on, mostly collecting names; since even not having played the game I knew the general plot already.

Now here is my point.\\
I think that first chapter is very important.\\
There is a big difference between writing Link is tired and writing 9k words of Link running around. Even knowing the game, scrolling over the big wall of text is a visual reminder of Links heroics. Later chapters also give callbacks specifically using earlier layout. It felt like the author was not only using the words but also the space those words occupied.

Sometimes different story's do something similar generally leaving a bunch of space blank, mostly webfiction does this I think. I know Terry Pratchett had a single word on a page in one book. There are obviously more examples, but specifically this time I found it really interesting and enjoyable.

** Random idea: Hire street performers to perform around polling locations. It would make waiting in line less of a big deal, possibly even downright enjoyable.

*** Alternative solution:

- Pass a law requiring states to keep all polling places open for at least eight hours per day for at least one week immediately prior to any federal election deadline, thus changing "election day" to an election week.

- Add a legal requirement for employers to give each employee at least one day of paid vacation as a federal holiday during election week.

- Require states to provide enough polling stations such that no voter must travel more than 30 minutes by car to vote. Furthermore, each polling station must be staffed and equipped, including parking spaces and road capacity, such that it could accommodate all of the voters closest to it within a four-hour period.

- Violations of any of these criteria are cause to extend the election deadline until all criteria have been met for the period of one week. Any public officials responsible for violations of these criteria may be charged with election tampering and fined up to $1 million and/or sentenced to up to five years in prison.

So, if the polling station closest to you also happens to be the closest one for 50,000 other people, and if it takes three minutes for the average person to vote, then the station would need to be able to handle 1,296 people voting at the same time. If it can't handle that, then your state just needs to add some more polling stations around that densely-populated area.

*** Or just take a few hints from the dozens of countries around the world where voting is NOT an ordeal that demands the best part of a person's day. Seriously, I lived in two countries (Italy and the UK) and voting has never been harder for me than going out of the front door, walking for 50/100 meters tops, entering some place, getting a ballot, putting a cross on it, putting it into a box and going home. Total time spent, ten minutes tops.
