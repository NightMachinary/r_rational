** So I once promised someone here that I would let them know when this story was finished and after 6 to 7 years of daily updates, it's complete! Took me a while to realize though, since I haven't checked in on the comic in months. Also, I have completely forgotten who I made that promise to.......

Moving on, here's the summary:

#+begin_quote
  All Night Laundry is an interactive horror webcomic about time travel, dreams, and the problems with identifying monsters. It follows the story of Bina Miryala, a journalism student at McGill University in Montreal. One night in June she went to a laundromat and rather than cleaning the clothes she needed for class the following morning, she landed right the middle of a supernatural mystery. All Night Laundry is written and drawn by Zachary Hall. It was created on the MSPA forums in May of 2013 and it has updated daily ever since.
#+end_quote

It's really well-written and drawn with confusing rules about the time travel and monsters where Bina investigates to find the weakness and come up with plans to keep herself and her friends from getting hurt or killed. Unlike other protagonists of the fiction posted here, she's very empathetic and demonstrates a high emotional intelligence to get conflicting personalities to work together in a crisis. I just simply adore her!

EDIT: As a new reader, make sure that you read the author's notes. Sometimes important info about the story gets mentioned in there.

*** Glad to see that it's available on some platform besides the original MSPA forum, where it was very hard to navigate. I might give it another try.

*** Huh - my RSS feed must be broken, I thought this was on hiatus. I'll go finish it!

EDIT: Never mind, it finished a while ago and I'd forgotten. I'm lacking closure because the epilogues haven't hit yet.

** Reading this right now, thank you so much for the rec!

This is definitely the best MSPA-inspired (?) thing I've ever seen, both in terms of the visual aesthetic and the plot. I especially like, in addition to all the praise this has already gotten, that the main character is a very /sensible/ person who is not unrealistically smart. Usually, either both of these traits present or neither; here, the author struck a perfect balance.

** Going through it now. Up to chapter 8. It reads well. Interesting story. Might help to have the author get a couple of editors to nitpick through the text - I noticed some your/you're, it's/its, to/too issues. A couple of other homophones which wouldn't be picked up with a spellchecker. Misplaced apostrophes. Some leftover author notes about images yet to be drawn, as well, which haven't been yet. Otherwise not bad!

*** The truly impressive part is how well written the story is when you realize it was done with daily updates the entire time!

If you look at the comments, a lot of readers in the later posts, posted about the mistakes and after the epilogue goes up, Zach will be correcting all of the minor mistakes.

** I can definitely give this a strong second. I started reading it when it was recommended here a while ago, and really enjoyed the whole thing through to the end. Definitely check it out if you're interested in well written time travel or Eldritch horror.

There's supposed to be an epilogue at some point, but the author is taking a well deserved break after years and posting every single day.
