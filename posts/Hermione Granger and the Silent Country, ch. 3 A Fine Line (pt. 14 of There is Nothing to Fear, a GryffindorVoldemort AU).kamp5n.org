The latest chapter, "A Fine Line," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/68499257][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

/Interesting./ That's quite the different reputation that Slytherin and Gryffindor have achieved in this timeline. I get that Gryffindor is now tainted by its association with Riddle, the same way Slytherin was in the canon timeline, so that makes sense, but Slytherin now being associated with "the other kind of smart kids" seems odd. Would Slytherin now represent social intelligence?

** I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective. I mean having a society that discriminates to the point that certain people(/species) are cut off from schools and opportunities is a thing, but the scale of it in magical Britain, and the difference in what you can achieve with and without a wand, would people "accept" the cost of totalitarian Riddle as a net gain?

I mean current left-wing mainstream stuff has plenty of proponents of non-violence, people point to Gandhi often, but he also wanted the Jewish people in WW2 to "offer themselves to the butcher's knife" because he lacks empathy (he was a racist sexual predator btw, you don't sleep naked with your 18 yr old grandniece nearly 6 decades your junior if you're a decent person). I know this is just a singke, very dramatic, example, but there's been enough people literally fighting for their rights over history, who have only achieved something at the cost of bloodshed, that complete dismissal of those means by people without those lived situations, it seems so privileged. I mean revolutions, civil wars, less bombastic/immediate things like the Black Panther Party and some Antifa groups.

I may have gone too specifically political there, but like the sheer difference in quality of life and rights for Goblins here is so much more major than what wizards lost it seems to me. The fact that all the Riddle perspectives are from people either human or human-passing is also worth noting.

Also, re: muggleborn forced adoption, this seems a bit more grey than at first glance. Like Hermione's parents literally cannot see ghosts for example, there are huge parts of wizard culture (and ability) that they are literally incapable of teaching to their child. For example, if you lost your capability to walk in exchange for being raised by your birth parents (who themselves could not walk) instead of foster parents, would you make that choice for yourself? Would people who had spent their life able to walk make the same choice for you as a child? I've had enough issues with (birth and not) parents and had enough friends in the same boat that I'm dismissive of birth parents (or otherwise 'unverified' parents) having any special inherant merit, but probably am too bias against it here.

Loss of culture is a significantly more difficult question, but I guess it's easier to pick up muggle culture later on than wizard culture later on? Like so many muggles literally do not know wizards exist in the first place. And it's a lot easier to learn to use muggle tools as an adult than it is to learn to use a wand as an adult, as well as losing a lot less opportunities than you otherwise would have. I'd be better off as a wizard without a smart phone than a muggleborn without a wand. That said, answering in such a way is concerning, I'm Australian and our Stolen Generation stuff is Fucked Up.

*** One thing is certain: this Riddle is a /far/ more interesting antagonist.

I am assuming this is a one point of divergence fic, where the only difference is the Sorting Hat's successful argument to Tom Riddle that his fear of death is a weakness best purged through Gryffindor companionship. In that case, we can be certain he /is,/ in fact, a villain. He does not personally care for the people he protects, because he is entirely incapable of empathy. His concern is immortality, though of an apparently different sort. He's doing all of this solely for himself.

He appears to have traded Stalin's terminal paranoia for /something else./ He isn't purging every competent person in a position of any power for fear that they might overthrow him, and thus causing administrative disaster, famine, and military disorder. Indeed, with such a small population, who will never fear starvation due to their magic, it wouldn't have mattered much if he had been Stalin's equal on the ladder of paranoia. He could not cause a Holodomor if he tried. But Dumbledore saw a flaw in his being, something which would cause him to fall. Moreover, Dumbledore, who championed the rights of all, was fighting against the man who did the same. There is something wrong with Riddle besides psychopathy.

But I really don't think we know enough to say whether this Riddle's rule is a net positive. The upsides are obvious, and as you have said, clearly worthy. Far more magical sapients are visibly included in all walks of public life. There are no children missing from canon, implying his revolution was scrupulous in sparing their lives. He does, at least, have some sort of compelling reason to abduct muggleborns, to protect them from the consequences of uncontrolled accidental magic. The Lost Generation could not have hurt themselves or others had they simply been left alone, while an unaware magical child clearly can. He's even treating the Basilisk with dignity, which I wouldn't have thought to do.

But there are far too many questions. They teach Dark Arts to children. Maybe that means it's a defense course with real teeth, but it could also be indoctrination and the swearing of binding oaths. We haven't seen nor heard from the House Elves yet, and the Centaurs are similarly absent. The Sorting Hat has been silenced. It's pretty clear that discipline at this school involves some form of torture, though we don't know what, why, or how it is justified. And, as is likely to be further explained in the next installment, they open each term with a duel, which they are required to watch whether or not they want to.

It is, as Hermione puts it, ominous.

Motives shouldn't be a concern, only actions. There have been plenty of great people throughout history who were mostly concerned about themselves, and plenty of terrible people fully convinced they were in the right and that what they were doing was best for others.

If his goal is to be immortalized metaphorically by creating a more just society then that's good. If his goal is to create a society that might find a solution to actual immortality that doesn't involve killing people, one which can be applied to everyone, then that's also good. We don't know what his actual goal is yet (although the former seems more likely given his characterization).

That all being said, until we know the full extent of his actions, we definitely can't say if he's evil or not. Mr. Sable is ominous. The sorting hat is ominous. Instilling dissociation into his followers by convincing them they become someone else when they put on the mask is ominous. If Riddle doesn't turn out to be actually evil in his actions it's either because he's not actually the antagonist, which would be weird; or a failure of the author's morality.

I'm not doing that Disney shit, I'm saying that if all he's done is the worst of what he's presented as having done so far then he shouldn't be presented as the antagonist. We shouldn't be expected to sympathize with people whose goal it is to defeat him, as is almost definitely the case with Harry and probably will be with Hermione.

The failure of morality wouldn't be just in making him utilitarian, it would be if the author made him the antagonist and presented him as villainous even if the worst thing he's doing is just extreme methods to achieve a just cause.

If Hitler or Stalin were only concerned about themselves the world would have been improved (probably), psychopaths and sociopaths are a tiny proportion of society and racists, nationalists, and supremacists are not composed entirely of them. Look at how much suffering humans cause to non-human animals, it's not a requirement that you lack empathy to hurt others. Indeed if anything someone who lacks empathy treats everyone equally (unless it benefits whatever goal they have) unlike the people who do the most harm who have an ingroup where they are empathetic and an outgroup who they do not care about.

*** That's a good question, and it's difficult to answer because Riddle's Britain is such a mixed bag.

The goblins seem to have only benefited, no question about it: They get to have wands. They are permitted, but apparently not /required/, to attend Hogwarts. Also (to point out a couple things that haven't come up yet), they have guaranteed seats on the Wizengamot /and/ goblin property laws take precedence in interactions between goblins and wizards (this includes the Sword of Gryffindor).

Other nonhumans, part-humans, etc are also doing better, it seems.

The Wizengamot itself has been reorganized and is, at least on its face, a more democratic institution (the pre-revolutionary Wizengamot had only five directly-elected seats out of fifty).

Muggles are /probably/ benefitting overall (Britain's actions have really strengthened the nuclear disarmament movement) but let's not forget that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27264121/chapters/66607840][the French government thinks the British are abducting muggle kids]] and has no idea why (too many kids are disappearing for them to all be muggle-borns). It's really hard to say that Riddle's regime is "good" for muggles, when all the good stuff is a side effect of "Riddle doesn't want Britain to be targeted in a nuclear war" and meanwhile there's, well, dozens of kids disappearing in Scotland alone. Saying "but more people are being saved in the case of a nuclear war, so the math checks out!" feels like it's missing the point.

It's also difficult to really spin the muggle-born abductions in a good way. As readers have pointed out in the past, Riddle is a magic supremacist, so it's probably not too far from the truth to say that cultural cleansing / indoctrination is not just a side effect of stealing muggle-borns, but the whole /point/. A more progressive strategy would be to keep muggle-borns with their birth families but approach them long before it's time for Hogwarts (ideally, as soon as you notice them use accidental magic).

But the question isn't "is Riddle's government good?" It's more like "is Riddle's government good /enough/?" Can we tolerate the skulls on the road if we think that there are fewer skulls now than in yesterday's world?

That's a harder question to answer, because we don't necessarily live in a world where skull-free roads are possible. Suffice it to say, Riddle couldn't stay in power if everyone in Britain turned against him, which means that he has to actually keep at least /some/ groups happy. Is it possible to remove some skulls over /here/ without adding more skulls over /there/? What if Riddle's government is actually the best system possible under the current circumstances, because anything else will break down the coalition that maintains it or even because Riddle himself is necessary to the system because nobody else has generated enough trust with e.g. the goblins?

All this is to say that, despite being a socialist, I couldn't personally accept Riddle's Britain, but a Stalinist would probably have fewer issues.

That's a difficult question to answer. Many proponents of that policy probably thought that /of course/ taking children away from a "flawed and inferior culture with no prospects of a future" was for the good of the children.

**** Eh, I'm pretty damn left wing myself, but I'd be more onboard than off with Riddle's Britain. I've got too many relatives who should be in prison (and tbh, too many relatives who should be beaten to death whilst in prison). I'm also queer, and when you are genuinely unsure if some of your relatives would beat and/or kill you if they found out and thought they could get away with it, you become more tolerant of a "permanent solution" to those beliefs. They'll always be more LGBTQI people, and always have been through history, but not so much for Nazis (as a particularly extreme example).

I mean, just speaking purely in skulls on the road, if Riddle decided every muggle in the UK would no longer be able to have kids, there wouldn't be any skulls to speak of whilst achieving Riddle's goal of magical supremacy. There's arguments about rights here, but I always found having a right to determining another's life like that weird, since people are born into abusive families often enough, or with enough long-term health conditions, that there is a definite number of people with a horrible life for reasons out of their own control, purely because of the desires of others to have kids. Like people will condemn torture, wanton murder and rape, as well as overly harsh imprisonment for creating unwarranted and pointless suffering, but then turn around and let people with whatever history of brutality or exploitation have kids without any oversight. There's admittedly (huge and glaring) opportunities for abuse with giving any government that power over people, but acknowledging that turns it into a goal to strive towards improving the situation (and having extensive checks and balances) and not something to be completely ignored. And there's enough non-invasive temporary birth control methods either created or in development (there's that contraceptive gel for people with penises from a few years earlier, currently undergoing testing) that, even if people are concerned about the side-effects of contraceptive measures, you can support research and development in that area first.

(Uh, before I get any particularly concerned pms, I'm estranged from the vast majority of my relatives now, so I'm not in any specific risk. And the worst of them have at least documentation of the allegations against them)

#+begin_quote
  I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective.
#+end_quote

I'm going to need to set this up a bit. Please keep in mind that any definitions of "left" and "right" are my own, and I fully expect you to hold different definitions.

First, I'm going to discard the idea that the "social" and "economic" ideas of the left and right are somehow separable. The social ideal of the left is a flat, diverse society, where no one has any more power than anyone else. Their economic path to this is socialism (or, as you move closer to the centre, a "fair trade" economy). The social ideal of the right is hierarchical, where those who have demonstrated merit are put in charge of society. Their economic path to this is free market capitalism (or, as you move closer to the centre, regulated capitalism). You can't really extract one from the other; the social ideals of the left are the source of their economic ideals, and the same is true of the right.

Now, I'm sure that you're all familiar with the "political compass", which displays a square where left and right is one axis, and authoritarianism (up) and statelessness (down) is the other. This axis is about how much power a state (or other similar institution) should have to further your ideals. So, the further you are to the left, the more the state (such as it exists) should be benefiting everyone, the further to the right you are, the more it should be benefiting the meritorious over the lazy, the criminal, and the otherwise abhorrent.

There is an inherent lie to this compass, in that a square is entirely the wrong shape: three of the "corners" can't exist. You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name. You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name. You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible. Hierarchy/authoritarianism is the one corner of that graph that can exist; that basically describes feudalism, which is how most of Western society was organized between the fall of the Roman Republic and the Reformation.

There's one more axis I want to bring into this, which is legitimacy vs tyranny, and this has to do with the /public perception/ of the government. Let's discard the left-right axis, for the moment, and look at the relationship between this axis and the "up-down" axis. A state which is universally regarded as legitimate /will not/ be overthrown; a state which is powerful enough /cannot/ be, and a state which is *both* is basically invincible. However, there's a nice, wide quarter-circle towards the weak-state/tyrannical corner where a state is vulnerable to being overthrown, regardless of whether its ideals are towards the left or the right.

So, as a leftist, politics is the art of using the government to break down hierarchies and promote equality, while rooting out people who would use it to increase hierarchy to their own benefit, and giving the government enough power to do so, but /not/ so much power that it becomes impossible to overthrow if it slides into tyranny.

...It's not an easy balance to find, and one of the biggest problems in left-wing politics is the knowledge that to reach total equality requires either tyranny or complete intellectual conformity, and this tends to lead to purity tests, infighting, and even, in rare cases, violent purges (e.g. the Reign of Terror in France, or the Great Purge in Soviet Russia), which are inimical to the spirit of a flat, diverse society.

With all of that sorted out, let us consider Riddle's Britain.

On the stateless-authoritarian scale, it is near the far top of the graph, nearly perfectly authoritarian. Riddle is completely in charge of his Death Eaters; the Death Eaters are in complete control of the State; the State is powerful enough to control the wizarding world, and the wizarding world has completely subsumed the Muggle government.

On the tyranny-legitimacy scale of public perception, there are two possible perspectives to look from. The first is the community of wizards/witches and magical creatures, and, from their perspective, the government probably looks legitimate enough. Casting down the nobility and raising up the magical creatures, and adding elected seats to the Wizengamot, along with bringing families like the Malfoys into the fold, have probably given Riddle enough support among the magical community that a large number of people feel that things are better under his rule. There is undoubtedly (quiet) dissent, but, with Dumbledore gone, no apparent organized resistance. For the muggles... we don't know what things are like. Probably bad. We haven't been given a window into the Muggle world, other than that brief glance at the aftermath of the dragon attack (Muggle casualties disregarded and breathless concerns about Muggle explosives) which doesn't bode well for them. But no matter how bad things are for the Muggles, they probably don't have the strength to resist the might of the wizarding world, if they even have the faintest idea who is oppressing them.

As for left-right... The Death Eaters are now the government, and one thing that this series has not done is /tell us what the Death Eaters want/. We have [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145][vague insinuations]] of "reforms that were more extreme than anything that Riddle had thus far dared to voice except through his Death Eaters"; we have James [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24335107/chapters/58675660][swearing]] to "fight, and suffer, and die for the cause of the Death Eaters," but no statement of what that cause is. All we know is that they follow Riddle without question. So, what does Riddle want? We know of two things that he wants, that do not appear to be the consolidation of power for its own sake: he has personally sought out the Deathly Hallows, and the Veil of Death.

So, with all of that preamble: how does Riddle look from a left-wing perspective?

He's fucking terrifying.

He's appropriating left-wing rhetoric in the name of consolidating power; he is enacting some left-wing policies for the purposes of populism. However, the only true goals that I can infer from his actions are a quest for immortality through the Deathly Hallows, as well as gaining power for power's sake. Yes, he has probably done some good through the nuclear disarmament of Britain, but, in doing so, he has likely removed Muggle Britain's ability to threaten his reign (which is likely the main reason why he did so). He has done some good by demolishing some of the wizarding world's internal hierarchies, to the advantage of muggleborns and magical creatures, but he likely did so only for the political support of the Gryffindors and the creatures themselves, and has used that support to entrench an even more harmful hierarchy, with himself at the top, and Muggles in oppression at the bottom.

He is exactly the reason why the political left often seem to value the norms and mechanisms of government more than the results which those mechanisms produce: we know what dangers lie down the path of Robespierre and Stalin, when revolutionaries talk big talk about "the Greater Good," and then achieve their goal, accrue too much power to themselves, and start purging dissidents. The biggest difference between someone like Riddle, and Stalin and Robespierre, is that those latter two were mortal and mundane.

So let me raise my voice against the utilitarians here and say that yes, he is a villain, regardless of the small existential good he's done thus far by disarming one country. And he's all the more terrifying of a villain for his rise to power being so plausible.

You've identified feudalism as the authright corner, but go back further in history and you will find two of the other corners.

#+begin_quote
  You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name.
#+end_quote

You can, if there's a large commons. The presence of a large commons makes it difficult for anyone to exert coercive power, as people can always disengage and support themselves using the commons. Removing the /practical possibility/ of oppressing others removes the need to have everyone buy into the ideological goal of not oppressing others. You can find examples of this dynamic in hunter-gatherer societies which happen to live in abundant natural environments with easy access to all of life's necessities.

Sadly for libleft!humanity, the commons are gone, and unlike in the past our capacity for violence has expanded sufficiently to cover the entire world, so the possibility of "escaping" to the commons is gone.

#+begin_quote
  You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name.
#+end_quote

You can, in a society which does have the concept of "legal" and "illegal", but still has practical disparities in terms of power, control, and capacity to do violence. It's not a very nice way to live. (It's also not really what libright had in mind, as libright generally does want a state to enforce property rights)

You can find real examples of this in societies which are transitioning from foraging into subsistence agriculture. Edible wild animals and plants are in decline, so they've started scratching at the dirt to supplement their diets... and that means the beginnings of property, of defending land, and of not pissing off whoever controls that land if you'd like to eat, but that's not a state.

Absolutely agreed on China and the USSR. Those became single-party cronyist states almost immediately, which is why I have virtually no faith in the auth-left corner existing in anywhere other than theory.

I disagree that this corner is anywhere near what modern social democracies are aiming for. I mean, to use your example of Norway: yes, they've actually created a functional state which I would consider to be on the left side of the political spectrum, which is an impressive accomplishment in itself. But it's a functional representative democracy (according to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index][Democracy Index]], it's currently *the most* democratic country in the world), with a constitution which guarantees basic human rights, and an independent judiciary.

Among the rights guaranteed by the Norwegian constitution is free speech:

#+begin_quote

  - There shall be freedom of expression.
  - No person may be held liable in law for having imparted or received information, ideas or messages unless this can be justified in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression, which are the seeking of truth, the promotion of democracy and the individual's freedom to form opinions. Such legal liability shall be prescribed by law.
  - Everyone shall be free to speak their mind frankly on the administration of the State and on any other subject whatsoever. Clearly defined limitations to this right may only be imposed when particularly weighty considerations so justify in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression.
  - Prior censorship and other preventive measures may not be applied unless so required in order to protect children and young persons from the harmful influence of moving pictures. Censorship of letters may only be imposed in institutions.
  - Everyone has a right of access to documents of the State and municipal administration and a right to follow the proceedings of the courts and democratically elected bodies. Limitations to this right may be prescribed by law to protect the privacy of the individual or for other weighty reasons.
  - It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions that facilitate open and enlightened public discourse.
#+end_quote

If I were to divide the authoritarian-stateless spectrum into quarters (state extremely powerless, state moderately powerless, state moderately powerful, state extremely powerful), then I don't think that I could place any state into even the "extremely powerful" /quarter/ of the spectrum, much less anywhere near the edge, that matches the description of Norway above. As such, it's difficult for me to agree that their aim is to get to the authleft corner; they seem to be trying to get to the hypothetical left-most point of stability that I was speculating about earlier. If even that; their most recent two elections put a coalition of non-socialist parties, led by the (by Norway's standards) centre-right [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Conservative_Party][Conservative Party]], into power, which argues against their desire to move any further left than they already are.

****** Yes, I suppose that doesn't match the stereotype of "authoritarian", does yet? The word "authoritarian" as used in english does preclude "free speech" and "democracy".

But within the context of this conversation, we were talking about something more specific: "a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state", and it was further a requirement that the state be working for the will of the people (rather than state employees benefiting themselves).

So what would an "all powerful state" which is working "for the will of the people" even look like? Well, they'd probably operate on the premise that their legitimacy to govern derives from the will of the people, so they'd likely want some sort of system to determine what the will of the people is (such as democracy, ballot initiatives, polls, voting...) and they definitely couldn't censor the speech of the people, which is an expression of the will of the people.

But they'd still hold all the power, that's a key ingredient. So the king, the state, the police, or whoever is in charge of all this has legitimate use of power whereas random thugs and also you and I for that matter, do not. State-sanctioned uses of power would be seen as "legitimate" and other uses of power as "illegitimate". There would probably be just one state (rather than a coalition of smaller states) and it would probably be discouraged for citizens to have weapons, so that they couldn't directly exert power. Instead, those who want power must seize it through the democratic mechanism, via voting or influencing others.

And if someone came in with a different perspective...it can happen, what if a bunch of American bible thumpers and Jesus freaks or or Saudi Sharia-heads suddenly came in to Norway and suppose they didn't believe in democracy as a valid way of doing things? How successful would they be at implementing their own systems?

Well, realistically unfortunately the real world Norway would probably be horribly racist about the latter group while unusually tolerant and accepting of the former because Norwegians obviously aren't immune to that sort of thing, but in our Imaginary Idealized Heavenly Norway Of Our Dreams, my guess is that at least on paper, they would be tolerated as citizens on equal footing with others (a flat, diverse society) but in practice any attempt to exert their value systems would be shut down by the police, and they'd be forced to advocate for their systems through democracy - a process which they would lose, and then they would die of old age, and then their grandchildren would secularize.

Idk it kind of sounds like "a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state" which tries to represent the will of the people rather than have state employees working purely for their own benefit to me. I'm not seeing any real attempt to distribute power...other than democracy. So I guess it's up to you to what degree it's not an "all powerful state" if it's an all powerful state which happens to be running a free speech democracy.

Consider this in contrast to, say, in the united states, where there is an active ideological push to keep power local, for the citizens and local militia to be armed, for states to be able to locally do things and use their state police to enforce them, that the federal government might rather not allow, and so on.

It's sort of tricky to talk about this because I think in practical political reality there's only two sides, the traditional right which represents those who wish to hold on to power, and the egalitarian left which represents those who are tired of their shit and are increasingly able to do something about it. The true compass has one axis. "Auth" and "Lib" are sort of pretensions to meta-principles that each side uses which are discarded when convenient. When the right wing pushes for curtailing and restricting the power of the state in a manner that allows the power of corporations, religious institutions, more conservative state governments, and children of the old feudal elite to fill the vacuum, it's not really because they are "lib" or "auth".

See, this is why, in my initial categorization, I put "legitimacy vs tyranny" on an entirely orthogonal axis to the other two. A left-auth government, as I would define it, would enforce an absence of hierarchy, whether or not that is the will of the people, or good for the people.

That's just it: they /don't/ have all the power. If the people have the power to replace a government they don't like, then /they/ have the power.

#+end_quote

I think we're operating on definitions of "power." You seem to be conflating "power" with "force" (specifically, violent force). I'm using it more to mean "control." A democratic government, especially one with a constitution guaranteeing civil rights (one that is followed, anyway) is very much limited in how much it can control its populace.

#+begin_quote
  And if someone came in with a different perspective...
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how this example proves that the state has power; the only thing you give as an example of this is "in practice any attempt to exert [anti-democratic] value systems would be shut down by the police"... I'm pretty sure that the the violent overthrow of a government is against the law anywhere (for obvious reasons), although, like laws against suicide, it's a law that can only be enforced for unsuccessful attempts. Using the police's ability to shut down a coup attempt, one which would have pretty much zero popular support, as a gauge of how strong the government, seems like a very weird measure of government strength. By that definition, pretty much any state would be strong.

Again: this is why I put the popular support of a government on a different axis: if you need popular support to stay in power, you're not strong; if you need to exert control of the populace to stay in power, you're not popular. If you have *both* the power to enforce control of the populace (if necessary) /and/ popular support, your State is pretty much invincible.

#+begin_quote
  Consider this in contrast to, say, in the united states,
#+end_quote

*That's* your model for a "less powerful" government than Norway? The one with the largest military in the world, as well as militarized police department, which are protected against civil litigation for violating people's rights by the doctrine of qualified immunity? Okay...

#+begin_quote

...But how is that a measure of how powerful "The State" is? I mean, yes, the /Federal/ government is limited by that, but if the "local" government gets all of those powers that the Feds don't, then wouldn't that just mean that you're under two semi-powerful governments adding up to one powerful one? Especially given the push for ideological conformity within the main two political parties, leading to less and less daylight between the federal government and that of a state governed by the same party?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

For *some* of them to be armed, sure. For others, the mere possession of a firearm seems to be justification for lethal force from police.

Also, doesn't "militia," in the constitutional sense, refer to the National Guard?

I'm have no idea whether or not you're correct about the right. I do know that it is an active point of argument on the left, whether a state is inherently a tool for creating hierarchy and must be abolished for the leftist utopia to come about, or whether people are dicks and some form of state control is necessary for leftist utopia to come about. My own personal opinion is that "utopia" quite literally means "place that doesn't exist," so it's a dumb argument anyway.

***** For the first few examples: Yeah, the relationship between capitalism and right-wing politics does break down as you reach the extreme right end of the compass. Going back to meritocracy, capitalism provides a means to sort the "deserving" from the "undeserving," so, for most starting most states, it's a tool for creating hierarchy by its very nature.

But in a state of maximum hierarchy, those in charge /don't want/ to do any more sorting; they want to lock in the existing structure.

So, sure, in a feudal or fascist society, capitalism would (and did) represent a move towards egalitarianism, a fairly large leap to the left. But while capitalism can't get, or keep, a society to the extreme right edge of the graph, its end result (plutocratic oligarchy) is still way closer to that edge than to the political centre, and so capitalism is almost always a tool for creating, not dismantling, hierarchy.

As for the third example: there are assholes in every movement. As I said, you can't reach the far left edge of the map for any prolonged length of time because humans are, largely, dicks (or, if women, the corresponding female anatomy), and can't help themselves from forming hierarchies without an oppressive regime to prevent them from doing so (which kinda defeats the whole point). So finding groups with anti-egalitarian sentiments in even the most egalitarian of movements (which M-Lism isn't; "suppression of opposition" is /not/ an egalitarian concept) is, sadly, to be expected.

Hermione values knowledge/performance, Hermione is thankful for the strong relationship with her parents, Hermione reluctantly acknowledges that Riddle has made some definite positive changes to magical Britain, even if she disagrees with his particular methods. Hermione who was basically set up as the greatest witch of her generation in canon, with this predicted from an early age. Riddle getting someone like that on side, operating completely in a foreign country, would benefit his public perception and support in a few years time.

Also, the way that the Dark Arts is taught at Hogwarts could be a point for or against Riddle for Hermione (something something knowledge has no agenda, only those that use it do). Riddle's "influence" over the government of the UK could easily be spun in a positive light, and accurately explanations of the threat of nuclear weapons are an easy door to a grudging acceptance. And any changes in the laws around underage magic to make it more accessible (and therefore, private study as a youth more possible) would also be a point in Riddle's favour in Hermione's eyes (if you can track underage magic, changing it to tracking based on spells used would deny potentially dangerous or malicious ones specifically. Wingardium Leviosa in your own time is probably fine, curses and hexes not so much).

***** Canon Hermione started SPEW. This Hermione just encountered severely discriminated non-humans who are easier to relate to (fellow students who have been discriminated against for their origins and cultural differences), without the whole complication of the House Elves having their magical species-wide Stockholm Syndrome. I don't think she'll be making badges for Riddle any time soon, but there's no way she's going to walk away without serious second thoughts about either Riddle or the results Riddle has gained as a bare minimum.

  Hermione's parents were good sports about waking up so early, better than they would have been if they knew where she was ultimately going.
#+end_quote

She's going through with this /without her parents knowledge/?? This continues to be wildly out of character and out of line with everyone's behavior two chapters ago. It feels like the horror movie where the dumb teens go into the haunted house and keep investigating the weird noises even as they find butcher equipment and blood on the walls.

I've loved this story so far and will continue to read but will likely stop doing so with a rational lens. it seems like this beat was just demanded by the plot and so the idiot ball got picked up.

*** It's not especially out of character, I would argue it's in-character. Given canon-Hermione was perfectly willing to mindwipe her parents for their own good, i don't believe a little lie to set their minds at ease would be a stretch of her canon characterisation, and this version was significantly more socially isolated than in canon.

She even discussed the trip with McGonagall, the authority-figure who led to the family abandoning Britain in the first place, and who apparently has no trouble misleading the folks.

**** As I've said elsewhere, the entire conversation with McGonagall made no sense given the proceeding chapters and huge amount of caution they'd taken to keep her out of Britain at all costs. It's apparently common knowledge that Riddle is a Dark Wizard who took over Britain by force and is extremely dangerous. McGonagall giving into political pressure from a country she has no loyalty to in order to put a child she cares for in danger is so far out of character as to be unrecognizable. My objections regarding the parents not knowing when Hermione is going into mortal danger is really just an extension of my strained disbelief from previous chapters.

***** McGonagall's initial actions are to secure Hermione (and whoever else she's able to) from being a victim of the rash of child disappearances across Britain. As a muggleborn she's a clear target, with absolutely no protections in place if the reigning powers decide to vanish her forever.

That... is not the case anymore. I'm uncertain if she's a citizen of Magical France but she IS a student of Beauxbatons, and under the school's protection if nothing else. Kidnapping her would be a major diplomatic incident at the very least, if not the kind of excuse neighbouring countries could use for war.

The wizarding world in this fic seems to hark back to feudal Europe in many ways (Beauxbatons being a Capet stronghold, Norway-Denmark existing). Riddle would giving his neighbours a reason to gang up on him and undo the revolution (see Napoleon for how that sort of thing can turn out), just to nab a single, if gifted, witch. The surrounding powers MUST be pretty nervous about this revolution of demi-human rights and political representation after all...

******* "Allowing to expatriate" =/= blatant kidnapping. Helen of Troy is one case in literature where an entirely willing "expatriation" led to war. And that was without the threat of revolution Riddle's politics bring. Just look at the US' cold war efforts to contain communism, if you want a more recent example. These aren't modern nation-states, either, but tiny communities largely led by hereditary aristocracy. Such constructions can be fierce in protecting their powerbase.

Sure the neighbouring countries did nothing while

1. It was a strictly internal British matter
2. They had no idea of the end result and what radical politics might spring up from it

If both of those things change then yeah, I really do think it could lead to war.

*** Ehhh, kid isolated socially when growing up has trouble trusting people, including family, seems fine to me. Also because the culture gap means relating to things is harder so the relationship is strained in the first place. Also also Hermione's not exactly had the same info as we've gained from the French intelligence report chapter previous, her underestimating the danger would also contribute.

There's enough factors here to support Hermione's actions imo.
