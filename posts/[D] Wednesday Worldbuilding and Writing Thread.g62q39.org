Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Just a wandering question I had, but assuming a civilization who lives completely underground like mole people or something, what would their maps look like?

Would everyone just make 3D models of the tunnels and huge subterranean caverns that people live in, or something else to handle the fact that height data needs to be included somehow in their maps?

*** Spelunkers have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_survey][cave survey maps]] and I can't think of any particular reason that an underground civilization wouldn't converge on some of the same techniques. For the most part, you would arrange your map so that it can represent the three-dimensional in two dimensions. Height data can just be noted on the map itself, and most of the time, it's not hugely vital to knowing where things are in relation to each other. You have to remember that a map of a cavern is going to be mostly blank space, since you don't show the rock, and that means that you have lots of room to annotate features (especially height).

**** Thanks, I haven't considered that we already had mapping techniques for cave surveys. I was googling 'underground maps' earlier for something similar and kept getting subway maps instead. I should have thought of googling 'cave maps' instead.

*** would they even have visual maps? I imagine a civ that lives totally underground would be super darkness-adapted, to the point where their "writing" would be more like braille anyway

their maps would probably be:

- physical models of the tunnels
- some sort of varying array of properties ("follow the scent of roses until you smell fungus", or "rough granite, then NW at smooth limestone")
- just get gud and memorize everything, scrub

*** You'd probably need several kinds of map: maps for navigation, where all that matters is the graph of connections; maps for caverns, where regularish paper maps /probably/ suffice; and maps for people doing excavation, which are probably fancy 3D-recreation-equivalents

Maps for navigation are essentially just string tied together to show the graph of tunnel connections. They don't necessarily need to be to scale, though good/big/fancy ones probably are. Portable maps of this style are rigged up in a collapsible frame so that it can be compactly stored and then expanded out to check directions when you get to a junction and need to figure out which way to go.

** In a fantasy world where 'dungeons' of some variety pop up full of monsters and treasures, what could keep the powerful players of the world from just farming them for profit? Other than them being so dangerous or popping up so frequently that it's seen as an actual existential threat, I don't see how you make sure everyone keeps shutting them down instead of just sitting on them and getting rich.

Solo Leveling solves it by having the boss monster come out of the dungeon to wreak havoc on civilians after a timer runs out, and killing the boss monster closes the dungeon. But that feels a bit artificial (I love Solo Leveling, don't get me wrong, I'm just not a fan specifically of the boss being locked inside the dungeon until a timer runs out).

So what other properties could dungeons have that make it so the rich and powerful would want all or most of them shut down immediately, even though there is plenty of magic treasure inside them?

*** The usual solution seems to be to give high level people better ways to profit than farm low level dungeons. And make high level adventuring time consuming and dangerous enough to limit the number of high level people in the world.

Also, modern readers always seem to underestimate how little information dissemination there was in middle age society. Even with magic, or even with institutionalized magic, it takes a lot of effort to even know where all the dungeons in the world are. It's not as simple as just looking up the list on the internet, hopping on a plane to run over and farm it. The world's a big place.

*** Make the dungeons alive, clever, and uninterested in catering to the needs and wants of those who would enslave them. Like Pokémon! The dungeons are hugely powerful resources, but they mostly just want to share that with people who are capable of friendship and mutual respect, so they intentionally sabotage anyone more nefarious about it. Malicious compliance, as it were.

*** My solution was to have dungeons be one time per person, so you can't farm a single dungeon, you have to farm multiple ones, and eventually you run out. Dungeons are also semi-random, so you can get some intel, but it won't be a complete walkthrough.

***** Eh, I have like 30K words put into it, but don't plan on publishing it for a bit, when I can actually focus on getting chapters out at a reasonable pace. The current focus is only halfway on the dungeon stuff, mostly it's comfy slice-of-life. There are a couple of things that I like about it, the biggest one being that dungeon delvers have to be fully prepared to completely exploit the dungeon before they go in, and dungeon delvers are travelers, encouraged by the system to go seek out new places. It gives a good rhythm to the life of a dungeoneer.

*** Taking a page from Blue Core, you could have the dungeons continuously "corrupt" amy delvers, where "corruption" is incurable and will eventually lead to death. So, everyone has a limited number of time they can spend in dungeons in their lifetime, so they have to pick and choose carefully before deciding to enter one.

*** instead of having a single “boss” escape from the dungeon, you could instead have occasional less organized monster raids come out and terrorize local villages looting and enslaving local populations. It could be similar to barbarian “invasions” of Rome.

Whatever you do, you have to make the incentive to destroy dungeons either actively destructive, or too unpredictable and terrible to allow (similar to a natural disaster). Otherwise, local powers would eventually adapt, becoming able to profit off said dungeon.

*** The Outer Sphere (story by the same author as Wake of the Ravager, but currently on hiatus) solves it thusly:

Dungeons are living entities from another dimension that burrow into the planet. Should a dungeon reach the planet's core, globally bad but (IIRC) unspecified things will happen - probably something along the lines of banishing the whole planet to the shadow realm or something like that.

Dungeons are also super tricky and very dedicated to their cause, so even if you /think/ you've managed to stop one or negotiate with it, you probably haven't.

Also the core of a dungeon is worth more than the value you'd get out of a few century's worth of production from a young dungeon, so there's that too.

***** There's a whole lot of it (I think it's still longer than Wake of the Ravager? imo there's about a trilogy plus half a book of content), and although it ends in kinda the middle of something the author had also written himself into a corner by having the main character(s) optimize themselves so heavily that things are kinda grindingly paranoid, sorta like the soul magic parts of Worth the Candle. He was right to take a few steps back imo.

*** The monsters respawn but the treasure doesn't. The optimal way to exploit the dungeon is to sweep the entire thing at once with overwhelming force, because it reduces the amount of time monsters have to respawn. The major powers do this, but it takes time to point an army at something, so small bands of adventurers have time to sneak in and take whatever they can first.

That does imply a loot system that feels more like a traditional roguelike than like an MMO. You don't kill monsters for their drops, you kill them because they're between you and the loot. And tool-using monsters are very inconsistently dangerous because they're usually armed with wooden clubs but sometimes one finds Excalibur.

#+end_quote

Bordering on this thing you said to avoid a bit: if the dungeon's threat level keeps increasing the longer it's around, someone will need to clear it before it becomes a threat, even though no dungeons (near civilization?) are actual threats.

*** I've been reading a fair bit of isekai/dungeon lite-lit and the most common solution is that indeed strong governing bodies regulate access to dungeons. Either state or adventurers guild.

Do you really need the dungeons to be shut down? Just accept that they are in fact a natural ressource that can be exploited and run with those implications.

If you want to go with shutdown, active dungeons could just deplete environmental mana, thus harming life on the surface.

*** Dungeons are dangerous monster holes, why would they have respawning treasure? If the dungeons respawn themselves, just make it so the treasure doesn't and is tied to the dungeon spawn.

If a dungeon has 5 bosses, killing the sword boss is the only way to loot a sword, and then no more sword mobs appear and the boss doesn't respawn. Killing all the bosses let's you loot the dungeon core, which as pure mana is the most expensive item that can be looted there anyway. And if you don't, the dungeon is empty anyways, so some else will come loot it. If you try to farm loot from normal mobs, assuming they even respawn, maybe their loot doesn't; once you loot 10 daggers that's all the dungeon will ever have.

** Regulatory Capture. this is when the organization responsibe for a thing is taken over by the thing it is responsible for.

in fiction, this has been done in G I Joe, an episode back in the 80s when cobra took over the government organization that gave the joes funding and red tape. likewise, in Worm the cauldron organization captured the PRT even before it formed. however, it could also be applied to a lot of other things. does your D&D game have an adventurers guild or mages guild? who is to say that some lich has not already captured the organization at some point in the past? superhero game, you could likewise easily have a villian in control of a major organization with authority over the heroes.

its funny how this is a thing, and yet anytime we see it in a story its as a plot twist, rather than a logical conclusion of how such a world would be run. if we start our worldbuilding from an assumption of regulatory capture, then we would more easily get the end state many settings end up in anyway.
