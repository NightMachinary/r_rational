"I win."

This turned out to be a lie. Then he died for it.

Turns out that made him win.

** Well... shit. People seem to be thinking the Hierarch has joined the Choir of Judgment, but I get the impression more that he's locked them in an unwinnable stalemate a la Zelda vs. Calamity Ganon or Oma Desala vs. Anubis. Is there a name for this kind of thing?

Thus, Hanno will wake up, realize he's out of touch with the Choir and that they won't be casting Judgement on anyone anytime soon, least of all the Dead King. Raises the question, though, of whether his plan to disarm them in the first place was any good.

I mean, sure, now we're uncertain whether the Judgment Angel Not-Corpse would be an effective weapon against him, but wouldn't that be the case even if his plan had clearly succeeded and Judgment was confirmed to be out of commission? Doesn't that just leave the Not-Corpse itself as an unreliable superweapon? And ... a band of heroes counting on a superweapon to take down the Big Bad Evil Guy only to have it fail on them in the final confrontation sure does sound like a recipe for a heroic takedown with an Aesop about relying on your own inner strength.

** Huh knew it was an angel corpse. I'm almost sad to see him go out to be honest, even if it is in a way that pretty much exemplifies his character and ends his arc faithfully. Man the Hierarch too in all honesty while neither of them were what you might call "Good" characters, they were for sure good characters if you know what i'm saying.

** The Bard really just wants to kill the Dead King? I'm a little disappointed, but a conflict with the Gods would probably be out of the scope of the story.

#+begin_quote
  “Your coalition does not scare the King of Death,” Kairos told her, not unkindly, “your petty assembly of armies and treaties which you so wastefully wring your hands over. He fears only one thing in all the world, and I have torn through the perilous nets she wove against him.”
#+end_quote

Suggesting that when the Bard told Cat that the Dead King was attacking because he had been cornered by the passing of time, it was to give her false confidence. Might've been for a good goal though, trading horses, using Cat's coalition to kill the Dead King...except that she was really upset when the Augur disrupted her plans.

Or I'm just reading too much into it. She did try to kill Cat in the same meeting, maybe tying up loose ends.

Edit: I saw a comment saying that the Hierarch died to keep the stalemate going on for eternity. Which makes perfect sense, and is awesome.

***** As I understood it, actively against only the ones who would disrupt Creation.

Sve Noc is self contained and must be wielded from a sort of living domain, but we also don't know that the Bard isn't actively plotting their demise or if it's just too late to affect them.

Also, I don't recall what role the Bard played with Sve Noc that would constitute them being led down a road. Was there something specific you saw besides abstaining from interference, if she even had footing through the privacy of their isolation within the Gloom?

As for Sve Noc, she nudged them on that road at Below's behest, so tempting mortals with Immortality and then smiting them down, might be one aspect of a bigger game between Above and Below.

*** Two possibilities:

1. She had counted at the time on Cordelia Hasenbach becoming the Warden of the West. With the intervention of the Augur to prevent such a huge move less than one day ago, her plans are currently broken.
2. Her plans are still on. The Dead King would have retreated, had Cordelia's weapon not been neutralised. Now that it is, he will continue to advance, and Bard has another layer of traps to spring that we haven't seen yet.

*** EE's writing style has been trending towards being more verbose. In this chapter, it's mainly Kairos being overly dramatic in his monologue. In others, Cat's been getting introspective since her several brushes with death, and likes to examine her actions from all possible angles. She's also a lot more eloquent than she was a year ago. So it does make for chapters that are wordier than before.

*** Cordelia dredged up some hidden superweapon. Theory was that it was an angel's not-a-corpse (because angels can't actually "die," but they can defeated/sealed/transformed, etc.), which turned out to be the case - it was an angel of the Choir of Judgment. The angel's corpse was turned into a sword, one strong enough to hurt or kill the Dead King. But... Now Judgment is busy with a stalemate with Hierarch, which begs the question whether the angel sword still actually has the power of Judgment...

although the timeline don't even add up for that to be the case.
