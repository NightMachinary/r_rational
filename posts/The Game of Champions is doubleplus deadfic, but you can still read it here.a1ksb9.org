** Well, this is a bit of a swift kick in the nuts. I can empathize with thinking one's writing is poor, as can anybody who's ever put words to paper. But /The Game of Champions/, removed because of qualms about quality? That's not an explanation, it's the punchline of a joke, and not a particularly funny one. TGoC was a strong contender for my favorite fic of all time, certainly in the top ten. I don't even know what to say.  

Nothing to be done but archive everything, I suppose, and put it in with Post's /Manifest Destiny/ and other assorted stories that have vanished from the internet. DLP's work by author subforum still has the text for a few of Lamora's works, if anyone else wants to nab them, though hastily saved HTML files don't make for the best reading experience. Still, I managed to acquire: /By The Victors, The Legend Yet Grew, The Last Son of Fire,/ and /The Gravehand of Morrighan'nan/. According to the Wayback Machine, nothing but his Skyrim and Pokémon fics were ever uploaded to FF.net anyway, so I don't think I'm missing anything...

** Funnily enough, if L. Lamora is a handle, he is following the path of his namesakes author.

The guy who wrote the lies of Locke lamora was destroyed by the divorce of his wife, stopped writing for years, abandoned several projects, and when he was finally pushed to release the novel he had already been paid an advance on (that last clause is supposition) it was notably below the standards of his previous writing.

*** To be clear, I wish the man only the best. I think he's a great writer with a talent few if any could replicate, I just also think that he loved his wife very much and hasn't recovered from her leaving him. My name is Oliver Horsey, and once I finally realised that the Lies of Locke Lamora was essentially Oliver Twist Fan-fiction (and appreciated that my name shares the same number of syllables as Locke's original name) I have really appreciated Jean Tannen saying ~'shit, I would've changed my name too'

** It's really a shame, because when I started Origin of Species I got a lot of recommendations to read a lot of Pokemon fanfic, and Game of Champions was the only one I really enjoyed. I'd hoped to see where he took his story when he picked it up again for more cross-contamination of ideas, but looks like I'm going it alone.

A more recent story, Pokemon: The Line, was good too, but even shorter and also unfinished. It anyone else has others to recommend (not Sun Soul or Traveler, I tried but couldn't get into them) that are similar, feel free to share.

**** There's a couple good ones I have really enjoyed reading. The Heptagonal Ring is an excellent read, Pokemon only and decent in length. A couple others that are not quite as well written, yet I very much enjoyed are The Path of Destiny, and The Surprising Adventures of a Glaceon in Unova.

Now, you want a Great read? The Thinking Man's Guide to Destroying the World. That story should have been sold in hardback. Writing; great. Characters; great. Plot twists; ya won't see 'em coming.

Currently I'm looking for something more in the style of Path of Destiny, where Pokemon are very obviously sapient, and their decisions and feeling are just as relevant as the human characters. If anyone's got any suggestions, hmu.

** I wish people wouldn't delete writing they think is trash. Partly, because they're sometimes wrong, but also because I think that making bad fiction publicly available is a public good. In English classes, you're only ever exposed to exemplary works (at least in theory). There's never any time dedicated to examining bad works to look at them to try and figure out why they're bad, or mediocre works to see what stopped them from becoming great. One of the reasons I like reading amateur fiction and fanfiction is that I can often see the seams of the craftsmanship, and getting to examine them makes me a better reader and writer generally.

*** No problem. Rest assured that if any thing else like this happens for a fic I have read, my response will be the same.

However, since you and I are different people with different tastes, here's what you need to take matters into your own hands:

Install Calibre (availible for win, mac, lin, etc) and its plugin fanficfare. Then, just copy a story URL and give it to FanficFare, which will autocreate a epub for you. Copy the Epub into an archive folder - this is necessary because while an author deleting a fic will not destroy the epub, if they overwrite the chapters with blank files, FanficFare will update the epub to a blank slate.

** By the way, this site has a pretty large archive of fanfiction.net fics, including The Game of Champions. I think it just archives everything anyone has downloaded using the site. Useful for finding stuff that's been taken down. Unfortunately it only covers FF, not AO3. Not necessary for now since you posted the mega link, but this could be handy in the future if you are looking for something else.
