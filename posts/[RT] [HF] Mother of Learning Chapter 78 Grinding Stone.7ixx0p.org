Like, even if Zorian and Zach have "disrupted all his plans" he should be able to figure out they won't be leaving the loop any time soon, and spending additional /years/ becoming an even better mage before leaving is not a replicable opportunity.

He's suddenly faced with a mysterious group of enemies who he suspected came into the loop the same way he did and so could have had knowledge such as how to escape the loop. He had to leave as soon as possible so he would be the first one out and not get trapped in the simulation and erased. He figured he would leave first to avoid the risk of losing everything instead of staying and gaining the experience of a few more years of loops only for someone else to leave the loop first.

All you have to do if you're red robe is run off somewhere remote and train until you're running low on restarts.

****** Red Robe doesn't have the benefit of seeing everything from our point of view. Think about it from his perspective. As far as he knows, he's up against a veritable army of time loopers, who can easily add more and more people to the loop as time goes on. This means there is at least one person out there with knowledge of some of the functions /of/ the time loop. It wouldn't be a stretch, as Red Robe, to assume that this unknown person is capable of finding out how to leave the loop himself, stranding Red Robe in a dimension headed for destruction with no way out. He simply left first so they wouldn't have the chance.

Even if this weren't the case, this mysterious group could likely track him down eventually by figuring out his identity were he to just vanish at the beginning of the restart (they would have to deduce who was "missing" first of course)... I'm sure there are divination magic users who are capable of tracking down even accomplished archmages, and Red Robe may not be the most powerful individual.

Red Robe was losing ground before he left the loop. He may have actually fixed most of his problems by ejecting the Aranea, but he had no way of knowing that the same thing wouldn't happen again, with more intelligent and troublesome adversaries. Leaving the loop was the best method given the information he was working with.

****** it is also suggested that he thought that if anyone left, everyone else dies and the loop collapses. the opportunity cost for leaving early is very high in this case, but the potential loss if he does not do so is literally everything. I suspect that part of this equation is that he's a necromancer - he probably doesn't value that time as much as a non-necromancer. he can (or assumes that he can) just become a lich when the time comes. he's already got the simulacrum bit down, and alanic said that was about halfway there.

********* IIUC, one half of the process is the ability to create a magical brain, attached to your soul, but animating a separate body, ie a simulacrum; the other half is the ability to transfer your soul's primary anchoring out of your original body and into your prepared phylactery, thus leaving the artificial mind and body as the only one.

You can add extra features, mostly around what happens when the artificial body is destroyed and the soul has to jump back to the phylactery, but that's the gist of it.

Given that assumption, it's not unreasonable to think that that person is 1) well connected 2) a good mage 3) knows about the loop menchanics. At that point it's simply too dangerous to sit in the loop, where you can be mindraped/soulkilled/erased when that person exits the loop first. Not an unreasonable reaction on his part IMO.

If they could establish a teleport chain from a Xlotic Bakora gate into the interior, that would presumably only take a day or two at most to traverse (and a simulacrum could do that and then gate them in).

Yes, they intend to use Bakora Gates as a way to reach their destination in future restart, but by dedicating a restart to the attempt and reaching the closest gate in one fell swoop.

Also, keep in mind that the reason Zorian is so fixated on the airship is because he needs it to reach Blantyrre, which cannot be reached through teleportation jumping, not because it would be impossible to reach the Xlotic interior without it. Using the airship to reach Ziggurat of the Sun just a side benefit.

The entire continent is wild and dangerous, as is the journey itself, and there are no friendly ports unless you have an existing contract with some of the lizardmen states. It would take quite a while for Z&Z to convince a ship owner to take them there. Then a more time to organize an expedition and actually travel there. Even if they can reach Blantyrre before the restart runs out, it would leave them with very little time to find a local Bakora gate or do anything actually productive.

No, Zorian does not get much utility from simulacra in combat, because he doesn't have enough mana to have even 2 of them casting combat spells at once. His mind magic gets a huge boost, yes, as it uses barely any mana. But for combat, he's using a lot of mana, and he can't afford to split it on multiple tasks. In the two fights I can think of, against the Grey Hunter and in the assault on the Ibasan base, he chastised the simulacra both times for using his mana. In the Grey Hunter fight, it didn't participate at all after the Ambush failed, and in the assault it was only in combat to help Taiven.

Zach has enough mana that he could have multiple simulacra in combat without severely hampering himself, although he obviously couldn't be as wasteful as he normally is.

#+begin_quote

I was thinking that they would stand next to each other, because they would need to communicate and they can't use telepathy like Zorian. One to attack, the other to focus on defending against opposing fire.

Not gonna say it's the greatest strategy, but I don't think it's terrible.

#+end_quote

He's rarely in combat against opponents he has to outlast. QI, yes, but he's the exception. In mass battles, two mages with Zach's skill but half his mana each are more useful than one with twice the mana because the two can be in two places at once, and Zach's skill is more useful than throwing more Mana at an opponent. Even against QI, twice as many Zach-level combat spells would mean QI is spending Mana more quickly and likely less efficiently to defend, while his offensive spells won't be any more effective. Zach loses Mana quicker, but QI spends a greater proportion defending himself rather than attacking.

Usually, he's much more limited by his ability to cast spells quickly, so that he can overcome enemy shields, than he is by waiting for his opponents to run out of mana. The endurance contest doesn't totally apply when you're as good as Zach is.

Only when he can't avoid it. The grey hunter, with its magic resistance making it functionally immune to mind magic, was a terrible match-up for him. Contrast with his duel against the flower, where he kept it largely pinned down by battering its mind. Or how he routinely puppets invaders and makes them stab their comrades. Mind magic is his go-to combat strategy whenever it works.

Yeah, Zach can definitely use and benefit from simulacra, but I still think his benefits are more modest in relation to his existing skills.

I disagree. In combat, the idea of tempo is incredibly important. That a single person can only accomplish so much in one beat can be baldly abused by four opponents working simultaneously, possibly ending a fight that much quicker.

For some fights, I agree that endurance would be more important, but other fights might benefit from opening moves that consists of four types of spells rather than one, possibly allowing the fight to end much more quickly, thus mitigating the increased endurance cost.

Also, another factor to keep in mind is that simulacra are disposable, allowing them to be much more aggressive and take more risks. If delivering a decisive blow would normally kill Zach, a simulacrum could sacrifice itself and end the fight much more quickly.

What if most of them, instead of being mere automatons, had copies of Zach's mind?

If Zorian can maintain six golacra, Zach can handle over 30. Team Zach wouldn't have mind magic, but might be able to use Zorian's soul intercommunication techniques for coordination. Arm them with standard loadout of bombs and potions and rifles, plus each one is capable of casting spells in a pinch (would drain his reserves if they all did, though).

*** - Artifact research-potentially arbitrarily great returns, up to and including making their own, or just using the ones they already have for any of the million problems they have. Plus, easier to discover key features maybe.
- Leveling soul sight skill-potentially super important in fighting QI, red robe, figuring out how to get out of the loop, figuring out the key functions, etc
- Simulacrum 1:likely further magic gun research in preparation for QI takedown
- Simulacrum 2:likely further simulacrum golem research in preparation for lichification post loop. See Soul Sight
- Simulacrum 3:likely further senses/mind editing research, potentially super great
- Simulacrum 4(?):research into cranium rats/hydra, in preparation for turning all simulacrums into one awesome SWARMMIND
- Experts et al: Spell and golem refinement, new crypt breaking spells, finding the key location in Blantyre, etc, etc, etc
- Invasion: Probably incrimental memorisation of QI defense/offense arsenal by sending Alanic and others after him. Z&Z don't have to be personally present to test things.
- Gate research by experts-always nice.

Really, I think they are moving along nicely. They have three major meta problems: * Find the keys * Escape the loop * Defeat invasion afterwards First involves finding the keys (task best left to experts), getting to the keys (airship-a slow process), and then getting the keys (hard to estimate what skills will be needed, but presumably combat+defence, which they already have in abundance, plus fortifying holes in their defence-mostly soul sight for soul defence at this point). Furthermore, they need a way to break into the royal treasury, and a way to safely kill QI.

Second involves god knows what, but some things seem likely to help. Soul-related skills are likely to be useful, since time loop deals with soul transfer. Same with mind magic skills. Dimensional skills are likely to be useful, since time loop is dimensional in nature.

Third involves mundane logistical optimisation (Alanic) and defeating QI. My personal best bet is a really long-ranged magic railgun with a dimensionaly-folded bullet with one of those soul-tearing spell formulas Kael did once.

Finally, artifacts are wildcards, so they are useful any time you don't know what the problem might be, and studying them is useful.

*** They don't know for certain that the Key will get them out - especially Zorian, whose original body already contains a soul. It's their best lead and they're chasing it, but Zorian is also working on a backup plan using the primordial prisons as a bridge.

And that plan involves large-scale pocket dimensions.

**** Ha, I can just see the cultists summoning the primordial out in the real world and instead getting Zorian and Zach.

***** Note: AFAIK, every single loop occurs over the course of a few seconds (or some rather short period of time) at the beginning of the month in the real world.

After all, Red Robe was presumably perfecting the invasion process for use during the real month at the end of the loop, though honestly you could argue he was using the invasion to grind skills or something and that they'll exit by the end of the month or something.

****** It would be interesting if every loop took something in the nano- or microsecond range in the real world (and indeed, we have no evidence each loop takes any time, or at least any subjectively experienceable time, in the real world---the gate seems to only be limited in how many loops it can run by the mystical power available from the planar alignment, not the passage of real-world time). Then if Zorian and Zack make it out via the keys, Red Robe would literally still be in the room with the gate when they do.

******* Yep! If that's how the gate works, RR would be right there! But if the gate instead places RR's soul back in his body, he could be elsewhere.

***** They have a lot of helpers. Daimen tracked down this Key piece for them, and Silverlake is tutoring them in dimensionalism rather than them researching it from scratch. So, their time usage is very efficient.

*** The update schedule is every three weeks on Sunday, usually in the afternoon for the PST timezone.

That's all you need to know for the update schedule, however the author posts the schedule here:

[[https://m.fictionpress.com/u/804592/?a=b]]

On that note, a new chapter should be coming out today! :)
