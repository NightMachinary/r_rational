** Maybe The Count of Monte Cristo. I especially like when he is in prison and is gleaning as much information as possible from the old man to eventually exact his revenge. When the opportunity arises to escape he has a good plan on how to fool the guards.

** Primer

Circle (not The Circle) - not the movie itself, but the victor is a brilliant rationalist both in arguments and actions

10 Cloverfield Lane - MEW is the smartest horror-movie protag I've ever witnessed, and John Goodman is actually extremely well set-up for the apocalypse

*** I think one of the great points about Primer is how, despite the protagonists acting rationally, they are wrong.

Primer seems convoluted if you assume the time travel works the way the protagonists think it does. However, in reality they got it wrong.

I feel like shit because I can't find the article, but I read a really good breakdown of how there are some rules of the time travel that the protagonists don't understand. I think it's a great film where the idea is having a rationalist piece of fiction where the characters are still in the dark.

***** Honestly, I'm never gonna find it. I think it was something like a TVTropes Wild Mass Guessing page or similar. No idea. But I remember it pretty well:

I think the ultimate explanation was that the time travel worked like the time travel in Michael Crichton's /Timeline/ -- parallel universe, not same timeline. The protagonists are confused by the fact that it takes the same amount of time to travel backward as it does forward, but that this is actually not indicative that they remain in the same universe.The reason they see themselves in the past is that it's some other, parallel copy of themselves that acts identical, and not actually them. Plus, the whole stuff with Granger or the phone call -- parallel timeline, no causality conflict.

If you haven't read /Timeline/, I suggest you do (great book!), but in case you haven't here's one of the main concepts, explained:

1. There are infinite timelines that progress at different rates "simultaneously" (e.g. there is a timeline we can cross over to that is currently in the Middle Ages).

2. You can cross over between timelines through the medium of the Quantum Foam.

3. There are an infinite amount of timelines that have the tech to BOTH disassemble a person and reassemble them in another timeline.

4. There are also infinite timelines that only have half of this process. They can either reassemble or disassemble but not both. They can still time travel by relying on the other half of the timelines to make up their knowledge gap.

The argument said that our heroes are actually missing some of the technology and that another universe is "helping" them along. We follow (at least initially) one set of heroes who don't realize that the rules keep changing on them as they are "reassembled" in a new universe each time. Then, later on, the heroes change to people who understand it but don't bother explaining it to us the viewer.

I don't think I explained it as well as the initial argument did, but if you see any flaws in it please point them out to me. They might either be my mistake or a general flaw I haven't considered.

**** I don't think the story should count as internally consistent if it's too confusing and poorly made to figure out what's going on and the fans end up making graphs to explain the story only for there to still be plot holes left over like what happened with the guy from the future that led to them using the fail-safe machine.

I also didn't buy the characters' motivations as logical when I finally figured out what they were and I don't recall them actually utilizing creative problem solving. I don't get why people praise this movie so much since I think it makes no sense and ultimately accomplishes nothing with its story.

** [[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/europa_report/][Europa Report]] is a good sci-fi movie, and fits the rational criteria. There are plot points where other scriptwriters would have had the characters do stupid things for drama, but Europa Report doesn't go that direction. When characters conflict, they have good reasons, driven by their beliefs and values, and they approach the disagreements pretty reasonably.

*** I can accept the premise for the duration of a movie.

I don't know if I would say that humans have free will, everything we do is a direct result of what comes before and it would probably be silly to say that the processes in a human brain are not deterministic in nature we are too big to be properly random. I don't however think that the universe itself is deterministic in such a way but a wavefunction doesn't exactly have free will just because it could collapse in different ways. My thoughts on free will on determinism are a bit confused and rambling it seems.

**** Free will isn't about determinism, it's about how it feels when your brain subconsciously plans out your future actions. Whenever it feels like you by an exercise of free will /could/ do something if you wanted to, it's because your brain evaluates the proposed action and finds it to require negligible effort. (You could totally stand up from you seat /right now/ but you can't just go win a Nobel Prize.)

It is this feeling that has prompted ~2000 years of discourse. Also there's a medical term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboulia][for when people lose this ability.]]

Humans are deterministic (although currently only in theory) and also they have free will. The feeling of free will is about highly non-trivial planning ability.

** I would argue for the Prestige.

Yes, there is one bit of "real magic" in the movie, but everything else is explained and the motives of the characters are rational with the exception of the initial revenge plot, which both pursue in rational ways.

Also, it's emphasis on how everything can be explained in a magician's tricks is very, very rationalist.

You get the power to duplicate things and creatures and humans and instead of using it for massive profit and create an economic revolution you use it to commit serial suicide?

The other guy is slightly less insane but still ruins his own life for one single magic trick.

Maybe it could be considered rational if we assume they are magic-trick-paperclippers, who only value magic tricks and everything else in the world exists only to serve that purpose. This is consistent with their behavior, but I hesitate to use the term rational to describe such an inhuman psychology.

** I think it's unusually hard for movies to be rational. They're under very tight time constraints, which often forces them to skim over obvious plot holes or move the story along by giving someone the idiot ball. Hollywood movies also have to appeal to an absurdly broad audience if they want to be profitable, which pushes them toward the median taste in plots and hurts their ability to experiment.
