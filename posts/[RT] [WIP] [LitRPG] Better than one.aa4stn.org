** You've certainly got an interesting premise here. There are many cool things you can do with this.

I've read the first few chapters, and it feels you might be rushing it too much. For example, I felt like you missed a great opportunity to establish the main characters' personalities with some character interaction as they regain their bearings after the initial crisis in the sewer. As it is, the spoiled princess personality of Estra doesn't quite feel genuine.

So far I don't think there's anything particularly irrational, but I felt that you're progressing things so quickly that things feel like they "just happen" without the reader having had a chance to see them coming. I feel like the events would be more impactful if you spent some more time establishing the world, characters and their situation first.

There are also some grammar mistakes, but nothing that would immediately put me off from reading the story. I think it would help you greatly with both pacing and grammar if you can find a good editor and beta reader.

*** I'd love to find a good editor and beta readers, but right now it's just the first draft. And this comment of yours is the best I got as far as feedback so far. You're probably right that I was rushing the first part there, I tend to underwrite. I probably need to squeeze in a chapter between 1 and 2, and do as you suggested. Thanks.

**** Chapter 1 really confused me because there seems to be a jump. At first the personality the MC is sharing a body with seems to know what is going on, and seems to be comfortable with being an ogre.

Then after they escape from the sewer that completely changes, the person is revealed to be Estra and she's horrified at being an ogre.

At first I thought that Estra was only put inside the ogre at that point, and that before was the original personality of the ogre. But that doesn't seem to be the case. It's confusing though.

***** That's not good. I don't like confusing. I'll probably need to clear that up. In the sewers, she was in shock (generally, the 1st stage of grief.) Shock provides emotional protection from being overwhelmed all at once. Then she was in denial (2nd stage) about what happened once they escaped.

I'll see about clearing that up. Thank you.

***** Ok, I revised chapter 1 to be less confusing. Hopefully it's clear now.

*** I expanded a few paragraphs from chapter 1, to slow the pace and show the initial interaction between the two.

**** I went back and read the added bit. Good work, I thought it helped. I find your writing style quite entertaining, so I'm pretty sure it won't hurt to slow down like that occasionally when you find spots to naturally show us more of the world and the characters.

Good luck with your project.

** I made an earnest attempt to keep the story rational. Please let me know if I succeed, or where I may have failed.

** I thought the core concept was inventive and interesting -- congrats on coming up with something new and fresh. I read all the chapters with pleasure.

A big turn-off for me is the personality of the princess and her interactions with the main character. The whole "she's a spoiled brat" thing doesn't work so much for me personally. I'd have preferred it if she was proud, sometimes unreasonable, but on the whole intelligent and persuadable and having more to say to the MC than a string of petty insults.

Think of why Pride and Prejudice works, for example. The main characters have a mix of positive and negative traits, and, even though they initially get into each other's cross-hairs, you are still rooting for them to work out their misunderstandings as the story evolves.

*** I get what you're saying. I am struggling with characters and dialogues at this time. I intend for her to have a character arc, where she matures and becomes reasonable and disciplined through their struggles. But this would take time, and not 1/3 of the book, but more like post climax. She does have some positive traits right from the start, such as being a great fire mage, and disciplined when it comes to taking care of her/their body. The rest will take some work, and through hardships I'll get her to a stage where'd she'd be proud of her accomplishments.

** It needs some interludes of the main character actually getting to employ his original skills, instead of every single one of his plans to do so getting derailed. For comedy, I dunno.. proper ventilation?

*** A plan is in the works to make use of his modern knowledge. But yeah, proper ventilation and safe working conditions would be nice :)
