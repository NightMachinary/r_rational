Couple that with a few implanted commands or keywords to mind control Zach during any truly dangerous confrontation as contingencies, and another to erase all memory of that. Red Robe could have been using Zach as his magic artillery cannon anytime it was necessary with him being non the wiser.

Just because Alanic does those things doesn't make it more likely that he's lying about knowing Xvim. Then you might as well say everything he's ever said to Zorian could be lies.

As to [[/u/-Fender-]]'s point, there's really no motive to provoke Z&Z about Xvim since they were the ones who mentioned Xvim's name first anyways. The way he phrases his responses makes it extremely unlikely he's lying about knowing Xvim.

*** Just to recap, what do they each know?

Alanic knows that they were targeted by some soul magic, and that both of their souls now have a marker. He knows that Xorian has some knowledge about sensing his soul, and that Zach is a novice. He probably knows that both are inordinately good magicians for their apparent age (depending on how exactly they saved his and Lukav's lives), and may be aware that they can both teleport. He also had to find it strange how Zorian spoke about him as if they were acquaintances, and seemed to know Xvim. (Although it was fairly obvious, he still somehow knew that Xvim was a person's name rather than a place or a training method, and he also knew right away that it was a reference to a man and not a woman.)

Xvim, on the other hand, knows that the time loop is a thing, and that Zorian and Zach are "endlessly" repeating this same month. He most likely knows that the Astral Plane is currently disconnected from their plane of existence, since he's told Zorian in the past that this is one of the most convincing things that he could be told to believe in the time loop. He also knows that both Zorian and Zach have very developed shaping skills, and that Zorian has been his student for a long time, going so far as respecting him as his master. He can also easily guess that this is really Zach's first time spending a restart as one of his students. Beyond that, all I can think of that he would also know would be whatever anecdotes and circumstantial evidence Zorian would have told him to convince him of the time loop.

As far as I can tell, neither is currently aware of the Sovereign Gate's usage or that Cyoria's time magic research facility is involved in any way, they are unaware of the invasion, unaware that Sudomir is a necromancer and built a spiritual sinkhole. They are most likely unaware of the deaths of all of the people with working knowledge of soul magic around Knyazov Dveri. They are also unaware that Zorian is a mind mage, although Xvim at least must have strong suspicions that Zorian is very knowledgeable in the field, after his talk with Zach. And they are unaware of the exact purpose of the soul marker.

Did I miss anything that they could have taught each other about the time loop and Z&Z?

IIRC Alanic was awed by the marker's complexity. so he can't. Xvim may be a good enough mage to handle such complex spell patterns, but then does he have an extroverted soul sight? Introverted absolutely, he is a DADA master after all, but extroverted perception may or may not fit his moral framework. So, who knows.

Maybe by their powers combined they could do this, but I think this is unlikely for story-wise reasons. If they manage to create a significant number of loopers, the 'real world' fight once they exit the loop is no match for them, because there are so many of them.

In this case it's fortuitous that it ended up being around the time a primordial was going to be released, but under normal circumstances, it doesn't seem likely that anything of that significance would be occurring. We do know that one Sovereign Gate user established the Ikosian Empire so maybe it was intended to help advance humanity? And it was implied by the Spirit that it used to be common (every few centuries or so on the planar alignment), was the Gate being used to occasionally shove humans forward?

***** Regardless of whether Veyers is RR, Zach and Veyers have gone through completely different events. Even if Veyers was RR, why should RR leaving have the same effect as the Lich trying to combine Zach's and Zorian's souls had on Zach's existence? What's weird is that it does seem to be giving the same results, as far as Zorian's information gathering is concerned.

Granted, while Zorian himself didn't have the resources or skills he does now back in loops 2-7, it's still odd that absolutely nothing could be found regarding Zach in those loops. And overall, Zach's disappearance then was a bigger deal than Veyers' is now. Investigators hired by Zach's guardian and other interested parties couldn't find any trace of him.

Even though we've had the loop explained, it still has some plot relevant mysteries to it, such as the mechanism or entity that made Zach disappear entirely for loops 2-7.

One other thing that's been bothering me, that came up again this chapter. Zorian is still assuming RR is a necromancer, despite never seeing him perform any necromancy. "Soulkill" was never a necromantic spell at all, just a time loop specific one, RR could have been misdirecting Zorian to throw him off by naming it as such. RR somehow manages to track him down while Zorian is invisible and shielded from Soul Sense, which could be explained by mind sense or any other non-visual detection abilities.

****** Zorian assumes RR is a necromancer because RR has openly boasted about his extroverted soul perception. While having soul sight is not the definitive proof of being a necromancer, it is a particularly strong evidence for it.

As for Zach's disappearance, this is complicated by Tesen not being trustworthy at all. Let's say on the start of the loop Tesen finds Zach's soulless corpse. Tesen knows that people know that he has been looting Noveda, but outright killing Zach in his sleep (and that's the reasonable assumption when the boy is found mysteriously dead) is beyond what's acceptable. He shoves the corpse into a pocket dimension and announces his eccentric ward has totally disappeared! He can even hire investigators in earnest to maintain plausibility.

The reasonable assumption was that the Gate was simply detecting soul damage done to the Controller and has abandoned remaking controllers body(ies) in favor of giving the soul time to heal. Zorian's soul was either more resilient or got less damaged and got healed faster.

******* But was it really soul sight and not some other sense?

RR manages to locate Zorian just a few paragraphs later, despite Zorian still hiding himself from soul sight. Lying about /how/ you're tracking someone seems like a good way to catch them. He does seem to know that Zorian is hiding his soul though, so there is some evidence for him being a soul mage, unless he was just guessing.

True, Tesen isn't trustworthy, but I feel like Zach's disappearance was legit. Zach being dead at the start of a loop fulfills one of the conditions for the loop to reset, so I'm not fond of that idea. Zach being in a coma would work better, but I don't see why Tesen would need to hide it in either case. There's not really a reason for people to suddenly start suspecting him of foul play, (other than Zach in a coma) and if lies can be detected with great accuracy in this world, he should be able to tell the truth and clear any suspicions regarding himself.

My thoughts are more in line with your "reasonable assumption", Zach's body simply wasn't created for those first loops, or it was created and immediately moved into a special location to facilitate the recovery of his soul. RR had a decent idea of when Zorian entered the loop, which I assume was based on when Zach's disappearances began.

Too bad Zorian didn't investigate Veyers' disappearance more in earlier loops, I'd like to know if this is a consequence of RR leaving or something established many loops ago. If there was a controller ability to keep someone's body from appearing in the loop, that would be pretty significant.

******** That's an interesting question. I'll go with soul sight.

Zorian had learned the very basics of soul protection before ch 26. His only mentor, if you can even call him that, was Kael. His soul defenses were extremely shoddy. It also seems that he has not mastered absolute soul defense in the current chapter. Maybe there is none, unlike mind magic and Mind Blank. In any case, even after Alanic's lessons he was still vulnerable to Sudomir's soul sight. The necromancer could even tell when Zorian activated his soul marker to reset the time loop. So of course Red Robe was able to find him.

The ability to have someone's body disappear would be fairly useless, if you have an ability to make anyone a soulless corpse. The only difference would be that someone disappearing is less disturbing then someone being found mysteriously dead.

However, you got me thinking, such ability is from entirely different class than "Soul Eject" ability. Modifying the physical world Template could be very useful and it makes sense to grant Controllers such ability. No need to gather crystallized mana and alchemical ingredients each restart when you can simply tell the Guardian create you some in the next restart. I wish Z&Z brute-guessed some info of the Controller abilities from the Guardian. He is, after all, obliged to answer a direct yes/no question about a particular ability.

********* I had forgotten about Sudomir's soul sight, but Zorian doesn't try to hide himself entirely from Sudomir at any point anyway. Probably because Zorian's presence in Iasku mansion was such that it couldn't be disguised in the first place, breaking stuff and destroying undead to get the innermost rooms of the mansion.

For the moment, I'll continue to find it suspicious that RR congratulates Zorian on hiding himself from his soul perception, goes on to talk about how great he is at soul magic (since he just used it to kill the aranea, which was a lie), and then grabs Zorian and slams him into a wall, and then attempts to read Zorian's mind (without any chants or gestures). One of the big appeals of Daimen as RR had to me was the idea that Daimen might be an inferior mind mage, which would explain RR's mental abilities.

Making a person disappear entirely would have one advantage over simply eliminating their soul, which is that other people are less likely to know for sure that the person is gone. Still, I'll admit that it would be an odd mechanic. Could the Guardian have collected Zach immediately due to the soul damage, and put his body in a place he couldn't be reached? If that was the case, maybe the Guardian did the same for Veyers for some reason?

********** Zorian barged into the cultist gate guns blazing, with reasonable expectations of being confronted by necromancers (because Ibasans) and a possibility, albeit small, of facing RR himself. He had been preparing for this assault for at least a month. Of course he had every possible ward and defense up including soul defenses and still Sudomir bypassed them.

Still, of course, every RR's word is suspect. We can be certain only about his mind magic, because he used it.

The way the safeguards against soul tampering are set up for the Controller ultimately depends on lots of intricate worldbuilding questions. I.e. does a soul need a living body to heal? If no, what happens to the souls of the dead in the loop? Since there is no afterlife for them to move on do they simply float for a month before the current SG-iteration is collapsed? It could be that a soul needs only time to heal. In this case the Guardian will simply place Controller's soul in the control room (or whatever this weird place where they talked to the Guardian was called), which is probably the safest place for a Controller to be, and wait.

Second, erasing Zach's memory of the normal version of the invasion, and repeating the same changes each restart to avoid suspicion. It was like this long enough that Zach made an elaborate plan to save Zorian, a side objective, from an explosion that only happens with Red Robe's influence, without thinking it was anything new.

Hopefully Alanic and Xvim force him to get his head checked.

** This is a bit tangential, but to be totally honest, I've gotta say: I ship Zach/Zorian p. hard. It's not remotely supported by the text or even slightly indicated subtextually, but still, they have a lot of chemistry. Zach is a really good foil for Zorian, and props to [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] on that score; I was legitimately surprised at how well he slotted into the story, given that he had been purposefully put on a bus for large swaths of the text.

Also, this was a good chapter, because I /also/ ship Xvim/Alanic. I'm excited to see what happens here; Alanic's presence is likely helpful, since we have every reason to believe he's got pretty high-level connections with the church and the military.

*** Well, if they got together it might be kinda contrived. Since part of the reason they're such good foils could be the spell that qtach ichl cast on them to try to combine their souls or something. So I guess you could kind of say they're soul mates in a sense I guess, but only because an evil lich tampered with their souls.

As for Xvim/Alanic I don't think there's been any contextual evidence for that whatsoever. No hints that they've ever interacted before. It would have been kinda funny though.

**** I think it'd be a stretch for nobody103 to include anybody as a romantic partner for Zorian at this point, except as some sort of aside in an epilogue that follows some kind of time skip. As Zach pointed out last chapter, Zorian hasn't thought much at all of the romantic possibilities of the time loop, and it's hard to see him turning to that at this point.

I don't miss the romantic subplot here, fwiw; I think Z/Z would probably be the most compelling possibility if one were to add such a subplot, especially given the mechanics of soul magic and etc., but it would arguably slow down the narrative of a very plot-driven piece of work. Part of what works about /MoL/ is its approach to the time loop gimmick, and given how many time loop stories include romance as the main plot driver, it's refreshing to see nobody103 eschew that in favor of worldbuilding density and plot elegance. Very Nasu-esque, really, all while avoiding the pitfalls that Nasu falls for in his H-game plots.

Z/Z could work if Zorian was bi, which I just don't see happening, he made his view of Taiven sexiness very explicit when he initially described her, so there's no doubt about him being interested in women, but he has never shown any such views on men.

I'm also happy that there's no romance, it usually ends up being fairly crass and often bloat out of proportion to take over the plot and romance pretty much only works as a side dish so it's pretty bad when that happens.

****** I dunno, I'm pretty sure that romance sits at the heart of some of the most iconic works of fiction. It's true that when it's done poorly, it's uniquely terrible, but I'm inclined to think it's /easy/ compared to the complicated plot work nobody103's doing; it's one thing to put together a mystery plot, but doing it so that you tell a satisfying mystery in a serial format seems even harder, since you can't go back and edit in that subtle foreshadowing that nobody103's so good at.

Z/Z obviously is not a real thing that can happen in the story at this point. But I call it compelling because romance is a good vector for conflict, and these characters and their motivations would be interestingly complicated by additional tension in their relationship. I don't think /MoL/ would necessarily be better for it, given that the space that sort of thing would take up has been used to tell a story from an arguably more original POV, but I can see how it'd be an interesting alternative.

** You know, it sounds pretty feasible that RR could have asked the Guardian to transfer his physical body to the real world. The Guardian wouldn't object to him leaving, since he has the Controller marker, and it's perfectly capable of creating a copy of his body and anchoring his soul to it.

Zorian and Zach might even be able to pull the same thing, once they get the Key and reopen the Gate. By transferring their physical bodies, they would sidestep issues of interfering with the template, since their original selves would remain intact. Of course, that would mean that there are two copies of them in the real world - or at least two copies of Zorian - but clearly the Guardian was not designed to anticipate that possibility. If the Maker thought about physical exit at all, then it would have anticipated the Controller's original body being a soulless corpse. Not a big deal. So the Guardian might allow it.
