** Interesting plan. My first thought was that they could transmit back information by having signs set up where death row prisoners are executed, or terminally ill patient beds.

Of course, the plan could be easily flawed depending on a few details we don't know. If the other woman's location at this time could not be found, even by Hannah dedicating her life to it, then Hannah is trapped into devoting her life to trying to track her down, and failing. If Hannah would be dissuaded by a message saying that finding this woman is impossible, then she could receive that message anyway if time here works a la HPMOR and chooses scenarios which minimise complexity.

Alternately, it's entirely possible that Hannah is not being strictly honest about this precommitment, in which case this would also fail. It's quite a big ask to dedicate your life to a mission based on information from someone you've just met, especially if that person proceeds to not give you any useful information about your own death. Even if she doesn't think Simon is lying, he could easily have reached some incorrect assumptions about his power.

Also, I think this story is large enough to benefit from a table of contents. Or placed more prominently should one already exist, since a cursory scan couldn't find it.

I have now created a table of contents! One of the things that I do not like about this Wordpress theme is that the pages are listed in small font at the top of the page, so people may not notice them. This is why the landing page is the "About" page, and I'm adding a mention of the table of contents (with a link of course) just below the "Start reading here" line, to make sure that people see it.

Would you mind letting me know what you think of the table of contents? There's nothing fancy, but it'd be nice to know if there's anything horrible about the way that it's formatted (maybe it's incredibly awful that the sequence titles are centered, say).

**** I can't see any problems with the table of contents. It doesn't really need to be fancy, just makes things easier to navigate

In a similar vein, I think next and previous chapter links would also be useful for anyone who discovers the story later and wants to read through

***** Those already exist. They're below the comments, though, and...apparently you didn't see them. Which means that they're not very useful, being where they are.

I'm not sure if I can fix that without switching to a different theme, but I'll take a look, and if I can't fix it then I'll have to look at alternate themes. I doubt that I'll be able to change the theme in the next month, however--at the moment, I'm also writing applications for grad school and studying for the GRE. That'll be done in a month, one way or another, and I'll make "find a new theme" one of the tasks that I complete before I find a nice corner to collapse in.

** *Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
