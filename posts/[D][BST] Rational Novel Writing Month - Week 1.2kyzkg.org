Whoops, my schedule is a bit packed today, but I can still start the discussion even if I don't write anything until tomorrow.


** I wrote the first thousand words last night once midnight hit, and will probably have the first chapter (which is mostly a prologue) done by the end of the day. I'm still planning to post to [[https://www.fictionpress.com/%7Ealexanderwales][fictionpress.com]] but I'm not sure how many disclaimers I need about the fact that the novel is being written in a month and probably won't be as high of quality as I would like.

Edit: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3221980/1/The-Dark-Wizard-of-Donkerk][The first chapter (~6000 words)]] is now up. I'm lagging behind my outline targets - at the current rate, it would be a doorstopper epic instead of a nice and tidy 80K word novel. I'll have to work on that. The second chapter ~8000 words is also up.

*** I don't think that would be such a good idea, unless you went all the way and added a sort of "Development Commentary" parallel to the story.

Which could be cool, I guess. But I'd rather read it in its best possible form.

**** It's more for people who are interested in seeing the process than people who want to read "finished product" - I've shared things a lot during NaNos past. And it will be finished at some point, assuming that NaNo doesn't produce a trainwreck this year. Once NaNo is over I'll take it down and do the actual editing work.

*** I've been wondering the same thing as well. I have a few friends who are interested to see my progress but I'd sort of rather wait until after i get a chance to write the whole thing and then edit it at least once.

** 3395 words of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2gttf1/dbst_anyone_writing_a_rationalist_novel_for/clqy11s][my novel]] written at the end of day 2. Yesterday went nicely with 2184 words, but then I went to some friends who helped screw over my sleep patterns and I spent a large part of today in a haze. We'll see how tomorrow goes, given that I need to get back on working on my MSc thesis as well.

Mostly throwing random scenes together in Scrivener at the moment, without being too concerned of how they fit together chronologically, or even which ones will be kept in the final manuscript. I hope something sensible will finally emerge from this.

Excerpt from day 1:

#+begin_quote
  "This shouldn't be any worse than your worst nightmare."

  "I've heard more reassuring descriptions."
#+end_quote

Excerpt from day 2:

#+begin_quote
  Then the ground under him shook, and those thoughts were pushed away, it being more urgent to find out what was happening. He heard the rumbling of stone under him, as the ground moved and earth shoot up; and then he heard the melody in the rumble, the sound waves that had pushed through the ground and broken it, and which then burst into fire as they made contact with the air, taking the shape of a woman who was standing in front of him.

  The Fire-Singer.

** I'm going to give it a go this time, mainly to crank out a lousy first draft of a novel that I've wanted to write for ages ("hard fantasy" about language, culture, and qualia) but I keep getting bogged down in timeline and character minutia.

I think it'll be easier to futz with the details once I've got a /complete story/ than it has been trying to cram all of the subtext I want into each individual paragraph of a single chapter. Did my first 1000 words before work this morning, and I'll try to hit 5k by the end of my weekend on Monday night.

** Up to 1,860 as of a few hours ago, and finished for today. Because of Technical Difficulties (TM) I'm not going with what I was originally planning - what I spent /two and a half months/ planning - but I'm enjoying it so far, and am looking forward to making at least 50,000 words of progress on this.

It's tentatively titled /The Calm Before the Stars/ and is both Fantasy and Sci-fi. Not a blending of the two, just both existing simultaneously. Space-age fantasy, essentially.

The fantasy aspect is mostly present in the existence of Deities, singular manifestations of the collective conscience.

Earth is on the cusp of breaking free of its ties to the planet - our large population and potential for future exponential expansion through colonization has attracted the galactic Deities, those whose Followers span across galaxies. Some of Earth's Deities want to ingratiate themselves with these Galactigods, ready for the corporate takeover. Others are trying to scheme, trade, or simply steal in order to get their hands on the secret of FTL travel, in order to give Earth - and themselves - a fighting chance without being folded into a pre-existing Faith.

It's pretty preliminary, and my writing so far is just worldbuilding by writing to discover characters and settings I want to include.

** Care to see the opening lines?

  “We all know why we're here,” he said, looking across the group of ponies tightly gathered in the atrium. “Canterlot has fallen; both princesses are presumed dead, and what little radio chatter that's left has confirmed megaspell strikes on Cloudsdale, Phillydelphia, and just about every damn city with more than 12 residents.” His voice trembled as he spoke his next words, “Hell - most of us here saw Manehatten go up in flames ourselves.”

[[/cutealoo][]] Is the beginning attention grabby enough? /I/ think so.

[[/dealwithit][]] Also, I've gotten 2293 words! [[http://imgur.com/JhB1Ras][And a cover!]] /Fuck yeah!/ It feels great to be ahead of schedule (even by a bit), and I hope I don't lose too much steam as the month progresses.

Also, I'm unsure how much I plan to share a long the way, or even immediately after November. I definitely plan on significantly editing the whole thing when I'm through, but I love the encouraging words getting readership /now/ will bring. dilemmas!

Good luck to all, and I can't wait to read all the other stories getting created this month.

*** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow][I think this is relevant.]]; my suggestion would be to turn that into narration instead of dialogue. Also, I like to make the first sentence the Wham! line that pulls the audience in, instead of using an entire paragraph. That can take one of two forms, complex and simple.

Simple: Manehattan burned.

Complex: When Jake got up that day, he didn't expect that lunch would include tea and scones with Loki's daughter.

As to how much to share, my suggestion is: a lot. Pick a schedule (I suggest every week) and post here on that schedule, with the promise that every week there will be another X words. Precommittment and public accountability supports success.

** I'm not doing a novel per se, but I'll be writing 10,000 words + 10,000 words + 7,000 words (the various deliverables for my Kickstarter) plus (~4,000 words)x4 for 2YE. Of that, I've written the first chapter of 2YE and about 9000 words of the first KS deliverable- in fairness, I started that before the KS ended in October.

Wish me luck!
