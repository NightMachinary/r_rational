Magic is insanely powerful in the Enchanted Forest. But how exactly would you go about achieving godhood, given the same resources as Emma Swan? If you want a real challenge, start without any magic of your own.

Factors of interest (off the top of my head):

Removing your heart can grant extremely limited immortality at the expense of love and other positive emotions.

In Wonderland, you can be decapitated without dying, while causing constant intense pain.

Genies can grant wishes if obtained. However, as always, said wishes will screw you over if possible and still cannot break the Rules of Magic.

Rules of Magic (all of which have been broken):

No resurrection (broken with Rumple by the Dagger, with Maleficent, and with Anastasia by obtaining all genie lamps at once.)

No time travel (broken one-way by Regina to retrieve poison apple, and by Zelena.)

No induced love (broken by Jafar with the three genie lamps.)

**** I thought a day was a good balance between risk of interruption and wanting to be conscious for the whole process - and specified time because (genuine) misinterpretation is too easy otherwise.

** One thing they often say in the show is that all magic has a price. Which means that most attempts to munchkin it will fail; the answer to "why can't I use the magic to do X" is that the price will be really bad.

Of course, you can still munchkin the "magic has a price" rule itself. After all, things that benefit you may harm other people and vice versa. Whether something is a "price" or a "benefit" and whether it is large or small is purely arbitrary. (If you can cast a spell to make your army win a battle, and the price that they all die when the battle is over, could an enemy spy, who actually wants the army to die, cast the same spell? After all, to him, the roles of price and benefit are reversed, so for him, the benefit exceeds the price.)

** There's ... /really/ no "you can't wish for more wishes" on that list? Can't you just wish to have all of the genie lamps? That's so broken it isn't even hilarious, just kind of disappointing.

From a /slightly/ more narratively satisfying angle - I've only seen the first season, so I'll take it from there - Emma pretty much starts out with enough evidence to prove the whole "storybook magic" hing is real, and she has said storybook. So a rational character would automatically start out as one of four or so people in the town who know magic exists after the first episode had passed.

I don't actually know as much about the setting as Emma would, in that situation, but I'd be inclined to just talk it out with "Mr Gold" and, once I had some magical defences, Regina. I've honestly got no problem with maintaining the spell, at least in the short run - heck, it's arguable whether you'd be basically killing off spell-created people acting as soul jars for the originals, and they'd be /less/ well-equipped to deal with the world as it is now.

(Specifically, I got the impression Rumpelstiltskin doesn't really /need/ that Dagger anymore, he seems like a jack-of-all-trades these days; so I'd probably ask for that in exchange for my ability to exploit magical powers in ways that aren't bound by idiotic storybook logic. He already knows my real name, so he'd have a guarantee. As you mention, magic in his setting is insane, so once I have it I shouldn't have much trouble.)
