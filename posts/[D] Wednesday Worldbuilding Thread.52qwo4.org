Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** A common feature of cyberpunk stories is to feature corporations in positions of power equal or greater than that of governments in developed nations. The simultaneously best and worst example of this trope is Shadowrun, where the Supreme Court granted megacorporations the same rights as sovereign nations, which I frankly find absurd even if it does a good job at justifying the dystopia. So I tried to think of a way to make the shift in the definition of business a bit less absurd, and I think I found the answer with superheroes.

In the setting I've come up with, all sources of superpowers require substantial infrastructure to produce and maintain, so large corporations are the only ones who can create them. However, new anti-trust laws and military treaties heavily regulate the usage of powers, so companies are severely limited in how they can profit from them. The only loophole is for when powers are used to be a good samaritan, so they decide to create superheroes and pass them off as a form of charitable donation.

The heroes end up being a huge success, and soon develop a celebrity culture around them and their exploits. The companies recognize a marketing opportunity and become sponsors of people that fight crime and save lives on TV. This is what causes a shift in the idea of what a corporation is. Suddenly, businesses are no longer just out for themselves, they are spending money solely to support the actions of real-life Supermen and using that money to hold them to high standards of behavior.

The appearance of supervillains backed by organized crime, which the police can't handle do to a a backlash against militarization, finally cements corporations as responsible protectors in the public consciousness. The brands people buy and work for become a mark of identity as much as the heroes themselves, and the companies that support those heroes are swimming in cash as they promote the image of responsible capitalism. Businesses begin internal crackdowns on abuses of power, even publicizing arrests of their own executives to prove their integrity.

Soon there are calls to loosen superpower laws and even deregulate other industries, and the liberals capitulate because the system does seem to be working. With the majority of corporate income now coming from what are basically taxes on customers, they begin building new subsidiaries to supplement public institutions as a way to further compete over PR. A few public controversies later, and people are demanding for-profit organizations be granted new legal protections from the tyranny of ideologues.

Where the typical cyberpunk megacorp comes into effect is that companies are more obsessed with their public image than actual business. They've taken every step they can to avoid or discourage accountability while also trying to slander each other, so private investigation and espionage is now an industry in and of itself. Workers and customers are also encouraged to become cogs in a machine while innovation has been stifled by a new kind of monopoly. The glitterati cape culture is social satire that writes itself.

**** Thank you. The only other setting I've seen pull off cyberpunk megacorps is Eclipse Phase, where all Earth governments were destroyed in the backstory and humanity has fled into space. The companies founded a new psuedo-democratic government and put themselves in charge because they owned most of the infrastructure. The rest of the solar system is either dictatorships, anarchist communities, or an experiment in socialism, so people are hesitant to leave.

****** I'm subscribed to [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]], but I've never posted there. Your setting is kind of interesting, but I'm not sure what kind of story you're setting up. You've mixed a lot of different concepts together from different genres, all of which are good on their own, but there's no overarching theme to tie it all together. I just went for straight cyberpunk dystopia

The one hole in your setting is the transition of superheroes from illegal to corporate. My setting implies that they were legal to begin with, and were also established by corporations in the first place and rely on them for their powers. Heroes in your world started off as independent vigilantes and don't gain many advantages from selling out, so why would they?

******* I guess, that the overarching theme of the setting as whole would be related to lies and pursuit of truth. IMO it ties underlying themes (Plato's Cave, crapsaccharine cyberpunk dystopia and commercial superheroes) quite well.

Superheroes never were illegal, but vigilantism just had a dubious legal nature, what was exploited by big corporations. As for gains from selling out, the biggest ones were corporations taking responsibility for heroes' actions (so they weren't e.g. pursued by law enforcement for collateral damage, which issue is often ignored in superhero fiction), additional resources and access to corporate labs to develop their abilities further. The last one was especially important, as the powers in my setting resemble [[https://redd.it/4f3vkq][mix of magic and reality programming]] rather than [[http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/748/694/41e.jpg][usual comic book superpowers]], so corporate superheroes had it easier due to better means of honing their talent and spell blueprints written for them by specialists hired by their employer.

******** According to current good samaritan laws, superheroes actually aren't liable for collateral damage most of the time, but if they were I would think that'd make corporations avoid responsibility for their actions. The way you describe superheroes makes it sound like they're just unusually powerful mages, in which case I don't see why they'd be celebrities. It seems like they'd have the same role in society as alchemists in FMA, who are constantly doing mundane work because their abilities are so useful.

I can see you exploring themes about truth with magic in a cyberpunk dystopia, but I don't see how superheroes fit into that even if they're celebrities. The only stories I've seen with celebrity heroes use them to make you feel cynical towards society. They represent the corruption of the fantastic and righteous, and mainly serve to set the stage for stories about other people dealing with them. If your setting already has that with magic and megacorps, why add an additional element that's normally used to inject fantasy into a mundane setting?

********* Not all countries have good samaritan laws and well, these usually apply to rather minor things. When supers are throwing at each other equivalents of bullets, grenades, rockets or even high yield explosives, good samaritan laws seem kinda out of place. As for the issue of responsibility, corporations haven't took it for all heroes, but only for selected and popular ones, what gave them large income because people more eagerly bought products advertised by heroes.

The comparison with alchemists from FMA is kinda off the mark, as Amestris isn't a highly developed in terms of technology. In a cyberpunk world most of mundane work would be rather ceded to machines. A lot of casters of Alchemy of Forms is still used in research, medicine, agriculture, industry or entertainment, though usually rather in fine stuff rather than physical labour, that can be handled by specialized robots. Superheroes became celebrities precisely because of the fact than in era of advanced Internet their deeds were streamed getting to wide audience. In a current day there are many channels with footages, interviews or reality shows. BTW the issue of people not using their powers to mundane jobs applies to pretty much every piece of work from superhero genre.

Well, in most cases superheroes in my setting are not righteous "allies of justice", but just enforcers of law and walking commercials. Often they are even worse people than villains they face, but for the purpose of PR they create fake personas. On the other hand supervillains are usually just mercenaries of the same corporations that hire superheroes, but meant to do underhanded jobs and take part in staged fights or vigilantes trying to uncover truth about crimes, that were swept under the carpet. The entire superhero culture is built on lies.

In initials versions of this setting I actually haven't thought about adding superheroes, but then if the magic is public, its applications with offensive purposes would be most likely banned or at least heavily supervised. Governments using casters on military purposes could also meet a public outrage plus people with more power than average would be feared. After all how would you feel if someone in your neightbourhood was walking with a rocket launcher? Superheroes de facto familiarized people with Alchemy of Forms and made them feel relatively safe.

********** I still think that the circumstances under which superheroes appear in settings are different from the ones you present. Live streaming crimefighting I understand, but there doesn't seem to be a reason for superheroes to appear in the first place, let alone become corporatized later on. If people feared Alchemy of Forms being used for combat, why would they be okay with vigilantes? If vigilantism has no legal protections, how did anyone keep doing it long enough to gain public support?

As to your reason for adding superheroes, I feel like you're trying to justify something that doesn't need it. Sure, people would be afraid of Alchemy of Forms being used to hurt people, but that doesn't mean people wouldn't ever use it for combat. People would learn how to fight just out of fear of getting into a fight. It's not like you can stop people from using magic however they want, but you can deter them with laws and capable authorities.

*********** Superheroes appeared for the same reason as they appear in most of superhero fiction (yours included) - certain people had more power than most of the society. And didn't fear Alchemy of Forms being used for combat, because that was already happening, but rather it being researched for combat means by military. That's quite a difference. Also the fact that vigilantes weren't employed and controlled by governments meant, that they cannot be used as a policing force of currently ruling political party to create a totalitarian regime. Them being independent was what appealed to public.

Well, just learning how to fight using Alchemy of Forms is not enough to use it for combat for the most of people. It's not like every alchemist is equal. Majority of casters wont get past reheating soup, even if they trained their entire lives, while some people can overpower tanks or high yield explosives within just few months of developing their talent.

************* Well, criminals already had military-grade magic, while government special squads were in many cases not enough due to asymmetrical distribution of powers. Especially since governments couldn't just forcibly incorporate anyone with powers into their forces, as it would be violation of their human rights, while hiring other supervillains as mercenaries was morally dubious. That's why initially police and special forces turned a blind eye on vigilantes, who did their job for them.

No one demanded vigilantes, but when first ones appeared media and public opinion were rooting for them, what along with leniency from police gave them a lot of leeway. And that's how they became a social phenomenon. If we discount vigilantes governments had two options: reduce freedom of people with higher talent in Alchemy of Forms to put them in special forces to fight crime or start creating infrastructure for law enforcement, what could take years during which supervillains would mostly go unpunished. Both of these were basically equal to a political suicide.

BTW why haven't national institutions create their own superheroes in your world? I mean an entire country should have means to create infrastructure essential to development of superpowers. Why allow private individuals or groups to basically create their own WMDs?

************** In my world, nations due have their own heroes but only commissioned a handful due to new arms treaties. Corporations decided to create more traditional superheroes as a marketing ploy and managed to eliminate legal responsibility for them while also holding them to the standards of ideal good samaritans by establishing them as nonprofit charities. They weren't effective altruists, but they got a lot of publicity and made sure to thank their sponsors.

When villains appeared, heroes had already earned the trust of the public by saving lives and fighting more mundane crime. The issue of collateral damage went nowhere since the villains usually started the fight and heroes were very good at presenting themselves as someone who just showed up to help. Whenever a hero did screw up or commit a crime, their sponsors would just take their powers away and replace them.

The government allowed the infrastructure to be built in the first place as part of regular R&D, and outright nationalizing it would make for bad press in the international community. Governments don't buy things just to keep them from being used, and companies are already being watched since they're defense contractors.

The first superheroes would have to be low powered with abilities that aren't directly offensive. They'd probably start off handing out powers like invulnerability and flight, which can't legally be considered weapons. Once heroes caught on, the government would hash out permit and registration laws.

** I've got a story idea.

In my world, there is an Eldritch Abomination at large in the ocean, every person is aware of its existence. In fact the biggest tragedy of the world had happened only because humans had attempted to kill it once. The disaster was so big that it had killed off 80 percent of the entire population and sent a civilization on the cusp of the Singularity back to the medieval ages, technology wise.

Modern technology still exists but is treated as artifacts of an arrogant culture that didn't know its place. There are churches of said Abomination.

And there are a group of people that believe that the abomination was sent to halt the development of the human race because somewhere, something was /scared/.

Obviously I need to hammer out the details and stuff but I think the premise needs some tweaking before that.

Edit: The majority is heavily indoctrinated by the abomination's worshippers from childhood.

Honestly everything from this point forwards seems to deviate from the core of the setting.

Do you want the major source of conflict to be the discussion between allowing the Eldritch Abomination to roam freely(with occasional high number casualties I expect), versus trying to destroy it when the retaliation potential is far too big? Or is it about pulling out a twist to surprise the reader?

Because if you reveal the truth in the status quo on the beginning(like you did here) then the reader will be slogging through descriptions of the society that do not address the main problem. If you pull it somewhere along the 2nd act, then it's sort of only a grimdark twist "if you try and kill it, 80% of the world will die like once before" isn't as impressive as it sounds in story terms because it's such a huge impact that it loses all meaning, you can get the same effect by scaling it to a nuclear explosion level of destruction of a single city for instance.

Also, this might be because I've been reading [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=32341][Shamus Young's Final Fantasy X retrospective lately]], but it really reminds me of its themes? It's not necessarily bad, just a point of comparison to keep in mind.

This wouldn't require industrial agriculture to sustain, but would still require like, really good agriculture and cusp-of-industrial-revolution tech. People might compete over resources.

Another source of conflict might be religious wars, which are always a classic. I doubt the Catholic Church would take the ascension of a bunch of devil-worshippers/heathens well!

** So I like some ideas from Naruto and want to homebrew a setting that has those ideas but not some of the other ones.

The ideas I love in Naruto:

#+begin_quote
  3rd generation warfare in a medieval setting. You have small highly trained armies like in the modern world.

  Jinchuriku are human atomic bombs.

  Intelligent ninja animals.

  Lot of throwable weapons. The fights in general are close and personal, not the bullets from 500m away like in modern times.

  Clans and a highly devolped biology understanding.
#+end_quote

Things I hate:

#+begin_quote
  Shonen power levels. Tailed beast should be the most powerful unstopable thing around. No exceptions.

  We have electricity and computers but still use knives to kill each other.
#+end_quote

So let's make a working setting out of it.

My ideas so far:

#+begin_quote
  Normal word with humans

  Thousands of years ago 9 tailed beasts appear. They are natural disasters that sleep for decades and then go on short rampages destroying everything they see. When they are tired rampaging they find a baby human and go sleep inside him. This baby human become a Jinchuriku. He now has a chakra sytem and a nearly unlimited chakra reserve. If jinchuriku is hurt of seriously enraged the biju awakens (partialy or totaly) and tries to eleminate the disturbance (sometime along with the city he is in) and go back to sleep.

  Jinchuriku descendants have also a chakra system but a more limited chakra reserve. This is how ninjas were born.

  Each Jinchuriku is particular and his descendants show variations in chakra systems creating a clan.

  This coninued for many years until 1500 years ago a great disaster wrecked humanity. In this adverse condition life was hard and many normal human died while the ones with chakra system survived.

  In current day 20% of population have a chakra system. Of those around 3% are from clans. The other are descendants of long forgotten clans. [spoiler]The disaster was introduced to explain how in such a short time a large fraction of population obtained the chakra system[/spoiler]

  In the last century many clans united in city states and created Hidden villages as we know them today.

  Currently they are at peace as all have jinchuriku and a MAD scenary is very likely. A common use of Jinchuriku in wars was smuggling him in the enemy city and then pocking him until biju awakesn and destroy the enemy city. Also using a jinchuriku this way makes biju go to sleep on enemy territory and basicaly gives the enemy a new Jinchuriku. This offers intresting warfare tactics.

*** I have never seen Naruto, but I have an idea of how handle the intelligent animals that could also explain the unusual mix of technology. If there are at least some animals that can communicate with humans, they've no doubt voiced their grievances over our effect on their environment. As a resolution to a Princess Mononoke-esque conflict, there is an international accord restricting the use of industrial technology. It's been in place for so long, though, that reverence for nature has become part of culture and spiritual practice.

This means that post-medieval technology can exist, but the infrastructure necessary to produce it is rare since you need to reach an agreement with the animals before you build it. Even something as simple as a mine requires a lengthy process of ritual negotiation until the animals grant you access to their territory. Hunting is usually allowed, but restricted. Both humans and animals have rights to defend their territory from intruders, but pursuit or retaliation is forbidden unless they are acting at the behest of their social group.

A lot of superhero origins work the same way, it was just an accident that the company couldn't have foreseen and doesn't know occurred so they don't try to repeat it.

(it's been a while. don't remember if the corp finds the spider and returns it to its cage or not). In the Amazing Spiderman, at one point part of the whole plot was the fact that spidey's dad had made the radioactive spider stuff.
