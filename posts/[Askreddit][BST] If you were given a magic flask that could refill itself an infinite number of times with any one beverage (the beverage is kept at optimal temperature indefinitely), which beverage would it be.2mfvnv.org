** 100% ethanol. It's the most useful thing I can think of that still qualifies as a beverage.

The main bottleneck in this scenario is that you have an infinite /flask/ instead of an infinite /amount/. This means that you are limited to as much as can pour out of it in a given amount of time. To solve this, I would build a centrifuge with the flask pointing outwards. At 20g of centrifugal force I would be getting far more out of my flask than normal (I think 20x as much, but I don't know fluid mechanics).

Now you have several options. The simplest is to just sell the ethanol at bulk rates, somewhere around $0.70/liter. I think we con do better. One of the biggest obstacles to reaching space is that you need to have enough fuel to lift the payload the last bit of the way, and also the fuel to lift the last bit of fuel the last bit of the way (as well as the payload), and the fuel to lift that fuel (and payload), and so on and so forth until you end up with spaceships that are mostly giant fuel tanks so that they can lift the fuel to make the trip. This flask breaks that vicious cycle. Ethanol isn't the best rocket fuel and it need oxygen to burn, so it might be restricted to the first stages only, but it could still make for massively cheaper spaceflight.

...

Alternatively, exploit the "optimum temperature" clause to get free energy out somehow.

*** This is a good answer but I don't think 100% ethanol qualifies as a beverage, maybe a high proof drink like moonshine /may/ qualify but since it is illegal then the highest proof legal drink would be like 75%.

** /Any/ one beverage? You might want to narrow that down.

Right now I'm thinking it would be filled with water from the fountain of youth (the flask is already breaking rules, so I'll take a mythical drink).

*** Someone said Felix Felicis on the other one. Health Potion is a vialable option, though personally I'd go with Worm's Superpower Lottery Drink for the fun of it.

However, in the interest of breaking things, and if you're counting imaginary beverages anyway, you might as well choose to fill it with 'magic water that turns into/does whatever I want once I pour it out of the original container'.

Edit: That's totally a real, fictional beverage, it's called 'miscellaqueous' and is described in this work of fiction [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mfvnv/askredditbst_if_you_were_given_a_magic_flask_that/cm3xlpf][right here]]. Obviously the first things you'd produce are a coating for the original flask imparting invincibility and other useful properties, a tonic to do the same for yourself, and a spare copy of the flask (not necessarily in that order)

** A quick Google search provides a list of the most expensive liquids, some of which could be described as a beverage in that I'm pretty sure a large number of people ingested them on purpose at some point.

Blood is apparently worth over $1,000/gal, but more importantly it's, y'know, blood. Get it in O negative. Be a hero.

LSD is worth over $100,000/gal, but it's, y'know, LSD. Renegade option, I guess.

Mercury was also on the list. Not sure if it counts, or why anyone would choose it, but I felt I should mention it anyway.

Give any liquid a reason to be drunk and we are set. I declare drinking molten gold to be a novel form of suicide. Molten gold is now a beverage.

Or fill it with the worlds most expensive liquor and go into business.

**** Why would you use another companies branding for your liquor?

A flask pouring 24/7/365 is a very small amount of liquor on a business scale. If we are comparing it to any liquor made on a production scale (rather than the novelty super limited more-cash-than-sense type that are expensive because of a name rather than taste) you dont stand a chance in hell of affecting the price significantly.
