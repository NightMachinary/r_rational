***** Axe-vim without the initial a?

In practice, that's how it goes with languages that have lots of consecutive consonants. If there's a preceding vowel, you just sort of glom it onto the Xvim to make it pronounceable. Consider:

- "So," Xvim said eventually. (A line from this chapter.)
- Soaks vim said eventually. (A bunch of words that you can probably pronounce, individually.)

Once you've gotten the hang of that, you need to start being able to say "Xvim" at the beginning of a sentence. Just breathe in a bit first, and then say "Xvim" as you're breathing out. (Pretend you're saying "Axe-vim", but that the "A" is very very quiet.)

** So Cheese_Ninja [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/40dv1f/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_47_politics/cyth4rg][was right]] about souls powering ward scheme.

Also this chapter puts to rest all this silly Sudomir Time Traveler nonsense. Which is nice.

The million soul well could act as a power source of some sort, if souls continue to generate mana. Maybe Sudomir wants to harness this giant battery and become godlike?

Which gives me an idea that the time loop itself could be powered by something similar. Would a billion souls be able to power such a spell? Who knows, but it seems possible.

edit: +On the downside: dying near soul well will kill Zorian forever.+ wait, it can't be true. Zorian died multiple times in Cyoria, which is near soul well. How does this entrapment work with time loop?

**** That's the thing, this is another piece of data to how souls interact with timey wimey stuff. This one, however seems to contradict the running theory.

Zorian's current understanding (and I haven't seen good alternative hypotheses) is that at the end of the loop spell reverts all souls and the world one month back in time, except for souls with special markers.

Zorian and Zach have such marker, it instructs the spell to not revert their souls. Aranea could have been tagged by another type of marker that says "EJECT THIS IMMEDIATELY". This would explain how Z's keep their memory and magic skills, how everyone else don't and how aranea got killed.

Another effect would be that non-looper souls are protected from all sorts of damage. When you consider, a month is a not insignificant amount of time, during this time there are bound to be unfortunate people that get their souls in trouble. If they are not protected from this damage, this will affect future restarts. It makes sens that they are. They don't accumulate shaping skills, but they are relieved of any lingering damage.

This does run into a problem when Zorian and Zach have died multiple times during invasion. Their souls then go into the well, and then somehow they are still reverted to unharmed state, while other damage (caused by lich) is not reverted.

Maybe soul well takes significant time to capture a soul and by that time time loop ends. Then it is in question what's the timer. Maybe capture speed is a function of range.

*** To be fair, a lot of people besides me came to the same conclusion about using souls to power it. I was still wrong though, because I expected it might tie into the Iron Beaks. We still don't know how he's manipulating them.

It is interesting to theorize how the soul well interacts with the time loop though. Presumably Zorian's soul has been captured plenty of times, unless there's another function on the soul marker that directly prevents that.

I can't help but think that something is wrong with Zorian's current theories about how the time loop is functioning as well. Turning back time for everyone in the world seems highly inefficient, when the spell only really cares about the three (known) people in the loop. That Red Robe can forcibly exclude certain people from the loop, making them automatically die at the very beginning of it, should be a hint, but it's not quite enough for me to go on. That it was possible for Zorian to be added to the loop is significant support for his idea of how it works.

*** I don't think so. Perhaps Zorians soul was trapped up until the time loop restarted and then returned to its "host-body".

Red robe didn't trap souls, he destroyed them (I would think). Big difference. Even if he did trap them he, the container, doesn't reset with the loop whereas this 'battery' certainly would I think.

Simply put, the battery has a state at the start of a loop, with x number of souls trapped in it. Say y souls are in there at the end of the loop. Z= y- x. Z are the people who die during the loop, their souls all are no longer in the battery rather they return to their bodies (really they never left those bodies to begin with).

*** Zorian's obviously benefited from the exercises and brought various amateurs into the loop as well as experts, but he kept ignoring one of the most obvious people out of sheer dislike.

But he overcame his personal feelings for other things while he was trying to learn about soul magic, so it didn't make sense for him to keep ignoring Xvim, so I was really glad to see this confrontation/revelation finally happen. I suppose that's part of why the story is so rewarding -- I've known it had to happen and kept anticipating it; even now, I've only gotten half the reward (the reveal) and am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next chapter (Xvim's reaction and help, hopefully).

**** It could need significantly less. If it was, say, ten thousand souls, that would be common enough in a magewar filled alternate medieval setting (anytime a decent sized town fell or a battle was fought) that it wouldn't be possible to tell which one fueled an enlichment.

The excess power could be used for other things. That this is what is fuelling the time loop doesn't work in my mind - it's in the loop, and it can't duplicate the souls, so everytime the loop resets, the souls of all those killed in Cyroria go back to the people who have them.

All it has then are those who died near Iasku Manor.

What it could be is the power source needed to summon/awaken the Primordial. THAT seems like a thing that could benefit from massive soul sacrifice.

***** It could be that the looping mechanism only needs a power boost at the point where it resets. And, handily, every time it resets it's after the invasion has killed a large number of people with an open gate nearby. When one of the loopers dies early they don't immediately reset the loop, the marker just keeps their soul around until the loop resets after the invasion.

I'm not saying it's likely, just that that's one way it could work.

************ You were right- From Chapter 39:

"I'd strongly recommend against that course of action. As for making it your familiar, keep in mind that it takes a long time for the soul link to mature and that you need to be close to it the whole time. There is no guarantee that the creature won't kill you during the process. And if you do manage to slave it to your will, it could still be dangerous to everyone around you who is not protected by the soul bond."

*** I just wrote one then for the hell of it. It checks for a new chapter once a second indefinitely and stops when it comes out. It's simple right now but there's no need for complexity when there is a known schedule. I'll turn it on the night before the next chapter comes out.

It was surprisingly easy in the end. 16 lines long, 11 if I remove the variables and set them in the functions, 8 if I get rid of statements reporting when it did and did not post, 7 if I combine some functions.
