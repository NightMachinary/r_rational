*** The proper contraction in that situation is 'tis, pronounced "tiz".

*** No, it's grammatically invalid, there is broad linguistic agreement on this point. The word "is" has multiple meanings, and only some of them can be contracted.

**** Are you saying that the word "is" has different meanings in the sentences "Yes, it is" and "Yes, it is raining"?

***** Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. In the terms used in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory][X-bar theory]]: In "Yes, it is raining" 'is' is a verb, and in "Yes, it is" 'is' is not a verb; it is an inflector, and the verb phrase is elided.

(X-bar theory is now a minority view, but its terminology is more clear for this purpose.)

****** Meaning is perhaps not the right word, it's a grammatical difference not a semantic one.

******* Semantically, "to be" is essentially meaningless; it carries grammatical content only.

*** When I try to understand the instinct that makes me avoid saying "Yes, it's", the impression I get is that the word "is" is emphasized in the sentence "Yes, it is" and you shouldn't contract away a vowel that's emphasized.

**** Standard phonological rules for English specify that at least one syllable per word is emphasized, which means that by your logic it is impermissible to say "it's raining".

***** I don't have the phonological background to explain my intuition, but I am pretty sure there is some sense in which "Yes, it is raining" does not put as much emphasis on the "is" as "Yes, it is" does.

Of course, maybe this is totally off-base and I am inventing intuition that happens to match the grammar we get at the end.
