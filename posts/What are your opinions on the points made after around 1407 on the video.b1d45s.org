** Summary of the relevant chunk of the video: "hyper-rational decision-making agents" will have their morality eroded over time if they follow game theory too closely.

Response: Only if their time horizon is short. Game theory in particular and rationality in general tell you how to achieve whatever your goal is. If your time horizon is short (e.g. "how do I win this game of poker"?) then they will lead you to cheat / do sloppy work / etc. If your time horizon is long (e.g. "how do I win a game of poker every night for the rest of my life?") then they will push you towards prosocial behavior that demonstrates integrity and thereby improves reputation, as lacking reputation makes it harder to convince others to help you.

*** I think part of the problem is that people generally dont understand their own value systems and their relationship to morality and game theory. My theory is that there are actually four types of morality with different functions in society: Punish Defectors (eye for an eye), Reward cooperators (golden rule), minimize suffering, and maximize flourishing. Morality only cares about the outer game, not the minigames contained within the outer game. That's why people can be rivals with each other in the context of a board game but still be friends outside it. If you lose a minigame you've only lost a small amount of payoff, and your total payoff across all minigames can still be pretty high. I wonder if people who are poor sports or cheaters tend to be people who think they have a low payoff in the outer game so they try to gain as much payoff as they can anywhere they can get it, even at the expense of other people's outer game payoff.

Either that, or people whose outer game payoff is so high and guaranteed, they don't have to fear losing it anyway. For example, they're disgustingly rich, or they're very powerful, so people will pander to them regardless of how shitty they act.

There are always individuals who would harm others to get their way. Morality is not meant to prevent those people from existing, but rather to make sure they can't just do whatever they want, because all the other people will react together.

So yes, both reputation and law exist to channel people into behaving in certain ways, which are more accommodating to long term successful co-existance.

Well, what's your idea of a moral person? And do they actually exist?

I don't think a moral person is making those 'benefit' calculations explicitly. It's a different baseline in expectation for what will long-term benefit you, and different baseline for how much you care about other people.

In an ideal enforcement system, an intelligent, manipulative sociopath acts the same way as a naturally empathetic and moral person. In real, vulnerable systems, the sociopath looks for gaps in enforcement and takes risks to break the established rules, when they believe they can get away with it.

In the same situation, a naturally empathetic person fears being caught much more, as they surround themselves with people similar to them, and expect those people to stop respecting them if they're caught. They also surround themselves with people that they naturally care about, and so don't want to hurt.

My idea of such a moral person is someone who doesn't act from rational POV, but from their strongly internalized sense of empathy. To this person, acting immorally would not just be a betrayal of his ideals, but also a betrayal of himself, of who he is and how he defines himself.

This is the inherent difference between sociopaths and naturally empathic people. Sociopaths lack a conscience, which means empathic people have a conscience. They have an innate sense of right and wrong, which exists like an emotion separate from rational thought. Would a moral person, defined as a person who always listens to his conscience, to his empathy, do what you suggest?

I think so. I think the 'natural' feeling of empathy and rightness / wrongness only really considers the well being of people immediately around you. That person would also use the ring of Gyges to help themselves and the people close to them at a cost of people they don't care about - i.e. those that they don't interact with regularly. They may feel a bit bad doing it, but they'd find some justification.

^ elaborating on that: Given that you can't /always/ know that an action you'll take will hurt others, it is expected and right to have a twinge of conscience when doing something that /might/ work out badly for some bystanders, evaluate the tradeoffs, and sometimes do the thing anyway. A person who never goes against their conscience would have to never take any risks that involve anyone other than themselves, and thus humanity passes up a lot of value.

I consider that familial love and friendship, not empathy. At that range, it's not really selflessness. You /like/ that person, and you enjoy his presence. In a way, when you do things for him, you're really doing it for you. Families or groups of friends can act selflessly for the people within that group, but act selfishly as a whole against outsider. It's still kind of acting selfishly on a grand scale. Nazi Germany, for example,is the perfect example of people working for those close to them at the expense of outsiders.

Interesting . Everyone everywhere seems to accept that someone out there /has/ to be pure evil. People tell long stories of men with an 'unbreakable' will. This very sub is dedicated to the idea of a perfectly rational individual that completely minimizes irrational actions.

And yet, it's the being dedicated to /good/ that's hard to swallow.

I'm curious about that. Our conscience is our innate sense of right and wrong, yes? It /is/ our morality, so to speak, yes?

(Just a sidenote: I don't believe in 'moral superiority' at all. A man who never does good, is never considerate, always gives into his raw emotions, never restrains what he wants in consideration of others and never takes the higher path is not 'evil' in my book. He's just not good. )

************** I'm not involved in this discussion but I'd like to add the fact that your statement that humans have an innate sense of right and wrong sounds flawed to me.

​

Morality changes, always has, people in the middle ages found watching people being tortured and killed fun. Kids had games where they burned baskets full of kittens for fun. People used to leave babies they didn't want out in the woods to die.

​

If humans had an innate sense of right and wrong they couldn't have done certain things in the past like burn kittens for fun as kids (which are far more representative of innate human instinct and behavior than grown adults). Our sense of right and wrong is a social constructs that changes with time, culture and location.

​

Morality is a social control tool humans developed to dissuade people from acting in ways that are negative to the society they live in, and persuade them to do things that are beneficial. In a way morality needs an upgrade as far as how it deals with people you will never meet or interact with, it was not built with it in mind.

I can see where you're coming from, but it still doesn't dispute my points or my evidence.. You'd need a lot of evidence in favor of it existing, more than of it not existing.

The evidence is against it, we have innate systems that help us build friendships and live in tribes of around 150 people, true but that doesn't mean we have innate morality. No matter how much of those traits we pretend they could have had.

Science doesn't deal with 'ifs' it deals with what is, and was. When we start asking 'what ifs' it becomes conjecture.

************ Empathy has four major flaws as the basis for a morality system.

1. It's prone to identifiable victims. It spotlights individuals, and encourages you to ignore others. It's not good at handling large scale issues, it handles local problems in front of you to the exclusion of larger issues.

2. It's biased towards people who are similar to you, of the same race and such.

3. It's very easy to become an empathy maximizing utility machine. For example people tend to give a little to lots of hot button charities, because each gives them an endorphin boost.

4. Emphatic people tend to be more violent and willing to hurt others to indulge their emotions. For example, anti Islam hate based on stories of Muslims raping people of the same race leads to people wanting to beat up random Muslims.[[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/the-violence-of-empathy/407155/]]

One average white collar crime, on a mathematical scale, is worse than 3 years of weekly bank heists. Yet it's clear white collar crime is rarely even reported, let alone prosecuted.

The system doesn't disincentivize crime. It disincentivizes being poor. Lower criminals get the stick, criminals higher up not only rarely get the stick , they get /a lot/ more tools and influence to balance the little punishment they get.

The social structure supports the social structure, and the great divide supports the greater division.

** While a goal might be rational, and you might use rational strategies to achieve that goal, becoming so obsessed on achieving that goal that you ignore any other consequences of your actions is irrational by definition (but sadly, not uncommon). That's why so many people who identify themselves as "rationalist" also identify themselves as "utilitarian": if you pretend that the only consequences of your actions are the intended ones, you're deluding yourself.

To put it another way... I'm going to define "ethics" as an optimal self-consistent moral code, defined such that every person benefits from every person adhering to it, and such that the most good comes to the most people by doing so.

If someone tries to pursue a goal, even a noble one, but disregards ethics in that pursuit, then that is harmful to society, both through the breach of ethics itself, as well as the example it sets for other people striving to achieve goals. The rational thing for society to do is to remove any incentive for defaulting on the ethical obligation by taking away whatever they've achieved, and, in addition, apply punishment so that the person is worse off for their lapse.

If you do that, then a rational actor would price the removal of achievement and the disincentive into their decisions, and continue to adhere to the system of ethics.

We, and the characters in "Billions," don't live in a world with such a well-defined ethical system (yet), but something resembling it is still there, and, whole I haven't watched the show, it sounds, from that video, like it's those societal disincentives that are punishing the characters for their moral lapses and obsession with achieving their goals at any costs. If they're not pricing that into their decision-making, then, however rational their goal, they're not really behaving rationally, even if the methods they take to achieve that goal adopt the trappings of rationality (e.g. game theory).

(but maybe later I find out that you thought I was someone else that did hurt you, and that might change it!)

Whereas if someone say steals something of yours, or hurts you or a family member in some way, and you become angry and seek their punishment (either through authority or directly through violence), as long as the punishment is not too out of line with the cause, I don't think you're immoral.

Concretely: if someone steals your wallet, and you grab their hand and pull them to the ground, get your wallet back, and then kick them out of anger, I don't think you've acted immorally. If in the same scenario after getting your wallet back you shoot them dead, you have.

Cause for hate is more complex. Let's call hate a prolonged, 'cold' anger that influences your incentives without inhibiting your planning ability. (when you're furious, you don't plan very well) Hate can still be warranted - I don't think it's immoral to hate murderers, or people who exploit entire communities, etc. Of course there is a certain burden of proof - you have to have good reason to believe the target of your hate is actually responsible.

It's a tit-for-tat-like deterrence mechanism.

If someone says something awful and hurtful to you , is it alright to punch him in the face? Is it alright to insult his parents?

Aren't the two actions unjust, more than the actions that caused them, an overreaction? But don't they come naturally to everyone? Are they not, understandable, despite being immoral?

If someone says something sufficiently awful and hurtful, with direct intent, I think can be just/moral/acceptable to punch them in the face. But not injure them severely, or not if you're a trained martial artist, etc. I don't think I'd ever do it myself, because it's... low-status?

Of course this depends on the details. In general escalating conflict is always suspect, but sometimes you have to make a stand.

Have to? Is that a normative statement?

Is this coming down to emotions now? Acting on anger is justified when you /feel/ it's justified? Don't you feel that EVERY action is justified when you're angry? Thus when someone commits an action you deem 'unjust' while they were angry, didn't that same action feel just to them, while they were angry?

If we were to excuse certain punishments that were worse than the crime doled out in anger,then what's stopping people from avenging murder with murder and returning to the revenge killings and family feuds of Romeo and Juliet? After all, the punishment is equal.

No, I don't think it matters whether you thought it was justified while being angry. It matters whether it was justified, and you should obviously not act on marginal cases where you can't quite tell if it seems justified because it is, or because you're angry and blowing things out of proportion.

How do you evaluate 'worse than the crime'? I don't think that punching someone in the face is necessarily worse than everything that people can do to you with just words. And there's an obvious difference between reacting in a moment because no better solutions are available, and premeditated murder for vengeance.

One is illegal. And of course, you're automatically assuming best case scenario. Even just taking this instance as precedent, sets up obvious loopholes. What determines what words are harmful to a person?

Does it depend on the victim? Can a person decide certain words are harmful to him without informing anyone else and then go around punching people in the face for saying that word? How can one prove that a word offends someone other than the victim saying it does?

Or does it depend on the intent of the person behind the insult? On whether that person meant to hurt you?

Perhaps while you may find it offensive, but maybe from his culture, or upbringing, such words are normal and regular, or he just overestimated how close you two were. There are a variety of ways the person may not 'deserve'to be punched. How can one prove that a word was seriously meant to hurt someone, other than villain himself saying so?

Do we set little loopholes for every individual case? For considering friendship, analyzing intent, and comparing the chemical about physical pain to emotional pain registered in the brain? Or do we throw it all out and make case by case value judgements?

"Key Takeaways

Tit for Tat is a game theory strategy in which each participant mimics the action of their opponent after cooperating in the first round.

Tit for Tat can be used in games with repeated moves or in a series of similar games.

Tit for Tat emphasizes that cooperation between participants produces a more favorable outcome than a non-cooperative strategy

The retaliation is used to bring outliers into cooperation, whch is the most successful method for the group.

**** Punishing defectors in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is something that will help everything stay as cooperative as possible. It's best for everyone to cooperate when they're in it for the long run, but defectors should still be punished so there is a big negative incentive that pushes people further away from defecting. Plus, if someone murders another person in the real world, it usually isn't considered immoral to put him in prison (assuming the prison system isn't overly abusive).

****** Um nope, not external influence, the players of this iterated Prisoner's Dilemma include the entirety of human society. That prison and the laws that say who to keep in there were put there by the society that believes in punishing defectors (and that this is a good choice of punishments). The effectiveness of those efforts is another question, I agree that the US prison system at least is not good at the reforming aspect and makes it harder to get out of the criminal life. But that doesn't mean I think prison is categorically bad and immoral and should be totally abolished because I've decided Forgiveness Is Good.

I don't think I understand what exactly you've been arguing. As it's been said, Game Theory concerns itself with achieving the goals you set. And my goals involve not just my own self-interest, it also includes as many other people as possible also benefiting. And I think that the world is a worse place if cooperation is encouraged by punishing defectors that hurt other people, and that never ever punishing anyone for anything would lead to a dramatically worse state of affairs.

Punishment is unnecessary. We believe it is necessary because we want to sate our anger towards the criminals. In reality, it is encourage prisoners to actively connect with more harmful elements and our prisons actively leads to more crime. We should turn our prisons into centers made to change people into more productive members of society.

And, in case you missed it, the whole thrust of my post was that by simplifying the consequences of your actions down to the point where the prisoner's dilemma applies, you're necessarily excluding a lot of foreseeable but indirect consequences. Your strategy has to model the fact that it will change other people's strategies, which can't be easily modeled.

** Game Theory makes a number of assumptions, (which you should examine before using) and even in hypothetical scenarios, its idea of rational isn't necessarily the best way to go. All this criticism of Game Theory misses the obvious one: what do you value? Game Theory's recommendations of what to do are based the value you place on outcomes. (As well as everyone else's view, so you can predict what they do. If you see "following Game Theory" as bad, say, morally, then maybe you haven't taken into account the value you place on being moral/not being immoral.)
