** Don't suppose anyone knows how to get hold of an RSS feed for fanfiction.net stories? I've tried searching around and it sounds like they're removed the links to them, but that by constructing the right URL it might still be possible.

I want to follow this, but I know I won't necessarily remember to go and check on it, or check on a user account on the site, unless I can fold it into how I read everything else I subscribe to.

*** I made a site for this! [[http://feephome.no-ip.org/%7Efeep/m.rss_proxy.cgi][link]] source [[https://gist.github.com/7780150][rss_proxy.cgi]] (user interface) [[https://gist.github.com/7780157][rss_proxy.d]] (actual updater). (If there's exploits, please tell me instead of abusing them!)

About the AbortException thing, for some reason trying to load from ff.net used to run into an error at the end, so I just went for "grab all the data we can and hope it's enough". :shrug:

**** Well you're now my favourite person for today... I mean, it's only like 00:19am here, so maybe that's a low bar, but I think you're still a strong contendor.

*** Good question! The author promises to post here when he updates, but I don't know if that'd help you with RSS creation. Let me know what works for you after you find out, anyways.

*** I couldn't do that for stories, but you can get atom feeds for authors: =http://www.fanfiction.net/atom/u/<userid>/= (this one's linked from user profiles too). You can also use services like [[http://page2rss.com/]] that crawl through a page and notify you when it changes.

** Ok, I hit save. I should probably load this onto my Kindle if I actually intend to read it.
