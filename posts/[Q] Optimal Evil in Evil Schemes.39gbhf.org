So I'm brainstorming a magical girl fic that as opposed to Middle Schoolers in close knit groups in their various hometowns, its more of a JROTC & College Prep academy where the big one has come and gone and new students are taught to be model citizens and work in groups as opposed to training for the fate of the earth. Our lead got in on a scholarship when she transmuted her dying brother's soul into a stuffed animal, and her antag is an unknown entity being all dark and ominous and nebulous, transmuting people into stone when she wants to send a message and playing with memories and social dynamics when she doesn't.

Eventually, jig is up and she's revealed to be a core member of the group, a kind of cleric who is pissed that even in a world of super science and magic that can better unite the world, we still hate and piss all over each other for the crimes of being humans, so she denounces her "god," and plans a megaspell to petrify everyone on Earth and Lotus Eater them into their own delusions of grandeur.

How evil and/or sympathetic do I make this character, and what should be the mechanics of her Lotus Eater megaspell? I want her to be clever enough to be able to fool everyone into thinking that she's innocent, but I still want enough humanity in her to be able to almost get behind the idea of her removing agency from everyone else on Earth because she can't stand others fighting. Outside of the obvious "Am I doing this right, does this sounds fun." I figured I'd ask around about if the system needs to be more explicitly flawed, driving people to madness if they've been bad, isolation and depression for people not creative enough to dream up something that can entertain them for an eternity. Or is it enough for the lead to be against that plan because it would mess up the antagonist for life, doesn't want her to be the one to make that choice for everyone, and/or that sort of society terrifies her?


** Good vs. Good is almost always more compelling.

My suggestion would be to have the Lotus Eater megaspell be perfect. You want the reader to /almost/ feel some sympathy for the villain, especially if they're a known character who already has some sympathy. The petrification is terrifying, until it's revealed that the person that's petrified is living a life of bliss, and then it's just unsettling. (My personal suggestion, knowing nothing about the magic, is that you can play up your themes by having someone become unpetrified and /beg/ to go back to the life they'd had as a person of stone.)

The question then becomes one of free will, consent, and the nature of what's real, all of which are good things for a protagonist and antagonist to be fighting over, because there's not really a right answer. Introducing flaws to the petrification is just putting your thumb on the scale, and there's not really a need to do that.

***** See, I'd be willing to buy the Lotus Lord position if someone could provide /definitive/ reasons why moral reality /can be no other way/, and why there's no genuinely preferable alternative action for someone /trying to do good/ other than to Lotusify people.

Like, with a misprogrammed AI, ok, the AI has an autistic fixation on this one /fiction/, due to its programming. I buy that it is motivated to fulfill the fixation which was programmed into it. But that fixation on a work of fiction is not a /moral position/ -- it's not related to what people prefer for themselves and others on full information and reflection. It's basically just the fic's author inserting a conceit to help him show why programming AIs with harmless-sounding utility function is a Really Bad Idea.

So, like, a Lotus Lord /could/ just try /improving real life/ if they /didn't/ have some programmed-in fixation on a dream world of some kind. They could work to alleviate poverty, mediate political conflicts, fight gang violence, and just generally make living a rich, full life more preferable than taking drugs or any metaphor for taking drugs. In fact, with reality-warping, superintelligence, massive mana reserves, or any other commonly-attributed villain power, they'd have an easy time of it.

Or hell, they could just offer the dream-world /without the brainwashing, memory erasure, and compulsion/. [[http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/16/on-the-design-of-escaped-realities/][There's a decent argument that a /mediated/ dream-experience /which is understood to be mediated/ is closer to reality-as-such than an unmediated but low-tech delusional worldview.]]

****** I agree in the case of a general AI setting goals.

The strongest argument I've seen in favor of virtualizing everyone is that human bodies use up resources that would be better spent on computation, which isn't all that strong of an argument, and doesn't mean that everyone has to be in a "fake" version of reality (because there are layers of mediation).

However, in a fictional world you can bypass a lot with your conceit. In the OP's magical girl example, it might not be /possible/ to use the power in another way; if your only tool is a spell that petrifies people and throws them into their version of Heaven, then there aren't questions of using that power in another way. This is /slightly/ cheesy, in that your audience will see the conflict of choice that you've set up, but like a good hypothetical question, you can cut out the parts that are irrelevant to what you want to discuss.

Bit of a semantics issue, but the magic would more or less turn on the happy leaving the brain to figure out its new reality.

Mentioned in one of the other posts that I'm not sure of the difference of a sufficiently fulfilling lotus machine and just pouring on the happy if it could indulge everyone of every constructive and destructive desire with no consequence, so I might go back and forth. The mechanics is that the spell forces the brain to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to constructing a dream scenario the person happy, so maybe a little of both if not one or the other.

Assuming you are talking about the version [[/u/alexanderwales]] mentioned i don't really see any personal reason to object to it. The only part which is questionable about it is the fact that it is forced, but really how could it be claimed that the free will aspect makes it bad when the positive side is so great? i mean this is essentially heaven for the small price of free will. In plenty of philosophies that would still count as "good", which I think is what [[/u/alexanderwales]] was saying essentially, not everyone will agree with it but it really depends on the person's philosophy. And I hope you are not claiming that you have a proof that makes a particular philosophy the only one correct.

Uhhhhh....

- I don't see why I or anyone else should deliberately create "essentially heaven" rather than "actually heaven". If you can still come up with objections and uncomfortable nastiness in the background (such as, say, omnicide), then you still got it wrong.

- If we're talking about the same thing, you can have all the free will you want in that scenario. It'll be the free will of a small child on a playground, a free will without the contact with a larger, more global, more entangled reality necessary to make it properly meaningful, but it'll be free in the sense that nobody is actually compelling or even much manipulating your choices. You're just only getting options you're pre-guaranteed to like, to the point that it's solipsistic bullshit.

- Why not find or invent a Third Option to take rather than trying to make blatantly apologia-flavored arguments for an omnicidal robot (and/or magical girl. Context of "what [[/u/alexanderwales]] was referring to" is not clear)?

Because the difference is so minimal i really don't see why to bother. The main issue with the mentioned state is that people will be forced into it, if you have or don't have "free will" while inside is irrelevant because in such a situation you are effectively brain dead, in the sense that you will not bother doing anything even if you could.

Is this pointed at the author or the character? If the author then its asking for a different story where i don't really see a big issue with the suggested approach, or at least that particular part of it.

If the character then why invent a third option? the time spent on inventing a newer better spell is suffering\pain\death of more people which supposedly is something which you want to avoid. For it to be better to try and make a better spell you need to reach the conclusion that the net negative over this time is greater then the net negative for that one time ignoring people's wishes to place them in "heaven".

i'm not writing the story and generally am more of a nihilist so i don't really agree with the "good" or "bad" in the argument. All i can really say is if i heard someone planned this "imperfect heaven" spell i wouldn't be particularly inclined to stop them, unless I had a good reason to believe that the spell will not work as they think it will.

#+begin_quote
  The net negative over an infinite timespan is always infinite.
#+end_quote

i thought we agreed that once the people are already in the spell there is no real negative for them, nothing really to improve in any way that they will be capable of appreciating. the only real negative is in the fact that it is forcefully pushing people into that without asking them, which some would even say isn't that negative in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  you now have infinite undisturbed time to work on something better
#+end_quote

only if something better is possible and undoing the current spell will not cause too big of a negative compared to the possible positive in the "better" spell. In any case during that time there is still the not insignificant negative because you are not effected by the spell..

Anyhow the point is not so much that this spell is objectively good but instead that it really depends on your values, which is why it should probably count as "good vs good".

I'm sorry, but this sounds kinda... cliched. It could work really well if executed well, but that's a fairly big /if/.

For one thing, if you make your villain motivated by Free Will Makes Suffering, you end up with your heroines having to defend /precisely/ the shittiest conduct of regular people as a matter of principle regarding Free Will. This is despite the fact that most regular people would probably say "yes" to a "morality pill" (that conformed to their notion of morality, or even that used a fully naturalized grounding for its morality) that lets you do things like control yourself better and make better choices.

It's also irritating to get to a Final Battle between such a villain and the heroines, and all of a sudden the heroines are motivated by making a more moral, less shitty world /without/ violating Free Will, /when they never had any such motivation before and are really just rationalizing the status quo/ (paging /Slayers Try/). Then the giant Eldritch Abomination Kriemhild Gretchen (or Jasmine, whatever) is killed, the Lotus Eating megaspell is broken... and everything goes back to normal, /proving the villain right/.

If you want to make a conflict about Free Will, you can't leave it as "Anti-Freedom villain versus sinful but pro-Freedom heroines." You need genuinely /good/ people to hold up the cause of Freedom /on principle/ rather than /because they'd rather keep being shitty people/.

If your conflict winds up with the Evil Law Firm of Satan sending a note to the heroes saying, "Thanks for averting world peace. That really could've put us out of business", then the heroes'/heroines' side of the moral conflict was irrational.

I think I would phrase Ideological Evil as, "believes in his/her capital-I Ideology more thoroughly, with greater normative weight in terms of deciding his/her actions, than in what the audience will recognize as commonsense morality."

Ends of spectrum: unpopular public policy (mere I Did What I Had To) ... Nazis (Ideological Evil to the nth degree). And I really mean it about the Nazis: they were the ones who mis-paraphrased Nietzsche to claim that Jews invented morality to enslave the stronger races. An Ideological Evil character believes that morality, as a category or concept, /should/ be discarded, and gives their ideology as the reason.

The problem I see with having obvious "good" and "evil" sides are that any remotely rational villain will recognise that they are on the wrong side. The "evil" side has to at least look good from the inside. That way, the villain can be smart and reasonable, but when they critically examine their own side they find their cause is just. (It's different if the villain's character isn't meant to stand up to scrutiny - if the work is more lighthearted, or the villain is only ever in the distant background, or if they're deliberately characterised as powerful but not self-aware.)

When some people agree with the villain's ideology and/or his methods, then you know their position could convince a reasonable person - or, at the very least, a realistic one. Making the villain /more/ sympathetic than the hero is a mistake, usually one relegated to heavy-handed moral lessons. But the reader should at least be able to understand why the villain wants the things he wants.

Well of course. I just don't think that this necessarily means the villain must believe themselves to be /good/, in the sense that an outside reader would recognize as good. Lots of bad people in real life, for example, justify their actions using blatantly self-serving rationalizations, or even vast, rationalized philosophical systems designed to justify the statement that there's not /really/ any such thing as right-and-wrong, and /other people/ are just being delusionally irrational for having morality in the first place.

Eliezer's Quirrellmort is actually a very good example here: a lot of what he says makes him /sound/ like merely a very cynical person, but when you /listen/ and /take his words seriously/, he's actually saying to Harry and the reader that he considers moral compunctions to be for sheep.

There's also the fact that readers will sympathize at least a little with any character portrayed as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard][sufficiently /awesome/]], no matter their moral alignment. You really can write Wizard Hitler and his Wizard Nazis and make them compelling characters that people like -- Harry Potter and its fandom proved that.

Sometimes, Good vs Good conflicts are /unrealistic/: some people are evil, and self-consciously /evil/, because the evaluative algorithms in their head have outputted that morality is just a shitty thing to do.

They still don't consider themselves to be an evil villain, they just dismiss the entire notion of "evil villain". Granted, they don't consider themselves to be "good" either, so it's hardly a "good versus good" story.

At worst, people can recognise that history will hate them, that they're breaking the law, that they were placed in a shitty situation with no acceptable "right answer", or that their actions are evil by a standard of morality which they consider naïve and idealistic.

But I think a negligible minority of people in real life would consider themselves the Bad Guy in their own story. (Ignoring depressive misanthropes who think they're bad people but aren't actually.)

Excellent point! I hadn't considered that, but it's perfectly true. Villains can have style and class and still be compelling - even /likeable/ - characters, and their moral standing need not enter into it.

A good character, what we call a Level 1 intelligent character, needs to do what a real person would do in the same circumstances - meaning, what a real person with that character's experiences, personality, skills, etc. would do. If the story is not completely fantastical, then a few readers will empathise with the villain's traits. Some readers have lost loved ones, or have a sociopathic streak, or have had their dream crushed by an unfeeling universe, or at least they /can imagine what that would be like/. And such a reader will look at the villain's actions and say "Yes, that's what I'd do". You're right, the reader in question might recognise that such a decision would be wrong, or Evil.

It would be a fairly small proportion of readers who would sympathise with the villain to that degree, and an even smaller subset who would refuse to accept them as the villain and post "AKEMI HOMUCIFER DID NOTHING WRONG" on the message boards. But they should exist if the villain is a well-written Level 1 character and the work has a large enough fanbase. Their existence doesn't make the story good, but they're an unintended and hard-to-avoid side effect of a well-written villain.

I think it depends on whether you're using the terms "good" and "bad" to denote the character's own feelings on stuff, or in the more rigid way of denoting how the characters model /other people/ as feeling. I'm using them in the latter way, and in that way, plenty of people are self-consciously the Bad Guy /in how they know they affect others/, but they still have coherently human motivations for what they're doing /from the inside/.

So I guess we're not really arguing over much, and I dragged out the thread in semantic bullshit because, being a LW-y science nerd, I have gotten overused to considering the Outside View the /real/ view, with the Inside View being largely self-delusion in many/most cases.

I think we're agreeing vehemently on this point?

(On the subject of Homura in specific... I think I just fail to understand the metaphysics and metaphysics-based moral system in play in /Madoka/. Like, I don't consider Kyubee sympathetic /at all/, and while I do think /erasing Madoka's memories/ is clearly evil, I also don't think that Madokami was necessarily the optimal outcome. The show seems to be saying, "Bodhisattvas > happy mortals", where I (and Homura, apparently) don't happen to think being a Bodhisattva is all that great at all.)

************* I think you're right! Thanks for clarifying my own position to me, and I say that with complete sincerity.

I really just wanted to discuss how some villains attract apologists. Sometimes it's an intentional interpretation of the story (like you said, Ozymandias is an antagonist but may or may not be a force for good), sometimes it's reasonable but goes further than the author expected, sometimes it's just silly. But I think this distinction between Inside View and Outside View is a key part of it.

As you've surmised, I have the two perspectives the other way around: I consider your Outside View the ambiguous and subjective view, while the Inside View is the definite and objective one. To put it another way, "X is a good person" is a subjective statement, while "X considers themself to be a good person" is an objective one. Arguing about the Outside View is almost sure to devolve into semantics and arguments about absolute morality or the lack thereof.

I don't actually know anything about /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/, I was just repeating what you said.

*** I agree with all of this.

Consider a group of people turned to stone will live indefinitely (especially if the magic can be altered to ensure it). So there will be no death or disease any longer. There is no real need to have people's fantasies isolated from each other either. So the character that cast this spell can do so from some very good motives.

Those who want to stop them must do so because they believe that free choices that change the real world are better than living a false life. More importantly, they have to defend this even though people are dying, sick or violent.

If anything, I think that the job of the heroes is actually a lot harder. After all, the villain is really offering a critique of current society and the hero. Their claim is that the hero is really only interested in preserving the status quo and that they are the real hero instead. The "hero" is really just a punch-clock villain ready to defend their ordinary lives. So the hero needs to show that this critique is either wrong OR they need accept it and change their behavior.

I don't want to immediately shut you down by saying that is not how the made up magic works, but I kinda wanted to explore the idea of solipsism heaven verses our collective reality, and the villain in question doesn't want shared experiences as either it may break the illusion, open up the harrassment issues we have in current society, or expose how nasty we truly are to one another once there is no barrier between our thoughts and other. She rather run a museum than a zoo. Irrational, I dunno? Understandable, that's what I'm asking for.

***** That is fine. The other elements I pointed out still apply.

The problem with isolation like that is that there is a easy problem with it. It is quite possible for people to notice that there are no real people besides themselves. Effectively, you gain immortality at the cost of permanent social isolation. But social isolation is also known as solitary confinement (in prisons). Long lasting solitary confinement is very bad for you and causes a lot of suffering.

So you have two options. Either she needs to add "false" people that are indistinguishable from real ones (Turing test people) OR she is not really solving the suffering problem that she claims to be solving.

****** Yeah, that isolation aspect is why the wrinkle that I'm currently looking at, either through the spell forcing the brain into doing the heavy lifting on entertaining itself, putting them into an altered state of mind, or doing what another redditor suggested where they're preferences are altered to enjoy isolation or are made ultra sensitive to reality. I wouldn't put it past the villain to get tunnel vision either, maybe valuing conflict-avoidance over the lives she's saving if she gets cornered and afraid, then send every mind to their rooms without supper. But again, speculation. I learned a lot here, will get back with y'all if anything comes of it.

End on a more melancholy note where the spell backfires on the caster when the power of friendship is introduced, and while the magical popo try to unpetrify her for questioning and punishment, her friends try and rationalize what just went down, who was right and who was wrong, and end with the Shin Sekai Yori ending of "this is our world as it is and we will try to do better?" Or is that just lip service in your opinion?

Actually, I think "We will try to do better" is an entirely valid moral. You just have to show people genuinely trying to do better.

What might be useful here is to have /three/ factions:

- One conventional set of fantasy heroes, conservative to the core (in the sense of preserving the status quo, because they think the status quo /is/ The Good, as fantasy heroes often do). Lawful Good, to the point of sometimes being Lawful Ideologue.

- One nonconventional set of heroes, of radical orientation. They are shown to be really, genuinely acting to improve the world and the lot of people in general, but since they're True Good they can't take the easy way out by riding off into the sunset when monsters have been killed (like some Chaotic Good characters) /or/ of always supporting the establishment (like Lawful Good). They have the toughest uphill battle because their values require the most hard work.

- The villain(s), who view the radical heroes' struggle as useless and the conservative heroes' actions as actively harmful. They want to just petrify everyone into bliss. They justify this on grounds of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight?from=Main.AndItWorked][And It Will Work]].

Any pair of these two factions might oppose the third, depending on the situation, and for interesting reasons.

****** A variant on the above for you -- this is an idea that I came up with for Team Anko, but feel free to use it.

Two or more groups, all of whom have access to the same information but interpret it differently. Maybe there's a spell that will Lotus Eater the planet and it can only be used when the stars align for five minutes once every century, the way they will next Thursday.

One group believes that the spell will create a separate lotus world for each person, therefore everything people do will be pointless because it will be solipsistic. The other group believes that the spell will put everyone in a mutually shared lotus world where experiences are just as valid as in the real world because they are shared.

Both groups have all the information, and it all supports either view, No one is being reckless or stupid; they are all very smart, have put in lots of time and effort on research, have done whatever experiments are possible, and they are confident that their version is true.

I can come up with other interpretations that would support three or more groups as well, so you might put that in the hopper.

EDIT: I should add that the idea for Team Anko isn't explicitly this Lotus World thing, just that it has the "both sides could easily be right" bit.

** Ooh, you can transform people into other things and their sould are attatched to them? There are opportunities for some /excellent/ transhumanist things there, even if there are drawbacks.

I think you're right; the "villain" is /too/ right. Destroying or preventing Utopia because /freedom!/ is a well-worn cliche, and (IMO) incredibly unsympathetic in a protagonist. On the other hand, you don't want to give them a good plan and then bolt on a stupid downside.

Here's my suggestion: there's no Matrix. The Petrified don't dream, and they certainly don't live in a perfect Lotus Eater world. Rather, they're fully conscious, but blind, deaf, and dumb - and their soul/mind has been altered so their preferences are OK with staring at darkness forever.

The brother is a bit of a Pinocchio where it's inconclusive if he his the lead's brother in the form of an animated stuffed animal, or a representation of his sisters thoughts and memories with a new kernel tossed in. Think FMA if Al was never sure if there was a difference between Al and the Almor. His body is in stone storage though until it can be cured, and the cat memories could always be transfered back in, but he tries not to dwell on the identity thing and just be a supportive brother who is also a stuffed cat.

The petrification spell is an entirely different animal though, that locks you in your body, keeps you alive and turns on whatever makes you happy. I don't know if there is more than a semantic difference between "whatever makes you happy" and "making whatever happy," but I'm willing to hear you out if you have a good reason as to why one works better than the other for long term happy making.
