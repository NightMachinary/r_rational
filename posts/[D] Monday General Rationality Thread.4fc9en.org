Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Another story from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4eb2md/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d1yxt6h][my ongoing adventures in the day clinic]]:

The most amazing progress has been happening. My brain rather suddenly updatet from alieving that it is stuck in a child-like state that needs to be afraid of /everything/ to alieving that I am now an adult.

Tasks that were previously were hard for me are kinda easy now, and I am rather happy as a result.

** It's currently recommended that you not let infants watch television because of the risk of attentional problems and slowed brain development in regards to language and vision.

I'm not a hundred percent convinced of this, especially since there are studies like [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042392/][this one]] which contradict that wisdom. There are a lot of confounders, since there are a lot of things that are likely to be different between a child that watches a lot of television and one that doesn't. For example, I would expect that this divides along class, education, and wealth lines. In general, I find the state of early childhood science to be quite lacking.

However, if I'm going to follow the advice to limit television exposure /anyway/, because while it might not be detrimental I wouldn't really expect it to be beneficial and there's little risk in limiting television time, I'm left curious as to what mechanism might be at work there. Would we expect radio to be equally bad? Podcasts? Talking to children is supposed to be good for language development, but is it the component of interactivity or just hearing the words? (I think my biggest problem with trying to find out the answers to these questions is that so many of the results are idiotic blogs that are content to make assertions without backing them up.)

*** The perhaps more insane part is that early childhood science isn't the only area where these answers are lacking. It's still not clear how anyone goes about learning a language, including adults. Even a simple question like, "Is there any language learning task X such that, if I keep doing it, I will learn this language to fluency?" appears to have no definite answer. There are a lot of people with different ideas (such as conversation or comprehensible input, which both beg the question of how precisely you begin comprehending or conversing -- and if you converse using only Pimsleur phrases back and forth, how could that possibly help you learn the 99% of the language that cannot be represented in such a constrained format?), and is FAR from being settled at all.

If deliberate study is needed (again: we have no idea if it is) then can this be done without another human? Unknown, because we have no idea /what/ the deliberate study would entail. If we design a task that we think will allow people to learn a language a la Pimsleur, there is an additional wrench that /clearly this is not how children learn./ So we're back at square one.

EDIT: My two cents: I've been learning Mandarin, and I've found flash cards useful. Popping an infant down with those would be... I don't know. Everything is an experiment in this area, but like I said, I find flash cards useful for increasing comprehension in real life scenarios that occurs at much fast speeds and in different contexts than the flash cards.

**** Well, here's the theory behind impairment of visual development, which I think makes a good deal of intuitive sense:

Normally, a baby hits some object with their poor motor skills and watches how it reacts. From that, they begin to build up an intuitive understanding of physics, just like our savannah ancestors did. The rules are easy to learn, given lots of examples, and eventually the baby understands physics.

Television doesn't follow physics. For one thing, it's all two dimensional. For another, there are a ton of cuts and fades. If a baby is watching bowling on television, he might see one shot as the bowler releases the ball, then a shot from a different angle as it goes down the lane, then a /third/ shot from behind the pins as it makes a strike. Adults can follow this, but the movement of a regular ball in the room with him would be confusing enough for the baby. The baby not only doesn't understand what's happening on the screen, it actively hurts his developing sense of physics, because he's getting fed information that conflicts with the other rules his brain is learning. This results in an overall slowdown of him learning rules.

But nice sounding theories aren't what science is about, so maybe that's just totally wrong.

As far as language learning goes, it might be that the extra auditory input from television is harmful to development because it's so divorced from anything interactive; the baby can listen, but when they point to things off-camera and say words, the baby might be learning that those words don't carry meaning, in the same way that a baby might end up confused if you held up an apple and an orange and called them both bananas. It's not enough to just /hear/ language, there need to be some feedback mechanisms in place so that the baby can actually learn; otherwise the baby learns that there /is/ no feedback from that stimulus, or gets confused about what rules are in play. Further, a baby watching television gets exposed to a /huge/ variety of accents and dialects, which might hinder development by obfuscating the rules.

At least, that's how I would steelman it. Needs more evidence though, and early childhood stuff is notoriously difficult to ethically test given consent issues.

***** I'd say that this applies to children below the age of 5 if at all.

There's a minimum level of comprehension that you need to make TV a useful resource for learning a language (a few hundred words and basic grammar); and even then it kind of depends on the type of show.

I'd expect research regarding how adults can learn a foreign language without access to study materials to have some useful information about this, assuming it covers media.

I can tell you a bit about how I learned English, but it's not really proper research.

Have you considered that watching TV might not necessarily hurt language development, but that these children simply lack other useful activities that would have been done in that time? In addition, there's also the possibility that early on in an infant's life there 's a crucial time where they can get a massive leg up compared to their competition by engaging in interaction instead of watching TV.

If tv shows are designed now to constantly flash new things on screen to hook peoples attention, then it makes sense that you would lose ability to intentionally focus your attention.

I have not seen the current state of modern childrens shows, so I have no data to back this up.

I read a study in The Economist that looked at the impact of the rollout of Sesame Street across the US. It didn't go national all at once so the researcher was able to see what impact it had. Turns out it increased the school grades and adult IQ of the kids who were exposed.

So an example of TV being good.

Unless totalTV stayed the same and it was just SS instead of Giligans Island which made the difference. Both could have lowered IQ but SS by not as much?

***** Words carry a lot of hidden information, and whenever a word is used to describe a thing that only meets some (or none) of that hidden information, it is less useful.

For example: Is this particular ostrich a bird? (alternatively, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/][is a whale a fish?]])

A "bird" is defined as a member of the class /Aves/, and an ostrich is a member of that class, therefore this ostrich is a bird.

The second question is how useful knowing that the ostrich is a bird actually is. If I knew nothing else about ostriches, I could make the following predictions with relatively high certainty:

- It has four limbs (two legs, two wings), a beak, is endothermic with a four chambered heart, and lays eggs if female. (True)
- it has hollow bones (Partly true)
- It can fly. (False)
- It is larger than a golfball, and smaller than a toilet. (False)

Describing an ostrich as "a bird" is less useful than describing a duck as "a bird" because it matches less of the hidden information about what "a bird" is.

(Sorry for stating the obvious, if I am. I'm not sure I interpreted your post correctly either.)

Incidentally, I would certainly consider Mistborn to be rational fiction myself, for the same reasons Rhamni pointed out.

******** [[/u/Dwood15]], [[/u/Quillwraith]] pretty much said what I was trying to:

(Mistborn spoilers below)

By the definition in the sidebar:

- Nothing happens because the plot requires it.
- The conflict is mostly due to factional differences instead of plot points.
- The characters solve problems with their brains.
- The rules are sane and consistent.

It meets those requirements fairly well.

On the other hand (repeating my spoiler warning):

- The characters actions are also driven by prophecy and the subtle and direct actions of two opposed god/elemental/people (whatever you want to call Ruin and Preservation, or Ati and Leras)
- Ruin is pretty much Evil. That /is/ its beliefs and values, and it /is/ what drives it into conflict with everything else, but still...
- No real complaints about how they solve problems.
- The rules are sane and consistent, but the actions of Ruin and Preservation can make them act less like physics (including magic-physics) and more like something people do.

I'd give it a solid B+ for how well it fits the definition of "rational fiction."

The second question is how useful is knowing that Mistborn is rational fiction actually is. (I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader.)

Doing meditation consistently and regularly is more important then doing it perfectly.

Well besides the obvious route, practicing meditation under states of duress, I've heard anecdotal evidence that that's a thing. For instance, building on the skill of "paying attention to something", I've heard:

- Falling asleep in seconds by force of will, by focusing on hypnotic imagery.
- Gaining control over various "autonomic" functions, like heart rate.

Frankly, I'm not familiar with the meditation literature, so I don't know how well this stuff checks out, or what a recommended progression would be... but you can worry about that a thousand hours (or at least a hundred) from now. There's a LOT of progression to be had in the basics.

I think this is more along the lines of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939454/][biofeedback]]. There have been studies that show meditation to help directly control heart rate, but honestly they don't sound like meditation to me [[https://www.theconnection.tv/use-mind-control-heart-rate/][like in this one]], where they ask participants specifically to pay high attention to their heart rate. I've gotten the impression they're related skills but if that's your goal, meditation probably isn't the most efficient route there.

Personally, I find the "body scan" technique (both links will teach this) useful to get into the mindset and then continuing much like MrCogmor suggested. There's also square breathing (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it in for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, repeat).

Last, some people suggest doing this before bed and if it works for you, great, but personally I found I started to associate it with sleep and would instead suggest trying it at junctures doing the day (just got home from work? 10 minutes).

Partly from his own stupidity. Partly. But also, and I do think this is what the author was trying to convey, /he wasn't even looking at the right scale/. The moral of the story was supposed to be that only Albus Dumbledore was actually playing the right game to begin with by considering the Larger Context Problems rather than the day-to-day political jockeying.

That, and ALICORN PRINCESS HERMIONE DID NOTHING WRONG, but that's just my personal and insistent interpretation.

If you're going to find fault with HJPEV using it, the fault is in him getting into situations where he needs a battle cry in the first place, not in choosing this particular one. If the only piece of information you had about a 11-year-old boy is that he used such a war cry while playing wargames with other children, you'd conclude that he's a fabulous chuuni nerd, not that he's a burgeoning Dark Lord.

I think that going all conscientious objector on the 11-year-old Ender-esque wargames and dedicating himself to something that actually matters in the long run might have been a better strategy, but the whole point of his character arc is that he's still a child at the onset.

Essentially, I'm referring to the fact that Harry acts in over-dramatic fashion without much apparent self consciousness. He also sees himself as someone truly special and acts correspondingly (as is typical with chūnibyō), but that's not as relevant in this particular case. From the outside he looks like an archetypical chūnibyō (even though he arguably doesn't fit, once his thoughts are known).

******** /Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chuunibyou][*/Chuunibyou/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote
  A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to "Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome". People with chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.

  This is a common stage in growth; for most people, it happens--you guessed it--around the 2nd year of middle school (Grade 8 in Japan). However, the problem is, there are some grown-ups who have this symptom.

  There are 3 main types of Chuunibyou. DQN-type pretends to be antisocial even though they aren't, or can't be and has made-up stories about antisocial behavior. Subculture-type prefers subculture or minor trends just to be different and have the "cool" factor. Evil Eye-Type admires mystical powers and pretends to have one of their own, to the extent of establishing an alias just for that.

  And if you think you have one of these or want more information in the subject, a good idea is to read the "Chuunibyou User Manual" (中二病取扱説明書, Chuunibyou Toriatsukai Setsumei Sho) by Saegami HYŌYA.

  If you [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr][tl;dr]] I'm going to clobber you.

What if mana was a resource like fuel, not inherent in any person, but rather around and in our environment, with certain areas where it would/could be gathered?

Then I'd use runes to interact in various ways with the mana, and different runes stacking/providing various effects.

**** That's part of what I'm trying to figure out, I want to figure out how I want mana to work in the series. And the conversion laws, being the laws of thermodynamics or newtons laws, etc?

Basically, mana is this pseudo-physical element, which has some special properties. In gas form, it can be interacted with via runes or stored in containers like any other gas, however, without runes on the container, there are some strange effects (working on that part)

Certain runes can initiate a 'burn' effect, where the mana is used up like gas and a bunsen or stove burner, and based on that rune, the "burn" can be controlled to cause different effects, such as a "cold" fire which actually reduces the surrounding heat in the area, or increase heat, one which generates electrical current or one which absorbs electricity, acting as a grounding line.

These effects would only be active so long as there is mana there to fuel it.

The design of the runes which channels and powers the mana would be similar to the way language works. You have a bunch of lines which make individual characters, and the combination of these letters make phrases sentences, and so forth.

Runes may be anything from 3d shapes, to carvings, to drawings on a piece of paper. Each medium will be able to create different effects, but these shapes which mana react to are going to be a natural part of the world, and animals, land features, plants, etc, will all have different reactions to these systems based on this.

What do you think about these rules? It's basically all i've got after a few days of thought on the subject.

It doesn't really matter whether you enchant a magic object with runes, words, rituals or magic crystals compared to whether magic items are uber-rare luxury goods, common upper-class items or household equipment and how easily they can be used for automation.

If you are trying to make a story then it is generally easier to alter a magic system to suit a plot then create plots suited to a particular magic system.

The magic system as outlined is fairly generic in tvtropes terms is geometric magic + background magic field + functional magic.

******* MrCogmor has some good points, but you also want to keep in mind the implications. That runes - human-created geometric shapes - hold the ability to define how a fundamental force is expressed implies something about the laws of reality.

For example, say if you were to uncover a cavern replete with mana, either the mana of the entire cavern or certain zones within it would group into the shape of what has become known and used as runes, each rune-formation affecting reality within a certain radius. Why mana groups into runes may have an answer similar to why molecules form in specific patterns. I find 'magical magnetism' an unconvincing reason, but it's convenient. However, magnetism itself has far-ranging implications on how the universe works, and so will your meta-force that defines how mana groups into shapes. Other suggestions might be emotions having a metaphysical and lasting impact on the earth and or mana, mana being an engineered force that is not naturally occurring, mana being an organism or domain of organisms rather than a force, etc.
