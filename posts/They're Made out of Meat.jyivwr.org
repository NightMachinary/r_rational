**** Featuring Ben Bailey. Personally, I choose to believe They're Made of Meat is a sequel to Cash Cab.

*** Including the verbatim rip of the original story that a guy submitted to our literary magazine my senior year of high school. We published it, I didn't realize it was plagiarism for years.

** So in order to be welcomed into the galactic community, we'd have to fully embrace the blessings of the Omnissia, but, on the other hand, that would mean we'd no longer be /allowed/ to interact with the galactical community in any non-genocidal forms... truly, a catch-22.

*** I don't think the Adeptus Mechanicus would be galactically acceptable. Remember that they run all their AIs on dead-meat servitors.

** I taught Middle School English last year and my kids really liked this story. I liked using flash fiction as a warm up activity; it gave the kids badly needed variety and let them practice skills on a quick variety of different authors. I actually got one kid to write a pretty good sci-fi story about a ship that crashes into mars told through audiologs without prompting or an assignment.

Of course, finding flash that was half as good as this made it a real problem. Two more the kids really liked were Riddle by Ogbewe Amadin and Felicity by Amy Rivers. Neither one of which are ration, but both are good fun.

** I like this story (and especially [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tScAyNaRdQ][this video adaptation]] of it) but it's off-topic.
