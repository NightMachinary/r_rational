** If y'all haven't read North's "The Midas Flesh", I highly recommend it.

The premise is, Midas is real, the entire Earth is gold (because its all touching his flesh), and aliens want to weaponize the flesh.

Its pretty awesome, and fits this sub fairly well. The characters are all relatively intelligent and act in believable ways.

**** Support your local comic book shop and buy it there!

It's a graphic novel, if I wasn't clear about that. It's awesome.

** But if she predicts that a killing will be successful then it will succeed, right? Because her predictions always turn out to be true. Her killer might not believe it will work but maybe he kills her by accident.

*** She can see the future, so presumably she can do something about the future she sees. Other people won't believe anything she says about possible future events due to the curse, so she can leverage the power of the curse to change what would happen, invalidating that future she sees.

This, of course, requires the assumption that the future she sees is mutable, rather than absolute. It would be a simpler solution to the conundrum, since the future she sees happening actually occuring despite information from the future would be by far more complex than the other possibility.

It seriously hinges on the rules of her future sight, but I would say it's a possible outcome, since the curse was that nobody would believe her, not 'she couldn't change the future', and Apollo wouldn't have given her the power to see the future in the first place unless it would be a useful power to have.

  It was a curse, dude. Apollo was cursing her.
#+end_quote

I'd say what the effect is called would be rather irrelevant to what it actually does... (There's a reason we have a trope in fiction called "Cursed With Awesome")

Regardless, in the original myth(There's a bunch of versions, but they're generally similar), she gained the power of prophecy(to see the future) by promising her body to Apollo. Depending on the version, when she breaks her promise, Apollo either applies an effect that makes people disbelieve her when she utters the truth about a future event, or makes people disbelieve anything she says, regardless of whether it's related to her future knowledge or not.

Either of these effects could be leveraged by a sufficiently savvy actor, which is what the comic is making fun of.

****** I was refuting the "wouldn't have given her a power if it were useless" point. Didn't realize I'd misremembered the myth, though the Dinosaur Comics version reflects my recollection.
