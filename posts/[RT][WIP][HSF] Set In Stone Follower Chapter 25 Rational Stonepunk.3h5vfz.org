** At this point, it seems like Allen has played his cards and is along for the ride. He's almost certainly revealed everything he'll tell about Albert's deal and the attack afterwards. Any moves he makes towards his attacker will almost certainly put Allen in a worse position.

I'm not entirely sure why we had such a long conversation with Doctor Sven. Probably Captain Marko or Stateman Urda will figure out a way to weaponize Allen's position.

*** I was trying to use the conversation with Doctor Sven to show growth under stress. In that conversation, there was no real winner or loser, but Allen did make Doctor Sven realize he was assuming too much. Unfortunately, in Doctor Sven's eyes, that realization was of dubious value, and Allen made those points accompanied by physical displays of anger which seemed to support the doctor's overall assessment of the situation.

No spoilers, but Allen's not done yet!

** I'm curious if it seems like the balance between Allen flailing and learning seems to be reasonable in the last couple chapters.

His emotions are also going every which way. Anyone have any serious issues with his emotions, or how he's dealing with them?

*** I don't have any issue with it, and it definitely makes sense, but the last few chapters have seemed to me to lack a sense of progress. Part of that is that not much time has passed, and part of that is that Allen hasn't really had a chance to get his bearings and his situation isn't really changing, just /intensifying/. This isn't necessarily a problem though, and I'm still really enjoying each new chapter!
