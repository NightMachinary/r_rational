** I really like the project so far. I get the same vibe from it as with "Rapture of the Nerds", "Accelerando" and other books I can't recall right now. In all, the protagonist stumbles through a strange hodgepodge world where everything is happening everywhere at once, where whole plot threads open and close again, sometimes within the same paragraph. I guess that could be a danger with this kind of narrative: The main thread can struggle to shine through all that's happening.

Two things: 1.) Is S.I. the final, official title? You know, renaming a TvTropes page would be so annoying. 2.) I always imagine Bunny much like the rabbit-person from Overgrowth. Is that visually accurate?

It's an issue I've been aware of since before I started writing, when I was just planning a simple road trip through various Adventure Towns. (Would you believe I actually did intend for Bunny to head straight in the direction of Phoenix, instead of, um, pretty much the exact opposite? :) )

It stands for a number of things relevant to the story (Self-Important, Self-Indulgent, Signal Integrity, System International, Science & Industry, etc), I haven't thought of a better title in a month, and nobody's made any suggestions - so it seems likely to stick.

  a TvTropes page

Anyone who wants to put one up, let me know, so I can stick up at least a placeholder page at a permanent address.

I haven't paid attention to that one since playing with Lugaru a few years back, but after a quick Google Images search, it seems pretty close.

** Awesome stuff so far. The 3 AIs helping seem a tad bit overpowered though.

*** They're an example of a technology that dates from after human uploading is created, just a couple of years before an event that's describable as a Singularity - 'a tad bit overpowered' compared to industrial-age cities is probably par for the course. That said, I do have some plans in Book Three that demonstrates not just their limitations, but outright vulnerabilities...

*** I haven't decided yet.

For comparison, I'd originally planned for the chapter I'm in the middle of writing to focus on a certain topic; but a minor detail I was planning on covering in about a paragraph has ballooned to take over the whole chapter for itself, and the protagonist is now making plans I wasn't expecting her to make.
