As I've previously mentioned, the Change Storms books are my "superpowers in the real world" series. I'm currently working on "Induction", which is #3 in the series, but it's standalone.

I've created [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/][a subreddit for the series]] which is currently showing [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/chapter_001.html][Chapter 1]], as well as two munchkin challenges: a character who [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3ic21z/mk_callsign_polarity_inverts_natural_laws/][inverts natural laws]] and a character who [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3ic1ap/mk_switch_momentum/][swaps momentum]] between two objects.

I'll be doing weekly drops of new chapters as they're written; they'll go to early-release [[https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs?ty=h][Patreon]] backers on Monday and everyone else (other Patreon backers, Reddit, mailing list) on Tuesday.

I'm setting up a proper website for the chapters, but there's been a tremendous amount of yak shaving involved and I decided I'd rather just get this out the door, even if it meant hosting it from Dropbox for now.


** The new project! Very excited to finally have this out the door.

** AWWWWWW YIS YIS YIS. MORE CHANGE! MORE STORMS! ahem So if get this right, the first two chapters you released, the lady senator and lady string hero, are part of a single story, and this SRD guy is standalone? Does that mean that his plot has no bearing on primary plot, or does he not interact with 2 MCs? Will read and report back on how it is later. And weekly drops? Hooray!

*** The first one (A Position So Fragile) was a prequel. The second (Acquisition) was the story of how Elly got her thread-straightening power. This one is set about three +days+ weeks after Acquisition, and continues with Elly's story. It's standalone in that you don't have to have read the other two to get what's going on.

**** Neat. Okay just finished reading. Has a couple of spelling mistakes. Forgot which ones, so use MS Word to find out.

Story is good, great teamwork and power combos. But I have to ask on what principles does the probability fail mode for explosives work? Because handheld booms are all chemical and the striking needle for the trigger is very big, so if the probs can cancel a chem reaction at that size, whats stopping them from canceling smaller things like parts of brain, cell structures and or the poison in their brain? or is that onl for nonliving things and normal humans?

Another thing i noticed was that Elly can keep thread powers for a few minutes after they leave her area of influence. This would be super useful as an artillery, missile and even crossbow (Foil mimicry) launching needles at high speed. Speaking of artillery, is there a reason there is no outside influence during the few hours of combat? And is the combat area almost always an acid trip made real? Which would explain alot.

Fixed, thanks.

Probability storms just sometime Do Wacky Things. Just like making invulnerable strings makes no sense under physics, so do the explosives fail.

Yes, Changed are much less susceptible to hot areas than norms are. That's why the military couldn't show up...well, that and the fact that there /aren't/ a significant number of line troops around there. I was very surprised, but none of the military bases that I could find around that area were actually combat soldiers. They're mostly supply, repair, and manufacturing depots. There's a base run by the Air Force that is a combination of the previous Macguire AFB, Army Fort Dix and...one other that I'm not remembering. (I'm away from my notes.) I wasn't entirely clear on that one -- not sure if it's combat troops or not. In any case, not a lot of firepower available nearby.

Yes, although there are some practical issues. First, it's threads, so they don't have a lot of mass, so they won't hit that hard. Without fletchings they generally won't fly straight, either. It could be made to work, but would require specific setup.

That's a fairly apt description. Generally when a kicker squad gets called in for a combat mission it's because the area's braun count is too high for normals and something that defies physics is about to do bad things. Areas with really high braun count get weird -- this area wasn't actuallh that bad, since the ground wasn't melting or turning into giraffes.

Combat missions against monsters are relatively rare, though. Kicker squads mainly get used for hunting Changed terrorists and doing the "rescue" part of search and rescue work, generally after a seeker squad does the "search" part. I'm actually planning some of that for either the next chapter or the one after.

****** I would find it kind of find it funny if "everything is animals" is a common enough symptom of Change Storms that there aren't actually very many endangered species left.

******* Heh.

I think the storms tend to kill more than they create, so probably goes the other way.
