This isn't so much to argue one site over the other as it is to adopt a common standard for the subreddit. For reference, the discussion was spurred [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/27csrn/hf_the_merchant_princes_series_by_charles_stross/chzvxzx][here]].

Sites suggested so far, in no paticular order (this list will be updated as necessary):

- [[http://www.goodreads.com/][Goodreads]]

- [[http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_stripbooks_deptiss_0_4?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=&sprefix=book%2Caps%2C181][Amazon]]

- [[http://www.bookfinder.com/][Bookfinder]]

- [[http://www.wikipedia.org/][Wikipedia]]


** In the event I choose to purchase a book, I prefer Amazon, so that would be my choice for recommendations here.

I agree with [[/u/alexanderwales]] that this sub isn't quite busy enough to have a rule, though a relaxed preference is probably a good idea.

** I'm only really familiar with Amazon, so:

*Pros*

- You can buy the book right away
- Verified reviews so that you can ensure the person making the review actually at least owns the book (see the rather famous case of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10394348-doors-of-stone][Doors of Stone]] on Goodreads having 800 ratings and 150 reviews despite not even having a release date yet)
- Usually has a preview of the first couple of pages so that you can see whether the writing style or content interests you (above and beyond the recommendation you get here).

*Cons*

- Region specific issues
- May not have the best price
- Amazon has an incentive to try to get you buying bad books
- Shill reviews (but you get those everywhere online that has reviews, and at least Amazon has some economic muscle to use as threat in particularly egregious or widespread cases)
- Amazon has a referral program that I don't know too much about that gives an incentive to excessive posting (probably not a problem with our size given how low the rewards would be though)

Now personally, I don't think there really needs to be a standard, because we're just not that large of a subreddit. By the general theory of online participation rates, a thousand subscribers means we have maybe in the dozens of people who will ever submit anything to this subreddit. Instituting rules increases overheads and reduces participation rates.

As a mutually agreed upon (as opposed to strict policy) standard, I would choose Amazon, since that's where I always go to see whether a book is really worth buying.

*** There are also certain ethical issues with Amazon. They censor books at whim, even after purchase - most flagrantly, removing copies of 1984 from buyers' ebook readers.

**** As a side note, Amazon owns both [[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/56575-amazon-buys-goodreads.html][Goodsreads]] and [[http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/amazon-to-acquire-abebooks/][Abebooks]] (which owns Bookfinder).

***** ... Hunh. I'd missed that, somehow.

Welp, I haven't got any further non-Amazon ideas, so I guess y'all might as well and go ahead and use whichever site you like.

***** That post is perfect in my opinion. It really is amazing when you look up the chain and you find almost everything is owned by just a handfull of companies at the top. A(lmost a)ll TV and Music industries at the top are owned by a dozen companies, which are represented by just 2 lobbies (MPAA, RIAA). Similar things exist with food companies too.

"You have the choice between Amazon, Abebooks, Bookfinder and Goodsreads. Amazon owns them all."

We have rules in order to (a) keep on topic, that being rational fiction, and (b) keep the quality of the sub up to ensure it's fun. We're small enough that (b) is basically not a problem yet; staying on-topic is enough - so we have characteristics of rational fiction in the sidebar, but no concrete rules. If soft power isn't enough we might think about more rule, but we just don't need them at the moment.

So post links about rational fiction wherever, and we'll deal with problems as they appear. But if anyone's unsure about the link - you can make it a self post!
