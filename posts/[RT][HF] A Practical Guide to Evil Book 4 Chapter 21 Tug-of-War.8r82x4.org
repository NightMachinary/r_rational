** I find the contrast here between political narrative and Story here really interesting, especially with Cat's ability with them. A prince pinions her pretty effectively by leveraging his understanding of the /political/ narrative, and she takes the hit without contesting it much. But as soon as the Pilgrim speaks, she goes full-on analysis mode, swimming through the shapes of stories easily.

I wonder, is this the influence of Winter on her or just her natural knacks and experience?

Also, what the fuck, Cat. Biting of your goddamn tongue. Think about what that looks like. You have to stick your tongue out into the space behind your lips and /bite/. There's no way to make that subtle, in a diplomatic situation where everyone's watching carefully. She was pretty clearly aware on some level what kind of intimidation factor that had - exploited it, even - but she barely even noticed it in her thoughts. Just sort of... /did it/. Never change, Cat. Your attempt to be less cheeky and shocking by biting off your tongue was probably the cheekiest, most shocking thing you could have done, and leveraging it to your advatage came so easily you didn't even think about it.

I love the idea of her making that last pronouncement with lips and teeth still stained red with her own blood.

Part of it is that she's in a better position on the political side than the Story. She can win the slow logistics game even if the agreement isnt great, but if there's a Pivot during the negotiations she's stuck with it

** Let's look at the potential impacts of this...

- Malicia is definitely going to find out about this, but the question is whether being it's a signatory constitutes rebellion or whether the intention itself can be interpreted as such... Both Cat and Malicia have /some/ room to maneuver at least, so that's probably fine, but definitely puts Malicia in an advantageous position with regards to Catherine. She can't really do much with it at the moment (Thanks Ashur!) but it will definitely come into play in their next scrying and Cat will have to be very careful treading these waters.
- Black and Malicia's current relationship is also similar to Cat and Malicia, which means he will eventually be an independent power in Calernia (assuming he survives the battle of the Vales). Cat's action here might give him precedent to do something similar with the Papenheim, but that's going to be difficult to pull off. Black views things practically so he probably would only see the joining of the alliance as a textbook "villain infiltrates heroes to gain advantage, maybe betray them later" move by Cat. He would approve.
- Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia. (Edit: Everyone missed my attempt at the "friendship broken" meme, FeelsBadMan).
- Hasenbach's position has just come under a powerful attack by that single line from Catherine. She will definitely have to reconsider a /lot/ of things about Catherine, decide whether she can even enter the alliance, and deal with the consequences of either decision. Both of which seem quite bad for her. Declining the request here and now rejects a potential villanous redemption arc and that would horribly weaken their side narratively. But allowing her in her Alliance also means acknowledging Callow as an independent entity and all the political bullshit that comes from it. Her life just got a lot harder.
- Army of Callow... she has their trust for now, but that will definitely see some shaking in the coming chapters. I'm guessing this is where the story will focus on, the loyalties of Cat's minions to her and the impact of this decision on it.

All in all that was a *bold* move by Cat. Can't wait to see how this plays out!

**** Malicia's reason for keeping the Gestalt was to have a means of getting to that negotiating table since Procer will never deal with Evil otherwise. Cat's background puts her in a perfect position to try to work a lasting peace between to forces of Good and Evil. Before Callow was merely the stage for the East and West to kill each other. Now, Callow may yet be the stage where Good and Evil finally settle their differences and seek a condition where they can prosper together.

... Psssshthahahaha, yeah like that would ever happen. The agents above and below demand blood and the grooves are too well worn into Creation. Still, narratively speaking, it would be a very nice ending to Cat's story if she could broker peace between the Principate and Praes.

She has lead them through hell and come out victorious, time and time again.

She is the final great hope for Callowan independence.

She, as the inheritor of Black's legacy, has orcs in important positions of power within the (often victorious) warband, and within her inner circle.

She has allowed the goblins to settle in Callow, and is close with several.

She's not joining the crusade and marching against Praes. She's not even joining the alliance with any sort of alacrity.

Cat has a full year to go back, or to spin this choice to her people. We don't know what she intends to make public.

What exactly is going to motivate an assassin?

Edit: I think you'll see dissent, and perhaps plenty of it. But if you look at what her actions will be doing, especially in the short term?

She beat the invaders down, with a numerical disadvantage. She defeated a crusading army, and forced them to leave without a speck of Callowan land.

Who exactly is complaining? The Army knows how badly it would have gone, to keep fighting.

The classic Hune objection is over the great loss of life and leaving the mortals to face down the heroes alone. The rate of attrition frankly has been unacceptable.

What makes me think that any immediate objection won't be coming from Hune is the fact that Cat went out of her way to sue for peace, when from the outside it may have seemed easier for Cat to press her advantage.

Might even win some points with Hune for it (fat chance).

Sooner or later though, the Praesi loyalists (to what extent anyone is loyal to the tower system) will need to come to terms with the fact that they serve a Callowan.

  There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark. Young Hanno would lead them, for the Seraphim had shaped him to the duty. As for the faces of the others, they could only guess. That charming young Valiant Champion was likely, as she'd followed the White Knight before. And there would have to be a practitioner. The most powerful of these was the Witch of the Woods, should she survive her confrontation with the Warlock. And the two of us, the Pilgrim added silently. Relics of an age already past, dusted off one last time. There was always a price to pay, to end the rise of Evil.

Regarding who'll join in the end, other than Akua I hope (from the perspective of somebody who is unironically rooting for theam Practical Evil) to see Hanno and the Bard on it. Hanno - because there're no other unaffiliated hero that could qualify as a leader in the sense of having "his own" agenda, and Bard - because, if [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/chapter-20-skew/][Thief's speculation]] is correct, then Bard's presence in the band would be a placeholder for the Valiant Champion (who'd hopefully get killed at the Red Flower Vales, otherwise we have a monster hunter facing the legions led by an orc, a vampire and a dragon). Also, Bard's presence and advice has a big chance to backfire for the heroes around her, after seeing the Bard in a new body Hanno and Akua would finally start asking questions, and Seraphim and/or Bard directly guiding the Crusade [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/8klqa0/thoughts_on_hierarch/dz96ihe/][would leave them open for reaping the consequences of that]].

** Which chapter has talked about Cordelia's Grand Alliance before? Because depending on the terms of its establishment, joining it doesn't necessarily mean renouncing Evil or even turning traitor against Praes. Helike is an alliance of city-states of varying alignments, right? So joining together doesn't mean everyone has to be on the same Side.

I'm calling it that by doing this she bends the Named into an impossible position and Pilgrim sacrifices himself by breaking truce, to prevent either becoming her mentor or some worse fate. She ends up killing the lot of them, but has to make good on the follow-through with the Grand Alliance and somehow ends up in the group of five with Saint. Buddy-cop tale of the year!

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

There's no way she can pull that off without antagonizing Black, the remaining Calamities, Aisha, Juniper, and a good portion the Praesi and Greenskins in her army.

I mean, sure, if she joins a crusade with overwhelming numbers she can beat them all, but that's a lot of friends and former allies she's going to slaughter.

*** To add on to that, Cat didn't mention breaking off from the Tower nor agreeing to attack Praes. She's implying that Callow wants to join the Grand Alliance against Evil.

My guess? There's one more Evil north of Procer, the Dead Kingdom. Cat is going turn the Alliance's force towards the Dead Kingdom instead of Callow & Praes. This brings the battlefield away from Callow to Procer, keeps the ties between Callow & Praes, breaks the story of Praes being Evil (and hence Black's motivation) and adds to the reason for the Dead King's awakening at the end of Book 3.

*** Or not. Right now, it's a narrative that leads straight to backstabbing former friends, though she can seize that to topple the Tower, sit on the throne and say "Look, I'm the Dread Empress now". Her Praesi allies would applaude at how beautiful it would be, but I doubt that's the plan.

Of course, if it were to turn out that a certain Dead King is getting involved in the crusade at the invitation of Malicia, well, Catherine has all the excuses she needs to frame her move as "Lesser Evil cooperates with Good to stop Greater Evil gone batshine bonkers". Which is her preferred narrative from the very start.

That said, my dream bet for an ending is Catherine being crowned Dread Empress and taking Amadeus as her Black Knight, mirroring their meeting at the very start. It probably won't happen but a man can believe.

*** She's got two options here. The first is that she's rebuffed. Good narrative. Queen tries to be good, good guys sneer and send her off. Not part of 'their' crowd but she tried. Sticks to her own kingdom, her own people. The Queen in Callow rules her people and doesn't take sides. She's 'good' or at least 'neutral' which should fool the Hashmallim. Probably the best she can hope for unless she's got Ranger hiding in a pocket to crash the negotiations.

Second is that she does join, and god only knows where that leads.

** Sort of a random question, but was it ever explained what lead Black to choose Cat as his Squire?

I would say her two biggest strengths are her ability to work with Stories (as demonstrated in this chapter and elsewhere) and her charisma, but I have trouble thinking of any cases where she demonstrated those traits before Black chose her. I know Black had her (among many others) under observation, but she was pretty much a loner at the orphanage and I don't know what she would have done that would indicate Story adeptness to Black.

*** I think it was just him caputalizing on a narratively obvious opportunity. He needs to break Callow and Praes's stories, and tie them together in a way that will outlast him. What better way to at least start down that path than to train a villain born in Callow, with ties to both nations?

In hindsight it all looks like he planned her rise to power, and at least by book 2 it seems like that was his long-term design, but i think early on it was just him seizing a fateful opportunity.

This agent recommends disposal before she can turn into a legitimate threat to the peace of the realm.”/ -- Report ‘for the eyes of Lord Black only', concerning the Imperial ward Catherine Foundling

I'd say it's a combination of natural charisma and a heroic potential, coupled with the fact that Black needed a Callowan to be promoted in the imperial hierarchy for his plans to work.

*** Also very important to note that Cat was saving up for the express purpose of joining the Legionnaires. Meaning she had already accepted the idea of working with Praes, to a certain extent. When you add in the Orphan thing, and the specific situation in that city, which Black said would have given rise to a hero, well, his plan with Cat not only created the answer to a short term problem (in case the long term didn't work out) but helped to create conditions that would solve one long term problem, a hero rising due to the narrative function of an orphan in Callow stops an oppressive and evil dictator (despite the details of Black being so heavily involved.
