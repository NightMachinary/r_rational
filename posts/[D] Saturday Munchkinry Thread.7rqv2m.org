Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** How about we switch this around. You are a god and you are designing a new world with a magic system. You have been warned of heroes being called into worlds and advancing the world technology level through the scientific method and you will not have it. Your challenge is to design way to make a magic system incompatible with not our version of technology or our laws of physics but to oppose the scientific method itself. Its inner workings are to be rendered inscrutable. If it would merely be inordinately difficult it counts. One example I came up with was for a veil of secretary surrounding magic with the guardians of Lethe enforcing it. They would come to attempts to breach the veil in a unpredictable manner and eat the information associated with it. It was unknown what exactly called them and data couldn't be shared between attempts as they would eat any data on the veil and their weaknesses as well as eat some people's memories entirely to deter further attempts and replenish their numbers. So, any ideas

*** I think that's pretty much the limit of it. It'd have to be something where the cornerstone of the world would run on amnesia, randomness or a mix thereof. I think any consistent system where data is allowed to accumulate would be figured out so it either needs to be inconsistent or data needs to not be allowed to accumulate.

The former can be accomplished through randomness, the latter through either memory wipes or memory limits (e.g restrictions on book permanency).

Or you can just brute force it by giving the bad guys superpowers--make an anti scientific method sect and give them superpowers and favors based on how much global scientific literacy there is. Then give anyone who uses the scientific method leprosy, with burning letters in the sky that point to them and say "I'm a terrible god who forbids doing things like this, so don't".

As an example, imagine that Bob casts a transformation spell turning an iron ingot into a gold ring. Alice would "see" a reddish beam shoot from his hand. Barry would "see" a ghostly glow in the shape of a ring. Carol would "hear" a C-major triad. Donald would "smell" the overpowering scent of lavender. Evan couldn't detect anything magical.

Yes. All mundane effects (such as an iron ingot or a gold ring sitting on a desk) would be unaffected.

#+begin_quote
  That doesn't seems like it would enough to keep the workings of magic a secret.
#+end_quote

You would know that Bob can transform iron into gold, but wouldn't have any idea of how to start reverse-engineering the spell.

Also, Bob would not be able to /teach/ you how to cast the spell. As a feature I'm adding right now, each person's way of /interacting/ with magic is unique as well. Bob's particular focus is star-based sympathy. He took an element formed by exploding stars (iron) in the shape representing merging (a 1x1x2 block) and turned it into an element formed by merging stars (gold) in the shape representing explosions (a ring). Alice /could/ theoretically learn how to cause the same effect (32 Fe -> 4 Au + 18 H2O + 21 O2, maintaining all subatomic particles) but it would be almost impossible and wouldn't benefit from Bob's teaching at all.

At this point I'm basically describing versatile superheroes rather than mages, though.

*** One simple way to do this is to screw around with confirmation bias. Apply an innate magic debuff on the entire world, that makes it hard for sapients to recall or observe phenomena that they do not expect.

Since this only affects their minds, our technology and our laws of physics are preserved just fine. The scientific method however, is shot to hell, since we wouldn't be able to properly perform experiments. Every experimenter, even a double-blinded one, has some expectations about how an experiment will end up. Those expectations will mess with his ability to observe and recall the actual experimental results, heavily skewing them towards what he was expecting. Scientists would be drowning in false positives and false negatives, making it utterly hellish to advance using the scientific method. You would still be able to advance science via theoretical calculations, but that only lets you go so far with respect to advancing the world technology.

** *Edit:* I've declared winners in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7rqv2m/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dt0u80c/?st=jcp714il&sh=fba47f48][another top-level comment]].

Alright, let's have some fun! You have 10 characters in which to express the largest finite number you can think of, and 100 characters to explain your notation. The winner is the person who writes the largest number. [[https://www.lettercount.com/][Here is a website]] that counts characters, for your convenience.

Rules:

- Put your number and explanation in spoiler tags.

- Do not read other peoples' answers until you have answered, unless you are not participating. No retroactively changing your answers. Do not discuss people's answers unless you enclose the discussion in spoiler tags.

- Your number must be expressed via a computable function (or a composition of computable functions, which is a computable function). So Busy Beaver function is cheating. For non-mathematicians, if you're scared by "computable function," note that almost any well-defined function you are likely to think of will be a computable function. This includes the standard multiplication operator, exponentiation operator, etc. The wikipedia page will probably tell you if something is not computable.

- *Edit:* ASCII character strings only

- You may use any pre-existing notation, constant, operator, or computable function, as long as it has a wikipedia page. In your 100-character explanation, link to the wikipedia pages of all pre-existing functions/notations/constants used. Links do not count towards character count. If you devise your own notation/function/whatever, it must be fully explained in your 100-character explanation.

- No max/min/inf/sup or other optimization operators, unless these things are embedded in a known computable function with a wikipedia page. No self-reference or meta-level tomfoolery; e.g., no saying things like "Consider the set of all 10-character ASCII strings which express computable functions..." No referencing other people's numbers and saying "That person's number plus 1."

- There is no explicit constraint on the format of your 10-character string or your explanation. You can write something like "F(G(4))" in your string, and in your explanation, write, "F is the sine function, G is the cosine function." The implicit constraint is that your function/number must be well-defined, and a reasonably competent English-speaking mathematician who is already familiar with the concepts you are referencing should be able to figure out precisely what you mean from your string and your explanation, /without/ having to follow the wikipedia links (to rule out explanations made out of single-character links that only make sense after looking at the link). You can save characters by removing parentheses and spaces, for example.

- Full example: [[#s][Number]], Character count: 3, [[#s][Explanation]], character count: 29. Since I have no idea how to put working links in spoiler tags, I guess just make links as you would normally, but the '[](...)' part doesn't count toward character count? Also, if the functions are obvious like sin/cosin, I guess it is okay to omit the link. Please list your character count separately somewhere, for convenience.

- Since there may be specific cases I missed, I will judge by the spirit, not the letter, of the law. If you have found an extremely clever way to munchkin these rules, I may let it pass, but do this at your own risk.

- [Optional but strongly encouraged]: Please record your level of mathematical education, so that it is possible later to give separate accolades to the mathematicians vs. non-mathematicians, if this seems necessary. Mathematicians will have a significant advantage.

The window to respond closes within 24 hours of when this comment was posted. I will edit this comment with the winner(s). This post is kind of an experiment to see if this works. It could just turn out that whoever has the most obscure knowledge of mathematical operators will win. To be honest, for some of the larger numbers I have no idea whether judging which one is larger will even be possible. I will probably need assistance (feel free to post comments with spoiler-tagged commentary; just mark the commentary clearly as such).

If this is popular, we can do it again in the future (presumably after ironing out the bugs discovered in this run).

((I would post this as its own discussion thread, but I am not sure if the moderators would consider it topical enough to rational fiction.))

Anyway, I don't think adding arbitrary accents works anyway. The problem is that I'm not going to bother counting the accents after about 10, so you're going to have to just write the number of accents next to the character, and at that point you might as well just use ascii.

****** No need for spoiler tags anymore, since the competition is over. So by the standard definition of a function, the output cannot change on different runs of the same input. A function is a set of ordered pairs, and a set is a fixed object. I take it you are thinking of a function as a "computational process" that may or may not involve randomness, but that is not what is normally meant in mathematics. (The "computability" condition means that there must indeed be some associated computational process, but that process must not give randomly varying answers). The number you specify must be "well-defined" in the sense that any number with the properties you describe must be the same number. Since there is more than one possible number, well-definedness does not hold here.

At a glance, I think size order goes as follows.

I'm pretty sure [[/u/Seth000]] is the winner with their iterated TREE functions.

Runner up is [[/u/currough]] with their binary tree of Ackermann functions of Graham's number. Iterated TREE beats iterated Ackermann, because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem][according to Wikipedia]], the growth rate is much higher than Ackermann in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy][fast-growing hierarchy]].

Then we have [[/u/bbrazil]] with xkcd's classic A(G,G).

Fourth place is [[/u/Gurkenglas]] with Conway's chained arrow notation 9->9->9->9. I don't have good intuition about chained arrow notation, but I think this is smaller than A(G,G)? If they had written 9>9>9>9>9 instead, that actually might haved pushed this to second or third place...maybe?

Fifth place is [[/u/TheJungleDragon]] with 9kkkkkkkk9, using Knuth's up-arrow notation, which is immense but unfortunately utterly destroyed by the higher-up answers.

Sixth place is [[/u/ulyssessword]] with chained exponents. Chained exponents might have worked well if I had restricted answers to only the basic operations, but unfortunately they don't hold a candle to hyperoperators. It's hard to write a large number if you've never seen hyperoperators before, so good effort.

The best strategy in this game, I think, is something similar to what [[/u/GaBeRockKing]] suggests. You want to use prefix/polish notation to write something like ttttttttt9 for your number, and to cram as much recursion into your explanation as possible while still having it be interpretable to the reader. For example, someone could write:

*Number:* qqqqqqqqq9 [10 chars]

*Explanation:* [[#s][spoiler tag because without it weird formatting stuff happens?]]

Where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman%27s_SSCG_function][Friedman's SSCG function]] grows faster than TREE, and the explanation adds several levels of recursion on top of that. Using chained arrow notation might allow even faster recursion, but the tradeoff is that every concept you import must be defined in the explanation with more characters. Better still might be trying to import the formalism of the fast-growing hierarchy and add things to it, but I'm not sure how to do that succintly.

Bringing in Turing machines like [[/u/xavion]] tried to do risks non-computability and ill-definedness. If we had allowed noncomputable functions, then the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#The_busy_beaver_function_%CE%A3][Busy Beaver function]] beats the hell out of any possible computable function anyone could have ever devised, because in some sense BB(n) is the maximum number expressable by any halting n-state Turing machine. Just pick an n where you are pretty sure that an n-state Turing machine has enough complexity to encode the concepts being used in this competition. Then do a whole bunch of recursion by defining BB^{k} (n) to be the maximum number definable by an n-state turing machine that can make oracle calls to BB^{k-1}, and so on.

Kudos to [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]] for trying to munchkin the rules. But it's hard to munchkin rules with a judge who models the intent of the rules (The "spirit of the law") rather than the literal rules.

EDIT: nvm. I need a way to recursively get more layers of recursions, not just get more recursions.

**** You are in the right track of trying to find a way to add layers o recursions,instead of making the thing bgger which only makes thigs look bigger to people . You can try yourself but if you just want to know how to continue ,there is a long thread in the xkcd forums whith a competition like this and people found ways to reach so munch further that that that your number of layers of recursions is basically 0 in comparison."Just" recursively get more layers of recursion wont even approach you to the medium sized numbers of the xkcd thread, let alone to the winner.

*** you know there is a thread in the xkcd forums whith the same premise and people there reached absurdly bigger numbers , until Eliezer came and broke the competition whith his.I didnt se this in time but i would have just did basically the same thing as eliezers numbe and liked to the article in the gogology wiki([[http://googology.wikia.com/wiki/Yudkowsky%27s_Number]]) .As far as I can tell that's not against the rules.,since it wouldnt be looking into other people's answers to this competition , and is basilly the same as using something like a mere akerman function , or xkcd number.

**** That... is a large number. It wouldn't have worked in this competition, since I intended links to be restricted to regular Wikipedia and not to any wiki. Also, 100 characters is probably not enough to give Yudkowsky's full definition. But still, that is the largest number I have ever seen. Thanks for the link.
