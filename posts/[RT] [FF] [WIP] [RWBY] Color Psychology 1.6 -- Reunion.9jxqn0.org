  Weiss and Ruby sat together in the tallest boughs of a tree. Ruby had Crescent Rose's scope pressed to her face again, scanning the treetops for nevermore.
#+end_quote

Weiss and Ruby, sitting in a tree, S-N-I-P-I-N-G....

#+begin_quote
  The exclusivity of exceptionality
#+end_quote

So conservation of Ninjutsu is a literal universal law on Remnant.

** Good chapter overall. Liked the character interactions and worldbuilding.

Pyrrha is a fair bit more guarded than I remember her being. Then again, it's a somewhat darker reconstruction, so it makes sense.\\
Curious of Pyrrha's semblance in this story. Is this still merely magnetic manipulation, just interacting oddly with Ruby's semblance?

Atlas' assimilation is probably the most intriguing bit here. Wondering how other cultures deal with negative emotions, then. Also not certain if "class 1 restricted information" is lowest class. Is it?\\
Besides that... Weiss' semblance is /massively/ versatile (even more than original's, actually), if somewhat high maintenance.

There's an interlude coming up in a few chapters (1.9 I think?) that should clear this up.

No comment. >.>

Yeah, definitely. I think strong abilities with one or two glaring weaknesses work best for protagonists. It lets them do really cool stuff without being overpowered.

I think Pyrrha is just using her magnetic manipulation to mess with the iron in people's blood.

*** Their "individuality" is their status as members of the schnee family. It's like those people who build their entire personality over which fandoms they are in, or the kind of extreme loyalty where you see yourself as a servant to the crown first and last. That's this entire family. That managed to survive the assimilation because of their control of dust, which would have had to have been nationalized to remove it from them.

Something interesting that /immediately/ occurred to me is that /weiss is going to grow./ It's a bildungsroman, she has to grow, and the opportunity is there because she's been moved to a novel society with radically different social mores inimical to her current worldview. (I mean, the author could have her double down on her identity as a member of the schnee, but that power has been on the outs already and I doubt the author is going to deny her the reinvention of herself that would require)

*** The 'stable cyan energy shield' is a question about Weiss's overpowered ability -- this ties in to how her *family* became powerful, because Weiss' strong semblance is part-and-parcel of the Schnee's heritage.

** I've found maybe five RWBY fics that I'd recommend to someone looking for fanfic, but this has been consistently more interesting than I expected, and I definitely want to see where you're going with it.

**** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sapr-rwby-mlp.674638/][SAPR]], which is ongoing, is also excellent. When MLP's Sunset Shimmer ends up in the human world, it's /Remnant/, not ours. The crossover's used to its fullest potential - Sunset's a faunus, each of the RWBY girls ends up on a team separate from the others, and the cast generally seems to grow in ways that seem natural given their new situations. And, unlike normal fics where a character from one world is dropped into another, Equestrian characters still work their way into the plot.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/arc-of-the-revolution-rwby.373388/][Arc of the Revolution]], a deadfic where Jaune stumbles his way into becoming one of the most terrifying people on Remnant due to constant misunderstandings by others.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/%E2%80%98hazredous%E2%80%99-interruptions-nanoha-rwby.373136/][Hazredous Interrruptions]] is objectively well-written and interesting, but I don't know the crossover well and the updates are/were slow. I stopped reading it a while back, because I thought I'd read it once it was finally done, so I don't know if it's still going on or finished.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emergence-rwby.308628/][Emergence]] has the RWBY crew getting dropped on Earth, in a sort of realistic reverse isekai thing. I liked the first contact elements, because I'm a sucker for that, but cared less about what the later stories looked like they were transitioning into, and haven't looked at it for a while.

The RWBY Time Loops are written by excellent writers, but is painfully long and might be hard to follow. The Games We Play has some good worldbuilding, but rambles on and simply gets boring as it continues.

I remember liking [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shards-a-worm-rwby-crossover.334032/][Shards]], which is dead, but don't remember much about it, and can't say if my younger self had good taste or not.

***** Just read through SAPR up to current, and I'm really enjoying it.

Tried reading Emergence but holy shit they were anti-explaining things. Like, if you asked someone to explain our world in the least helpful and most confusing way that's still technically true you might get close to how frustrating that was to read. I had to stop because I was so mad.

I actually read The Games We Play because I was searching for Gamer fics, and didn't even realize RWBY was a show until I had finished the whole fic. I absolutely loved that book, and maybe because I have a really low bar for Gamer fics I didn't see it as rambling at all. I thought it was kind of brilliant how as his wisdom went up his thoughts became longer and more complex. When I actually saw the show and caught up to current I was simultaneously incredibly disappointed that the show didn't cover nearly as much as I thought and in awe at the worldbuilding accomplished in TGWP. An extra city, multiple world bosses, festivals, politics, semblances, meaning, history through puzzle pieces, and an overarching story that fit the world of Remnant and Grimm just right. The fight against Penny where he was pot chugging was brilliant. I've never felt such fear of an enemy in a book as I have towards Pandora Shells. The way he fully used the Gamer power up to the extremes is still peerless. God I miss the feeling of reading that book for the first time.
