I just got around to reading Significant Digits, it was super great, but I kinda remember a sequel to it posted here I can't find now


** You may be thinking of Orders of Magnitude. It's not exactly a sequel though - and unfinished when I last encountered it.

** Maybe you're thinking of [[http://www.2pih.com/table-of-contents/][Orders of Magnitude]] even though it's a prequel to HPMOR and Significant Digits.

** Were you specifically after more Significant Digits material, or are you generally looking around at HPMoR continuations? There are various other complete and incomplete recursive fics.
