** So The Witness is currently out on Steam (or still in pre-sale for the next few hours if you're in America), and I'd have to say it's bloody brilliant!

This is a work of love by Jonathan Blow, the same guy who made [[http://braid-game.com/][Braid]]. He has also chosen to take the way designers currently create games and spark a revolution by showing a better way by using his games as a golden standard. For example, he has even brought in a landscaper and architect to ensure the quality of immersion in the environment which is such an unusual idea that seems like the obvious thing to do in hind-sight when making a high-priced, high-quality game.

This is why I wanted to post a link to The Witness, because it's such a strong commitment to one's goals/philosophy and I feel that this game has a lot to teach in terms of discovery, learning multiple seemingly unrelated facts which all later connect into a future puzzle, and /my god is the artwork/ */f#$!ing spectacular!!!/* It's not just that it's so beautiful (although it's definitely that!), but it all connects and relates to each other with no chance for any breaks in immersion. Considering how the artwork is made into an extension of the puzzles, this is a damn impressive feat.

Here's the [[http://the-witness.net/news/][game blog]] and reviews by the [[http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DeannaVanBuren/20151012/254238/Architecture_in_Video_Games_Designing_for_Impact.php][architect]], and by [[http://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626][Kotaku]].

The only "flaw" I can find is that it costs $40, but since the game is easily over 50 hours of game play with a lot of replay value, I'll begrudgingly say as a college student it's worth it.

I will not be answering any questions about the game, because to say anymore would be to ruin the experience, just like how talking about [[http://undertale.com/][Undertale]] would ruin the game for anyone who hasn't played it yet.
