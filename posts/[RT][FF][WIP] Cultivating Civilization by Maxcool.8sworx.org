** I'd like to say I really appreciate you posting stuff to this sub. It's often hard to find new things to read, and even if I'm not 100% across all your recommendations, it's definitely nice to have the option to have a gander.

***** As with anything of this type 90% of everything is crap. So I find that the best places to find new stories are sites that have robust rating systems.

[[http://topwebfiction.com/][topwebfiction.com]] and [[http://webfictionguide.com/][webfictionguide.com]]

are good places to start.

I have found a number of very good novels on [[http://royalroadl.com/][royalroadl.com]]. The site has a very nice rating system and search feature. Making an account is free and will remember where you are in a story if you leave and come back later. The downside of this site is that average quality is low so the 90% rule is closer to 95% crap, but there are tons of new stories so you can always find a few gems in the mountains of crap. Additionally specific niche genres are heavily favored, litRPG, OP MC power fantasy, etc. If you are not into those types of stories you may find the site less useful.

Lastly reddit is a pretty good way to find new stories. Especially this subreddit. [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]] some times has some good recommendation threads.

I am always looking for new stories and sites so if anyone else has recommendations I would loved to hear them.

Of course this subreddit

** I have read it, but not really liked it.

First, there is one of my hated tropes/tendencies: if it's rational, it must be dark. This story looks at the common cultivation tropes, and looks through black-tinted glasses.

Second, it greatly irks me how MC refers to the natives of the world as "primitives". Every tine I see it, I want to retort: "who are you to say that, your culture is 400 years old and their - 40000", or something like that. Colonial mindset is not any less dangerous than "primitive".

And third, underlying the previous, I believe there is a huge plothole in the worldbuilding. The first stages of cultivation are very easy and very cheap to achieve! Even servants, who don't posess good aptitude, can apparently reach the first stage in a week, and third stage in a few months. Requiring no resources at all, starving and being repeatedly harmed and drained of mana. There is absolutely no reason why not everyone is a cultivator then! A sect which transformed their outer portion to include the entire country which they rule would benefit tremendously: more recruits with hidden talents, more efficient resource gathering etc. This is something that should have happened in the world the author describes. But didn't because the author wanted to do a colonialist fantasy of a transmigrated White Man who would teach those stupid primitives the Right Way.

** Cultivating Civilizations are horrible places for people to live.

Abducted from his retirement, Jack was placed into such a world.

He has two options. Either he can follow the traditions of the world and kill his way to the top, or try to change the world into one where people don't have to.

Follow him on his path as he tries to balance his past life's morals with this life's realities.

Jack doesn't care that a sea of people stands in his way, he will nurture a sea of his own and drown them.

** Very enjoyable take on the cultivation genre. It's such a relief to see a character in one of these worlds focus on gathering allies and spreading his knowledge rather than just getting more powerful. I recommend it!
