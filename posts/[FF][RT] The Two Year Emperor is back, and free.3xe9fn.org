Short version: 2YE is publicly available again and can be downloaded here: ﻿﻿[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0%EF%BB%BF][https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0﻿]] This is an archive of all the original HTML files in book 1 (the part about Jake), including author's notes and such. I haven't had time to add nav links, but Ctrl+O is a thing. If anyone has time to strip the files and combine them and/or add the nav links I would really appreciate it.

Long version:

2YE is a D&D fanfic that I originally published on FFN. When I went from being a programmer to being an author I stripped the copyrighted D&D elements out and published it on Amazon. (After giving it away for 6 weeks first so that no one would get caught short if they were in the middle of reading.) I put it in the Kindle Online Lending Library program because that's where an author makes 40% of his money on a book. The TOS for the KOLL program requires exclusivity, so I had to take it offline at that time.

Yesterday someone pointed something out to me that I had forgotten: when I was originally writing 2YE and posting it on FFN I started publishing spinoff stories. At the bottom of most 2YE chapters I put a short ad pointing to those stories, along with the note "Don't worry, 2YE will always be free, no matter how many spinoff sales I do or don't get."

I thought about this when it was pointed out to me, and then I went over to my Amazon dashboard to see what the deal was with 2YE right now. KOLL requires exclusivity while you're in, and you only have the chance to opt out every 90 days. As it happened, I was able to get the book out of the KOLL program.

2YE is now available for free again. I may or may not repost it on FFN -- their interface is a total pain, and uploading and then posting 71 chapters (plus 14 more for Book 2) would be annoying. At some point I'll probably take the time to add "Next" and "Prev" links and strip all the Author's Notes and other cruft, but for now this is the exact dump of what was on FFN. It's currently posted over on my [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][Patreon]] as a free download, and when I eventually get it cleaned up that's where the polished version will be.

EDIT: I forgot to say: Book 2 (the part about Suze) isn't included because it needs some rework. It'll go up as soon as I get enough tuits.


** [[/u/Mraedis]] is right, your work is awesome. I had a lot of fun reading 2YE, when it ended and I started reading Team Anko I guess I wasn't done processing so I didn't give t a fair chance before quitting. A couple days ago I started reading Team Anko again and it's really freaking good, I binged it. I don't know what I want more, Team Anko or Marked for Death.

Not that bad, aside from the hard-coding. Apology accepted, though I only had to look because you apologized. I am giving BOD and assuming you've tested it though.

** Thank you -- I missed 2YE during its serial posting stage b/c of Worm and HPMOR and didn't really get into the idea of D&D spin-offs until I started reading Mother of Learning.

I was just thinking this weekend that I would totally buy 2YE since the munchkin-min-max aspects of the world would be really great for my own fiction-spin-off for D&D.

I love reading Change Storms. I'm always surprised that the characters are able to derive the precise way their own powers function, but that's probably bleed over from Worm where most of the characters are clueless on how their powers work.

I will always be a Patreon supporter of yours!

Hey, don't let me stop you! ;>

I'm glad you want to read it, and thank you for saying so; it makes a huge difference to my morale and motivation. And a special thank you for being a supporter. Incidentally, if there are any rewards you'd like to see offered, let me know. I can't promise they'll happen, but I'd welcome suggestions.

***** It is, yes. I had to remove it from the lending library, but it's still for sale. The for-sale version is a bit different, though -- I scrubbed out all the copyrighted bits, nuked one chapter that didn't contribute much, and made some other edits here and there.
