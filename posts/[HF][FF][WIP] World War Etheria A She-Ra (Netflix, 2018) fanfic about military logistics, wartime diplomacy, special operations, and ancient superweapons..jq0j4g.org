** Oh my god I didn't realize how much I needed this until I read the title. Please be good.

EDIT: Okay, not my thing at all. This is way too grimdark for a She Ra story. Also, the structure is of the "Original story, except with guns and everybody is too cool to have emotional vulnerabilities" type, which really isn't the kind of fanfic I like.

*** First of all: fair enough that you don't like it. I'm completely cool with it; I write for me, not for the approval of readers.

However I'd like to contend a few points you raise: I feel you have misjudged my wiritngs. I say that without reproach.

It is not original. Plot-beat for plot-beat, virtually everything is copied from canon; occasionally expanded on and rearranged in chronology. The setting is adapted to make sense as a real planet with real places, and there's a lot of 'filler' if you will, consisting of getting from point A to point B. Where canon focuses heavily on character studies, this is more the complementary study of the world and the conflict that unfolds.

It is not Grimdark, it is Nobledark. Grim implies hopelessness and powerlessness of individuals, which I sincerely hope I haven't put on the page. Noble stories in contrast have hope and heroes who matter, this one does if I've written it right. It is dark, but a frank look at warfare is dark; that is unfortunately unavoidable.

I'd also like to say that the characters are not too cool to have emotional vulnerabilities, but they bottle them up in realistic ways, and handle setbacks like professional adults; handle trauma like fragile humans in bad situations. If the characters seem cool and detached, it is because they are hiding their fears and insecurities, and in part because I am compressing the story to fit in a little over a year rather than three or four, and have aged them up accordingly.

Thank you for giving my writings a try; I really do appreciate it. :)

PS. I think it is harsh and unwarranted criticism to say my writings are unfit "for a She-Ra story." Neither you nor even Noelle get to tell me what to write; that is just a fact of my right to express myself in fanfiction.

**** Yeah, maybe I was a bit harsh.

That said, what I'm getting from your answer is "every single thing you didn't like about the story was something I did on purpose", so... I guess we have seriously different tastes?

Anyway, I'm glad that you liked writing this.

***** And that is my point; we have different tastes, I just wanted to point out that what you described not liking was perhaps an uncharitable reading.

All respect to those who write Grimdark, characters who are in fact "too cool for emotional vulnerabilities," etc. But the framing of your comment I took at least as equating these qualities with a lack of skill at writing. I then just wanted to point out that these observed characteristics were in fact put there deliberately, and were not as superficial as it may seem.

(Remember when people said HJPEV was an unrealistic 11-year-old and then 121 chapters later Big Yud reveals that whole horocrux thing? It's like that except less obstinate.)

If this artistic choice -- of writing dark stories with characters who unhealthily present a "cool" facade in the face of traumatizing experiences -- is not to your liking then all the more power to you. Life is too short to read things you don't like.

Godspeed, and may you find the She-Ra fanfic you are looking for elsewhere.

Why would Glimmer need a horse?

*** Because her teleportation powers works like this:

- She has a 'budget' or 'pool' which recharges at a rate proportional to proximity to the Moonstone. Overuse causes migraines and 'psychic nose bleeds.'
- Her teleportation is of the 'swap volumes' type.
- The 'costs' of teleportation are determined by three things:

  - Sum of mass transferred
  - Distance transferred
  - Severance energy; that is for 'portal cuts' she needs to pay for cutting hard materials. Fluids are basically free, solids are potentially very expensive.

- Other than that her teleportation envelope can be arbitrarily complex in shape and she can re-orient objects.
- She cannot alter momentum other than to 'cancel' falls.

Glimmer is a precision sniper rifle, not a rocket ship; although both propel projectiles by way of exothermic chemical reactions, they are extremely different in application.

This is a fic about /logistics./ Why the fuck are you asking me why people are riding horses?

** Breedy good! Definitely more thought put into the Horde vs Magical kingdoms than original show ever tried. Not grimdark at all, its violent but more like people die when fired at, rather than something like shower of gore or guts strewn on battlefield.

Relationships are very speed up, barely any development, it is based on show knowledge and fanon rather than any character behavior in story, except Scorpia (best venom bun, too precious too good for this world).

Not terribly rational, seeing as how nobody is using magic to solve food/transport or boost the economy, nor is Hordak using advanced tech to corner the economy sector via cheap plentiful products.

Powers are reasonably well developed from original.

I read all the three installments in the series, eagerly awaiting more. Gib more.

Also, rational does not mean munchkin. There is such a thing as entrenched institutions.

** You've taken my favorite things out of canon -- the excellent worldbuilding bits -- and developed it. This was a delight to read.

I understand why you kept the stations or canon, but I'd like to see stronger justifications of character's actions and choices that broke the suspicions of disbelief to me, most importantly

* Adora forgetting about the Light Palace for so long

* Adora giving Cathra access rights

* Not mounting any princesses-led offensive ops or even doing more collateral damage on their expeditions

* Adora not applying her brilliant mind to any kingdom logistics like Hordak does

*** The Crystal Palace lies over a days travel into a dangerous woodlands. You wouldn't want to go there all the time, even if it wasn't inhabited by an AI you don't fully trust.

Friends-to-enemies is a process. Trust erodes with time and effort, just as it is built. Both of them carry hope that the other will just 'realize' they were wrong all along.

Causing collateral damage intentionally is a war crime.

Adora is good at military tactics, operational doctrine, and theoretical strategy. She is not a logistical savant, she just knows how to Quartermaster. And besides there's a war on. Her skills are needed elsewhere than in restructuring society, and you don't pass major reforms during war, either.
