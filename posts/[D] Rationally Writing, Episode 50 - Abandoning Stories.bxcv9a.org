** Welcome back everyone! This episode we discuss the reasons authors abandon stories before they're finished, whether they want to or not. Thanks to patron Oren Milman for suggesting this topic!

** Are there transcripts available for these, for deaf or hearing-impaired folks (or, less importantly, for writers who prefer to read than listen)?

*** Probably best to get a professional solution for this if you're deaf, since you'll be needing it for much more than this. The free speech to text converters are garbage (even Google's destroy-this-market-bomb is terrible, but it's the best free one I think - basically you record it into a Google voice voicemail).

*** No, sorry. Unfortunately, machine transcription isn't really good enough to be usable, and manual transcription is too expensive and/or time consuming. I would love to have transcriptions, but the costs are just too high.

**** Is machine transcription good enough to get a first-pass rough draft that can then be hand-edited?

Would you host fansubs if fansubs were provided to you?

I've heard estimates for hand transcription are about 3 hours work per hour of audio.

***** We would absolutely love fansubs if someone wanted to go to the effort, and we would definitely host them.

Doing machine transcription followed up by human transcription and correction is probably the easiest way to go but it's still very time-intensive, more work than I think either of us are willing to put in.

** From the title I thought it might be about all the subplots that just got abandoned after the Zapdos attack because the central character died.

*** Oh man, I would love to do a whole episode about dropped threads and abandoned subplots. It's a big problem in serial work, unless you're an absolute master of tying up loose threads and/or planning out your stories.
