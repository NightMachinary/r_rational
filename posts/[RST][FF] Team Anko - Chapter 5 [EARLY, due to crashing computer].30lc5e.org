** My computer is crashing every 10-15 minutes, so I'm posting this a day early before handing my baby over to people I've never met before who claim they can make it better. Enjoy.

On a related topic, today's chapter is half the normal length. See aforementioned related topic for why.

*** Thank you, that's really helpful. I've actually listened to a bunch of Writing Excuses in the past; I've enjoyed it, but not found it that helpful in many cases, because it's short and there's a fair amount of vagueness (EDIT: by this I mean "too high level") in the discussion. Maybe I've just listened to the wrong episodes though; I'll go try the ones you pointed out.

I was worried that Anko would be an even worse teacher than Jiraiya in canon for Naruto but after this chapter she likely is much better. Also her backstory was very interesting.

Second: wow, that is such a collection of stupid. If there's one thing you should be telling him, that's it. Just for safety. And if there's anything to be angsty and whiny about it's NOT that. Criminy.

I don't know if naruto knew.

Also, I'm gonna get you the pages anko is in because I personally feel anko being lewd is more fanon than canon.

***** Well, Anko's lewdness can be derived from her character, considering we really don't see her in casual settings in the series. The most casual we get is when she's the proctor (in which she cuts Naruto, drapes herself over him and licks him) Every other time we encounter her (that I can recall) it's in fairly serious situations, so we wouldn't notice if she was actually lewd. However, her standard ninja attire is a mesh body suit, a skirt and a trenchcoat. Now, in looking at pictures of her, it's ambiguous whether she's naked or not under it. There isn't any other clothing drawn under the suit. You would see the dividing line of fabric vs skin if there was. So it's safe to assume she's just wearing that. And a woman who's standard ninja attire is that? She's clearly trying to make some sort of statement in that area. She's not going to dress like that and be super-professional.

** Right now it feels slow to me. You carefully and comprehensively explained a lot of backstory so far. However, the main characters are not committed to a big story yet.

Is the story about the route to the Republic? Anko's team could drop out of the action after their mapping job as well. Is it about Hinata's abuse and the related clan politics? Then this mapping mission seems to drag on too much.

In the sense of wise reading, these are my current thoughts. However, this is the first time I am reading a fanfic "live". I usually read them when they are finished, so I do not have to wait for the next chapter.

This is actually a romance story, but I see where you're coming from. My plan had been: clearly establish the desire for a relationship, clearly establish the character problems that make it non-trivial, and establish the shared experiences that will pull the protagonists together (Specifically, being thrown together for a long period of time on an important and dangerous mission out in the wilderness away from parental chaperones.)

Do you have suggestions on a better way to have handled it?

**** You could try to increase the tension by hinting at future problems building up.

The most bland hinting is a prophecy, but afaik no prophecies in Naruto.

You could do short cut somewhere else. This implies the reader knows more than the characters, but you can keep it vague. Ideas: Some HyÅ«ga notices and follows them; Land of Lightning/Sound/Waterfall sending some ninjas into the buffer zone; Fire Daimyo/Hokage gets info about additional dangers for their mission; Orochimaru starts a search for Anko; Someone in the casino noticed their cheating and is sending Samurai after them; Their disguise during equipment-buying was not as successful as they thought.

A whole second story line is probably not fitting for your story. I noticed this in other stories. Whenever some main character has a long and boring talk, somewhere else some exciting things are happening or at least a cliffhanger to keep the tension.

***** Those are good suggestions for things to do in the future (one of which is already scheduled for next chapter, or at least something similar) but I meant to ask if you had suggestions on how the first 5 chapters could have been better handled?

****** Anko set a timelimit of 3 days for the provisioning. Time never felt scarce though. That could have been more tense, but it was an arbitrary limit anyways. There is no time pressure whatsoever on Anko herself as far as I remember.

All danger so far is tell not show. We have never seen samurai winning against ninja. All threats have been navigated around. Everything works according to the plan. Compare Worm, where there is also a lot of planning (offscreen), but then everything goes haywire anyways. Worm overuses this imho. However, Naruto overachieving the Poker task is the other extreme. Idea in the casino: Suddenly "Everybody stay calm! We have a cheater here!". 20 samurai surround the room. Naruto is about to create some shadow clones. Hinata/Anko signs him to wait. The samurai capture someone else. Result: We have seen Samurai in action and know better how dangerous they are. Even more awesome by our main characters. We learned that all plans might require improvisation, which makes future planning more interesting. You could even end that chapter in between for a cliffhanger.

Another idea: Have someone follow them as the leave the village. Makes covering the tracks more urgent. There is the mystery why they are followed and by whom. It requires some denouement later, though. Maybe it was just someone Anko hired for the lulz ... eh ... for teaching.

** Nice chapter. The exploration of Anko's backstory this release was interesting; hearing her flunk out and being a worse student than Naruto in the Academy came as a real surprise. As did the horrors of Orochimaru's training.

I loved the 'wha?' reaction all three genin had to hearing Anko's been carrying around mission funds they could've been using instead of personal cash for buying stuff.

*** Yeah, with my computer in the shop I don't have my usual HTML => BBCode scripts, so take 8000 words and converting it by hand is prohibitive. Until I'm back on my own machine I'll only be posting on FFN.

Although, I should post a notice to the forum about that. Thanks for jogging my memory.
