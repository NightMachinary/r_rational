** Sola, like the Volunteer, was inspired by two separate characters, one well known, the other obscure. It will be interesting to see who, if anyone, figures out the obscure one.

Incidentally, for those who remember the Xelian's Oblivion Projector from Skybreaker's Call--Sola was the target they had in mind when they built it.

*** Well, I'm guessing that Phoenix is the well known one. The other I'm not sure...Sola didn't get a lot of screen time, so there aren't a lot of characteristics to key on. Fire, maybe?

**** No, Fire isn't the obscure one, though you are right about Phoenix--the wings ref was a bit of a giveaway. The scene with the Merionians is, among other things, my answer to X-Men 135 (original series).

The key for the obscure one is that Sola spent most of her time inside the sun--she couldn't safely land on Earth or get very close to people because she can never cool down far enough.

***** Celestia?

That thing in Effulgence where one of the Jokers who could burn/regenerate teleported into the middle of a sun, and was forcibly teleported back, and when he returned he was so hot he flashed the room on fire until he burned-in-place to regenerate?

***** I've got nothing. Spoiler it for me?

Also, I'm guessing that Blue Sentinel is Green Lantern + Blue Beetle?

****** Sunswift, from 'The Futurians' by Dave Cockrum, who , not incidentally, was the co-creator of Phoenix.

No Blue Beetle--Blue Sentinel was inspired by a specific vision of Hal Jordan as Green Lantern: There was a very brief cameo by him in I think the second Dark Knight series, where he has turned rather alien after losing everyone he really cared about on Earth.
