** Hey everyone, welcome back to, say it with me now, the New Longest Chapter Yet! Lots of notes this time around, so bear with me:

First, I had an amazing time this month at the Center for Applied Rationality workshop in Seattle. It was tons of fun, I met all sorts of interesting and unique people, and I learned quite a lot about myself and various tools available to upgrade my thinking and perspectives. If you're curious to learn more you should totally [[http://www.rationality.org/][check out their site]]! The title of this chapter is based on one of their techniques, and I'm going to try and draw Red's out and upload it to my site soon so you can get a better picture of what it looks like.

Second, in case it's not quite clear in the story: abra can't be used to teleport others. They can only teleport their trainer, since it requires a full-mind-meld to bring them along.

Third, some amazing readers have made some amazing fan creations! Check out my site for links to some [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon-fan-art/][awesome fan art]] and an [[https://soundcloud.com/user-598992923/pokemon-the-origin-of-species-ch-1-unreliable-predictions][audio play of the first chapter]], which was just delightful and a fantastic surprise for me.

Finally, I wanted to repeat once again that, while I enjoy and appreciate and value guest reviews, remember that fanfiction literally does not allow me to respond to them, so please keep that in mind if you leave reviews that have questions in them but are not signed in :) Additionally, fanfiction will block anything that looks like a website or email address, so if you try to leave those in your reviews, Guest or otherwise, I cannot follow up on them as they will just look like empty spaces in the reviews.

Enjoy, and all feedback welcome, as usual!

** So nobody's talking about the "ero" mystery. Did everyone figure it out immediately and I'm the only one not getting it?

My best guess is it has something to do with the old pokedex, something like "New Folder" or "Document1", only the pokedex somehow glitched and it's actually "*ERRO*R", "*ERRO*R1", etc. (English is not my first language, but I think you're not supposed to distinguish double letters, so "ero" and "erro" would sound the same).

***** In a similar vein to "disabling/controlling attacks", I was thinking Ero is just short for erode. "Fast" was obviously quick attack. So my guess would be that they're descriptive, but my model wouldn't explain Ero 2. Perhaps Ero stage 2, as in, wait for current status effects and erode the opponent's stamina.

I think determining Ero vs Ero 2 seems like it could cause undue hesitation in fast paced battling evironment.

My thinking was that Aiko doesn't seem as clever as the other characters. Or perhaps she's just more 'child-like' or naive.

Following that logic, Aiko's tactic probably isn't as clever, or strategic as some of the other tactics we've seen. At least in this way.

That may also be why it's harder for Blue to figure out; he's trying to figure it out as though it /doesn't/ have an obvious fault.

**** I thought about that, but from Blue's POV it seemed like there's more to it than just "all commands are Ero N in random order for all Pokemon". It makes sense, because this way you can't learn code names (like "Bai"), which code name corresponds to which attack depends on which Pokemon is out. But then what "Ero" means? If it's just a nonsense word, it seems "unfair" narratively. And if that's the code, why not drop "Ero" and just use "1", "2", etc. "Ero one", "Ero two", etc seem a bit too long to say to be optimal. If "Ero" is her analogue of "Ok, Google" to avoid accidental activation, replace numbers with something which serves the same purpose, but is not common words, like numbers in a foreign language or "alpha", "bravo", etc.

**** On the one hand, having more trainers join the party would be a pretty big diversion from the original games. On the other hand, I can see the appeal of having more main characters to focus on. Maybe there should be more teams of major side characters whose perspectives we get to see. I mean we already are starting to do get something like this but it's mostly just individual side characters, rather than recurring teams of them. It would be interesting to do something like what Sonic Heroes did. The main team is Red Blue, Leaf and Aiko. Then you could add others.

BTW why didn't you name her Kerria instead of Aiko? Then you could have had all four of the Gen 1 colors represented among the protagonists. Seriously this was a huge missed opportunity.

I've been thinking of adding a "Yellow" character to the story for awhile, but if I do I would first want to actually read the manga some so I could get a sense of their character (Leaf is essentially an OC, but I have nothing in particular in mind for Yellow) and what their role in the story would be.

****** If it helps kick-start any seed-ideas (and at the risk of being mildly spoilery), here are a few facts about manga!Yellow:

Her attitude towards Pokémon is very benevolent and empathetic. This likely stems from her special ability to heal and understand Pokémon via touch, which she was born with. This goes so far that Pokémon healing is considered her 'specialty', same as how Pokémon battling is manga!Red's, Pokémon training is manga!Blue's, and catching Pokémon is manga!Crystal's.

As a result of her attitude, her battling style focuses heavily on subduing enemy Pokémon without actually injuring them. It was her skill in controlling a battle in this manner that convinced manga!Prof. Oak to let her be the main character of the Yellow Saga. (Even though we later find out she's also super-naïve, and somehow doesn't even know about metamorphosis... wut? -_-)

Her home is Viridian City, and her first Pokémon was a Rattata. She also wears a cool straw hat, which at some point gets the rainbow and silver feathers in it (which are the keys to TIME TRAVEL - seriously).

So, with the above, maybe one idea could be that OoS!Yellow is a psychic like Red, but focused on applying her powers to further veterinary research and care. That could make her a foil to Red, i.e. pure versus applied science, and her battling style could make her another foil to Blue. She would likely have a similar stance as Leaf on Pokémon treatment, but because of her psychic/empathic abilities has a more extreme position? If her primary interest is in veterinary medicine, she could have an understanding of Pokémon biology that exceeds even what Red has studied in that field (specialist vs generalist).

Considering all of the above, she could maybe have a role to play whenever Pokémon biology/medicine/biomedical ethics/humane treatment/time travel (jk!) gets the limelight?

Healing powers would be a massive break of how my world works (human psychics are not powerful enough to heal pokemon) but it could be worked in with just a lot of experience raising and taking care of them, which is very similar to Aiko.

I guess we'll see. I might actually just change her name to Kerria at this point XD

******** Green (English translation) in the manga was initially a shady character. She's first introduced as a con-artist who dupes Red, and from there on has a supporting/anti-heroine role until things get really epic (outrageous) in Saffron City. She originally stole her Squirtle and Pokedex from Prof. Oak, and the conclusion to her character arc in the Red Saga is being forgiven after explaining why she turned to theft and scams.

The story piece is clearer now but the "she" here is still ambiguous since the sentence is about two women. Also, without the "she rather /I/ just let it go," or something to that effect, the sentence looks like Leaf is doing the letting go. Something like "Or would Leaf appreciate it if I dropped the subject entirely?" or "Or would Leaf rather I forget about the whole thing?" or "Should I just let go of the topic?" or "Or would Leaf prefer not to talk about it?" or similar would work better, IMO; that way, the reader won't have to pull out of the story to try to figure out who is doing what.

*** When Red was explaining what it was like to be psychic to his mother by comparing it to be deaf person being able to hear:

#+begin_quote
  Red smiles ruefully. "It's pretty amazing. Like... I don't know, getting a hearing implant must be, for someone born deaf. But it's a lot of hard work too, and I still can't do a lot of things I thought I'd be able to. I can't even lift a stupid rock."
#+end_quote

I would advise against that metaphor. Cochlear implants are a subject of controversy in the Deaf culture since they often view it as 'forcing' people to fit in when for those who are born deaf and receive the implants late in life (not hearing aids though since they don't require surgeries). It takes years of practice and hearing therapy to be able to hear as well as a hearing person (if ever). For many Deaf, they are skeptical of the 'benefits' that cochlear implants bring. While they don't have issue with teens or adults choosing to get them of their own volition, there are issues with hearing parents deciding that their deaf child should get the implants to be "cured". For example in the media about cochlear implants, we almost always see the parents gushing about the implants, but the children are rarely shown being asked for their opinions before or after.

If you did want to use a metaphor with controversial implications just like how there is controversy associated with psychics in your story, then it's a very good choice. But if you simply wanted to use an analogy of using a sense for the first time, then I would recommend the blind seeing color for the first time instead.

Whoops, I went off in a tangent. I'm fine with the metaphor itself, but I thought you might want to know about any potential issues with it and I'm willing to answer any qeustions you may have.

**** So this is actually something I'm aware of but did not in this case use intentionally to parallel the controversy about psychics, which makes me feel like I should change it for that reason, while at the same time I'm still navigating how I feel about it and whether including it with such muddled intentions does it justice.

For now I think I'm going to keep it in because I know how /Red/ would react to the idea that medically curing a disability isn't an obvious and uncomplicated good. (Which may be in part influenced by the much more advanced medical technologies available in the Pokemon world, but may not be too).

#+begin_quote
  The language of his original research paper was too focused on trying to support his hypothesis of a correlation between Other and psychic ability. He also felt misrepresented the meaning of his p-value, considering the lack of statistical significance.
#+end_quote

I think there's something missing before misrepresented.

#+begin_quote
  Well, if this pattern holds up, you won't have to worry about that any more. It might take you a bit to convince a paper to pay attention, but the journal boards aren't stupid enough to ignore something like this.

** I really enjoy your writing, my only complaint is that I hate waiting for the next to be released! I know some have said they think adding Aiko to the story would make for too many perspectives and possibly drag out the story. I agree, but I also like her! I thought that maybe she would work well as a constant side character the way she has been so far. You may have already considered this, but I wanted to mention it. Whatever happens, the story is still awesome and I can't wait for the next chapter!

** "When we get to Vermilion," he eventually says, "after the cruise, you should find a ride back to Unova and set an abra teleport there. Then you can come back and go visit whenever you want."

Red should have taken a ride back to Pallet town with Prof. Oak to do this himself. If he sets an Abra to TP to their current location, he can override that with a new location later, right?

** Hey, just picked up the story on Sunday and ended up binging it until I caught up. I just wanted you to know that I really enjoy your take on the world of pokemon. It's fascinating to have a game I grew up playing as a kid re-contextualized as a truly dangerous and fleshed out world. It reminds of when people talk about doing the Nuzlocke challenge in the games. I hadn't really thought about the more emotional implications behind it until you're serial made me look at it from a more realistic point of view. I'm looking forward to the next chapter!

** Hey, I'm a bit late to the party but I realized that I haven't been commenting much lately and since I feel guilty about it I wanted to leave my own small contribution! This story is always the highlight of the start of a new month for me and it really has grown into something special. This chapter allowed the main characters to look into their character arcs, in a way, in order to decide which direction -they- wanna go. It's as if you, the author, were giving them the freedom to choose their own path as opposed to letting the demands of the plot to dictate it. It might be an illusion, but it's (super) effective!

Red's conflict with his mother seems a bit petty at first, but then you realize it holds a sense of familiarity. It's actually a fairly realistic teen-parent conflict moment in its scope and execution. Concerning Red's future, I am really exited about his finding some big mystery or problem to work on: right now his research has been for the sake of the research itself, but when he finds something he's truly passionate about (for whatever reason) this focus will move on to the object itself. The psychic interludes are always a joy to read.

As for Blue, his character establishing moments with his grandpa were truly heartwarming and showed a softer side of him. He's still my favorite character to read about because I'm a sucker for this kind of ambition-driven rise to greatness journey, so I'm ready to enjoy the Blue ride!

Finally, Leaf is where the story has unexpectedly grown on me the most: I went from being pretty uninterested in her character and story arc in general to genuinely enjoying it. I think it has some great potential, conspiracies aside, to highlight some of the ethical grey zones of the pokemon universe, while making her question her own firm and somewhat black-and-white beliefs at the same time. That would truly be awesome.

I think that's all for now..oh yeah, the new character! I kinda like her, but I feel like I am supposed to like her and sympathize with her, which makes me want to not like her despite it. Yet I also have the feeling she might have some hidden depths after all. By the way, is her father supposed to represent the pokemon daycare from the games?
