*** Time dilation? I thought the rescue mission back forever ago confirmed that time passed in halting linear steps, e.g. Door A opens / closes on Tuesday with an 8H dungeon experience over the course of 5 minutes real time; Door B opens on Wednesday for an 8H dungeon experience over the course of 5 minutes real time; entering both windows independently adds 16H-10Min to you, but staying in from the Tuesday entry to the Wednesday entry is net zero (plus any remaining window benefit) as 24H passes in-dungeon and in-real.

Because during that rescue mission when James & Co entered through the air duct, they popped back out a week or whatever later through the door entry. If the time dilation was in effect evenly, they would have been gone maybe an hour or two or had a much longer waiting period (weeks to months) for the door to open.

**** Even before the rescue operation, their original theory on how much time would pass inside was negated by just leaving an electronic device inside and realizing by accident that its battery hadn't died. Like you mentioned, five minutes gets compressed into eight hours, but not /every/ five minutes.

***** That's a really unique and clever mechanism to drive behavior; show up on time, for the allotted time, to maximize your efficiency. Over-stay? Fine, whatever, but no disproportionately extra time benefits for you.

It certainly solves the 'just move literally everything into the time dilation room' problem that MoL skirted around.

I don't know if that's entirely unique to your story, but I haven't seen it used anywhere else.
