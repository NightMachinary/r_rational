I have been recently binge reading Release that witch , and was hooked to the idea of a 21st century guy transforming a society. Though I have seen some varients of the question, they are little old and seem pretty specific to CN/LN and not wider literature.

​

Books which fall under similar category which I have read :

​

1) A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs court

2) Nantucket Series by RM Stirling

3) Cast away under an alien sun

4) How a realist hero rebuilt a kingdom

5) A Hero's Journey

​

Have not read :

1) 1632 ( Was not able to get in)

2) Cross time engineer ( Gathered from reviews the protagonist is kind of Mary Sue like character)

​

I liked the technological advancements described in these works which I could relate to , also how the hero though knowledgeable needs other people for starting industrial revolution.

I am open to suggestions from CN/LN or fantasy


** Can't find a book by the name of A Hero's Journey, did you mean [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329][A Hero's War]]? If not, then that's a recommendation from me.

Here on Reddit, there's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][Oh This Has Not Gone Well]], a story that started strong enough but kinda... changed its mind on where it was going multiple times, and every turn made it less appropriate for this topic. I mostly lost interest around chapter 80, but keep reading out of habit and because the chapters are really short.

More stories of similar quality are listed in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6amn32/meta_looking_for_stories_like_this_has_not_gone/][this]] post.

** - Dr. Stone: The main character is a very precocious teen who has to rebuild civilisation from the ground up, with plot arcs running in parallel with the completion of different projects. This definitely meets your criterion of having other people involved with their own skills, and I enjoyed how they presented the ways different technologies are interlinked, but you may find the larger-than-life personalities, rapid pace of development, and strokes of good luck off-putting. First chapter spoilers: This doesn't strictly count as transport to another world, because the characters are instead petrified by a mysterious cataclysm and reawaken after millennia.
- How to invent everything: Subtitled "A survival guide for the stranded time traveller", this book by Ryan North is nonfiction but might still appeal to your tastes

Also, you might want to take a look at the TvTropes pages for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One-man industrial revolution]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans][Giving Radio to the Romans]], which have a lot more examples that I haven't read

** Not quite "modern human transported to alt earth," more "extremely competent and well-trained modern humans try to bring back magic using time travel": /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ by Neal Stephenson.

A professor of ancient languages is recruited by a secret branch of the US military to translate scattered fragments that seem to point towards magic having at one point existed in the world. Also written as an epistolary novel which is great fun.

**** I ended up reading all the novels up to the fourth and really disappointed by it due to MC's squeamishness throughout the entire series. It doesn't help the fact that he knows nothing about anything unless its guns because he doesn't know any sort of fantasy or comic books to draw from in a fantasy setting. Its frankly annoying. Not to mention thats there's slightly NTR. ugh

** Most books by Eric Frank Russell could kinda qualify, starting with Wasp.

I see Dr Stone has been recommended already. If you like it you might also love The Blue World by Jack Vance, it is a short read, about descendants of spaceship-wrecked humans figuring out science on a world with no land at all (no obvious, mass mineral resources whatsoever).

And then there is the Tschai series (Planet of adventure), by Jack Vance too, where a near-future human astronaut ends up stranded on a multi-sentient species alien world and works his way towards going back home. Not spoiling it but he ends up having a huge effect on the present civilizations.

** I like the Wandering Inn [[https://wanderinginn.com/]],

Though a lot of what I like about it puts it at the edge of your category as most of the impact the main character has is relatively local rather than world warping, and is social/cultural not industrial.

​

The Schooled in Magic series [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/128629-schooled-in-magic]] is also good and more directly what you described.

*** You might like this then: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][Dao of Magic]] It doesn't really take itself seriously, bordering on crack-fic, but not completely. The world of qi is getting progressively more fleshed out by way of implications and interaction with physics and other energies, rather than adding a Thousand More Even Higher Spiritual Quality Plants and Ancienter Beasts. Personally, I dropped it recently because it's not good enough to keep track of its plot together with other web serials I'm juggling, but it's a fresh take for sure. MC is mostly using modern concepts and science to make most of qi, not, like, building factories and industrializing plebeian masses, if that's what you were looking for, but there are uplifting themes too.

**** I'be read it and i'm impatiently waiting for it to come off hiatus, but I wouldn't classify it as "xianxia." Soft xianxia maybe? I want the full cultivation package, which comes with a lot of assumptions DOM breaks. The MC has a massive advantage over everyone else in the setting, the magic system intentionally divorces itself from the roots, etc. I want to see an MC in an actual cultivation world who's major advantage is out of context knowledge fighting a system with the general kind of ideals found in the rational community, in a realistic way afforded by the freedom available to long lived, powerful individuals influencing a normal (ish) society.

**** I'd clarify that A) someone else already came and did as much uplifting as they could, but that was five hundred years before the story starts and B) the present-day of the story is roughly equivalent to 1930s in most respects, so there's just less room to uplift and C) most of the uplifting that's left to do hasn't happened in story yet, since what's left takes longer, there are unique circumstances, and the focus is on leveraging first-mover advantages rather than generally improving society and D) yes, so far most of it is off-screen.
