flycrane01 has been on fire this last week, with 23 chapters translated at over 45000 words. I was a bit hesitant to post this since newcomers won't have caught up since the last post and even regular readers might not be keeping up with reading at this pace, but we'll see how it goes.


** Any way to qidian for free anymore?

**** IIRC may not even be a leecher site. There's been endless drama between Qidian and WW, with Qidian straight up copy pasting a lot of translations and paywalling them later. It was proven because a lot of translations had certain portions of text that essentially stated that if you're seeing the current sentence, the translation has been illegally obtained, etc

***** [[https://wuxiaworld.com][wuxiaworld.com]] is different from [[https://wuxiaworld.co][wuxiaworld.co]]. Perhaps they are related, but the first is a proper translation site, and the latter is a leecher site.

*** There's also a reddit sub, QidianUnderground. Copied out into pastebin I think.

Used to read there, but I quit this 40MoC after a bit
