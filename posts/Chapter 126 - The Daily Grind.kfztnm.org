*** I like to think I write characters who want things, and work to make those things happen. Sometimes they do this by fighting monsters, and sometimes they do it by talking about their feelings, or the state of their world.

But then, I'm not the one linking here, so I'm open to other reasons.

**** People here also tend to like Gamer-type stories, and this has a unique and cool system.

***** Would you believe I hadn't actually heard of The Gamer when I started writing this? I'd read other litRPGs, obviously; that's kinda what I'd intended to parody. But not the big one that everyone keeps referencing and I kept missing the existence of.

****** Ehh, it is much better that way. It actually absolutely sucks. It has done a lot of good, having spawned so much relevant fanfics and stories.. But so much bad too, as many of those copied it way too closely. I absolutely hate "observe", for example.

What is really funny is that I just watched a Korean movie "Resurrection of little match girl" which had some kind of a gamer system and a pro gaming scene was an element there. And it is from two decades ago... And it was not a small one. It was made for four years and it qas the most expensive Korean movie that far. Copied some Matrix stuff too, like the bullet dodging scene. :D It did not explain literally any of the system, though. There just were stats running in the screen every now and then when he leveled up and stuff.
