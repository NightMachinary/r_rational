** Have you published your series about the magical nurse anywhere? I think an acquaintance of mine would appreciate it.

EDIT: Actually, I found them both. Do you mind if I upload them somewhere, since right now they're only available privately?

*** Oh man, I'm assuming you mean Physics of Magic? Blast from the past! I super don't mind if you upload somewhere. (FYI that that series is pretty long-abandoned and unlikely to get finished, and has probably long since slipped into the uncanny writer valley of "things I am embarrassed to have written.")

I self-published the first book on Amazon at one point (though I don't think I actually get any money for it because I never figured out all the tax information I was supposed to put in): [[https://www.amazon.com/Magical-Delinquents-Physics-Magic-1/dp/1499367139/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545079248&sr=8-1&keywords=magical+delinquents+miranda+dixon-luinenburg]]
