Precommitments are a popular idea among rationalists and in rationalism, I've noticed. Do you have any that have helped you in your life?


** I tend to use "micro-commitments" -

I email people saying when I will send the next update, so that I need to make progress by then.

I make public commitments to do specific actions, so that I feel compelled to follow through.

I tell friends I'm working for the next X hours, and won't be on chat / reddit / etc. and so I don't violate it since it's easy for them to notice if I failed to follow through.

Like now - I'm going to publicly mention that I will get off of Reddit until this afternoon (PST) - and anyone should be able to see if I didn't do so.

**** Taking the weak side of an argument is generally just a really bad idea -- basically the definition of rationalization.

If it had more evidence than the opposing view, it would be stronger as a result. So if you notice yourself doing this a lot, getting worked up in defense of the objectively weaker side of the debate, it's a warning sign that you aren't being rational.

"Weaker position" for the sake of this rule can sometimes refer to the entire framework assumed by the argument (the manner in which certain political debates involve two horribly naive viewpoints in collision, debates on the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin, etc.). So it can apply as "never deliberately take either side in a horribly naive argument" in that case.

Steelman arguments (intending to clarify how someone's flawed argument can be viewed positively without actually agreeing with it) are not an example of actually taking the weak side, but more a case of attempting to understand more fully the flaws thereof (including its appeal). If you didn't see flaws, you'd be agreeing/advocating, not steelmanning.

Similarly, "taking" a seemingly weak position for the sake of making sure all options are explored -- playing the devil's advocate -- is not properly described as taking a weak position for the sake of this rule either; it's essentially the same as steelmanning, attempting to uncover flaws in a position you don't actually hold in order to add a level of sophistication / force opponents to clarify theirs to escape the hole you have dug for them. (If you are /actually/ the devil, i.e. the argument does not appear weak to you, you aren't playing the devil's advocate at that point, but merely advocating.)

This precommitment/rule basically just boils down to a (for me) more intuitive version of "be rational, don't believe stuff that isn't so, update when you have evidence, don't depend on cached reasoning" and so on. But it's also a useful heuristic, as my physiological and emotional reactions can clue me in when I don't have the amount of evidence the position requires to be considered reasonable.

***** Hmm I guess this was a misunderstanding then, when you said "deliberately" I understood this as taking an opinion for an argument while knowing that it is probably wrong.

*** That sounds like it would have the problem of having the set of precommitments you will pretend to have made in the past depend on your future thoughts - your enemies being able to influence your past precommitments (by influencing your thoughts (by influencing your situation or talking to you)) seems like a vulnerability.

*** I don't understand why this is practically different than saying something like "I try to make the smartest possible decision." That sounds pretty nice, but is of course mostly contentless. I don't think this what you mean - I think I'm missing something in the disconnect between the facts that A) precommitments (the vanilla flavor, that actually happen in advance) are often (in practice) efficacious because you have set in place external pressure to incentivize something, like, say, the scheduled checkup with a colleague as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, and B) you simply don't have these consequences set up in advance with your strategy. What's missing in my understanding? How do you implement this strategy in a way that it actually does work; what does this UDTist approach look like from the inside?

  An *inherently funny word* is a word which can be found amusing without any given context, for reasons ranging from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia][onomatopoeia]] to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonosemantics][phonosemantics]]. Such words have been used by a range of influential [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian][comedians]] to enhance the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humor][humor]] of their routines.

  It is part of the mythology of actors and writers that the consonant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive][plosives]] (so called because they start suddenly or "explosively") /p, b, t, d, k/, and /g/ are the funniest sounds in the English language.

I suppose it depends on the context and delivery. :) I'd say "generally dodging said question, and preparing ways to tactfully do so" would generally be more useful - all a precommitment grants you is the ability to shut it down completely - if you resort to employing it, it'd hard to avoid being rude. (Sorry to nitpick. I don't really have any right to do so.)

** Precommitment can work as signalling to a political group, in that following through on it can incur costs that would not otherwise be borne. At least in that sense, the 'draft for a libertarian compact' I once wrote, and which can be seen at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/sketches/JustCompact.jpg]] , helped me to feel associated with other members of a political group I wished to be a member of at the time.

(In case you're curious, it was before I was clearly aware of the differences between left/social/civil libertarianism and "markets are always better than government" right-libertarianism. This probably isn't the best thread to cover that, so I'll just point to [[http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html]] .)

I haven't come across any particular reason to renounce that particular precommitment, and it covers certain basic aspects of participating in civil society, so it's at least arguably still in effect, though of little practical consequence.
