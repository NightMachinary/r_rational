Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** *What makes a work rational-adjacent?*

All works that are rationalist are rational. All works that are rational are of interest to the rational fiction community (at least in theory.) But there exist a large segment of works that are of interest to the rational fiction community in general that aren't strictly rational or rationalist. We call these works "rational-adjacent."

I think I've identified a few qualities that make a work rational-adjacent, even despite the fact that they definitely don't qualify as rational.

The most important, by far, is that the work must be driven by *Character Agency*. That being the ability for character to make their own decisions, based off their own goals, wants, needs, and personality. This is very similar to tenet #1, and that's not a coincidence. Rational/ist fiction, since the days of HPMOR and lesswrong, has been fundamentally empowering. Main characters typically struggle against entropy, death, irrationality, the Social Order ^{TM,} or what-have-you. And while the main character isn't always expected to /succeed/, the basic contract of many rational works is that a reader can expect the choices of the characters (main or otherwise) to matter. The author won't have Fate running everything behind the scenes, and if the story is a Shaggy Dog story, it's because the characters has explicitly coordinated to make it so.

That contract is reflected with rational-adjacent works, and to an extent, even magnified. Character actions are guaranteed to matter, even if they probably shouldn't be. Take Isekai works, for example. Very, very few are rational, but they still get a fair bit of traction in [[/r/rational]] because (at least according to my theory), among other things, it's gratifying to watch a character who has the ability to affect significant change on the world around them. Even if (especially if) the plot revolves around their fate to be hugely influential people, and they have plot armor defending them from fatal consequences.

As an example, I recall mooderino's [[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/5288/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis][How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis]] getting some traction here, despite being pretty explicitly non-rational. Because H---B is heavily driven by the decisions made by the main character, we put away our "not sufficiently rational" glasses.

Character Agency even helps soften the impact of works violating rules #2 and #3 of rational fiction. It's less irritating for a character to act irrational, apply their knowledge unintelligently, luck into solving their problems, and be driven by less-than-perfectly-convincing motivations so long as, from the perspective of the reader, it seems like the /character/ is doing these things, as opposed to the author making the character do these things to support some element of the plot.

Look at Coil from /Worm/. He's pretty much straight megalomaniacal douchebag, what with the [[#s][spoilers]] thing and the [[#s][spoilers]] thing. But it's not /Wildbow/ that makes Coil a douchebag; that's all on him. He makes the explicit decision to be a not-nice guy, and that's OK. Worm is rational-adjacent because of (among other reasons) the fact that this is how all the characters operate. They're not all smart, they're not all rational, but they're still making decisions for themselves. (Well, except for that one time...)

The second important element must be that the setting of the world must have *non-real-world setting mechanics*. That is, stuff like magic, or futuretech. I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mvsux/d_rationalist_fiction_that_takes_place_in_the/drxftmr/][earlier]] arguing that rational fiction with a real-world setting is redundant because nothing simulates the real world better than itself. Rational-adjacent fiction, not being as constrained as rational fiction, can in theory have a real-world setting, but I don't think I've ever seen real-world fiction being discussed by [[/r/rational]].

Part of that is simply the fact that real-world fiction just tends to be discussed elsewhere, part of it is that it's immersion-breaking for most real-work protagonists to have full character agency (How do they have so much time and money? Do they not pay taxes? Are they trust-fund babies? What?), but a lot of it simply stems from the initial conditions of the rational-work fandom. We're predisposed to like fantasy and sci-fi works anyways, and as a community that contains a lot of would-be munchkins, it's a lot more fun to watch someone mess with a ruleset that hasn't had all of its low-hanging fruit taken.

And these setting mechanics don't necessarily have to meet rule #4. As readers, we want to know enough to munchkin them; self-consistency is much less of a requirement.

I wanted to put another big section here, but I realized that that was just my inclination to have at least 3 items to make a list. There are other elements likely to make a work rational-adjacent, but they're less important. Here's a list of the ones I thought of:

- Presence of violence/combat in plot (empowerment)
- Reasonably small core group of characters, relative to work length (increases the ability for each character to have character agency.)
- One overarching plot, as opposed to more episodic arcs. The overarching plot doesn't necessarily need to be obvious at the start of the work, so long as it's obvious at the end. (I'm not actually sure why this is true.)
- Main character has scientific/technical background. (Self-insert potential, mostly.)
- Work is online serial fiction. (Technically not anything to do with rational-adjacency, but accessibility makes us a lot more likely to discuss it.)

Does anyone else have anything to add/disagree with?

*** I agree that I've definitely seen these qualities a lot in works I'd consider rational-adjacent, and they're at least a pretty good predictor of things that I would enjoy.

I'm thinking about the difference between the presence of com/bat/ vs. the presence of con/flict/, and while I do think that the difference is a factor I can't articulate why. Is it something about fight scene choreography? something about physical power, as opposed some other kind of power or control? Is it just something that flows naturally from the kinds of settings that the works take place in?

--------------

Little progress on the app this week, but some interesting design concepts were discussed as pertains to formulating a sense of progression and difficulty ramping.

On the [[/r/rational]] Discord server, we occasionally run a Minecraft server when the mood strikes us. This most recent time (which is still running, details in the #minecraft_server channel if you want to hop on) I ended up running the server as I had the itch to play.  It's been a few years since I last did this, and I absolutely adored some of the mods in the Billionaire pack that we ended up using.  Tinker's Construct in particular appeals to me; I quite enjoy the concept of building a smeltery and the fine-tuned control you get over building the individual pieces of your tools and weapons (much better than vanilla's enchantment system, by far).

However, after building a large smeltery and constructing all the patterns and moulds necessary for any item I might want to build, and then forging a fine set of bows, arrows, swords, and pickaxes, I was struck with the feeling that my ability to equip myself absolutely dwarfed any ability that the world had to challenge me.  I went out and slaughtered mod-boosted zombies and skeletons by the dozens, with pretty much no risk to me at all.  I brought this up with some of the more experienced Minecraft players on the server, and the answer was basically “well, go find some challenge.  Some of the mods let us summon bosses.”

This strikes me as inherently...plastic.  Fake.  I was suddenly pulled out of the game's immersion and reminded that I was essentially in a theme park, going from attraction to attraction, meeting some small standard of competence before being ushered onto the next ride.  Nothing was ever going to ambush me, there were no threats looming over my head that I needed to prepare for, and so long as I stayed in our vetted and protected areas (or wasn't a complete idiot if I /did/ leave), I was never going to die again.

While mulling over the problem, I was reminded again of my appraisal of Terraria when I first played it: “Minecraft as it /should/ have been, but in 2D”.  Terraria has most of the same strengths as Minecraft: very deep creative control, exploration, ability to automate survival strategies, social multiplayer, mod support.  However, there's one thing that it absolutely nails that Minecraft just doesn't grok: a sense of /tension/ or /motivated progress/.

I decided to see if I could find out what exactly Terraria did to give me this impression, and it turns out there's a surprisingly simple formula that the game appears to follow.  

First, Terraria's gameplay is divided into discrete eras, connected by what I'll call /transitions/.  Each era is characterized by different monster spawns, random events, loot, NPCs, and other factors which overall define how difficult it is.  When first entering a new era, the difficulty spikes proportional to how bad your old equipment is suited to the new situations, but slowly over time as the player gathers better equipment and gets more experience the same old monsters simply don't stand a chance anymore. The difficulty curve looks something like this for each era:

[[https://i.imgur.com/1KoER42.png]]

Once the player has entered the tail there at the end, they can begin stockpiling resources and preparing to enter the next era, which is explicitly triggered via a transition, usually a boss fight at a fixed location or other set of manually-triggered circumstances.  In general, this is more or less the same as what Minecraft does, except that Minecrafts “eras” tend to be different dimensions (the Nether, the End, etc).  

Where Terraria differs is in what I'll call /milestones/, which are for the most part non-consensual.  Once you enter an era, you have a small grace period to get your act together and take on that era's milestones, but if you take too long they will start spawning at regular intervals and kicking your trash in until you finally deal with them.  Bosses are the most common kind of milestone, but there are also events such as invasions that require you to defend your base from waves of difficult enemies.  

These milestones transform the difficulty curve to look something more like this:

[[https://i.imgur.com/kzXb4bF.png]]

Considering that the underlying curve is still at your own pace, the fact that the milestones could drop at any moment (or it appears that way) lends a sense of urgency to what would otherwise lead to the meandering sort of pace that I don't like about Minecraft.  

There are two further caveats that Terraria adds on.  First, the very first transition is intentionally designed to be accidentally triggerable (unlike all the others that absolutely require deliberate action), meaning that an uninformed player is likely to be dunked into a difficulty spike without warning, which creates a sort of paranoia that the designers take advantage of without further explicitly repeating.  Second, the very last difficulty era has an “endgame” of epic proportions, which requires not one, not two, but six bosses to be fought consecutively, which at once offers a good challenge, a satisfying conclusion, and plenty of replayable opportunities to get ridiculous end-game loot.  

The entire game's difficulty curve thus looks something similar to this:

[[https://i.imgur.com/O9mvtCJ.png]]

The milestones that you cannot avoid confronting help keep the tension constant, even as the overall difficulty of the day-to-day activity goes down.  At the same time, a certain amount of player agency is preserved, as the world-changing era transitions are more or less under your control.  

--------------

So what does this have to do with Renegade?  Well, while I'm not against people faffing about and finding their own way in the sandbox, I definitely want there to be some core tension that gives meaning to a player's mastery (or lack of mastery) of the world and its rules.  There's a balance to be struck between being brutally unforgiving and full-open empty sandbox, and I think that aiming to modulate the difficulty and engagement to match the above graph is the way to do it.

Unlike Terraria, there are autonomous factors at play, a world that progresses, and occasionally some actual plot.  As such,I don't think that having a single unified progression path is the way to go for Renegade.  Instead, I'm going to attempt to have multiple such paths that follow the pattern, with consequences both good and bad for passing each transition, especially as pertains to affecting other paths.

My current (extremely) rough draft for some path ideas is here:  [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPBbrM9XRPto1UYcwrCNrwo3EWC-yt7Bje-LTMa0Bic/edit?usp=sharing]]

The championship circuit (i.e. collect badges) path is the most straightforward to translate, which simply involves adding challengers, rivals, and the public eye on you the more badges you obtain.  Others are more difficult to design for (and thus all the holes in the document), but all in all I think that this is a useful tool for plotting out some escalating stakes and difficulty/tension beats.  

Thoughts or comments on this concept would be most appreciated.

** I just finished /Dark State/ by Charles Stross, which is the second book in the second cycle of the Merchant Princes series. It's the middle book in the series, and while middle books in a trilogy are always a bit weak, this one ends on no less than /six/ different cliffhangers, which should be a crime. The final book is already written and slated for publication in a year, so that's not as bad as it could be, but my experiences with print publication have left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth -- I'm starting to think that it's just an inferior method of publishing serial works, but at the same time, serial works are some of the best sellers (for the same reasons that Hollywood does reboots, sequels, adaptations, etc.).

Is it really six? I count:

[[#s][Cliffhangers]]

I don't think you can get to six unless you're counting the different parts of the [[#s][A Cliffhanger]] (frankly, I think 1 and 2 arguably count as a single plot thread).

**** Spoiler tags, please.

How you count a cliffhanger depends on how you count plot threads. IMO, it's a cliffhanger if you leave a plot thread without a proper resolution, but that's expected for all but the last installment of any serial. In the case of /Dark State/, I expected one or two of the ongoing plot threads to not be resolved so that there would be something continuing on into /Invisible Sun/ -- halfway through the book, I thought those two would probably be 1) [[#s][]] and 2) [[#s][]], since those are two of the major throughlines started in /Empire Games/.

The [[#s][]] plotline is now divergent from [[#s][]], because those look very much like they'll have different resolutions (and I don't count [[#s][]] separately because they're very likely to have the /same/ resolution).

Other than the ones you listed, the other two I count are the [[#s][]], which I didn't expect to be wrapped up in this book, and [[#s][]], which ends on such a textbook cliffhanger (character being asked an important, defining question whose answer we're not given) that it annoyed me (plus bringing in the somewhat contrived, IMO [[#s][]] as a new plot thread right at the very end).

I think what irritated me most about /Dark State/ was how the few things that got resolved had several complications stemming from them, which undercut the joy of that resolution. It's a middle book, and middle books in a trilogy aren't /supposed/ to resolve everything, but this book hardly gave anything in the way of closure before it ended -- at best, it did "these conflicts are now in another phase".

Oops. Fixed now. Also, you've attached yours to blank text boxes, which might be intentional, but is not easy to read.

Anyway,

I wouldn't expect 1 or 2 to have been resolved in /Dark State/ at all. The question the trilogy as a whole is focused on is "how does the NAC develop into a stable, functional democracy and engage with the US on its own terms". Resolving [[#s][1]] and [[#s][2]] is the thematic through-line for the trilogy as a whole -- it's not really fair to call those a "cliffhanger" any more than its fair to say "the Empire still exists at the end of /The Empire Strikes Back/ was a "cliffhanger". Although looked at that way, it is kind of weird that [[#s][3]]).

I think it's possible that [[#s][spoiler]] has a different resolution from [[#s][spoiler]], but it probably has the same/a related resolution as [[#s][spoiler]].

[[#s][spoiler]] sure, but that's the core character arc, which gets resolved in the third act. I think the issue is that [[#s][spoilers]].

** Are there any well-accepted ways of comparing estimated probabilities of a discrete state (e.g. A/P or 0/1 for binary parameters, 0/1/2 for ternary, etc.) to the true value of that discrete parameter? Specifically, one of my current projects is a simulation study and one of its components is trying to determine how different degrees of model misspecification might bias my retrieval of the values of a set of discrete parameters in the true, data-generating model. I have samples from the joint posterior that give me probabilities for the presence or absence of the discrete param, e.g. under --

(technically, one might think of there being hundreds of millions of discrete parameters in the model I'm working with -- a major focal parameter is the topology of a tree, which for a strictly bifurcating tree with n tips results in 2^{n-1} possible bipartitions. The approximated probability almost all of these will be 0, since after considerable thinning I only collected like 20k samples per analysis lol, and even then ESS is less that that)

For eyeballing purposes, my first thought was to bin the probabilities, find the average probability of the samples in each bin, count up the proportion of times the corresponding parameter is truly 1 in the data generating model for each misspecification condition, and then make a scatter plot of the results, but I don't have enough replicates to give me good bins at, say, a 0.01 resolution, so I'd need something like 0.1 sized bins. Alternatively, I can imagine doing some sort of dodgy weighted averaging to fabricate points at tiny intervals, and then I'm sure there's something to do with summing the distances of the estimated probabilities to the true values. Besides eyeballing I could fit a binomial regression to the "raw data", but then I don't have any good intuitions for how to interpret parameter estimates under the usual link functions... but then could I just not use one, since my predictors are probabilities themselves, constrained to [0,1]? Although my "observations" wouldn't actually be independent, and I don't have a way to model that nonindependence... IDK, but I /would/ prefer to not reinvent any square wheels. Any thoughts? This seems like a really basic thing to do but some cursory google-fu is failing me, and I know some people here like to ask their inner hearts what it feels the probability of some discrete event occurring in the following year is and then see how well they did at the year's end for self-calibration purposes or whatever, which is the same sort of problem (I'm sure this pops up in stuff like weather forecasting, too, where you try to predict whether it will or will not rain in a given location on a given day).

edit: ahhhh hmmmm hold up, I think I found an answer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule]], e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score]], although that one obviously wouldn't work because 1/N ≈ 0

In a method similar to how you would normally evaluate calibration in standard classification problems, e.g. [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.html][here]] or my "eyeballing" example above? I can think of other ways to construct them in my case besides straight binning, e.g. try and fit a function across (0,1) for the true presents and absents (above some cutoff, since most bipartitions never appear in my sample from the joint posterior, so approximate posterior probabilities of improbably nodes aren't meaningful) and then just take the ratio of the height of the present function over the sum of their heights for each probability, though that sounds sorta hacky.

#+end_quote

Ah, I vaguely remember this from an old bayesian stats book, though even then a lot of the information theory stuff was not very rigorously presented.

I think an issue (here and for any sort of calibration curve) would be accommodating non-independence between each binary parameter, since there'll be a lot of overlap between the sets that comprise each bipartition (and in truth there's only a single discrete parameter with a vast statespace, rather than a billion or however many binary ones -- there are (2n-5)!! distinct topologies a strictly bifurcating tree with n tips can take, so e.g. 100 tips means 1.7E182ish alternatives).

In fact, I'm pretty sure the simulated data are sufficiently uninformative and the data-generating tree's topology sufficiently improbable that the latter never actually appears in my sample (so p ≈ 0 for the correct answer lol), and I don't think it would be proper to just find the product of probabilities of the "true" set of bipartitions. And then even if I could do that, I think I'd need to set some ad hoc cutoff below which I deem estimated probabilities meaningless.

Ideally there'd be some sort of comparable tree-specific measure I could use but afaik nobody has developed one yet (although I've not really familiar with the information theory stuff people do in my field, [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066063/pdf/syw042.pdf][e.g.]], so maybe they've worked something out.

** Does anyone here cry to anime that's dubbed, who watches both subbed and dubbed anime?

I want to write a post about certain scenes in fiction that have made me cry, two of which are anime scenes, and link to them, but I don't know whether I should specifically suggest/"restrict" viewers to the Japanese audio/english subtitles.

Despite growing up on anime that was dubbed in English (some of which /did/ have good voice acting), for the past few years I've found that I can barely stand English dubbed anime: the japanese voice actors not only seem able to inject far more emotion into their voices (specifically, they can do it without sounding cheesy to my foreign ears), but the written translation is often far better than the rewritten lines of dialogue, to me.

(This is not universally true, sometimes the dubbed dialogue is better, or just more clear in what's being communicated, but in my spot-check of emotional or important moments through the anime I've watched lately, it seems to be the case)

But if there are others here who have seen, say, the second episode of My Hero Academia and cried at the end like I did, but instead watched it with English dubs, then maybe it's just me and I don't have to worry so much about this.

*** I tend to have a similar response with Japanese media in general. My best guess is that this occurs because there's a slight delay between hearing/reading and understanding what's going on. So I focus more on the emotion of the voices first and then focus on the content of what they're saying.

Whereas in your native language, you kind of have to hear the emotion of what they're saying and the words themselves at the same exact time. Also the fact that we're (generally) unfamiliar with the words that are being said in Japanese makes them feel more novel than similar words said in English. We can't really tell if something is trite and overdone instinctively by hearing it in Japanese.

Also the Japanese voice actors have direct access to the original directors of the story and I imagine that makes a difference in their performances at times.

But that's just my guess for why Japanese stuff tends to affect me emotionally more.

**** I agree with this, though I think it's worth discussing whether subtitles can prevent the viewer from noticing or caring about elements they would otherwise view as shortcomings.

[[https://youtu.be/BvnsxCv8NLo][Explanation Point]] gave an example of how he assumed Attack on Titan had a lot more depth than he could pick up on, until he watched the dub and found the story and characters as bland as they appeared.

I can personally attest to how I found the comedic timing to be completely off in the Azumanga Diaoh dub, to the point where I thought it was some experimental artistic style, until I read the original comic strip.

However, when I watched Blend S subbed, another 4-koma adaptation, I was laughing at jokes that were awkwardly drawn out because my eyes moved back and forth from the subtitles at the right pace.

Digibro has [[https://youtu.be/R1zhW9lAIeY][talked]] about something like this [[https://youtu.be/zIVHXhbRrgs][twice]] in the context of shonen manga adaptations, where using the panels as a straight storyboard can reduce the impact of the imagery and dialogue.

This is probably something that varies from person to person based on personal preference and cultural expectations, I've heard dubs actually tend to have better lip-syncing, but I still think it's worth talking about.

***** You pose some good points.

I think definitely when it comes to dialogue, subs can make me forget how corny what someone is saying is.

Hearing something like "Everybody let's do our best!" sounds much lamer in English than hearing "Ganbatte Mina-san!" in Japanese and reading the same thing.

Though I think for me personally it's a bit more confusing because I actually do understand a lot of Japanese (I'd say I'm around an intermediate level of understand) so while I'm reading subtitles I'm also listening out for what the characters are actually saying. It kinda muddles the waters for me.

****** I once heard Geoff from Mother's Basement mention how learning some Japanese helped him enjoy the comedic timing in Konosuba, which may have kept me from enjoying every joke since I definitely didn't laugh as much as he did.

At the same time, I've also gotten more used to corny dialogue since I watched Gurren Lagaan dubbed just as I was coming out of a really bad depression. A lot of the time I need silly escapism with recognizable archetypes learning a simple lesson in a goofy scenario to help ground me.

**** Yes to all this, that's pretty much my understanding of it too. I'm just curious to know to what degree it effects others the same way.

It probably matters less for stories that are less vocally emotional too: like there wasn't a lot of shouting or crying in Cowboy Bebop, it relied more on the setting and music to communicate its tone, so the english dubs never really came off as trite or overdone.

*** I usually watch with subs, because that's what the majority of anime have available, and even when dubs are available, they're sometimes trash. Still, there have been a number of times that I've found dubbed anime emotionally moving (/Your Lie in April/, /Your Name/, lots of the Ghibli stuff), and I don't /think/ there's much of a difference for me.

***** I highly doubt they would prefer to modify it. I think you'd have to actually do the experiment because, why would they ever even think to do that? I certainly wouldn't have thought to do that in an equivalently reversed case - would you ever suddenly decide it was time to watch Game of Thrones in Japanese, or even considered that as a choice? Also I suspect this is going to vary by reading fluency - If the general population liked reading subtitles better it would already be a thing - but it's not, because I think unlike people who hang out on internet forums such as this one most people don't actually read much faster than the spoken word. And if they're anglophone anime lovers they're also people who appreciate "foreign" things. I think you'd have to find people who fit some very, very specific demographic characteristics to do any real investigation on the question of whether some people liking subs over dubs is due to those people liking subs inherently vs those people finding dubs inadequate as translations.

*** I wouldn't say I /cried/, but it's still one of the most emotionally impactful scenes in the series for me and, from what I've heard, they changed basically nothing about the scene between versions. Dubs are the default for me because I find listening to and reading dialogue to be very different experiences, but that might have something to do with being autistic.

The only anime so far where I willingly switched from dub to sub was School-Live! since I found Yuki's voice grating, though I've liked the actress in other roles, but found that the subtitles led me to focus more on the direction and visual storytelling that I hadn't appreciated before. The dialogue was suddenly as simple as it needed to be.

I switched to the sub of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because the dub for Stardust Crusaders is incomplete and, for all of the dub's awkward line delivery, I find the subtitles a bit distracting from the gonzo visuals. I also can't tell if the Japanese voice actors are hamming it up the way the Americans were so I'm laughing less while watching it, even if the “engrish” cracks me up.

So I think there are circumstances where dubs and subs can both be superior experiences, though I'm only willing to go through the effort of trying both if I think I'm missing out due to the way dialogue is delivered. I don't think I would've enjoyed One Punch Man's snappy deadpan in Japanese or Blend S's 4-panel-style gags in English (the former is much funnier FYI).

*** In my experience it really depends on the specific sub or dub. I can more readily think of emotionally moving Japanese examples, but that is probably because subs make a larger pool to draw from. I found the penultimate scenes in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be more moving in English. Planetes seemed different but equally compelling in both languages. I struggle to take Shinji seriously in any version of Evangelion....

I'd probably link to the language I prefer, watch it in both languages just to check, and put in a note if I still felt uncertain after seeing both. It can't be helped that the voice acting varies by series and by language.

I'm very interested in the post you want to write.

*** Semi-pro poker player here.

The most important concepts are pot odds (and all its implications for poker theory), bankroll management, preflop hand selection (you should be folding most hands, and raising with the very best hands -- you should call much much less often than most players do). Also very important is understanding the two major reasons to bet (bluff and value bet).

*** All my tips assume you're just playing casually (i.e., with some friends on friday evening) and in-person, as opposed to online against professionals or people who want to be professional.

It's pretty common for people to make riskier bets the longer the game goes on. Especially if they have very few chips left. At some point, people just want the game to end. That means that big bets late game are more likely to be bluffs (or at least not correspond so much to the actual quality of an opponent's hand), and also that opponents are more likely to call bluffs late game. Be aware that you'll have the same inclinations. Be as thrifty with your cash when you've doubled your starting amount as when you've halved it.

An excellent tactic is to ask someone close to being out of chips /exactly/ how many chips they have left, to imply that you're considering kicking them out of the game. Whether that's a bluff or a double bluff depends on your hand and their personality.

Don't heedlessly chase flushes. You might think "there's four clovers in play already, which means that there's a 1/4 chance of getting another in the next card." That is, of course, false. At least 4 of 12 clovers are out of contention, plus however many your opponents hold in their hands. If you think an opponent is chasing the same flush as you, then it is rather unlikely that either of you will get it. That being said, you have the best chance at a flush when you have two of a suit in hand, two of that suit are on the table, and you think your opponents aren't going for the flush. Alternatively, if you have one of a suit, and there are three of that suit on the table, and someone folds /after/ the third of the suit shows up, that means it's very likely that both their cards are off-suit, improving your chances..

The more players on the table, the better the best hand will be. With 2-4 players, you'll see a lot of best hands that are high card/pair. With 5-7 players, you'll see a fair number of three-ofs, straights, and flushes. I've never played with more than 7 players, and I don't think it's particularly feasible. So if you're playing with more people, be more willing to fold, even at a loss.

If you win after everyone folds, /never/ show your hand. In fact, never show your hand except when you have to. Don't talk about what's in it, even after the fact, unless you intend to lie. You need to create doubt over how responsive you are to the state of your own hand.

Try to establish a fake tell. It'll need to be pretty obvious to work against amateurs, and it'll only help a bluff work once (unless you're /really/ good at acting, and won't advertise the fact that it was a bluff after everyone folds). But oh boy will it be a satisfying bluff.

I'm finally doing something about my inability to focus on long-form cognitive tasks (most notably, writing) and getting evaluated for ADHD on Monday. It's a psychometric called the Quotient ADHD system; anyone know anything about it? theunitofcaring's tumblr post at the end of last year about the experience of going on medication was really encouraging, and despite the fact that I know not to expect a panacea, I'm still /hoping/ for a quality of life improvement.

Depression continues to kick my ass, though. Paths to long-term life goals seem obscured and unlikely, and given the state of the world it's unclear that I even /should/ pursue the goal of having children. Rationaltumblr is full of proud parents blogging about it, so that's weak evidence it's a worthwhile goal regardless, but honestly the true reason driving me is "I don't know what Large Thing I'd do with my life otherwise." A highschool friend of mine connected to the rationalist community killed herself the other week, which, while not driving me to suicidal-ness myself, is at least forcing me to spend a lot of time thinking about it and what would drive one there.

The Honor Harrington series of space opera is unreasonably sprawling and slow-moving at this point, but I picked up the latest book of the side series /Manticore Ascendant/ this week and /really/ liked it. I am now way more invested in this side series and its crew than I am in the main plotline.

*** I've been on medication to deal with my ADHD since 3rd grade, I can tell you that how much your quality of life improves depends a lot on the medication. I swear by Stratera - it's always worked the best for me, but it's difficult to manage if you're the forgetful type like I am. One type of medication I recently tried to switch to is Vyvanse, but it makes me paranoid and when I'm on it, I tend to bring that paranoia into my decision-making.

The effects of each medicine vary from person to person, but if you find one that works for you it can be a real life-saver. I went from an almost-failing student to wildly successful when I started taking my medication, but after years of taking it the influence is more subtle.
