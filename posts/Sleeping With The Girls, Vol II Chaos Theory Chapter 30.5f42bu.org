** For anyone who needs the link, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Volume I]] is here.

For anyone ignorant of the premise, it's about a self-insert who keeps bouncing from one fiction story to another. So there are lots of crossovers here. Background knowledge of the involved works helps, but are not necessary. Note Volume II is a direct continuation of Volume I.

Summaries from fanfiction.net:

- Volume I - Experimental Author Fantasy Corruption Scenario: What happens when the author plays the Self Insert role straight? Without embellished charisma, physical attributes, or abilities beyond their capability in real life? AKA: I'm normal. Let's find out!

- Volume II - The experiment continues. What are the side effects of one's pressence if you give it a little time to percolate? Think you can call the shots?
