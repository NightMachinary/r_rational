Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I seem to have run into an issue regarding what happens when you have a galaxy with multiple intelligent civilizations, ubiquitous FTL, but only one civilization surpassed K1 by the time of said FTL, meaning that said civilization outpopulates all the others combined by a factor of 2000, being generous to the smaller civilizations.

It's supposed to be a tentative Pax Galactica, where technology permits nondestructive solutions to a majority of problems that would otherwise be resolved through violence, effectively post-scarcity, the lowest population worlds extra peaceful courtesy a mix of native culture, the tech, and probably convenient timing of contact.

Aside from such a massive population ruining some plot-points, it raises a few issues, the most glaring of which is the massive power imbalance. There's US states getting 2 senators when a couple cities outpopulate some states, then there's 2000:1, or more accurately, 200000:120:20:15:5. I could put half of the big civ into Virtual Utopias and the problem would be unaffected.

There's also the slight problem of whether or not any propulsion lasers still exist, or how difficult it would be to police their production. The level of Orwellian surveillance necessary to track everything that could be used to sneak off, build a superweapon, and bring it home is mindboggling. (FTL is designed such that it does not work as kinetic weapon, there is somewhat Orwellian surveillance in place to catch more easily-detected locally-made weapons, nothing that could stop someone from flying off somewhere, making a bunch of gunpowder, and coming home with viable gunpowder weapons, but those would be caught before entering effective range. By the time anyone notices that someone brought a megalaser home, it doesn't seem implausible that it could have already been fired.)

It also seems likely that, due to the numbers, these people would be a supermajority /everywhere/, unless there is a strong disincentive to emigrate or vacation to certain places. I can imagine a "minimal impact" policy that would discourage supermajorities of this group from popping up on inhabited planets, but I don't want them to just not be elsewhere /at all/. If there's some kind of quota system, I'm not sure how it would be enforced, or how the enforcers would decide who gets to go to a protected place.

I'd also like to minimize things that look like totalitarianism, and while I can see FTL-capable vehicles being manufactured with automated reporting, and /maybe/ (big maybe) some way to be overridden remotely, actually using that for anything short of preventing terrorism and warcrimes is anti-preferred. It probably helps that, while things overall are post-scarcity, FTL-capable vehicles might still be costly to obtain. Given a K2-sized civ that could use FTL to set up production anywhere, I'm not sure how believable that is, but I suppose production might be artificially limited due to the impossibility of effectively policing.

I'm sure there are other issues not coming to mind at present. Feedback on how to deal with this is appreciated.

*** Here's the vague outlines of an idea.

The most populous civilization - let's call them the Heralds - was the one to develop the FTL and distribute it to the other civilizations.

The Herald's FTL engines are obtusely designed and basically unserviceable except by trained Herald technicians. The technicians are almost cult-like in their secrecy. There are plenty of alien firms who have built knockoff drives, but those are still heavily based on the Herald Drives, and the software is just a straight copy. The knockoffs tend to be unreliable, and the Heralds refuse to service drives that weren't made by them, so the knockoffs aren't very common anyways.

The minority civilizations grumble about this economic control, but the Heralds provide the engines at a fair price and repair them incredibly cheaply, so there isn't a strong economic incentive to invest the huge amounts of capital needed to R&D a new non-herald design from scratch. (And the Heralds sabotage such projects.)

Why all this effort to maintain control of the FTL engine tech? Because each engine has the mind of a Herald inside. Choose either an AI based on a scanned Herald mind, or some sort of nasty biotech stuff, depending on your preferred aestethic.

These engineminds monitor the cargo of the ships they're warping, and if they catch a whiff of anthing dangerous (like a megalaser), well... everyone knows that FTL ships just sometimes never arrive at their destination. Oh well. That's a danger of the technology.

That's why there are states (as well as The House). And now I'm wondering how the other branches work. (Judges?)

How fast is FTL? (IRL, ruling Earth might take more than 1 army because you can only get around so fast.) This, and how far apart habited/habitable planets are will shape a lot of things.

*** Here's an idea - FTL provides travel to another world which (at least within the galaxy) has costs (both time and money) largely /independent/ of the location of the start and end points.

Along with that, far-future terraforming technology is more than capable of (with large but not unattainable resources) terraform any world in the galaxy.

The net result of this is that there are just /so many/ habitable worlds that there are plenty of easily accessible empty worlds; and that, in turn, means that a group of settlers with a unified vision can pool their resources to create a colony on any world that they choose, running under any philosophy that they choose. Petty tyrants can create one-world slave empires, people can create societies where social position is defined by skill at Go, or whatever.

In this way, it's easy to imagine a few worlds which were purposely settled /without/ the supermajority civilisation - and unless they advertise their location, they won't be getting any immigrants either (unless a ship full of a new lot of settlers looking for an empty world pops up one day).

** How would a battle play out between a superpowered army consisting of only said superpowered infantry and a combined arms land force(Armor, artillery, infantry) of equal numbers? In this scenario, the superpowered army is assaulting an enemy city from the north.

The powers range from standard elementary powers to classic sci-fi energy shields (health bars, really) to 'hax' like teleportation and intangibility. In general, the firepower or protection offered by the powers are not significantly more powerful than the military equivalent, but packed within an infantry's associated cost and benefits. It is also notable that they haven't received much formal training, so a strategy would likely to be more effective if they played to the individual's strength rather than advanced military knowledge and steadfast discipline.

One likely plan of attack would be infiltration in my opinion. Send a small team of select powers to the city and scout out the positions, numbers and leadership, capturing important people and sabotaging where possible, eventually weathering down the opposition until a direct confrontation is trivial. However, I feel a strict entrance/exit control can easily shut it down without including power that is excessively powerful.

How would you suggest an order of battle?

  What I'd like help with is suggestions for sexual and non-sexual interactions that capture a sense of emotional awakening.
#+end_quote

I'm imagining a dialogue at the beginning of their interaction. The leaders (or interested parties if the amazons don't think in terms of leaders) are trying to decide whether to let him in or not. Before the discussion, to the MC's surprise, they invite him to be a part of it. He at least gets to contribute to the discussion of what will be done with him.

It is decided he will remain with them for a time. In light of the fact that his death would cause the apocalypse, he gets assigned guards. While learning the amazon's way of life over several days, he gets restless and bored. He doesn't hunt, he isn't skilled in non-hunting activities. He feels like he isn't contributing, and naturally he feels like he has to contribute to be of value (he grew up in the other cultures, after all.) The guards maintain their distance from him, knowing an emotional attachment to a man is a liability--but other members of the tribe might take advantage of having a willing reproduction partner in their midst. Traveling to the borders is a pain.

Reluctantly (his death would cause the apocalypse!) the guards agree to take him out on hunting expeditions so that he can stop feeling useless. He witnesses their approach to hunting, comes to terms with the fact that the merit-chosen amazon hunters are way better at it than him. Social interactions around the campfire abound. While he isn't the best hunter, he isn't the /worst/ either, and he befriends the companions over their shared work and interest in providing for the tribe. If he sleeps with one of them, it becomes a difficult situation--they similarly don't want an emotional attachment, he does. Maybe he decides to stop traveling with the hunting party when he realizes how much of a problem it would be to get monogamous feelings for one of the hunters.

Things are easier when they get back. The MC is now more enthusiastic about learning skills outside his comfort zone, having witnessed how the amazons foster growth instead of demanding competence. He starts to learn the patience and acceptance of the tribe in their endeavors.

Then something makes him leave.

  I wonder how much of their cultural norms he would actually intermalize
#+end_quote

That's a really good point. You could explain his restlessness as wanderlust instead of dissatisfaction, in that case--and maybe when he gets back, he has a new appreciation but never intends to stay.

#+begin_quote
  it carries a sense of secrecy, like such an encounter is clandestine and only likely to happen away from their society
#+end_quote

Wouldn't all of their encounters with men be that way? Indeed, deciding to go on a hunting trip might subtly signal that you want children--it would give you a reason to travel to the border. The actual man you meet would of course not be seen by most of your people, making it seem clandestine. "Hunting" to this society could have a double meaning.

Our hapless MC won't know he's volunteering to travel with a (higher than background rate) of women who want to reproduce or otherwise seek out men, which might be a fun surprise. He'll get a second surprise, when most of them prefer to wait for a greater selection rather than use him. After all, if they were actually interested in him as a reproductive partner, they would have asked him while he was at the village instead of bothering with the trip in the first place.

Or maybe most of the hunters he travels with like hunting for its own sake. The culture's double association with traveling isn't very likely to be universal, just like such associations in other cultures.

*** I'd have to wonder how open and empathetic these Amazons would be to having/helping a man in their territory. In order for a group of people to self segregate as these Amazons do, they'd have to have fairly strong opinions about their outgroup/s, I'm having trouble rationalizing how this wouldn't ultimately be driven by strong negative prejudices towards men. If you were to frame this by race instead of gender, the Amazons would essentially be an ethnostate which I think kind of de-romanticizes this scenario and alludes to what sort of people self segregate to this degree. I'm just imagining how a black person walking into a white ethnostate would be received and I'm not seeing empathy and acceptance. Perhaps the Amazons and the guy could use each other to work through their toxic ideologies and misconceptions together, but I could just as easily imagine the guy having his toxic ideas reinforced after being met with bigotry from the Amazons (which could be an interesting way to challenge him later in the story after having made progress away from his own toxic behaviors/beliefs). Maybe a matriarchal society would work better to represent what the Amazons are meant to represent without the baggage that a uni-gender society would carry? Also, if there's going to be polyamory that isn't purely between women, what sort of birth control is available, if any?

​

I guess my point is that for full segregation like they have, it's going to take a little more than minor cultural differences. Not allowing any men in their society would require them to believe all men are incapable, on a biological level, of integrating into their society, so much so that they are clearly getting rid of their male children (unless they only produce females?). Even if the segregation is somehow purely ideological, you could relate it to immigration bans on Muslims, and depending on your views there, it might not cast a very flattering light on the Amazons. If you're preventing anyone that subscribes to a specific ideology from entering your society you must think their ideology is extremely abhorrent, which is either because it is that abhorrent or there's bigotry involved (and the beliefs of the non-Amazons doesn't sound that bad).

​

>I'm curious why you ask.

Your description of the Amazon's society felt kind of bonobo-esque (very sexually active) but it also sounded like they only use men when they want babies. If you intend to have the guy have sex with the Amazons and for them to be open to this it's either cuz they want babies or they have some means of birth control so it isn't a factor, idk. Also, if the society is all female maybe they're aborting male children? I don't remember why I even asked that part.

******* Suppose the immigrant sneaks in and sets up camp near a village. Just to make things extra hard, suppose that his stated reason isn't wanting to trade, but wanting to be near his expecting lover from several months back--a woman of the tribe who also wants him near.

I imagine banishment for the male, option to leave for the female. Would they kill the squatter if he refused to vacate?

This sort of situation will arise. Probably not terribly often, but it will be something they need a protocol for--and a protocol that everyone knows, so that it doesn't usually get to "he could only be convinced to leave with force" stage.

Another question is, what does the tribe do to prevent male conceptions? If the method has a failure rate, how does it treat members of the tribe who accidentally conceive a male?

  It's interesting to think about but I'm doubtful that it's taking us toward meaningful story content.
#+end_quote

These kinds of questions are vital to the interactions and story you want to write.

If the culture of the Amazons weren't important to the story, then sure, you could just paint them as generically good and ignore the implications of their societal structure. That's fine.

But if you're interested in writing a story about a man overcoming his toxic masculinity and learning to value other people and cultures, then having those people and cultures be fully realized is pretty dang important. If you just set up a paper-thin society of woman whose entire existence revolves around furthering the growth of the main character (and having consequence-free sex with him?!), then you haven't fully internalized the message that you want to convey.

(By the way, is this story a Legend of Zelda fic?)

*** When designing these civilizations, I'd think about birth-rates, and what it takes to have a stable population.

Up until the modern era, the average woman had around 5-7 kids over her lifetime. This creates an /incredible/ amount of pressure for civilizations to expand. A farmer's first son might inherit his farm. But the 2nd and 3rd sons need to go out and find their own land.

Failing that, they become tenant farmers somewhere, and have to live on denser and denser plots of land, until they can't feed themselves. This is a major factor in why Europe was able to have so many wars. Sure, war sucks. But if the alternative is slow starvation as a subsistence farmer, war gets more appealing.

So, my first question is why your Amazons haven't had their lands annexed by their faster-growing neighbors.

You could do it. Maybe the Amazons live on the other side of a river or something, and this provides a natural boundary line. The Amazons respond harshly whenever someone tries to carve out even a small farm in 'their' woods. But that's going to have a duality. You're nice to /your/ people, while being willing to murder the poor 3rd son of a farmer who's trying to get himself a half-acre of land and not hurt anyone.
