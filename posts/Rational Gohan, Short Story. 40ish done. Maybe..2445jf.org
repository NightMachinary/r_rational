** The topic of existential risk in the /Dragonball/ universe is a fairly interesting one. On the one hand, dragonballs. On the other hand, it's probably easier to make a list of characters who /can't/ blow up planets by sneezing.

** What coincidence, happened into this sub on a long chain of links and saw this. I wrote a storyline for a graphic novel not unlike Dragonball (which remains unpublished because the artist is lazy) that dealt with a lot of those ideas.

While Goku always bounced back from injuries with plot-like speed, the whole zenkai concept didn't really come into play until somewhere around issue 180 (around when the show transitioned over to Z). I suspect it was a quick way to retcon a lot of things for Toriyama and provide a way to for his protagonists to gain huge power in short periods of time (and the concept vanishes as inexplicably as it appeared along with any mention of numeric power levels after they started needing scientific notation).

In any case our story had nothing to do with DB other than being a similar flying kung fu laser brawl; but the rationalization for how a character increased the level of mystical spirit power they could utilize was simply through intense practice and experience. We also added an element of danger in that trying to channel too much of it could fry your mind or body and leave you permanently crippled, vegetative, or dead, so there was a well known reason for characters to be afraid of simply pushing themselves to the absolute limit repeatedly, as it was impossible to know where the exact, razor thin line between "I can" and "I'm dead" is.

When faced with do-or-die scenarios, several characters of course realize this and go for broke, however in the majority of cases they burned themselves out and accomplished nothing in the process.

Quite a bit of the interpersonal storylines involved the embittered old folks cautioning the brash youngsters against such excesses, as they had seen so many shooting stars flare out.

But yes, given zenkai and senzu beans, it really made absolutely no sense for Goku, Piccolo, and Gohan not to be beating each other half to death on an almost daily basis because unlike Bejiita or the various other villainous characters, they knew with great certainty they wouldn't actually kill each other. I'm sure Toriyama realized this but it probably would have seemed like cheating. Piccolo and Gohan could have hopped into the Seishi to Toki no heya for like, 20 minutes at any given time with a dozen senzu beans and come out with Gohan at whatever stage of super saiyajin was necessary for their current predicament. (in fact one of the biggest WTFs about the post-Cell storyline was that Piccolo apparently completely forgot about Gohan after Goku's second death and never even bothered to spar with him occasionally, leading to one of the most tragic cases of ruined character development I can remember in young adult fiction).

There's a similar rational line down to why the Namek warrior caste didn't practice fusing on a massive scale, because a half dozen of them together would have trivially defeated Friiza, and their species apparently lives thousands of years. The moral quandary of six individuals to secure a planet for millennia doesn't seem too rough.

*** You could probably get a nice fanfic out of writing a story about old Namek where warrior castes fused all the time and eventually people decided to forbid the practice because it led to the Namekian species nearly blowing itself up with super-ultra-Namekians fighting each other regularly.

*** That sounds like an interesting sort of story, besides the art not working what ever become of it?

I really liked Dragonball Z, and loved Dragonball, but they really did jump off the deep end pretty much right after the Saiyan Saga. Introducing "Power Levels" that were inconsistent from essentially every angle, the zenkai concept, the way gravity seemed incompatible with everything. (How is it that a man who can lift 50 ton boulders with ease and blow up planets and who canonically weights 80~ kg possibly give a shit about 100x gravity?)

I always justified it to myself by imagining Goku/Vegeta's bodies were made of absurdly dense material. Dense enough to fuck with the normal laws that govern how dense objects can possibly be, just to make the math work out with how strong they were compared to the environment vs. the numbers given. (Which is something I think I'm going to keep in any fanfiction I write, definitely anything close to "rational" fiction.)

Also, I have a couple plans for how zenkai is going to work to prevent it from being overpowered while keeping with it's canon usages. We'll see anyway.

**** It's still sitting in his queue, in theory, or for me to be independently wealthy enough to hire some folks to draw it to my specifications. He and I both grew up on the original manga and anime that got mailed in every month from his uncle in Japan, so it's somewhat of a personal project for us.

Best of luck with your attempt to shoehorn it into something plausibly rational :)

** I'm sure many people have had the idea, but I don't know where to find it if it's ever been done before. Gohan attempts to exploit the strange nature of the DBZ universe.

*** I'm also interested to see where it goes. I've got some plans thought out, some are more ambitious than others lengthwise.

I've literally never written a work of fiction longer than a two page English essay, so I'm fairly terrified of biting off more than I can chew. (Hence the five chapter mini-story.)

Any thoughts? Characters you want to see, suggestions on any and everything? Critiques? I'm a blank slate where this is concerned, virtually anything you can say is valuable.

No pressure.

**** I think it's going remarkably well so far considering your inexperience with writing fiction :) It explains the roughness to the prose, but that'll fade with revisions and experience.

I really like the way you're describing Ki, as it's exactly how I always envisioned it. Having to actively reinforce certain parts of your body makes perfect sense considering the way the characters in the show's toughness so wildly varies at times.

I am curious to see how Vegeta reacts to this. Remember, he did in fact think of himself on Namek, so I always found it odd that he never brought it up again later in the series. Even without Dende, he did know about the existence of senzu beans, after all.

Minor thing: Korin says "I don't want to trust you kid. But I've made the same mistake with your father." What he means by this isn't immediately clear; on the surface it sounds like a contradiction. Maybe think of rewording it?

** 40%? Aww. This idea deserves more than 5 chapters. It's too good to end!
