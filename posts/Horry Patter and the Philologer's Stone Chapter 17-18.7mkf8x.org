** These are short, but already tons to look at. It seems my prediction that Future!Horry removed Present!Horry's soul for some reason might be correct, though I suppose we don't know precisely when Horry's soul vanished. It sounded sort of like Horry's abuse at the hands of the...Durbleys? (I've forgotten them already) might have something to do with this.

In any case, Alvin feels he has already failed monumentally. Considering that we have /no idea at all/ what the grander conflicts in this story might be, this may or may not be a horrifically bad thing. The people of this world seem unusually attached to the idea that all of their actions are predecided, so I am unsure if Voltebort-he-who-must-be-named should be thwarted or not.

*** #+begin_quote
  Loose threads weave through the boy on a far distant roof---still as glass in a slice of spacetime, points of rain frozen around him---and the threads wind suddenly into nothingness.

His soul vanished on a roof in the rain. We know only one scene on a roof.

**** Alvin's eye can see the past. So, if on the rooftop future!Horry managed to swap souls with present!Horry, that likely explains Alvin's observance of Horry's soul suddenly disappearing and a new soul replacing it from nowhere. The soul lines are unbroken, they just cross a temporal boundary that Alvin can't see across.

Is present!Horry now a horcrux for future!Horry?

** Bleh. Too short. I've found that updates need at least 1,000 words in order for the readers to not start complaining about shortness. The author would have done better to combine them all into one chapter.

*** Yeah, this is at least half my fault. Fanfiction.net was refusing to accept new chapters, so I had to edit an old document, and stick the text of the chapter in it. This screwed up all the formatting, so after I was halfway through fixing the formatting through (what will be parts 1-4), it was eaten by a failed update.

Then I ragequit and just posted what now is part 1, because I still had that saved. I may eventually rejoin them all into 1 chapter, but I didn't want to post /nothing/ yesterday. They've since fixed the updating bug.

*shrug* Well, it's not like you're on a deadline or anything. We wouldn't have known (or cared) if you'd taken an extra day or two to get all 4 parts together.

*** He used his Eye's past-gazing power to follow Horry's timeline back to whence his soul came. Apparently, this path leads to space, suggesting that either that's where they originally come from, or the trails that objects leave to his Eye are imprinted on the aether that Earth travels through.

He then identifies the point at which Horry's soul vanishes to be on a roof in rain.
