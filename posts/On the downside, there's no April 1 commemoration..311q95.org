  In my time here, I noticed your timeline has a bit of a problem with nonsapient diseases. Not to worry! We're going to fix that for you right quick!

*** Well soon, you can ask them! Our homeworld's Kernel runs Updateless Decision Theory, so we enforce the equality of /all/ life-forms, because Updatelessly, we could have been /any/ of them. So you should get ready to negotiate over how you'll split up the available mass.

***** Because they're agenty enough to count as optimization processes for the Kernel's purposes. We know this was a really conservative move on our part, but there's not much we can do about it at this stage of ultraintelligence.

You think we should have programmed it for the Updateless Intelligence Metric-extracted utility function of every particle in the universe?

My diseases keep me company with no regard for themselves. If you make them sapient, they'll start /judging me./
