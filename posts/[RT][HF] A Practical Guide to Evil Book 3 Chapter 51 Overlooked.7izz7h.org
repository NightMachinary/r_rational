** I liked this chapter. Glad someone called Catherine out on her "It's okay if people die because my cause is just" attitude.

*** The thing is with or without Catherine, people would still be dying, just at different times for different reasons. The rebellion was still going to happen, Heiress/Diabolist was still going to be Heiress/Diabolist, and the war with Procer is still going to happen. The only thing that might have been different would be the Fae invasion.

**** I'd argue Heiress was kinda caused by Black deciding to pick a Squire. NewEvil!Squire needs an OldEvil!Heir to oppose them according to Calamities kabbalah balance.

** As much as Cat may not feel like it, I think that was actually a very good and productive conversation with Hune. She was able to discover that the source of the issue is Hune's worldview as an ogre. Sure it wasn't a flowers and gumdrops ending to the first round, but you can't fix anything without knowing the problem. And expecting a thaw to long frozen relations after the first 5 minutes of honesty is kind of silly.

** Hune's point of view is quite reasonable. Her people get shafted by the current regime and Cat promises all sorts of changes but Hune's right to be sceptical. Cat's already shown that she can base her decisions on personal feelings so who's to say she won't back down on those promises later?

The way to solve this is to implement some sort of overarching plan. Kind of how the Legions were created as a way to give other races a way to move up, Cat needs to meet up with Malicia and negotiate some sort of social restructuring.

For all the talk of making things better Cat's done a remarkable job of breaking down the current system and not setting up anything new.

*** It doesn't really matter what system or plan Cat sets up, the distrust is generational. Short of in universe blood pacts (which I feel would have been either commonly used, or commonly magic'd into breaking) there's no way for Cat to demonstrably signal commitment to ogreish fair treatment, until she's already given them what they want, post war. She needs the payment in blood and trust up front but her coin is no good.

*** Nah, she has to be around to offer opposition at a critical point, only to be persuaded or forced to comply.
