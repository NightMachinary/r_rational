*** I love how here Naruto is a genius of technique construction and a trained kid-soldier, but in these things he's still a naive twelve year old.

There's this trend in works where the protagonists are supposed to be intelligent, especially young and brilliant, of writing them basically as adults. I'm happy LUTD manages to avoid this pitfall.

**** Huh? If anything, it's extremely unrealistic for a 12 year old to be this unaware of sex. And I mean any 12 year old, not even a smart one. In the real world, this would be indicative of a developmental issue. This is a classical trap of adults writing children while forgetting what children are actually like at certain ages.

***** You mean that the child who was shunned by his whole community -with a high ranking figure explicitly out to alienate him-, who only talked with the Hokage -who could give him approximately as much time as the POTUS can his children-, with an unspecified parental figure -who is implied to have been dead for some years-, and later with only one of his teachers -mostly during class ours-, could have ended up with developmental issues/severe gaps in his knowledge?!

Nah, I can't see how that would be possible.

Ok, sorry, sarcasm out, but I don't get how that would be surprising. Remember that, at the same age, LUTD!Hinata has a fairly good grasp of sexuality.

******* Sure, but, first, this is not canon, it's AU, and it's not like canon ever claimed to be the pinnacle of rationality and self-consistency. Second, the sexy jutsu is a naive technique that shows a naive understanding of sexuality. Third, ninjas are supposed to seduce people too, but not kids (in this fanfiction). You will remember during Kakashi's trial that everyone in the court was scandalised such a young child had used seduction against the enemy, the Hokage had to remind everyone about the Hidden Stone "scandal", and pointed out that is was a diffused practise during the warring clans period (implying that it's not done anymore).

******** Historically marriage age was often when puberty came. It's a little bit bullshitty that backwards warlike societies like these without modern medicine they would think like us on these issues.

But of course fiction has to please the reader and not many would probably enjoy too much realism.

But anyway, I didn't even suggest they should go seduce people as fresh genin. Just that they should /know/ about that kind of stuff and definitely learn something about both seduction and sex in academy.

********* I've heard from many sources that this belief about marriage historically coming very soon is more of a modern day myth, and that aside from rare cases where nobles and empires were involved, marriage actually came around what we would consider full teenage, like sixteen-nineteen. But then it's not like Naruto is set in ancient times. I'll point out that in Naruto international economy is flourishing (think of the deal with wave) when they're not at war, which explains why they can have convenience stores, fridges, air conditioners, radios and cameras. Naruto had a photo taken for his ninja ID at the very start of the manga and the photo was ready in a matter of hours/a day. And they are actually capable of treating illnesses basically at our level or beyond. Sakura was capable of treating an unknown poison on the go. Tsunade cured a spinal fracture. They performed eye surgery on the field! Orochimaru created human clones, spliced DNA and they kept a kid with a chronic bone infection alive for years! Maybe they are warmongers, but they aren't backwards.

Well, it's in different world. With obviously very weird tech levels jumping around. They don't have guns and vehicles, but do have radio tech and all kinds of futuristic stuff that works on chakra. I'd bet having magic around hinders tech too. Kishimoto said he didn't really think about consistent tech level, but that it would be somewhat before our time.

The world has just had two huge wars, like Kakashi fought on one of them and next one is coming, so when exactly is the economy flourishing? :s I don't think that world is really stable enough to become like ours in things like ethical thinking and society and stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Historically, the age of consent for a sexual union was determined by tribal custom, or was a matter for families to decide. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty: such as menstruation for a girl and pubic hair for a boy.[1]

  In Jewish oral tradition, men cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of majority of 13 years and one day and have undergone puberty. With no signs of puberty, they are considered minors until the age of twenty. After twenty, they are not considered adults if they show signs of impotence. If they show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry. The same rules apply to women, except their age of majority is 12 years and a day.[2][3]

  In Ancient Rome, it was very common for girls to marry and have children shortly after the onset of puberty. Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old.[4] In Roman law, first marriages to brides from 12 to 24 required the consent of the bride and her father; by the late antique period, Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.[5] The Catholic canon law followed the Roman law. In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.[6] Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry without their parents' approval.[7]

*********** WRT to all-over-the-place tech levels, I do have a little worldbuilding that makes it more plausible, but have yet to find a way to work it in. Ultimately, however, this is one of those things which you have to roll with at least a little bit if you want to write Naruto without gutting the setting.

If you think about it, it could be said that one of the biggest strides forward of the world's economy has been the introduction of the metal containers and metal ships for mass, reliable cargo shipping around the world. One can imagine storage seals could have a similar impact on trade, in peace times. Maybe they just are really good at picking the economy back up. And besides, you can't really have commonplace fridges and radios without a functioning international economy. I mean, you /could/, but not really, and not if you wanted to achieve anything else in the meantime.

There's this theory that the modern parity between sexes is due in large measure to the contraceptive pill, as it gave women the freedom to decide when to be mothers and when not to, and raised female sexuality from the field of reproduction to that of recreation, as it had always been for men. It doesn't seem too far fetched to imagine that there's a similar social dynamic in the Narutoverse.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That, simply, does not matches our observations. Not in the sense that we see civilians being treated in the same hospital as Naruto does (though we're never told the opposite), but in that there are the preconditions for modern ethics and social dynamics to happen, and we see them happen. Supposing there is this big tech, medical and social divide between ninja and civilians would make what we observe less probable, so it's more reasonable to suppose that it's not the case.

I actually wanted to give the frame of time I was referring to, but then I edited my comment and it got lost. I meant in the past as in the Middle Age Europe, maybe Edo Period Japan. We know that the Narutoverse is at least as advanced as that.

#+begin_quote
  It's practically a trade school. To think that it wouldn't teach anything about important part of the trade is kinda ridiculous. Also training against that.
#+end_quote

Maybe it's modular. It's well established that a ninja's education doesn't stop at the academy. Maybe they leave this kind of topic to the jonin sensei.

It's a ninja village, which are rare. Daimyos rule over a huge amounts of normal citizens. The show is all about the ninjas and ninja villages. Civvies in ninja villages are very priviledged, as they can be in chakra enhanced care.

Even if it was true, which I'm not sold on, this would have little bearing on our point, because Konoha can be viewed as a self-contained society. It doesn't matter if outside the village social norms are backwards, inside the village children are not taught seduction tactics, they don't marry as soon as they reach puberty, and there's a fair amount of equality between the sexes.

They have different sensibilities regarding war when compared to ours, for sure. Still, this doesn't mean that they are behind us on anything else.
