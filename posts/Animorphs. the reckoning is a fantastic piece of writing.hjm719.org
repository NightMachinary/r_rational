I'm only in 2 books and I'm absolutely blown away by the sheer quality of this fan fic. I've never had a book where every single character is this engaging, I look forward to every single character's chapters with equal eagerness it's incredible. I also feel like it doesn't fall into the trap of some rational fics of only having the protaginists being rational and smart. Visser 3 is constantly playing 20d chess with himself and his host and it makes him terrifying along with how accurate and strategic he can be with his plans. Just every bit of this story is excellent and it's incredible


** It's still a WIP, right?

Not to be /That Guy/, but I just don't have the memory to keep track of a zillion different concurrent stories in my head, and there's so much great stuff that's complete I can afford to be picky.

Unrelated, but Mother of Learning and HP: Methods of Rationality are the only complete [[/r/rational]] web serials I've read. Worm is in my queue... Any other complete series I should be binging?

******* Disagree. I would argue that Unsong is rational within a wholly unusual setting. True, there is a lot that would not make sense outside of that setting, but that is because that world is... very, very different than ours.

I will warn OP that Unsong, besides being a wonderful read, is a bit... odd. Rare is the book that can successfully make humor based off of Jewish Kaballah and computer programming simultaneously, and have multiple levels of jokes in each. And it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if it is... it's wonderful

The Andalites are as contemptuous of us as the Protoss are of the Terrans. Visser Three, as an extremely ambitious Yeerk in the brain of an Andalite military genius, is where the fic really shines. He's an utterly terrifying villain, a lone wolf and utility monster with several civilizations' worth of tech backing him up, rather than a bumbling doofus who gets duped by teenagers into dyeing his fur purple.

** I definitely like the book and it tries so many things, that I haven't seen anywhere else, so I do respect the effort. And it's a very thrilling ride, thru and thru.

But it has uhm.... data presentation issues.

[warning, many spoilers ahead]

There's clones, morphed humans, Yeerks, mini-Yeerks, distributed Yeerks, Andalites, Thoughtspeak, birdperson, Eids, Hiracs (which one was that, anyway?), dains, residual Toms, Esplin and Alloran, the many presidents of the United States, clones, decoy clones, sentient ships, coalescions, War Prince Jake's guilty conscience about totally wanting to bang Marco's mom (that's how I read it, anyway), Aximillilili and Elfangor, War Prince Jake's black box, fifty shades of Marco....... kinda all blurs together, sometimes.

I don't read a book with pen in hand and with full concentration, I read for leisure, so I don't want to do tedious mental bookkepping to keep things straight.Part of it, is the many numbers. I do enjoy that they are there. Numbers make the story more rational and nail down the context.

But....I know it is a literary convention to write out numbers as words. Only because it's a convention, doesn't mean it's not a terrible idea.Honestly, if that convention didn't exist, I think the average book would be more rational, simply because it would be easier to present hard data.On a math test, they don't write out numbers either, since you're supposed to quickly think and be able to manipulate the numbers. Why is reading a war story any different?Of course, in some sense, the characters also have to do that mental translation step, so it's "only fair", but they have the advantage of being in the story and thus having more intimate context.Reading "sixtenhundred thousand" is a lot harder to parse than 160.000. And there's a lot of numbers.

Especially a problem, if you're a native speaker of a language, where numbers have a different Endianness for two-digit numbers. (like German or French)Since two digit numbers are often in the leading position of a larger number, this language interference issue comes up a lot.

A lot of the multifacted characters are pose a challenge to present coherently write. Parentheses, hyphens and so on are used. Also cursive, but I think authors always vastly overestimate how visible and salient cursive actually is (not very, when one reads quickly).

The lines of thoughts are referred to as "one glow, one bright, one shade, one dark" in the first Ax-chapter. That..... are some difficult to distinguish properties, since shade and dark and bright and glow seem to resemble each other.

Though when Ax speaks in Parentheses-threads, I don't get the feeling that this is different from how I think.Like:(We shall have cheeseburgers! There is a McDonald's over there.)((But McDonald's cheeseburgers are lackluster.))(((But there's a Burger King over here!)))((((Burger King cheeseburgers are indeed better, but that Burger King's card reader is broken and we don't have cash on hand))))(((((We shall not eat cheeseburger, then!)))))

Look, five threads, is my intellect thus superior to even an Andalite?No, that's just sequential thinking. One thought after another.The ()-constructions never seem to run in parallel, so they don't read as any kind of special Andalite superthought.

Also I wish we would get color coding for all those threads.Also I wish we would get color coding for Esplin and Alloran.

I mean.... thought-speak being confusing is a running gag, but can't we as the readers get colors?

Also the "in media res"-nature of many chapters is extremely jarring sometimes.The chapter starts and one of the Marco's shouts "Heimdall!". And I think immediately two Marcos get themselves killed, because they wander off? I still don't know who the hell "Heimdall" is. The Marcos have some kind of id-system where they come up with 12 digit random numbers, but I'm not gonna follow that, because I'm not a Marco and a Marco certainly isn't writing the numbers as words, when he thinks of them.

The plot also just kinda skips over details. Like one of the Marclones must have witnessed everyone in São Paulo dying around him of radiation poisoning, but this isn't explored or even mentioned.

*** Yeah, I'm most of the way through it and although it's very fun, there's just /so much/ happening that it's getting harder and harder to keep track.

One thing I'm really struggling with (spoilers) is the "backups". The story is highly character-focused and character-driven, which I love, but it's hard to keep a handle on the character development when it keeps getting reset by days, weeks, months, and I have to keep track of which of their critical paradigm-shifting moments each character does and doesn't remember. Sometimes that creates frustrating situations--like, how Jake felt about Marco's confession (and how Marco felt about how /Jake/ felt) was left unresolved for chapters upon chapters, and then Jake got reset to /before/ that happened and they had to redo it anyway. I had the impression early on that the main cast planned on making new backups frequently, but I guess that was just Marco.

** So, I just binge read this fanfic and it is very interesting and well done. I appreciate the way that the author, [[/u/TK17Studios]], was able to deepen the histories and cultures of many of the alien species. Being able to show the whole way that an Andalite mind might think parallel thoughts at the same time was mindblowing, and I liked the alieness of it. It was like having to learn a new language almost. Similarly the Arn also have a very interesting way of speaking. And of course the fleshing out of the yeerk coalescion and how that works was fascinating. I also do like that the animorphs are actually trying to win and so do less stupid things in general. The fact that everything escalates so quickly just makes sense when you push this story forward, out of the 90s and into our age with quicker and easier access to technology. The changes to the morphing tech and the explanations about its creation help to make some elements make more sense.

I only have a few critiques. One is that that sometimes it feels like the characters in the main group all sound like Marco. I like Marco. I love the deepening of his voice and thinking process here. But, I've always thought Marco's ability to point out the issues in scenarios made him somewhat unique and when everyone does it all the time, it kind of lessens that. Is it strange to want some of the other characters to /think less/? Also, the characters of Ax and Tobias especially just don't feel like the Ax and Tobias from the books. Their unique relationship has especially been diminished. With Tobias in particular I get the strong sense that he is a totally different character who just happens to have the same name. The introduction of Garrett as his friend weakens that sense of loneliness from really having no-one and being separate from everyone. The changes to the nothlit rules, which don't allow him to be stuck in hawk morph and thus be an outsider of sorts even within the animorphs group, also changes that. I'm /ok/ with this new Tobias, but he will always be distinct from the canon Tobias to me. The effect is that in this version he's no longer my favorite character.

I'm not sure if I would have liked this fanfiction (or maybe /appreciated/) it as much if I had read it in elementary school like I did with the originals. Where the books have a certain levity and pervasive humor and silliness to them with a background of serious themes and issues, this fanfic brings all of that to the forefront. As a result, it does lose some of that energy, but it is excellent as a thoughtful read. I'm excited about the next chapters and the final arc.

Edit: Also, I have a theory about Cassie, but I'm afraid to post it cause I don't want it to be changed if I'm right.

** I started reading it based on a previous recommendation here. It's got a lot going for it, but I got dragged down by the angst... okay, yes, war is horrible, it's good that you kids recognize that. Great that you think violence isn't the answer, even when you're dealing with an existential threat from an alien source that barely recognizes your species as intelligent. Your parents raised you well.

and, gosh, yes, there are a lot of ethical issues involved with cloning and mind control, aren't there?

but, like, I thought I was going to get to read an adventure story about kids with superpowers kicking ass and discovering how much more there is to life in the galaxy than we ever dreamed. Instead I get kids wallowing over ethical dilemmas while amoral aliens continue the murdering.

*** Minor/major spoilers for the series ahead, but in the final chapters of the book series, the Animorphs recruit dozens of disabled kids and end up using them as glorified cannon fodder. It is arguably not the worst thing they do, and they're miserable, exhausted, and hideously on-edge throughout.

​

The series is, if anything, a purposeful deconstruction of exactly that sentiment --- albeit somewhat buried by scholastic ghostwriters. Morphing is fun sometimes but is mostly creepy body horror or worse.

​

To echo a previous comment, [[https://www.reddit.com/user/TK17Studios/][u/TK17Studios]] has managed to do the 'HPMoR thing' of taking apart an existing canon of inconsistent quality and using the pieces to build something bigger and better. My SO is/was a big Harry Potter fan, but I have to remind her that Daphne Greengrass doesn't 'exist', as far as the original canon is concerned. Nevermind Azkaban and the dementors.

​

I don't know if not knowing anything about Animorphs makes the reckoning hard to follow, but I do know that the original characters are every bit as good. It sucks that the fic doesn't get the front-page WtC treatment here, but it absolutely should.

​

Here's one data point for you. I am not familiar with the original Animorphs, but I tried to read this rational version, and I found it sheer torture. I kept skimming ahead hoping it would get better, but it never did.

The angst, as you call it, and the writing style grate on me. All the complaining and arguing that rarely turns into taking action. Characters beginning every other sentence with "I mean..." whether it makes sense or not, and characters not finishing half of their sentences. Frequent POV switches, and the switches usually happen when the action is about to start so that we skip over the action and get to more whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action.

My comment was not directed to you at all. The part where I started my comment with "keturn:" should have been a clue.

It is interesting that me writing a comment sharing my opinion with another person who was asking for opinions results in a comment from the author talking about feelings, impugning my motives, and saying that my opinion is false.

Let's see. Angst, hurt feelings, pointless arguing. Could almost be a passage in the story. Ha!

Here's a theory for you. I guess many ESFP, ESFJ, ENFP will be likely to enjoy the story, while many INTJ, INTP, ISTJ will tend to dislike the story.

You are not "disproving falsehood" as if the discussion is on physics or something related to the real world. You are disagreeing with a review of your own work of fiction and seem completely unable to articulate why. For an author of "rational fiction" I consider this is a really bad sign. Not sure if you want more readers or not, but your reaction to criticism is at least enough for me to remove your work from my "to read" list and find other authors to read.

#+end_quote

To be clear, a work of fiction is part of the real world, and there are objective claims that can be made about it. [[/u/TK17Studios]] is pointing out that the original review is the one that made objective claims about the story (not just shared the reader's personal take on it) and did not substantiate those claims. Subjective opinions of whether the story worked for them or not are not at issue here.

If your position is still that, upon seeing a post that makes claims you believe are objectively false, the burden of proof should be on you to refute them, that's great, but it shouldn't be the standard expectation, because it's /exhausting/ and also leads to conversations where someone who hasn't actually put effort into demonstrating their claims can effortlessly waste the time of those who do.

You can disagree with the tone of how he initially responded to the reviewer, but he's right in what he's saying here.

************* Listen, I think both you and [[/u/TK17Studios]] need to hear this: When [[/u/morgf]] complained about there being too much angst in this story, he was expressing his /opinion/. This opinion cannot be a falsehood for the simple reason that *there is no objective measurement of how much angst is too much angst.* The same holds true for all his other points as well (too much complaining, too much whining, skips over too much of the action, too frequent POV changes, etc.). The only "factual" statement he made was that characters begin every second sentence with "I mean..." (which is probably not /literally/ true, at least I hope not for TK17Studios' sake), but anyone trying to respond to this by saying that it's "false" has completely missed the point (and clearly fail at reading comprehension).

************** You may not know this, but I once did a detailed reread of HPMOR that cataloged in a spreadsheet every instance of Harry "winning," "losing," or coming out basically neutral in his interactions with others or the actions he took. I did it because I was baffled by people making assertions about HPMOR that did not match my experience of the story, and treating their take on the story as based in fact.

All of which is to say, I'm pretty sensitive to when people are /just/ giving their opinion on something, and when they're sneaking in an assertion of fact. I'm not claiming to be perfect on it or anything, but with careful attention it's certainly doable.

"Harry is treated as a perfect character" is an assertion.

"Harry is too arrogant" is an opinion.

"Harry wins too often" is an opinion, but it has an implied assertion hidden in it.

So let's look at the initial comment itself in detail:

#+begin_quote
  I tried to read this rational version, and I found it sheer torture.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  I kept skimming ahead hoping it would get better, but it never did.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  The angst, as you call it, and the writing style grate on me.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  All the complaining and arguing that rarely turns into taking action.
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  Characters beginning every other sentence with "I mean..." whether it makes sense or not,
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  and characters not finishing half of their sentences.
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  Frequent POV switches
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  and the switches usually happen when the action is about to start
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  so that we skip over the action and get to more whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action.
#+end_quote

Assertion assertion assertion assertion.

I'm not trying to dump on [[/u/morgf]] , I don't think he was intentionally or maliciously trying to present his opinions as indisputable facts. I also think [[/u/TK17Studios]] came out the gate a bit strong in his initial response to the comment, in that it could reasonably be read to be implying bad faith on the part of [[/u/morgf]].

But the comment itself certainly was not just an expression of opinion. It made falsifiable claims about the story that were, at best, exaggerated, and at worst, made up wholecloth.

Again, I think [[/u/morgf]] 's genuine, lived experience of reading the story made what he wrote feel real to him. But that doesn't make what he said, the way he said it, defensible in a subreddit where people should be at least /trying/ to be precise and reasonable in their criticisms of things.

I admit that sometimes when I watch action-based works of fiction I complain - not about the presence of action obviously, but about the characters' lack of thinking. So you might still have had a point.

But it is very easy to prove that there is in fact a lot of action-taking happening in this fic, so I too wonder why you felt the need to use false statements in your data point.
