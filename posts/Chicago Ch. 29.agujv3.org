** Brief summary: Chicago is a Madoka Magica fanfic that is a sequel to the author's previous fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]]. Both are fairly dark and gritty stories about magical girls fighting against monsters and the machinations of Kyubey.

**** It's not particularly, it's just good reading with a protagonist who clearly identified their goal and works to fulfill it with reasonable actions.

***** If everyone else is resonable for thier motivation and the magic ass pulls are at lest Madoka consistent I think you mean it's rational (AKA good consistent non tropey fiction) by the sidebar. Thank You.
