** I noticed that for the Patreon posting, you posted the appendix independently instead of posting the entire story with the appendix as a 24th chapter like you have been doing with all of the prior chapters.

*** That mostly comes down to formatting issues and how I have my template set up. I've been futzing with that to try to get the hardcopies looking more pretty, but this appendix uses some formatting that's different from the main story and wasn't being handled well by the compile. I don't think it's a hard thing to change (necessarily), but it's going to require some changes to the template, which means that I need to do a spot-check through the whole work to see whether I've broken anything. The appendix will be appended to the whole work once I get that figured out.

** When you said Lysander's detractors did you mean supporters?

**** Me too, though I guess I assumed that Lysander was an analogue of Pliny the Elder that perished in an analogue of the Pompeii disaster.

Given the presence of illustrati, it's also possible that he was killed by a lava illustrati.

**** I actually like the thrown in a volcano theory. I spent some time trying to make the original wording work as a joke. Sad to see I was right.

**** That was my absolute favourite part, though! Please please keep it! It made me laugh out loud!

Edit: Seriously, it made go, "wait, what?", and then "oh, that's a /really/ clever bit of worldbuilding"

*** I believe it's the latter since if there existed illustrati with no domains, then there would be far more myths, legends, and stories about them. The extremely low quantity of such tales therefore implies that they are all fabricated misinformation to increase the illustrati's standing or hide their abilities.

**** In that case "the few" would probably be a clearer wording than "a few", or even better yet "how few".

*** My understanding was this: some people argued that one can't be a cat Illustrati if there are no cats nearby (because they wouldn't have any to control). The author disagrees, because there are some historical examples of Illustrati without apparent domains (which he believes just didn't have any specimens of their animal around). So the conclusion is that a person can have an animal domain, even if there are none around, so long as the idea of that animal has already spread beyond the minimum "domain fame" threshold (as exemplified by the apparent lack of cat Illustrati in the distant past even in places where they were already known).
