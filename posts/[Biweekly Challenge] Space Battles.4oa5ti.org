[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4m41h1/biweekly_challenge_power_failure/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Power Failure".

Next time, we'll be doing [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBattle][Space Battles]]! Battles! In Spaaaaaace! This is a great time to break out that humongous mecha story you've been thinking about, or a hard sci-fi tale of ships shooting lasers at each other from hundreds of kilometers away. The only requirement is that there needs to be battle, and it needs to be in space. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, June 29th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
It's been one year since the first [[/r/rational]] challenge, discounting a few earlier proto-challenges. I think it's appropriate for us to go back and do a twist on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/][that first challenge]]; the theme will be "Reverse Portal Fantasy". If a portal fantasy is where someone from our world steps into another, then a reverse portal fantasy is where someone from another world steps into ours. Of course, this is entirely a matter of perspective, since one character's portal fantasy is another's reverse portal fantasy, but the intent here is to get stories about fantastical people stepping into the mundane world. Feel free to try out whatever variations you'd like though.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/29.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread will be up shortly.

*** Hopefully constructive criticism:

I found the voice of the character jarring. He at times spoke like an old, ignorant Philly guy, but then in the same sentence he'd sound like a boy in his late teens or very early twenties who spends most of his time on the internet or speaks internet jargon in-person. For example: sentence fragments beginning with "so," use of "I guess" when not actually guessing, other filler words like "like" and "kinda," overuse of "oh" and "[yeah]," the phrase "here's the thing," etc.

To fix it, watch a video of a person from your character's target demographic and mimic their voice verbally. Then talk aloud as you're writing.

**** Tbh, I just sort of picked Philadelphia as a home city. I've never even been there, lol. The most I know about Philly is what the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air has taught me.

I just kind of needed him to have a home city. I wasn't really intending for him to sound like an old Philly guy. Which makes me curious, what sentences sounded like "an old Philly guy"?

  That he had to give him some bulls[#!&] precognitive sense too?

  Heh, it did to me too, a while ago. You may have heard of me, you may not have, I'm not sure. But I was one of the first, way back when.

  I could have, technically, but come on. I'm not a f[%@#]ing p[@#$!].

  the whole shtick

  you wouldn't believe. I was like a cockroach. You could get rid of me for a while but I'm just gonna come crawling back. Pissed.

  It stretched over her muffin top like shrink wrap. I laughed myself straight out of my chair the first time I saw her.

  It sounds like a pretty good gig, am I right? Until some hopped up soccer mom that's too clever for their own good takes advantage of your arrogance. I hope that b[!@$#] gets f[@#$!]ed. In every way possible. Preferably by men with d[@$#]s reminiscent of sports equipment.

  Too mean? Listen to me, you f[@#$]ing ingrate.

  give me a handy

  Of course, the old man or woman or alien thingazoid wasn't exactly nice enough to explain the potential downsides

*** I understood this was a sort of e-sport, but played with a trident in an arena. I wasn't able to imagine how the hologram looked though, or what a "unit" really is. A spaceship?

Furthermore, the discussion in the end about things that are dangerous, magnetic tethers and magnets in the gloves makes no sense. I have no idea what any of these might be used for. It seems to set up mechanisms that will be explained in the future, but the story then ends.

Don't take this badly, I write this because I'm hoping for clarifications. You have a nice writing style :)

**** The vagueness was intentional, but perhaps ill-considered if it hindered your imagination. I imagined somewhat triangle-shaped three dimensional motes of blue. Could spaceships, but didn't want to restrict more fanciful imaginings. The augmented reality could display any number of scenes and still represent the movements of blue blobs. The hologram I imagined as a blue sphere, somewhere between a meter and two meters in diameter. I didn't realize this when writing it, but I think I drew subconscious inspiration from blitzball's sphere and minimap when visualizing the hologram and the units, respectively.

The end banter is just work-place banter. They're both professionals who make their living at a sport that should have no danger, but does in order to make the stakes higher. The neophyte recommends a magnetic tether gun, as it would be exciting to see someone who falls off the platform shoot it in order to save their lives. The veteran already solved the problem to her own satisfaction by emplacing magnets in the backs of her suit's gloves in order to stabilize herself should she misstep, as she does in the end.

I appreciate the feedback! Thank you.

I think I could fix all the things you mention with just a few added lines. I'm not sure if that's against the rules, though. I'll just update the master copy, unless I receive word it's okay to edit - which I just got. Thanks again!

Because of the placement of the various regions of the brain that in influences, to change your perception of time, overlap somewhat with the regions that interpret sensory data.
