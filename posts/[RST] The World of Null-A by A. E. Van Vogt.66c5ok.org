** Has anyone read this? I won't lie - I am massively biased against fiction books > 50 years old, I find "classics" are either so thoroughly ingrained in culture the actual content is passé, or that modern re-tellings of the story are superior. The only notable exception I've found is Lovecraft, and even then, at least 50% of his works are garbage (a fact he acknowledged even in his day).

Scifi works date the fastest of all - writing about the future is risky, as advancements may either transform Scifi into historical fiction or make the plot seem silly. I would read /Null-A/ if a few others could vouch for it, but right now it seems like a risky use of my time.

Please feel free to point me toward the /superior/ retellings of /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/521][Robinson Crusoe]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/82][Ivanhoe]]/, etc., that you've found. Also, I find it very hard to believe that /any/ of those works could be considered "passé".

**** Oh I've read /A Connecticut Yankee/, and it's quite good. I'm certain you can enumerate hundreds of older fictions which remain timeless, but for each of those there are 10000 books which did not stand the test of time. Do modern readers enjoy /The Jungle/, /Moby Dick/, or /Uncle Tom's Cabin/? They changed the world sure, but they aren't /good stories/ anymore.

***** Also, the nice part about older books is you don't have to read the ten thousand bad books. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to even find them. The ones that are still around are still around for a reason.

Reading stories is nice, but the time you spend with a book like Gulliver's Travels or Evalina is like time you're spending with a person 40% smarter than you at their absolute peak. They're also entertaining, but that's almost beside the point.

  1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.

  2. If some good /a/ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good /b/ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use /a/ and not /b/.

  3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.

  4. By 2 & 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

  ∴ By 1 & 4: Society ought to discourage new art.

  In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it's cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.

******* As a quick rebuttal, I would say that #3 is flawed. It would be like saying that people who enjoy reading books can be easily satisfied by only reading books produced decades ago, so there is no need to write any more books. Art and literature are fields that need a constant influx of creativity and novel ideas to keep up with societal changes as our culture continually changes and grow.

Furthermore, it's also making the unwarranted assumption that artists are machines who produce art with no enjoyment or desire satisfied by the process of creation. Even if consumers would be fine only with currently existing art, the producers would be a group of people who need to make more art to fulfill their needs according to #2, invalidating #4.

Not just /like/ that. It /is/ that. This is the whole thrust of Gwern's article there.

Also, artists, presumably, should screw off and find a more economically efficient activity (see point #1).

******* I'm actually aware of Gwern's article and it is a large part of my basis of the opposite opinion. I think newer works tend to be higher quality, more well-formed versions of past works. Very little is truly original (if anything is), and that means all artists are either re-mixing older content in new ways or expressions or improving them [or worsening them, but bad books don't generally sell much]). Sure, there are countless past works which are /very good/, but it seems plausible that you could make an even better work, and so we should let that happen.

As a result, newer works tend to supercede older ones, making older works less likely to be worthwhile.

I haven't read /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203][Uncle Tom's Cabin]]/, but /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ is among my favorite books--I've read it at least three times, IIRC. I also found /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7522][King Coal]]/ (same author, different subject) to be quite interesting.

**** There are a (probably literal, if printed and weighed) ton of inferior retellings of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, most of which go awry by using a sci-fi protag so that his tech solutions run on phlebotinum, or by making the historical people cardboard cut-outs.

However, I think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time][An Island in the Sea of Time]] one-ups Clemens' masterpiece quite handily, judged simply as a work of fiction, rather than in historical context.

*** Huh. My experience is that I really love visions of the future presented by the past - it means that exploring the perspective of the author and their time becomes just as fun as exploring the imagined perspective of the characters and their time.

** That cover blurb always seemed a bit odd to me: "fine for addicts of science fiction". It seems like it's saying, "okay, if you *really* like reading SF, I guess this book is fine, whatever". Googling the phrase, apparently I'm not the only person who thought this, and the 1948 review it was taken from was rather lukewarm, so I'm not sure how this ended up on the cover.

I read the book a couple years ago and didn't dislike it but I found it rather confusing. I felt like the universe wasn't really established: at first it seemed like humanity was in the early stages of colonizing the solar system, but then there's an entire galactic civilization (of humans, I think?) and none of the characters seemed surprised by this so something didn't quite add up and I don't think this was ever addressed.

The Null-A concept seemed critical for understanding the book, but I recall it being almost entirely unexplained. I Googled it, but I'm not sure what people in the 40's were supposed to do.

I also found it tiresome that the hero kept getting captured by the same villains and they kept letting him go. I think this happened 3-5 times in total, mostly associated with the hero infiltrating the same facility over and over.

** I'm sure this has been posted before but I thought I'd bring it back to our attention now that we have more subscribers. I consider The World of Null-A, a 70 year old novel, to be the kind of work we should try to write and share here in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Has anyone else read it?

*** I read it basically by mistake when I was about 13 (more than 25 years ago...).

That series (World, Pawns, Three) was my entry into "adult" SF, but let's face it, at the time it was a mindfuck of epic proportions. I followed with and much preferred Van Vogt's other works, especially Slan and Empire of the Atom, etc.

Then I discovered Asimov and it kind of recalibrated my whole perception of the entirety of Van Vogt's corpus.
