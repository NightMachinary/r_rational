I laughed, but thinking about it, this really is probably exactly how Praesi think of friendships. In Ubua's eyes, her (likely) killing Cat here is exactly what a friend would do, especially since it will likely empower her and deprive their mutual enemy, Sve Noc, of said power. Praesi friendship really is about how you can use your friends to get ahead and stick it to your enemies.

**** My money is on Akua shoving that shard of Winter she stole back into Cat. Doesn't seem like a right junction to betray Cat right now. Even if that succeeded, and she managed to put down both Cat and Sve, she'd still be stuck in Everdark, without support (given that mantle seems to decide the titles of people endowed with Winter it's unlikely Akua would inherit title of Sovereign of Moonless Nights, and that'd mean no obedience from Peerage and rest of Cat's army), with Archer likely still out there and pissed off, and with exit closed off by dwarven army. The odds of this working out in her favor are terrible, and Akua is too smart to take a gamble like that, especially given that her current long term goal is just to survive.

Helping Cat however looks better. Cat has been consistently hitting above her weight, so betting on her beating Sve in a second round is not that dangerous. And if they win, even if she had to sacrifice that bit of Winter she had, well... Collar Fair was useful, Collar Fairy would be less useful without Winter powers, yes? So maybe grant back some Winter. Hell, I'd imagine she'd try angling for full Winter title in this scenario.

Her mantle basically subsumed the Name of Squire. She still had it, technically, but we've had a lot of lines like:

#+begin_quote
  My mantle and my Name woke, intertwined beyond separation
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  It would have been a lie, though, to still call myself the Squire. No one did anymore. I could still feel the bare bones of that Name, some days, but the flesh and muscle over them was Winter's. Whatever I'd done in Liesse, when I had broken Masego's scaffolding, it had ended my tenure. I had no aspects anymore, only the power that my mantle lent me.
#+end_quote

Combine that with how she's spoken about having lost any and all power, and no mention of anything like a Name or Name abilities, and she's almost certainly just a plain old human at this point.

***** Yep, I think they can, how do you think new names are made? Some names are foreign or twisted, like Heirophant, or Black Queen, names that share roots with other names, but are also Parallels.

Heirophant v. Warlock; a Heirophant being a sage of miracles and learning, while a warlock is of curses and hoarding power. Black Queen v. Queen of Callow; an even clearer parallel, Queen of Callow is a name for the queen of Callow of the gods above, Black Queen is for the Gods Bellow.

But what if someone wanted to craft a new name out of neutral power? I have said many times that there are no Neutral names, and that even 'neutral' named have a clear allegiance, like Ranger to Bellow, as a name has too draw power from somewhere.

However, what if a particularly ambitious mortal killed a couple of fairly neutral Godlike entities, say a highly ranked fae noble and the source of the Drows power, in a feat of such dastardly heroics that it makes an a new name from that power? One that is not reliant on above or below for its aspects?

God I hope this comes true, it would be so rediculously badass.

Rumena calling it how it is. Cat really did not think any of this through. She had a half-hearted plan to deal with the Longstrides, which was fairly terrible and failed immediately, and /no/ plan to deal with Sve, who she knew would be making her play at the battle of Great Strycht. This is the logical outcome.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Oh, I was wondering why Rumena hadn't immediately killed her last chapter. But this is still not good for Cat's long-term survival.

#+begin_quote
  I'd earned the mantle through murder, back in the old days of about two years ago.
#+end_quote

How time flies. I really need to go back at some point and look at all the timeskips, maybe make a bit of a timeline.

#+begin_quote
  The droplet that tipped the cup was that even as I began spewing out clear water and bile the Mantle of Woe fell down over my face, smothering it all over my face.
#+end_quote

Right, Cat still has the mantle of Woe. I wonder if this will become relevant.

More seriously, taking magic items from prisoners seems like it should be basic protocol. Whether the prisoner is basically powerless or not, I don't think anyone would want to have to deal without whatever shenanigans their artifacts might potentially be able to get up to. Case probably in point - the rest of this book.

#+begin_quote
  It glanced at Sve and found no answer there -- she seemed a little miffed by my refusal to take this seriously
#+end_quote

I'm vaguely surprised that Sve gave up trying to humble Cat after a single failure. She went from inflicting unspeakable terror onto Cat for her backchat, to engaging Cat in a little back-and-forth, standing around while Cat enjoys a smoke and gets her digs in. Why's Sve even dragging this out? You'd figure she'd be keen to complete her apotheosis now that she finally has the opportunity.

#+begin_quote
  In the absence of an actual scheme, it seemed like I was going to have to bluff a living goddess.
#+end_quote

Well, there goes the idea that Cat planned for this outcome. And Cat, you just had an object lesson in how bad you are at lying.

#+begin_quote
  “Why so many warriors, Sve?” I asked, opening my eyes. “Witnesses, honour guard? Nah, this is best left quiet. Not the kind of knowledge you want floating out there. I think it's a statement of power. A reminder of hopelessness, to break me down. But if that's the case, why these warriors?”
#+end_quote

This seems like a weird idea.

First off, all these Drow are nothing compared to Sve's own power, as she proves a moment later, so bringing them as a statement of power is weird. Secondly they're the wrong Drow to bring, as Cat herself mentions a moment later, and so bringing them doesn't prove anything except that she can't bring Cat's army. Thirdly, why would Sve care about breaking Cat? Sve's literally about to kill her, as of which moment Cat's opinions will matter to nobody, and she literally just gave up on tormenting Cat and instead stood there while Cat asked for a smoke and wiped vomit on one of the Mighty, which is about as far from "breaking her down" as she can get.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, I would have made you servants.
#+end_quote

Slaves, Cat. The word you're looking for is slaves. If, that is, slaves were forced to obey any and all orders in the spirt they were given or face instant death. So a word worse than slaves? Either way, if you're going to go down this road,Cat, at least own it.

#+begin_quote
  the same happened all around me, every Longstride messily collapsing.
#+end_quote

Did Rumena die? That could be important. It's in Sve's interests to keep this quiet so you'd think she'd kill it too, but Sve's handling of this execution thus far has been pretty sloppy. Which it has to be, I know: Sve holds all the cards here and wants to kill Cat, but if she's allowed to kill Cat then the serial ends.

#+begin_quote
  “Then fear me, drow,” Akua Sahelian announced, “for I wield the power of friendship.”
#+end_quote

Okay, that's a great line.

No clue how Akua is going to help out here. Sve can kill Cat casually at any moment she chooses, gaining control of both the mantle and Akua with it, and Akua doesn't hae anything close to the power needed to stop that from happening.

Maybe Akua is planning on killing Cat herself, before Sve can get to it? I wouldn't rate that as likely, but she needs some sort of creative solution to the problem at hand.

*** Narrative Logic applies here:

- Cat has been stripped of nearly anything that marks her identity. The readers can ignore that because she is the viewpoint character, but in-universe, the Mantle of Woe is one of the last things clearly pointing at Cat and signifying "This is Catherine Foundling, the Queen of Winter". So her Mantle remaining may be necessary to the Sacrifice thing Sve Noc is trying to achieve.

- Sve's behavior isn't rational - her long use of her domain has warped her mind into certain habits and perspectives that offer her little flexibility and even less lateral thinking. *This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"*

- Cat aims to "tell a story" in front of an audience. The bluff of a plan in front of witnesses inclined for treason is merely a first brush at painting something.

The Archer - Cat dialogue earlier highlighted this rare trait of Catherine: Her true superpower is being a literal main character:

She always acts as if the universe is an audience, paying attention to her. Inside an universe running heavily on narrative logic, this offers her incredible agency. Why?

Because by "entertaining" the readers, she gains plot armor and the entire story itself will bend to ensure her continued existence (through whatever setbacks and "penultimate" failures) there might be.

Catherine seems like a surprisingly talented "brawler" at story-fu: She intuits certain narrative laws & trends, then outplays her opponents on a meta-level that is often one or several tiers higher than they can imagine.

This is speculation with nothing to back it up, and requires another few layers of assumption to be added in for it to make sense.

I think it's much more likley that Rumena just made a mistake.

#+begin_quote
  Sve's behavior isn't rational
#+end_quote

I'll say it isn't. She has two goals here, apparently, kill Cat and to "break [her] down"and she's very bad at following through on either of those tasks. She's making no progress on the murder front - which, fair enough, monologuing is a time-old tradition - but her actions on the breaking Cat front don't add up to anything after a single, failed attempt at torture and gathering up minions who are counterproductive to the actual goal.

#+begin_quote
  This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"
#+end_quote

You quotes "Drow madness" and "Winter madness", but those words never actually appeared in the chapter. Hell, I don't think they've ever appeared in the /series/.

What the chapter /did/ say was that Winter alienation means nothing to Sve, because she's so far gone into whatever it is the Night has done to her. What this means for her mental state, there's no way to know.

But none of this explains what Sve is doing. She's not just /sub optimal/, she's /inconsistent/. Which is weird when she was called out as "static". Again, she tortures Cat for backchat, then stands around while she snarkily requests a smoke and wipes vomit on the Mighty.

EDIT: The closet I can come to an explanation here is that Sve gave up on this goal of breaking Cat after her failed attempt.

Sorry, but I'm not sure what this point is meant to address. I take it that you raised this up in response to something specific I said, but I can't tell what that was.

I don't dispute that Cat tries to focus on the narrative (Even if she's made some questionable decisions as of late - see also, the entire Sve-Cat conflict thus far), but I also don't see how it ties what's happening here or my comment?

In general, though, I think there's a couple of thing to keep in mind here:

One is Cat seemingly no longer has a Name - it got ripped out with her soul and the mantle. She's an ordinary human without a Role to fulfil, at the moment. This makes it kind of hard for her to leverage her Role for story purposes.

The second is that there's a limit to what stories can do: we had the example of Will vs Urulan, and the sort of story it would take for Will to have even a chance in a fight, given to us earlier and the gap between Cat and Sve right now is exponentially larger.

#+begin_quote

Reminder that Cat apparently didn't realise that there were any stories going on in the Everdark at all, until Archer pointed out all the obvious coincidences to her. It doesn't help that she's quite unfamiliar with Drow stories, unless she's been having Ivah tell them to her offscreen. And Black just recently showed us all the danger of that.

Well, she does. Hence the drowning Cat in terror after she makes her first snarky comment. Sve just seems to give up on responding to sarcasm or flagrant disrepect afterwards. I thought this was weird in part /because/ of her static nature.

But we'll have to see whether Sve keeps dragging things out with Akua making a play.

*** Maybe Cat did plan for this but she erased her memories of the plan to stop herself from leaking the plan to Sve after losing her powers and becoming vulnerable. We've already had an arc with memory shenanigans, so we know it's possible, and there's still the "folly" keyword thing that still hasn't been explained yet.

Did you, like, miss this whole arc? Catherine attacked their country and stole the water explicitly to force them to become her slaves so she could expend their lives defending the people she cares about. It is the main point of everything that she's been doing since she left Kether.

**** A few definitions of slave for you:

From the oxford dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.

  1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation.

  1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something.
#+end_quote

From the Collins dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 countable noun A slave is someone who is the property of another person and has to work for that person.

  2 countable noun You can describe someone as a slave when they are completely under the control of another person or of a powerful influence.
#+end_quote

From the Merrian-Webster dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  1 : a person held in servitude as the chattel of another

  2 : one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence
#+end_quote

Whereas servant is defined as:

#+begin_quote
  1 A person who performs duties for others, especially a person employed in a house on domestic duties or as a personal attendant.
#+end_quote

,

#+begin_quote
  1 countable noun A servant is someone who is employed to work at another person's home, for example as a cleaner or a gardener.

  2 countable noun You can use servant to refer to someone or something that provides a service for people or can be used by them.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  one that serves others
#+end_quote

respectively.

The definitions for slave are much more fitting. The Drow are controlled absolutely by Cat, and are allowed only as much freedom as she gives them. Remember, one of the oaths is:

#+begin_quote
  you will follow the orders of the Sovereign of Moonless Nights without intent to subvert or pervert the spirit in which they were given
#+end_quote

and breaking it means instant death. There's an argument to be made that they are an extension of her will, which is far more than property. They recieve no wages, and Cat is happy to have them die for the sake of tactical advantage (impressing Soln with her ruthlessness).

As for the definition of servant... none of it really fits? I guess they perform duties for Cat, but not domestic duties, and they /do/ serve her, but to a degree that's far outside the boundaries of what a servant would usually do.

I really have no clue how you could argue for "servant" over "slave" here, but if you've got a different perspective I'm happy to listen to it.

Did she make every drow take oaths though? I thought only those that bid at her auction were made to take them. And the Sigil leaders.

​

You could probably argue that the Peerage are slaves(except Ivah). But all the others were not forced to bid in the auctions.

***** To be fair as Cat points out in this chapter the drow, particularly the nisi, were essentially slaves already: bound to the Night, the Sve Noc and the Gods Below. They were doomed to endlessly slaughter each while living in ruins, with no real hope of release or a better future. And with the invasion of the dwarves; genocide was inevitable.

She could have evacuated them without requiring oaths or service, but that would just have unleashed a nation worth of treacherous, homicidal maniacs on the surface. The oaths are the only real way to reform a society obsessed with betrayal up to the point where they can function as part of wider Calernia.

*** Yeah, this whole arc feels like a side-quest that's just retreading a lot of the same ground. Another chapter of Cat wondering about how her relationship with Akua. Another chapter of Cat wondering if she's doing the right thing. Another Chapter where Cat very nearly gets killed by some low-tier enemy and realizes she needs to take these fights seriously.

How short a lot of these updates feel certainly doesn't help matters. How many updates lately have consisted of Cat having a single conversation with someone? It's like the in-between missions phase in an RPG where you go talk to all the companions until their dialogue is exhausted.
