Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So i'm building my next pokemon fanfic, and i'm having trouble to decide how much power the gym leaders should have and its attributions.

In my world, 50 years ago kanto and johto seized a war through a pact of non aggresion. At that time, the interregional elite four were created to moderate businees beetween both continents.

Keep in mind that my worldbuilding is similar to pokemon TooS (my greatest inspiration) and so, pokemons are a real threat to society as a rule. One of the main reasons to seal the pact was for better disposal of resources against the wild.

The first thing i thought was to simply use leaders and elite four as some sort of president/governor, but i'm not so sure. Ideas are welcome.

*** So would most of the elite four's power be with Pokemon. You could have they have the authority to take charge of local response teams if there is a reason to believe in danger from the local Pokemon. They would also presumably be important in helping decide longer term measures, so their suggestions probably carry surprising weight in all manner of things. I assume they would help plan any emergency plans, as well as things like if certain actions are too likely to annoy Pokemon such as mining to be dangerous. They probably have large authority in immediate disasters and significant weight if they can explain why something is an unacceptable risk. This is just first thoughts though, I kinda need to leave now.

*** What's the impact of this decision on the story you want to tell? I think explicitly considering this impact could help your decision.

Perhaps even consider setting your story in the same world as TOoS (effectively making it a fanfic fanfic, I guess)? Daystar has already described a believable system.

**** Is there some place or chapter that he explicit tells us how the dynamic between leaders and mayors work? I understand that leaders are to some extend both executive and judicial power, since they can manage man power, take decisions on how to spend resouces and judge crimes. But if they do so, what mayors are for? Who create the laws?

But how does the rangers works on that equasion? They have some judge power when it comes to renegates at least.

***** I haven't personally paid a whole lot of attention to that aspect and so may be overestimating how much he's mentioned/hinted in the story! How much detail do you need for your own story, though? It's definitely a fun topic to consider, in any case. Perhaps think about where the gym leader system comes from? Why are there gym leaders?

****** Maybe i'm overstimating this aspect of the story. It isn't like my characters are political scientists or anything, but i feel like i need to understand at least the basic of how society works law wise.

Leaders come from a society build upon finally mastering this monsters that constantly threatens humanity. Pokeball invention and the arts of taming and training were the only reason that cities could push foward and progress in technology. It makes sense to me that the top dogs of the command chain are the ones more suited to defend and master this constant danger. But if you concentrate all political functions on leaders, they couldn't possibily handle all trainers that want to challenge or train in their gyms. At least some form of support politicians are needed

I like this train of thought, it's interesting! If people have fought intercontintental wars as part of your premise, then presumably they're sufficiently defended against frequent Pokémon attacks such that there is time to specialize into developing technology and politics... but maybe because mastery of battling is so respected that most political leaders have to have been capable trainers too? Or maybe that's not the case...

******** Yeah i mean... people would naturally gather power around those who can defy and control nature. Like in TooS, the first monarch was nobunaga who conquered all Kanto after using pokemon as a resouce for war. Likewise, if there's some political or business interest (say building a train rail or something) they would need full support of someone capable of defending the perimeter arouns the construction site.

In the other hand, leaders aren't necessarily good financial managers. Maybe after sometime they would naturally choose someone to take care of tax and legal business. And if that's the case, it's plausible that after sometime people claim to choose this representatives.

So what i got now is:

Leaders can:

Spend tax resouces to military purposes. Create regulation laws. Judge crimes related to pokemon. Command regional rangers forces.

And invest and manage to some degree in other activities without tax money.

Other politicians can:

Spend tax resouces to educational, health and urban safety. Create laws (related to above maters). Judge normal urban crimes.

This kind of division allow me to explore relations between leaders and other politicians. Like Brock and pewter mayor in TooS that don't seem to get along.

What do u think?

** Any of you ever read Tales of Demons and Gods? Or other similar setting stories? The setting is called Xianxia..

​

How would you go about making a rational story in such a setting without going for the routes we normally see? i.e OP magical treasure, character is reborn with all his knowledge from the future, chosen one, mary sue..

​

The setting has so much potential, but sadly most stories using it tend to be bad.

Anybody knows of something similar, or is planning on creating something like this?

*** To me, the way to “win” a Xianxia setting is to be a charismatic cult-leader and attract a bunch of talents to yourself, then build a secret monastery where you all level up and study the secrets of the universe together for a couple decades. Every once in a while, come out of hiding, have your disciples spar with a few famous warriors whose level they have now reached to impress them, then seduce them to join your cult. Now you have higher-level teachers and new knowledge to cross-pollinate with. Rinse and repeat.

Of course, it's not a very compelling narrative. I get the sense that this is exactly what /would have/ happened next in Will Wight's /Cradle/ series, since all the team-building was done and the protagonists have got a few good planners. But, since it's boring, literal aliens intervened to make staying holed up somewhere getting stronger untenable.

**** You're overlooking the limited resource problem. Xianxia changes dramatically if the resources required to reach the top aren't highly limited.

Cradle has this to. The last book was all about how the resources left behind by someone at a higher tier were worth insane amounts for those at lower tiers. Ethan has also been spending insane amounts of money to level up Lindon and Yerin. It's the entire reason that he's in trouble with his house/clan right now.

***** True, I forgot about that. (Though, not all Xianxia is like that. Sometimes you've got linear cultivation to miraculous heights, but no Rare Candies made out of the souls of your enemies to eat.)

With that in mind, it's true---the "progression system" of /Cradle/ was carefully balanced so that the characters have now---at the point when they're just strong enough to be able to protect themselves from most random threats---also become strong enough that acquiring more strength requires venturing out into the world vacuuming it all up, rather than staying at home. They've become rather large Qi Katamaris.

However, in /Cradle/, my outlined strategy totally could have worked to help the characters through everything /up until/ ~Highgold. In essence, it's what a more functional version of Sacred Valley would be. (Heck, maybe it's what Sacred Valley originally /was/, and successive generations just forgot.)

*** Most likely the reason you find them bad is because of the way it produces enjoyment in the reader. I've read plenty of Xianxia but I have a friend who's read half of everything, and when I talk with him, I can see the completely different style of reading. He practically skims over it, and as he describes, he can miss paragraphs and it won't change the story much.

It's meant for mindless reading on the way to/from work in China, where readers don't have the mental energy to care or criticize logical fallacies in the story. They just want to experience the emotions of character, the feelings of drama and eventual triumph, and the sensation of being important when the real world makes them feel insignificant.

It's why the descriptions are so excessively over the top, why the characters are often caricatures and the MC is a mary sue, why the MC finds a treasure that changes his dismal fate (real life) or goes back in time to fix all of his mistakes, because that's what the readers are here for.

**** I understand it, I actually enjoy those stories. When I say bad I don't mean it is horrible and shitty or anything.

It's just a shortening of everything you said in your comment. I didn't want to go on a large 2 paragraphs tangent just to make it more palatable.

My point was I like the setting, and a lot of stories from that setting, and I'd like to read a more developed and well thought out story in this setting.

I think it'd be amusing if we had a low status character thrown into a heritable leadership position after the main line of a family was wiped out for some reason. Sort of like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius]].

*** I think Savage Divinity is somewhat a rational-friendly cultivation story.

Not sure if it is what you are looking for.

I'm still not sure if the MC has special abilities or just found a way to get strong/techniques everyone could copy. (and some may have used before MC discovered them independently)

I think most english Xianxia stories/translations could be more enjoyable FOR ME (and maybe the average/normal western person) if they used more western concepts/idoms.

for example use respect instead of face. Bad: Give me face! Good: Show me some respect.

The Xianxia/Wuxa concepts (weak MC getting OP, Respect, revenge, honour, might makes right, people in power are corrupt) could also work well in a classic fantasy setting, but I think you would like to keep the martial warrior setting

You could start with a village that get's destroyed because they can't pay some noble/strong immortal taxes (or the immortal needs to kill for cultivation)

(also cultivation is a bad word to understand for westerners)

The village kids/teenagers are spared (cause the immortal want next time taxes/victims)

Our MC leaves to get strong. Goes to monastery/sect/whatever and starts as disciple. Questions older about abilities and leaves cause not even elders could beat immortal.

goes to a few other sects and learns their beginner techniques.

And cause he learns them and understands how they work/what they do our MC can use them creatively. (Also he saw what basic techniques can do if a real master uses them, when immortal killed the village protectors. Since he learned the same techniques through different ideology lenses, he sees those techniques are not phoenix breath/dragon lungs...)

So while he travels he trains his basic techniques. Maybe he finds some friendly people (merchants/ entertainer) that he can travel with for an arc.

Maybe in the next arc, he mets other kids from his ex village (childhood friends or a cat girl or both or both in one) who got enslaved/killed/crippled. so we learn our MC just got lucky.

Next arc, helping getting friend a new arm/fulfilling last request

Then he gets involved into a war between two sects (really because resources, but the excuse is respect/honour/...) There we learn/get told disciples normally learn techniques until they can show their masters they have rudimentary skills in it and then start learning the next technique.

After that attack on immortal and defeat because immortal used some advanced techniques. rest of arc how he lost hope until he realizes the advanced technique is something he could do with his basic techniques.

(Something like in the rational Naruto fanfic where the black sphere genjutsu(?) is nothing other than the disguise ninjutsu,)

Well, if this was a show, the final arc would be a movie. Immortal get's beaten. We leave our MC, when a village elder makes excuses for not giving him the promised money/resources/helpp (for killing the immortal)

So enough time wasted with that. Probably not what you wanted -_-

tl;dr:

- use words and concept your audience understands

- make the MC do something different than everyone else and explain why no one else does it that way (maybe MCs only way to do it and the start is too hard normally)

- show how the rational thing to do is to behave like most people in that world (if that doesn't work, you should rethink your setting)
