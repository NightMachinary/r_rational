I posed this question [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xu1zn/d_romance_in_rationalist_fiction/?][last year]] and it went well.

Has anything changed since then? Have great works of the rationalist canon incorporated or focused on romance? Has the outside world media gotten any better at handling romance? Have you?


** "Marry me"

"Are you serious?"

"We're genetically compatible, highly intelligent and have the same goals. It makes perfect sense to get married"

-[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzu3IT590h4][David Xanatos proposal, Gargoyles]]

I'd love to read a rational Gargoyles fic with Xanatos as main protagonist. He and Fox make a scarily logical based couple (can't say rational as they're not precisely a healthy relationship). Another great example comes when Xanatos decides to use Fox as guinea pig for a magical talisman and yet in the end shows he loves her too much to lose her.

They have great chemistry, are somewhat sociopaths willing to manipulate the other yet in the end they stay together and are willing to grow together and compromise some of their inherent selfishness.

** So far the only rational fics I've seen that have romance in them are:

Luminosity/Radiance Strong Female Protagonist

Not sure if Time Braid counts as rational fic.

I don't think I've seen any on screen romantic relationships anywhere else in rational fiction.

It's kinda refreshing to take a break from the culturally omnipresent over-the-top obsession with romance, but I think rational fiction could do a good job of presenting realistic and healthy romantic relationships where a lot of typical romance fiction doesn't. I.e. in the original Twilight, Edward spies on Bella while she's sleeping. In real life, this is called stalking. In Twilight, it's called romantic. You do not see this EVER happen in Luminosity.

**** While it was an aphrodisiac it wasn't shown as the reason they were in the relationship, and it did touch on many topics regarding those relationships and their implications.

Don't know if i'd really count it as full on "rational" fiction, but it was well written, and i think the author put more effort into the relationships than any other story I read which wasn't first and foremost -about- relationships.

  The difference is mostly that the aggressor has a much greater degree of control than in real life.
#+end_quote

Is what I would say, but I did a thought experiment and I'm still creeped out by an unintentional example. Degree of control is a part of it...

I have some more hypotheses:

- Attractiveness, a (debatably) complex function of elements of high levels of organization, is being subverted by a very low level of organization.

  - I say subverted because the effects are not advantageous to the individual. It may be genetically advantageous, just as being raped by a conquering tribe is genetically advantageous to the alternative.

- Attractiveness is made fundamentally alien to me (from an unaffected perspective) and the thought of being affected so I can appreciate it is horrifying to me.
- I believe I would not want to revert the change. I am s (both of D/s) and I would have a hard enough time being abstractly attracted to power without additionally being made concretely attracted. In the context of porn, though, this is incredibly attractive.

  - Why is it not attractive to me in Time Braid? Is it because I am in an intensely strategical mindset? Because I am identifying with the character so deeply while remaining unaffected?

- It resembles wireheading. Possibly the three points above are close to my definition of wireheading.
- I am focusing on only the psychological consequences on the subject (the potential for being exploited, though the aggressor may not be exploitative) and imagining myself in their position. The intentionality of the aggressor is only (morally? aesthetically?) relevant regarding culpability.
- It is the same sort of mind-altering sexuality that so creeps me out by a transformed 12-year-old corrupting her 12-year-old friend.
- It enables sexuality's use as a weapon against you. I can only think in terms of enabling or potential because the intention inexplicably does not matter to me. Perhaps it is the idea of such a world that horrifies me.

I should probably note that I simply adore the incredibly BDSM parts with SakuHina, though that might be an order of magnitude more creepy than everything I've mentioned. It could be affected by my capricious aversion to male characters.

Puberty might be just as horrifying to me. I just haven't been able to go through it more than once to see if my child self did not want. I've occasionally fantasized about being asexual, aromantic, and asocial, with decreasing frequency from left to right. Um, I have some other reasons for wanting to go through puberty more than once, but they're unrelated.

And yes, I think people using sexual attraction against each other in real life is creepy. Well. Creepy in the context of a male aggressor? In the context of a female aggressor I'm not sure I have a word. Or perhaps it's creepy in the context of an ugly, awkward, low-status aggressor. The strange thing there is that I'm not sure I would want to revert the change (puberty) in this case. It is certainly analogous to my concerns.

I can try some more experiments, but I've exhausted my attention for the above.

Did you not have any sense of sexuality prior to puberty?

Also, noooooo, don't turn yourself asocial, I'll miss you!

(Yes, that /is/ psychologically normal. Sexual psychology isn't /entirely/ about hormones, puberty, and genetic imperatives. Just because you're not /ready/ for healthy sexuality doesn't mean your mind is incapable of processing any sexual stimuli that /do/ occur.)

Boy did I read a lot of lemon fanfic. That Roy/Riza, mmm.

What exactly are you calling psychologically normal? And I'm using puberty as a catch-all term for the start of sexual development, which is involuntary and inevitable. In the future, I have an inkling that asexuality should remain the default for a while (although it's unclear how childhood should interact with posthumanity), like gender and anatomical sex. Actually, why not just read Alicorn's [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/damagereport.shtml][Damage Report]] again, that seems pretty akin to what I'd be rooting for. [[#s][]]

I always wonder what's the sort of "space" in between forcing these varieties on people and forcing uniformity on people. I'd be a bit disturbed if I got to the future and they'd eliminated anatomical sex and gender because those things were "forced" or "oppressive".

OTOH, ideologically I'm a gender abolitionist, so I'm being inconsistent here.

And on the third and weirder hand, if I got to the future and there were all kinds of invent-your-own fads in gender and anatomical sex, right down to how the bits go together, then I'd breathe a massive sigh of relief that everything had gone just fine.

But I guess I have a completely different perspective because I was always the short, underdeveloped kid waiting for puberty to /really/ kick in, and also because I perceive my current self as fully continuous with my pre-pubescent self (hence always saying that on the scale of "five-year-old vs deathist vs transhumanist", I'm the five-year-old).

I was not aware of it at all. I knew about sex, and I actually got in trouble in first grade for lecturing about reproduction, but sexual attraction was completely alien to me until around fourth grade.

Abolitionist in what way? I'd certainly abolish involuntary anatomical sex and gender identity. I can imagine people in the future wanting to literally try on gender dysphoria, but as always, in a purely consensual fashion.

The third hand is generally the weirdest. But if not all avatar expression or sensory erogeny is somatic, then anatomical sex can get even weirder. Orientation will also become several orders of magnitude more interesting. Fetishization will be normalized, and any mode of interaction with any configuration of people and objects will be sexualized.

To expand on that, in /Luminosity/, sometimes he does watch her while she sleeps - but only once they're dating, and once she's agreed. His sister Alice looked into the future and warned him that doing it any other way would ruin any chance of Rational!Bella ever even being friendly to him.

BWAHAHAHAHA, no.

It started like that, no doubt, but as the story continued any semblance of Bella being strong or rational disappeared in smoke.

Though it can be considered realistic, since as time went on Bella became increasingly emotional and more reliant on reacting to situations rather than proactively plan for them in advance, slowly dropping her rationality in the face of "muh Edward, where is much Edward?".

To be fair, that could be interpreted as a consequence of the vampirical soul mates bond, but still.

**** I think it was more a consequence of things spiraling too far outside of her control for her to adopt her desired, rationalist-esque strategies. You can't really Chessmaster unless you have a solid information/power base and that was something Bella lacked in increasing amounts as the story progressed.

Plus we can also argue that her rational ability was compromised by all of her new attachments, and the subsequent threat to these attachments. It's a rare person that can completely rationalize through most of their loved ones being threatened, especially when said person is in no position to help said loved ones.

TL;DR: I find your comment rather inaccurate, and your downvotes well deserved.

** I think this discussion might open up in significant new directions if the definition here was expanded from merely "great works of the rationalist canon [with a side order of] romance", to the topic of rational romance in general.

Rather than presupposing (not that I'm accusing you of that, but I'm just pointing out a possible fallacy) that all romance is by definition irrational on some level, we could ask the question: of all the stories that might be considered "romances", how many of them are rational?

Because then that opens up the space to things like Jane Austen's novels, which are definitely considered romances, and which, I would argue, are refreshingly rational. Unfortunately, most of the stuff that passes for romance in the mainstream media /doesn't/ qualify as rational IMO. Way too many of the plots are wholly dependent on characters merely not telling each other some important truth when they first have the opportunity.

I think I've gotten better at portraying romance in my writing. My /Captain America/ fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305962/1/Echoes-and-Questions][Echoes and Questions]], for example, is two canon characters (Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter) sitting down to have a rational conversation about what would be involved in maintaining a romantic relationship with Captain America. There are biological concerns, disparity-of-physical-strength concerns, psychological concerns, emotional concerns... It feels like nobody ever writes about this kind of stuff in the romance genre, and definitely not in the comic-book-superhero genre, so it leaves open vast tracts of land :) in which to write compelling stories.

And then my four-novel epic /Downton Abbey/ rewrite fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence][Trust and Providence]], does away with two whole series' worth of the TV show's shallow main romance plot by having the two primary characters talk plainly about their terrible secret and then get engaged /in the first chapter/. Which leaves 500K+ words to actually /tell a compelling and intelligent story/. It's a thorough example of how to write a romance where the parties act rationally, almost never hide information from each other, aren't separated by obvious contrivances, and yet still struggle with antagonistic forces that threaten to tear them apart (e.g., infertility, WWI, paraplegia, rape recovery, plain old exhaustion from being parents and trying to run a business and a family simultaneously). As a bonus, it has plenty of explicit sex scenes and not a single one of them is merely gratuitous. Because, you know, compelling drama and sexuality can be intertwined in a long-term marriage!
