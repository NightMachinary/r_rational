** From what I did read so far last time, it's not my cup of tea. It's not bad from what I read so far, but it wasn't really appealing.

I am not even sure why you have a reincarnated character if Earth knowledge didn't really play any significant role to the story even if it's simple as 'germ theory' or vague knowledge of scientific concepts. I am not asking for an industrial revolution, which is an unlikely scenario.

Anyway, what do I look for in fics nowday?

Support roles, less combat, civilization building, engineering, worldbuilding, logistics.

Though I do make certain exceptions for fics that doesn't have any of those if they are sufficiently good.

*** I have to agree, and SD in particular has a problem with taking absolutely forever to get anywhere. My view might be a little skewed because I tend to focus on plot to the exclusion of setting, but I still can't reccomend SD.

**** There's another fic that I liked, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/leaves-of-grass-naruto-si.28246/][Leave of Grasses]] that does a much better job of using an Earth-born reincarnated character.

There's not going to be an industrial revolution or anything like that, but you at least know that there's some Earth influences running in the MC, so the reincarnation isn't a pointless feature.

It also managed to keep me interested despite the slow paced nature of the work. It's approaching eighty thousand words but I felt it's just the beginning.

So what is the difference between SD and Leaves of Grasses? If I have to summarize my gut feeling..it is that I don't care about SD, not the main character, the world, or even the side characters.

***** Might I suggest [[http://www.paultwister.com/lpt01/][The Tales of Paul Twister]]? It's about a man who gets pulled into a fantasy world, his natural advantage is a personal antimagic field (which is also a disadvantage, as he's immune to for example healing magic), and he makes his way by being a profession cursebreaker and thief.

He constantly uses names like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne in order to see if anyone recognizes them, indicating they are from Earth.

As a side project he started an academy of the sciences to start his own mini industrial revolution under the name Anthony Stark.

It's a very good series.

****** If I want an industrial revolution fic, there's [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/82/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]].

But I have yet to try out /The Tales of Paul Twister/.

******* Standard-issue American portal fantasy. Which is fine for those who like it - and I did finish reading - but if you're not into the USA-worldview, it can get /very/ tedious.

****** It sounded like a fun premise, but /man/ did it get boring. Started out good, and then there was chapter after chapter of Paul trying to woo this heart rendingly generic angel girl while barely anything happened, and it was all so stereotypical. After ten chapters of angel girl being literally the only other character of note, I still didn't give a toss about her. She could have died the very next line and I would have sighed in relief.

It read in all like a story that should be told round a camp fire, or as a bet time story. The prose was dry and dusty, and the characters lacked zest. I was a few chapters from the end of the first book and I just gave up reading.

Now granted it's not as bad as I'm making it sound. It's as good as a middle of the road fantasy novel that you'd find in a book store.

******* The second through forth books are better, yes. There is more intrigue, an eventual invasion of the fantasy realm by a private security company from Earth, and some other stuff. You don't actually need to know much about the first story to continue, you can probable piece it together. I accidentally read them out of order the first time.

**** To be honest, I think it's more a genre conceit, like how space opera's have FTL travel and no common, better-than-human AI. Xianxia just isn't for people who like balanced MCs. (Incidentally, the wikipedia Xianxia page is written like a tvtropes article, which really bothered me for some reason.)

**** I'm only half way through, but I'm not really seeing that. He's got a penchant for personal healing, and a reckless suicidal anime-protagonist-esque fighting style, but his internal chi reserves are on several occasions mentioned to be shit, and he learns nothing easily, taking longer than average for everything it seems.

****** He's exactly the opposite of arrogant, he thinks he's shit compared to everyone around him even when he performs impressive feats, because he's ignorant about those feats being impressive, or his skills being impressive, as nobody tells him anything they assume he should know.

He causes fights because he's a lush who hates bullies, slavery, can't keep his mouth shut, and has basically no concept of Eastern face-saving or values, refusing to give in to corrupt nobility. Plus he can't help rubbing it in. This is not helped by everyone around him assuming he knows all of this and that he's doing it on purpose, /despite them raising him from a half-feral escaped slave child/ and having never actually taught him this stuff.

After the 7th time that happened I assumed it was a conceit of the genre that every single noble except Tong Da Hai's family were assholes.

** While the main character is kind of a dick, I find myself liking a lot of the side characters quite a bit. Tong Da Hai for example is basically Cool Old Master combined with Reasonable Authority Figure. Akanai is basically a more bloodthirsty and proactive Karin of the Heavy Wind from Zero no Tsukaima. Taduk is the Old Master with a quirky personality (Hare Supremacy and his darling daughter).

Even Sumei and Mei Lin, the resident Tsundere and Genki Girls are alright, though I'm starting to root more for Adujan at this point.
