Hi all

** Needs a proof-read and is a bit simplistic, but nothing seemed glaringly incorrect.

*** u/alexshatberg:
#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Does this mean Unsong isn't rational?

**** I think the diversity of factions, and diversity of beliefs and values within factions, handles this objection. Even conflicts like protagonists vs Thamiel have great depth. The uninteresting conflict of pure Good vs Evil -- angels that draw flaming swords and Smite when they see demons -- is treated with appropriate brevity.

***** I wouldn't try to hard to fit things where they don't belong. The author has said it is not rational.
