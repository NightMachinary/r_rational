What fiction (especially rational/ist fiction) has changed the way that you think or how you look at the world?

(The book which comes to mind most readily for me is /Blindsight/, which got me really interested in the workings of the mind on a biological level, made me value consciousness that much more and, somehow, helped me through a particularly depressive period in my life)

** Dune. I had already read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, but Dune was the first that really caused me to think deeply and philosophically about its meaning and theme for an extended period of time. I was in High School at the time, and after finishing Dune, it occurred to me that the sensations I felt was what my English teachers wanted me to feel about the novels we read in class.

Harry's speech to Dumbledore in the humanism chapter of HPMOR made me consider morality independent of an omnipotent god which (with the help of the Sequence) eventually lead away from my YEC Fundamenalist Southern Baptist beliefs.

In the aftermath of abandoning my religious beliefs, Shinji and the Warhammer 40k made me take humanism seriously. The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover made me question the upper limits of what is possible in my newfound materialistic understanding of reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover]]

Note the first chapter is devoted to a spoiler warning and a mimetic hazard warning. I found some of the implications of the ideas pretty existentially disturbing. If you are the sort of person that can be bothered by Roko's Basilisk, I would exercise caution about reading this story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k]]

If you like serial escalation, humanity fuck yeah, giant mech battles, and over-complicated plotting, this is the story for you. Be advised that the story is about one or two chapter short of being finished, and that it has been like that for several years now (with a few minor updates each year). The author is in fact rewriting the story from scratch, so it is unlikely he will get to actually finishing it for some time.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29]]

Has a good and unique setting, explores lots of interesting metaphysical themes like the implications of precognition. The sequels by the original author are also good. The prequels by his son are low-mediocre pulpy science fiction, and thus trash in comparison to the original. I actually found the sequels by his son to be tolerable, but they are still no comparison with the original.

Had a lot of cool stuff about cognitive biases and consciousness in it (though it could get a bit didactic), with the same sort of strain of eliminativism I believe I've heard is in Blindsight, capped with some horrifying scenes with those ideas taken to their conclusion. All against a well-designed fantasy backdrop (based on the Crusades)playing off tropes in the genre.

It got me more into the issue of consciousness and how we think, lead me to Kahneman and others and their views (albeit far less extreme) about thinking, which definitely had an impact on how I think about the mind.

I have a very broad range of interests and can discuss most topics at least on a surface level. I am constantly examining myself and everything around me to validate what I know. This makes me a very, very stubborn person, and I can think of no single work of literature that impacted me dramatically by it's content.

But I still have an answer. Wildbow's /Worm/.

/Worm/ was a good read, but the content of the story wasn't world changing to me. How the story was written, the process of serial web fiction - *THAT* got my attention. I determined long, long ago that if I ever tried to write a novel, it would never happen, because I couldn't write that much all at once with no input, and didn't want to impose on family to read what was certainly going to be terrible crap, at least at first.

Wildbow's /Worm/ was the first serial fiction I ever encountered. Somehow. I had always read dead tree books before, nothing online. The idea of writing little pieces of a book, piece by piece, hit me like a Louisville Slugger. Two years later, I can barely look at that first story and not cringe, for so many reasons. But it was good enough that people liked it, and gave me feedback that I desperately needed.

In short, /Worm/ showed me a way *I* could write. At this point I'm far over a million words written since I found /Worm/, and about to start editing six novels for publication (the oldest ones are gonna be painful!)

**** Okay, so Maya Toitovna is not the most stable of characters. In some ways she uses sex and relationships as a way to achieve and maintain and demonstrate power, which is very apparent because Frank Chalmers is the head of the American side of the mission and John Boone is the First Man On Mars. She worked her way up through Roskosmos by playing the game of beds.

As a counter to this negative stereotype of Russia, you have the rounded, stable Nadia Cherneshevsky, who does not define herself through her relationships, and who is a role model to many of the nisei (the second-generation Martians). Nadia's relationships are healthy ones. She's also an engineer, not a politician.

Maya eventually pairs with the psychologist, Michel, who is himself psychologically unstable. This is a healthier relationship, but Maya still has problems with major swings in her mood trends.

Ann Clayborne is the chief aerologist, and while she has relationship issues that we are told ultimately stem from being abused by a male relative when she was young, she does have a stable family life with Simon. The Reds idolize her, but (I haven't read the books in a while) I don't think she likes their attention and elevation of her to a figurehead. She loves Mars, not the life that grows upon it.

There are other well-written women in The Mars Trilogy. Jackie's relationship with Zoe is between a narcissist and her independent daughter, across a generational gap that expresses itself politically. Phyllis' rise and fall from power is itself well-written, but Phyllis is not a POV character. The mystic biologist Hiroko is not a POV character, but we see her through the eyes of Nirgal, Sax, Nadia, Michel and in some ways the non-POV character Coyote. Zoe, Nadia, and Maya are POV characters.

If it sounds like there are a lot of troubled female characters, there are. There are also a lot of troubled male characters. I think the least-troubled person among the First Hundred is Sax, and he's described by his students as a colony of a hundred enhanced lab rats puppeting a human body.

...

I don't think KSR has any people do things because they are male or because they are female, with the exception of Hiroko. Maya isn't emotional because she's a woman, but rather because her brain and past relationships were fucked by Russian social hierarchy. Nadia builds to build, not because she's a mother or some such. Coyote doesn't wander because he's male, but because there's no real place for him on Mars. Hiroko becomes the mother goddess figure of Mars because, well, /shikata ga nai/, but also because she's carrying out her philosophy through the farm team and her family. Characters do things because the characters have reasons, and if those reasons are sexist it's because of in-book sexism rather than blatant authorial sexism.

Does this answer your questions?

MoR, obviously, because it lead me to LessWrong.

Pratchett's works are fantastic because in making fun of the way everything works they make you consider why they work like they do and what would work better. I have read them all.

Surprisingly, Artemis Fowl. I was 11, and looking back it did not change the way I thought for the better. Instead it made me an insufferable little swat for a few years there. Though I suppose we all look back at our childhood like that.

Puella Magi Adfligo Systema is a quest on SV. It gave practical experience of testing reality and observing the results. Also learned how to write fight scenes partially from that, which I am glad for.

Ian Irvine's View From the Mirror books. They were the first stories I read where good did not gloriously triumph over evil, and instead was an ever marching parade of taking shit in order to just barely squeak an ambiguous victory, all overturned because you did not pay attention to one particular detail. Not very good lessons from that one either. I learned cynicism. Took a while to get over. Also forced me to consider that the evil invading aliens might be alright people in a shit situation with bad PR.

  Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers.
#+end_quote

I think it was sometime around reading Dune (I can't remember exactly when, so I am not 100% it was entirely a result of reading DUne), the I picked up the habit of trying to internalize and understand competing points of view/worldviews simultaneously. I was a Young Earth Creationist at the time, but I tried to seriously imagine how an "evolutionist" (I would have used that terminology at the time) would view things (as opposed to just assuming their viewpoint was because they had rejected God, like >90% of the other people at my church would think). The decisive point was when my "atheist" mode of thinking started outputting more moral answers than my Christian mode of thinking (which was used some mix of moral realism and Divine command theory).

But yeah, it was around the time that I read Dune in High School that I started developing the tendency to try to hold multiple contradictory viewpoints/worldviews simultaneously.

I think God Emperor of Dune might have contributed to my thoughts on omniscience and free will would interact.

He tried to write a character many times smarter than him with powers he could not comprehend: it was a losing proposition no matter how skilled he is. Also, the race consciousness?

Peter Watts (Blindsight et al, Starfish et al, The Things) is remarkably good at portraying the inner experience of alien psychologies.

Ghost in the Shell would have been nice to see years and years ago, but I saw it only two weeks ago. I was too familiar with the themes and ideas involved for it to have a real impact on me, but if I had seen it as a child, I think it would have been very formative. Viewing it now only yielded appreciation for the animation, art, and music. I only pieced together the actual plot after a second viewing, as it's very sparse on detailed exposition.

My own story idea is suffering from a number of unfortunate coincidences; the main character is very similar to Ghost in the Shell's Kusanagi Motoko, and she even has a similar hairstyle as Motoko in ARISE. All this, and I had made those details concrete weeks before I watched GitS. Writing is suffering.

*Yes.* It gets so bad that sometimes I feel like a story I've written is trash because it doesn't feel enough like Blindsight, before I realize, wait, this isn't even in the same genre, /not every book has to sound like Blindsight./

On a related note, I think that one of the most difficult things for me as a writer is accepting that different authors have different styles, and though I write differently than many of my favorite authors that does not mean that my style is automatically inferior.

No. Psychologists and neuroscientists loved the movie (which isn't surprising, since it was based on the most up-to-date psychological research available, which makes it pretty unique given that most of Hollywood still thinks psychologists cite Sigmund Freud with a straight face), and I didn't know Eliezer had reacted at all.

I knew the film would go over well with a lot of the rationalist community, but I also predicted (accurately) that I'd see a number of self-proclaimed capital-R Rationalists complaining that the movie should have had a character called "Reason" whose job it was to give the emotions a talking-to and stop them from causing Riley to make suboptimal decisions.

Even in the replies to Eliezer's facebook post, I saw some people linking to that godawful Vox article.

**** The main character's outlook on life is very distorted, but watching him struggle with that is interesting. The author does a fantastic job writing a main character who is simultaneously pitiful and inspiring, repulsive and admirable. The darker moments of the book make it more beautiful, by contrast.

I understand why you'd think it sounds depressing, but in my view it's more like a book that's about depression. Partly, this means it is looking for ways to overcome depression from within the inside. That's almost the opposite of depressing, it could be argued. However, to be fair, the author is not writing a simple book. In order to explore the topic of depression faithfully, Donaldson offers partial explanations and justifications for Thomas' worldview and mistakes. These justifications are simultaneously very compelling, when you view the world from Thomas' point of view, and very inadequate, when you view them in an impartial way. Sometimes, however, they are adequate. Thomas has a strong degree of hardness and pragmatism, that in itself seems beneficial. He struggles with self-hatred, and sometimes this makes him do terrible things while other times it makes him act very altruistically, out of self-sacrificing love for how much better other people are than himself. Even that logic comes across as twisted, but it's somewhat admirable despite it. Because his negative qualities and positive qualities and the connections between them are prominently displayed, overall, while the book makes it clear that Thomas is deeply flawed, it uses an extraordinarily empathetic approach to convey that message. It is a book about emotionally learning how to avoid making terrible mistakes due to maladaptive reasoning processes or detrimental mind-body-behavior feedback loops. I find it valuable for that reason.

As a work of fantasy, it doesn't do particularly well on most traditional benchmarks. What's interesting isn't the plot or the worldbuilding, but what goes on inside Thomas' head. Even after taking that excuse into account, it gets rather repetitive, which is why I haven't gone back to the series yet.

Have you ever watched Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog? That inspired a few similar feelings in me. Dr. Horrible is easy to care about, he has a heart and some admirable personality traits, but he's also selfish and an idiot and self-sabotaging. The stories aren't exactly the same of course, but both their main characters inspire a mixed reaction in me that's both intellectually and emotionally interesting to process.
