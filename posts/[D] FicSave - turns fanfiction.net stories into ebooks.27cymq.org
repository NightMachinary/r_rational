And I though that a fair few people here might be interested. It's limited, but what it does it does well.

** If you happen to be using [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] for reading or organizing ebooks on Windows (and syncing with devices, etc) there is a [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261][fanfic downloader plugin]] which creates .epubs that can then be converted to any number of other different software.

Pros:

- Supports lists of fanfics to do batches of them.
- Supports a ton of sites (almost all major repositories of fanfic that aren't absurdly terrible*). Includes: fanfiction.net, fimfiction.net, twisting the hellmouth, archiveofourown.org, etc. (list is huge).
- Can check for updates and download them and replace epubs etc. automatically.
- Output is very readable with TOC based on the fic's internal chaptering and formatting etc. preserved.

Cons:

- Program runs very slowly (not optimized well) so if you're doing a batch of lots and lots of fics be prepared to leave it running in background for several hours

Usage Notes:

- Good for long lists of stories, but takes a long time (set up and let go overnight if doing hundreds of stories at once).
- The checking and updating of hundreds of fics also takes a longish time.
- Never seems to have any significant processor or memory load.

*Absurdly terrible ways of storing fanfics that are widely used is mostly forum threads, e.g. stories posted only on Beast's Lair or Spacebattles etc. I haven't found a good way to get a story from a thread to .epub that doesn't involve passing through the step "copy and paste into a word processor or something similar, by hand" yet - if anyone finds something like that let me know!

*** I also endorse Calibre. A minor correction, however: it's not Windows-only. I use it on Debian to manage my Nook Touch. There's also a plugin for downloading news websites on a schedule and formatting them as ebooks. I get the latest issues of LWN.net, Phoronix, Anandtech, and Al Jazeera every time I plug in my ereader.

*** Another endorsement for Calibre here. Even if I didn't have an ebook reader I would still find Calibre very useful for keeping a library of documents.

For downloading just any old random web-page stuff into ebook form, I recommend the browser extension [[http://www.grabmybooks.com/][GrabMyBooks]]. It's very good for doing things like compiling a bunch of forum posts into a book, you can select just certain elements from a page to save and you can combine stuff from multiple different pages into a single book as separate chapters. Even includes images.

I've set up my installation of Calibre to automatically incorporate any documents it finds in a specific directory into my Calibre library, and I save the output from GrabMyBooks into that directory. So it's very quick and efficient for getting stuff from the web into a nicely-formatted ebook in Calibre, just a few clicks.

*** Neat! I had been thinking that I wanted a way to backup my stories, and this is a super easy way to keep up with minor edits and things like that.

**** Yeah. Fanfic.net thought it was a breach of their IP for a computer to convert it into an epub or mobi or whatever.

***** That sucks... Of their IP being the words written by the authors? I'm going check their terms of service, I'm suddenly suspicious.

***** Despite the fact that flagfic had explicitly asked for, and been given, permission. I did not like the way FFN handled that. They wouldn't even acknowledge that they ever granted permission in the first place.
