** Downvoting because the SI protagonist wastes time fixing individual worm character's problems instead of immediately communicating the relevant information he has to people and organizations like Dragon or Cauldron that can act on it. The worm main characters are known to us personally, so it is easier to care about them, but in the face of all humanities extinction (across multiple possible worlds), I think watching out for them should take a lower priority. In terms of saving the world Dinah, Panacea, and Taylor are the most immediately critical and the rest can be ignored. The only reason to hesitate telling Cauldron is because of their tendency to screw up things when they can't path to victory it.

The crap the protagonist tries pulling with Cauldron probably wouldn't actually work. In order to beat Contessa's path to victory and force her to do stuff, he would need to precommit across all possible futures to only reveal his information if his demands where met.

Yeah, the protagonist is trying to manipulate Cauldron, and Piggot and Dragon and Armsmaster and Tattletale and Eidolon and Coil without any kind of parahuman ability. He should have no way of succeeding at this without author fiat. Any of them should be able to force the details out of him one way or another. He shouldn't have even bothered trying if he is supposed to be a smart SI but he does and he succeeds and its annoying.

I would be very hesitant of approaching cauldron or so on because of said issues. The rational approach is caution. He just did some low level stuff in the interim, and approached then /as soon as he felt safe/.

And path to victory explicitly doesn't work on him, as is the case with any worm fic that lasts longer than a page.

After talking to everyone, their personal problems are done. Taylor's fixed in a day. Amy goes from burning out to better than ever in one weekend. Paige has no issues from her confinement. Eidolon backs down after one confrontation with Alexandria about going to therapy. After how big of a deal is made about the passengers maximize for conflict, we see absolutely no evidence of it after people talk to Security. The only person to ever backslide even a little is Amy, and it was quickly patched up in two conversations. That was the part that broke it for me.

***** Again, adding rationality to an irrational world (something the shards are not prepared for) can have big consequences.

The whole point of worm is that everyone is on the cusp of making good decisions, and are nudged away from that by space magic.

Amy getting better with respite and therapy... Exactly what would happen. She was in a vicious cycle. Prior get better really quick when they leave those situations and their needs are meet (speaking from a position of personal expertise).

Eidolon actually getting help (not immediately) is absolutely in character because he is not a bad person. He is /influenced/ by his shard, it doesn't control him. He explicitly /wants to do good/.

And they still don't trust Mike, they are still being influenced against him.

Worm is a world on a knife edge, and mike provides the gentle nudge into the right direction. That is perfectly believable psychology.

The only thing I'm not sure about is Riley, which i admit did seem easy, but I don't think that has fully played out yet, and to be honest she is so young and conflicted it isn't horrendously farfetched either. Again, I have seen similar changes in kids taken out of abusive homes.

Note he didn't try to redeem burnscar, or jack slash, or coil, it even Sophia. He can only help people if they are on the borderline.

  The narrow street, with tall brick buildings on either side. No pavement to speak of. A woman, in her thirties, dragging a kid, maybe ten, by the arm. The look of desperation mirrored on each face. Running toward me. Behind them, two cars, accelerating now to catch up with them. They'd been playing cat and mouse, letting their prospective victims think they might have a chance, but now a new factor had joined the game.

#+end_quote

haha what

there's a fuckton of this kind of thing; the author puts themselves into every fucking problem in canon, and /always/ wins. there is occasionally a fumbled attempt at "conflict" but inevitably it is resolved in the si's decisive favour and he is proven to be the incredible genius we all know he is. christ.

(ahem.)

i don't like doing this, and i think that a work's quality (poor though it is) should be judged on the merits of the author. /however/, in this case i think the pleasure derived from the marginal extra reader pales far in comparison to the effect it has on enabling and encouraging the author. so. /please do not promote anything by ack/. roughly 50% of his works are creepy-ass sexual fantasies about underage girls -- often masquerading as standard wormfic. here's the sb mod report from one of his recent stories:

"I AM NOT FUCKING AMUSED.

More to come later, as the moderation staff is currently investigating a thread. Do not make a new thread. Do not repost the story. There will be consequences for this bullshit. You deserve all of it.

And I am incredibly disappointed in everyone who didn't report this fucking bullshit when it started being posted. God damn.

[OPPRESSION INTENSIFIES AGAIN]

Alright, let's make some things perfectly clear:

First: We do not want underage sexual content on this site. This means that the following are not at all acceptable: A) Minors bringing each other to orgasm with their powers. On screen. B) Descriptions of teenagers straddling each others naked bodies. C) Teenagers describing, in way too much detail, how good the sex they just had was. D) Things along those lines. Don't try to game this. You know who you are. Second: If you see underage sexual content on the site, fucking report it. Jesus christ. Even if you don't want to report it, then tell the writer that they are breaking the rules and should edit if they do not want to be punished. Third: Do not assume that because one post is OKed everything else in the story was. This thing is five hundred thousand words long, and this judgement is only based on four chapters of that. This is now a recurring problem, as it has happened in Panacea Quest and this story. Fourth: To all CrW writers, please improve your prose. The moderation staff has to read a lot of your work in the process of doing our job, and if doing so is annoying, confusing, tedious, or actively painful before we get to the creepy sex stuff, we are going to be rather more annoyed than we were otherwise. (As hard as that may seem) Five: There are romances that are not underage girls in lesbian relationships or underage harems. This seems to be a common misconception among rule-breakers, so in the name of getting some variety in our reports, I feel this part of the PSA is necessary. Also, we give a bit more leeway to characters that aren't minors.

Ack, for your offenses in this thread you will be getting a vacation for a month. This is the second time you have been told that 16 year olds are minors as far as SB is concerned, and I dearly hope that it sticks. This thread will not be re-opened, do not create a new one."

he's written some more explicite underage erotica on ao3, which i will not link for obvious reasons. suffice to say that i think this sort of behaviour should be disincentivised, because nobody's really said anything so far.

Your comments about SI problems are on the mark IMO. Your comments about underage erotica are, as far as I can tell, basically ad hominem and should not inform anyone considering viewing this. The way you stick them together makes the overall accuracy of your comment difficult to judge.

*** Thank you for sharing your opinion.

Still, I have to disagree with attacking the work just because it contains underage erotica. I think that the constant effort to drive out the controversial content from every single community is harmful. The whole issue is so damn politically charged that everyone must play the game of social signalling to show how tough on child abusers the are. This stupid monkey circus is really annoying and counterproductive to minimising the abuse of actual real-life children. I urge you to reconsider you stance on this subject.

this, more than anything else, is my problem with ack (it was probably a bad idea to isolate it to one clause). i don't have any problem with giving the kind of person who would be into underage erotica a safe way to get their rocks off (ei, a way that does not involve any actual children). i would not have any issue with ack if he were a less godawful author and occasionally also posted stuff to underage erotica dot com, or w/e. but it's important to recognize that sexual preferences are not formed in a vacuum; frequent exposure often creates attraction. my beef is not with ack writing underage erotica, it's with him combining it with otherwise unobjectionable works.

So your argument is that someone might browse a site for general fanfiction, stumble upon underage erotica and this person is then more likely to abuse children? Do you think that confining this content to dedicated communities is an effective strategy for stopping the abuse? I have a suspicion that it would be about as effective at preventing child abuse as current American justice system is at rehabilitating criminals (counterproductive, that is) and for much the same reasons. Socialization of people to the norms of a suitable culture is an effective way to influence a person's behaviour, but for this to happen they need to feel welcome in the community. What kind of norms do you think people in places dedicated to underage erotica are likely to adopt if you force them out of every other community? I don't think that respecting the rules, opinions or preferences of people who constantly spit on them, consider them criminals even when they have done nothing to warrant it, and so on, will be a core values of theirs.

In that context an outside agent who can think rationally and can convince the main characters to listen to them would probably have as much success as mike has had. Especially because he knows their [[#s][worm spoilers]].

That all said, so far in the story his own bad decisions have lead to him nearly dying at least three times (probably more like six or seven), only to be saved by factors outside his control, and this is /despite/ having the personal protection of Fortuna, which is now probably no longer the case. And many of those bad decisions, it seems to me, are because he doesn't really take his mortality seriously... as he has somehow arrived in a fictional world. I would be as messed up.

He has plot armor in that he's meddling very, very deep and has been 'lucky' enough so far in that when people have tried to kill him, they haven't read the Evil Overlord rule about shooting and it /not/ being too good for my enemies.

** While it did keep me entertained, I feel like things are too easy for this guy. I mean, yes, he does risk his life quite a few times, but when i say too easy, I'm not saying he's not in danger. I'm saying too easy as in his plans always work out. As far as we can tell, Security isn't anything too special. He's an overweight, 40-something year old security guard, who's only professions have been working security and driving a taxi. And a few self defense techniques he picked up. I feel as if it shouldn't be this neat and easy for him to accomplish so many of his goals.

Yes, I understand that being in the start of the Wormverse, with full knowledge of its canon, is a lot of power, especially when it comes to gamebreakers like Contessa, Coil and Dinah. But there's still a noticeable lack of things not going his way. So far, none of his plans have really gone astray and, if they have, they haven't stayed that way. and get fixed relatively quickly.

All I'm saying is, if you really wanted the realistic portrayal of an over the hill average Joe protagonist, you can't have him go in, and mess with every big player in the game, and have each plan he makes as a result WORK. Just doesn't seem possible. In addition, Worm is stupidly long. Like 1.7 million words long. I can't, realistically, see Security maintaining each and every bit of obscure knowledge from it. Sure, the big plot devices, such as Zion's true nature, Cauldron's shenanigans, etc. But it really gets me when he gets down to the personal level with practically each individual he comes in contact with. Every single little nuance of Worm, he seems to remember. With perfect accuracy. That's just unfeasible. Even down to "Oh, you felt this and that, at this time, and I know how that feels." People aren't that trustworthy. You can't walk up to the DHS, and spill a bunch of classified information to the POTUS and assume you're now going to be taken seriously, as an asset. More than likely, you're going to be brought in and questioned. In fact, beyond Contessa's PtV, there's no reason for Cauldron to not pull a Dinah Alcott on him. He seems to supercede Contessa's PtV, as he has information on enemies immune to it, such as Scion, Eidolon and the Endbringers.

In short, he's a Gary Stu in every way that counts. Sure, he's fat and old. But he's got a girlfriend (FwB?) is being taken seriously by an organization that makes the DHS look like puppies and each and every plan he utilizes while surrounded by Masters and Strangers works out. Every one of them.

Also, HJPEV, while probably way more talented and intelligent than any eleven year old has the right to be, has clear cut reasoning as to why he's a gamebreaker. He's extensively studied things like Bayesian statistics and the human condition. Like extensively to the point where he has trouble making real, human social connections. And while HJPEV was able to brute-think his way through a lot of his issues, there will still noticeable consequences and near misses.

Mike....read Worm. That's it. There's never any indication that he did ANYTHING beyond that. He didn't sit at home compiling his own Worm wiki for fun. He didn't read Worm every six months. He just read it. And, upon being teleported into the Wormverse, is able to subsequently craft all of these complicated plans with minimal thinking. Like seriously, this story took place over like 10 days. In that time, he's implemented several different plans seamlessly, out thought Tattletale (and the author is conveniently nerfing her power it seems, there's no way he should've been able to keep so much secret from her considering the regular contact he has and the constant dancing around the subject matter he does) Coil, Contessa (all of Cauldron really), the PRT, The Protectorate, The Triumvarate....Need I go on?

And note. Yes. He does have the deep and dirty on all of them, and the canon timeline. I understand this. But that doesn't justify how all of his plans run so seamlessly, despite all of the balls in the air, although we can probably just accept the author's Contessa-shaped handwave for most of this fic anyway :\

/Anyone/ who read worm would know enough to manipulate or at least predict the major characters, particularly if they had spent time /writing them/.

This discussion is starting to feel like talking to someone who is convinced there is only one way time travel could work, or only one way ai could come about, or only one way magic could function. It is not rational to close of your hypothesis space on something unknowable.

I have written several stories with very careful planning about path to victory, and depending on exactly how it works and how blind it is to certain outcomes it is just as game-able as anything. More so, because it is canon that contessa doesn't actually think but relies on the path to a fault.

As canon is written the is ambiguity, and sure, there is a fanfiction anthropic principle in effect in that certain PTV variants are used simply because otherwise you can't have a story, but the one you just linked would prevent almost every fanfiction written in the wormverse.

** This fic is about a non-powered fanfic author entering the Wormverse with prior knowledge of the story.

It essentially revolves around the idea of what a relatively smart person would do knowing the big dangers coming, but being completely personally vulnerable in a world of capes.

The best thing about it is (IMO) /all/ of the characters act at as real people (if not all at level one, some people still make really bad but believable decisions), they all have their own off-screen decisions happening which mess up the protagonist fairly often. The protagonist is smart but not unfairly so, and does his best to do his best.

Unfinished currently, but there is plenty there. It is slow building to conflict, so don't expect worm-style angst for a bit. Some people feel it comes off as a fix-fic but I don't get that vibe at all.

The characters are unrealistically tolerant of the SI's manipulation of them. (Contessa would just Path to Victory a way of tricking or intimidating the SI into telling what he knows)

  Some people feel it comes off as a fix-fic but I don't get that vibe at all.

Most of the protagonists earlier actions come off unrealistically successful. I mean, he survived Lung without powers. I dropped the story several chapters before the latest so I can't say if things are finally going wrong.

**** Utilitarianism /= rationality. A rational character maximizes /their own/ values. How you weight people you know (and know are good people) vs people you don't (and could be bad people) vs people who aren't alive yet is an open question.

And how much you value having a fulfilling personal life with friends is also to personal taste.

If you /knew/ a few specific people were going to get badly harmed and it cost you little to fix it, would you?

  It essentially revolves around the idea of what a relatively smart person would do knowing the big dangers coming, but being completely personally vulnerable in a world of capes.

I assume step 1 is "steal some of the Superpower in a Can".
