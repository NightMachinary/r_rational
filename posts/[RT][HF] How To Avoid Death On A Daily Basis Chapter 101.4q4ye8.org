Not strictly speaking rational (although I do try to try to keep things within the realm of plausibility) but since the story received so much interest from this sub I thought i'd just do a post letting you know I've started posting chapters again.

** I'm a huge fan of this story, and you introduced the Lord Admin very effectively. But something about the interaction in this chapter seems off. Colin is too flippant in his responses, considering Lord Admin's dreaded reputation. Seems a little unrealistic.

*** Yeah, fair point. The idea is that after a certain point, the more desperate the situation, the less fearful Colin gets. Once he accepts things are going to end badly (which he tends to do very quickly) he gives up hope of winning and resorts to sarcasm. Threatening him is a bit like threatening someone about to commit suicide.

The problem is if I make him too flippant it can take the tension out of the scene, so I do struggle with getting the balance right.

** YES! You atually continued writing and have not lost your will and are planing an actual story to be told. YAS!

Ok good work on all of this, humor is still on top and writing speed is pretty good(3 chapters yay). Keep it up.
