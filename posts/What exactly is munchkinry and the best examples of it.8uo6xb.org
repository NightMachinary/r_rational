I see the term thrown around alot and a google search doesn't satisfy why the term came about.


** On this subreddit at least, it usually refers to exposing and/or abusing loopholes in a given set of rules, in creative and interesting ways

My personal favourite example is from Harry Potter and the Natural 20, wherein a character points out that if one follows the exact rules of D&D 3.5 to their logical conclusion, then any character wielding a tower shield is completely invisible (as they and their equipment cannot be seen through full cover, and the tower shield is part of their equipment).

*** D&D 3.5 is particularly bad for how many hilarious rules dysfunctions it has. From drowning a person to prevent them from bleeding out, to peoples eyesight and hearing getting better with age (rather than worse) and it being literally impossible to see the moon at night.

** Examples of munchkinry? There are plenty in [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]].

Imagine you have a superpower that allows you to control bugs and insects. Pretty damn creepy, and boring, right? However! If you have /really/ good control, like the protagonist of that story, you can use that to great effect. For starters, and that's not spoiling a lot, she uses her creepy crawlies to fabricate a damn great costume that can stand up to knives and small arms fire, because spider silk is fucking badass.

Or if you're a guy whose touch can stop things and people in time. Great for crime fighting, just put a dude in time-out then slap handcuffs on his immobile form. Easy, right? But there's more! How about you start carrying a stack of paper, so you can build staircases wherever you go? Or bring an inflatable tent, giving you instant access to an inviolable shield! There are some neat tricks with ultra-thin wires later on, but that would be spoilers.

Seriously, I could rave for hours and hours on how cleverly superpowers are used in that book, and that's not even its best feature; an honor belonging to its many well-developed characters.

Just... don't be like me and put the book down after the second chapter because of the bullying, okay? It really doesn't last long at all, and while it's an important part of the main character and forms many of her traits, it isn't focussed on a lot.

****** So he literally defines it as "Gritty, adult, dark science fiction and fantasy."? That's pretty broad, and yea, under that definition Worm is grimdark - and so is practically any superhero movie besides Spiderman. At that point the word just... kinda loses its meaning.\\
Like, yea, Worm is a shithole of a world, and every superpowered human has a tragic backstory by default. But there are still decent people, in fact even most villains have /some/ decency or less shitty traits, even some of the literal Nazis.

Contrast that with WH40k, a universe where reality itself is close to coming apart at the seams due to Chaos gods, where a galaxy-devouring tide of bio-horror-monsters is about to overwhelm every major power, and where even the "good" guys are literal fascists that make North Korea look like a democratical first-world country.

No, these two aren't even in the same ballpark as far as shittyness is concerned. We shouldn't use the same word to describe both.

How so? Almost the entire MCU is basically action-adventure romps with the occasional emotional moment whose consequences aren't mused about too much before going back to the heroes mindlessly quipping their way to victory.

Now if we're talking about the DC universe, or most of the pre-MCU superhero movies, like Singer's X-Men or the original Daredevil, then it's a different story.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin][This TVTropes article]] does a good job explaining what the term means. According to that article:

#+begin_quote
  The name "munchkin" refers to the tendency of younger players to adopt this play style. Munchkins are, more than anything else, immature. They tend to grow out of it. An old, possibly apocryphal, story states that they were originally called "muchkins" on Use NET, due to their tendency to try and acquire as "much" as they possibly can

***** Personal first hand knowledge. The gaming community I was involved with in the 70's used it.

Citation referencing "Munchkin" as a term of art in 1983:

#+begin_quote
  The whole thing started around 1983 or so at a party at Pacificon at the Dunfey Hotel in San Mateo in which the idea came up of classifying the different styles of roleplaying. They came up with four different types, which are explained below. Special credit goes to Perry Caro, Chris Guthrie, Rick Heli, Robert Allen, and Ken Kaufman, to name a few.

  The Real Man

  The tough macho type who walks up to the attacking dragon and orders it to leave before he gets hurt.

  The Real Roleplayer

  The intelligent cunning guy who tricks the constable into letting you all out of prison.

  The Loonie

  The guy who will do anything for a cheap laugh, including casting a fireball at ground zero.

  The Munchkin

  Need we say more?

This term was well known at Sydney University in 1977-78 (personal experience - that's was when I was playing D&D there).

An even earlier reference:

#+begin_quote
  I can point to its use in Alarums and Excursions back in 1976 if I look around long enough. There were young players even back then, and they often tended toward the malign forms of power gaming, and thus the connection. I'm sorry, just because you didn't see it until it got into more general usage doesn't mean it was new when you saw it. Memes take a while to spread.

** Munchkinry is taking maximal advantage of the rules as written, often in a way that was never intended by the writer.

Perhaps the most extreme example is [[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pun-Pun_(3.5e_Optimized_Character_Build)][Pun-Pun]], a kobold with a viper familiar who uses an unexpected combination of monster abilities to obtain arbitrarily high values for all his character stats and every other number on his character sheet.

** In pen&paper RPG munchkin is a player that minmaxes his stats, abuses rules, fucks over other party members on loot and xp, and does everything he can to get more powerful, to the detriment of the story and fun. Basically treats rpg like it's a competive game.

You think you're going to visit the chocolate factory and instead some guy created an alternate universe with an entire race of people who make him candy (obviously the munchkins)

So munchkinry is when you break the rules in a manner similar to that.

*** Tv tropes says it's just an insult because younger d&d players are more likely to engage in cheaty tactics, that's kind of boring.

Edit: I stand by my first leap of logic as a fairly rational one given that:

1. The word munchkin did not previously exist prior to roald dahl making it up in willy wonka.

2. Willy Wonka is basically a max level d&d player breaking the world to suit his own needs.

3. Munchkin isn't really used as an insult for short people anymore, I last remember hearing it in the 90's. I feel old now.

Anyway, sorry for clogging up the thread, have a nice day!
