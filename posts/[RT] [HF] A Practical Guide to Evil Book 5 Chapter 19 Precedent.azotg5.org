  “Well,” I finally said. “This is going to get a little tricky.”

  “This is going to get a little tricky,” Indrani cheerfully repeated. “Now /there/‘s the name of your sex tape, Cat.”

  “I've always been partial to ‘it got worse',” Hakram offered, the filthy traitor.

  “Murder ensued,” Akua tastefully suggested.

  I glared but she just stared back at me, all smirking and insolence.

  "You're all useless,” I complained.

  “Name of Hakram's sex tape,” Indrani grinned.

** I am slightly concerned about Cat taking a glass of wine offered by Akua. If she's no longer Named, then she doesn't have the ability to burn out the poisons anymore. It's possible that Night can achieve the same effect, but it seems like a poor gamble to take, especially when everyone else had turned their backs to her so they could gaze out upon the sleeping drow.

Do not trust the Bad Faith Wraith!

*** Akua is smart. She has no viable path to resurrection so far, and the only way to find one is to manifest physically for her to operate. Which means she needed the cloak in the hands of someone and both be useful and be trusted enough for the owner to go along with it.

If Cat dies and she gets blamed, its over for her.

More than that, I assume Cat is still doing those little "tell me everything then forget about this conversation" sessions.

**** No */visible/* viable path to resurrection. Just because we cannot see her machinations doesn't mean they are there. Cat's "tell me and forget" conversations are clever, but given what we've seen of how clever and devious Akua can be? I sometimes wonder if that enough.

​

Oh, and they've recently been to see the Dead King - who could conceivably be a path for resurrection (to a degree) for Akua?

#+end_quote

I think it's virtually guaranteed that it is /not/ enough. Akua is cleverer than Catherine, and has doubtless noticed that her mind has been tampered with.

#+begin_quote
  “We have done this before,” Diabolist said.

  “We have,” I murmured. “Have you walled off any memories or knowledge, or considered doing so?”

  “I have not,” Akua replied.

  “Do you have any hole or holes in your memories?”

  “I do not,” she said, then cocked her head to the side. “I do not. Oh my, you have been thorough.”
#+end_quote

There are no holes in her memories because Catherine is clever enough not to leave holes. Akua is assuredly cleverer.

The red flag Catherine is missing is that Akua /has no memory of even considering walling off memories./

**** I didn't mean to imply that /this/ particular glass of wine was poisoned. I'm more concerned that Cat's narrative didn't consciously address it. She took the glass, thanked Akua for it, and drank without pausing to wonder if that action was okay.

Also, I'm sure a Praesi highborn like Akua is familiar with more varieties of poison than "you choke to death while the camera dramatically focuses on the falling glass of wine". In fact, with the tradition of all food and drink at Tower functions being poisoned with "embarassing" results, I think it's safe to say that mind-altering substances are definitely on the menu. Possibly very subtle, long-term mind-altering substances.
