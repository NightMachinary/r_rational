** When I updated my stories, I had forgotten this one; It hadn't been updated in a long while.

I loved the reference to General Chaos, I cackled and everything.

Nothing else to say right now, still reading it.

Edit: Actually, what's up with the thumbnail? Why Code Geass? [[/ajconfused][]]

**** The General Chaos thing is a direct mirror of the omake chapter with the Sorting Hat's alternate replies, in which the Hat says that Harry is the reincarnation of Godric Gryffindor /and/ Salazar Slytherin /and/ Naruto.

Code Geass just because it's my avatar. Lighting Up the Dark doesn't have a thumbnail of its own, and I can't draw for toffee to give it one. Maybe if it gets popular enough I can announce a fan art competition, with some sort of reward like Eliezer's shoutouts.

Edit: @Kodix, that's a fair point. There are a number of possible responses. [[#s][I think the best one is this:]]

Also, thanks for the explanation.

***** Honestly I just used the spoiler tag because the original post did, but I don't think it's at all necessary. As for the usage, it's [Title here, I put "regarding your spoiler", no quotes](#s "remember the quotes, put text here").

Anyway, I greatly enjoy your fic, thank you for that. It's one of the better I've seen.

** Well, this was a nice chapter. I enjoyed the trick at the start :) That new technique naruto learnt seems really helpful - just thinking, but wouldn't Hinata's technique work fine if you could remove the recoil damage from it? That means clones could do it fine, right?

**** There are two problems with that. First, ordinary clones aren't great at taijutsu. In canon, you'll note that when Sakura uses clones in her fight against Ino, they only deliver a single blow (IIRC) before popping. Here, it's the limitations of Clone AI, which make it hard to create a clone that can act with the flexibility and creativity required of a good taijutsu user.

Secondly, Hinata's technique costs chakra each time she uses it. Not much, but she's not a chakra powerhouse like Naruto, and creating clones with a bunch of extra chakra would cost her over time (especially since clones only have 1 HP, so they wouldn't last long individually).

The Shadow Clone Technique would solve these problems, but Naruto isn't prepared to teach it to her after what Kakashi-sensei said about the dangers (which seem like the sort of thing that could indeed apply to Hinata).

#+begin_quote
  A ninjutsu that creates an intangible copy of one's own body, without any substance. Since the clone itself doesn't have the ability to attack, and thus can only be used to confuse the enemy, it is mainly used in combination with other ninjutsu. It's a basic technique, but depending on one's ingenuity, it can be used effectively. The clones may not dissipate when they come into contact with something.

  These clones can be easily distinguished by persons with d≈çjutsu. A person with normal eyes can also distinguish the clones from the original, since the clones do not have shadows and will not disrupt the area around themselves with their movement (i.e. won't kick up dust, crush grass, etc.).

This is supported by what we have seen of Kyubey's thought process so far.

*** If your assumption holds true, Gaara would be the first (in-canon) opportunity to sketch out the thought processes and goals of tailed beasts with any degree of comparability to their human equivalent. He could offer valuable insights in what colour spectrum the motivations of such beasts are: are they greyscale, orange and blue, or so far removed from colour they smell like chlorine pentafluoride?

*** I've seen different people use those two terms differently, so I'm not sure exactly how to answer that. But in short, according to the conventional understanding of chakra (which may or may not be incomplete or incorrect), chakra is self-aware, aware of its immediate surroundings, and capable of processing information. However, it has no personality and is completely passive, doing nothing except react to its master's will (conscious and unconscious). Most ninja, when they stop to think about it at all, tend to consider the intelligence of chakra as a part of the general intelligence that runs their bodies.

There'll be more on this later in the story, but probably not for a while, since chasing up the deeper implications of chakra intelligence would take way more advanced knowledge than our Genin have.

**** I'm sorry for the lack of information on which interpretation of those terms I meant.

In most cases I adhere to *sapience* as the ability to use tools, to plan ahead, for intellectual capacity, so to speak, whereas *sentience* more properly reflects the emotional spectrum; empathy, capacity for pain and passion, those things.

In light of your story this interpretation feels true concerning chakra: it can react and respond to stimuli in the fashion of an automaton, but does not care for feelings of its master / wielder, nor the target it is aiming / aimed at. It has no aspirations of its own, as far as I understand it, and I would even dare say chakra is bereft of any agency.

The counter to that hypothesis are the tailed beasts, of course, being of pure chakra and actual goals, whatever those might be.

**** I am curious how you will explain techniques that involve the user's soul stepping outside their body, or immortality techniques like those of Sasori and Kakuzu. Or how Orochimaru couldn't use his arms anymore after his chakra-arms were sealed. I think that in canon naruto, chakra basically is your soul. Is your explanation of chakra consciousness a replacement of that? Or is it an addition? Does that mean people have three consciousness inside them: Chakra, their brain and their soul?

if so, that's freaky!

*** You mean because the rule of consent applies to chakra? I thought it was more like, whoever set up the system for manipulating chakra (probably the sage) used chakra as an easy way to identify sapience, since it's usually at least a necessary condition. I mean even the pseudo AIs in this universe have chakra, so a chakraless sapience might be an unsuspected edge case

** Good lord, The Naruto fanfics here made me nostalgic and start to rewatch the actual show.

It's painful how mind numbingly stupid Naruto and everyone else is, I swear y'all are spoiling me. Having a ready supply of fiction with intelligent characters is wonderful.

Anyway, I'm really curious to see what you do with Gaara,especially whether his seemingly violent nature stems from genuinely alien thought processes.
