** I think this gets at a lot of what I was thinking about when talking about /Star Trek/ yesterday. If you see a replicator, and ask "Why doesn't the Federation replicate people?", or see a transporter and ask "Why doesn't the Federation just use transporter spoofing to make a second person?" the answer has to be something like:

- It can't, because the Federation would have tried to do that as soon as the technology was in prototype stage.
- It can, but it's so strongly taboo that no one does it.
- It can, but the technology is tightly controlled by some entity.
- It can, but there are technological problems that prevent it from being worthwhile (like single-bit errors).

The answer /cannot/ be "No one thought of it," at least, not if you want people to read and enjoy your fanfic. And in the Trekverse, where there are trillions of people with access to near infinite knowledge and resources, along with dozens of /other/ cultures with divergent values, any munchkin attempt immediately raises the question of why it wasn't done before.

*** It seems very likely to become a taboo for any society with the capability. Because if it isn't taboo, things go to shit really quickly, and after the first couple of copyist wars, well.. Heck, for the star trek universe, which does have "Inscrutable elder races" all over the place even if they are often far to scrutable, "no Xeroxing people" might well simply be leaving off the unstated "Because having the people involved in doing so mysteriously drop dead is a waste of manpower".

*** I think of the dementors as representing loss-of-value, of which death and depression would both be instances. Depression because you stop caring and because of anhedonia. Death, well, because without sentient beings to enjoy the world, the world doesn't have much value. Also, most humans value life very much.

When HPMOR!Harry became demented, he didn't fall dead, he became a being with a utility function that assigns zero or less utility to everything.

Oh. And you can heal from contact with dementors through chocolate. That's another point for depression.

*** Yeah, I think Eliezer is just dead wrong about this one, and seems to get more caught up on their appearance than what they actually do. Why do happy thoughts fight off death? Why does death make your worse memories play out again and again? Why are there more of them when everything is gloomy and sad? Why does chocolate make you feel better?

[Also, my own head canon is that they absolutely can be destroyed by a concerted patronus charm, I know word of god is that they cannot be destroyed, but that's absolutely silly: in story its not actually clear if they can be destroyed or not]

EDIT: it's worth noting that I have no real problem of them being death in hpmor, just in Eliezer claiming that they are obviously death.

*** Death is known to have greatly depressing effect on people, is it not? Either death of those close to them or apprehension of their own death.

***** If it has many other stylistic characteristics commonly associated with Death, maybe it is.

It would be crazy to think "Dementors spread depression, ergo they're Death incarnations", but it's equally crazy to think "Dementros are undead creatures in dark cloaks that spread depression, ergo they couldn't possibly be Death incarnations".

And this assumption, that they really represend Death and depression is just superficial effect, fits their stylistics very well.

You realize she /gave an interview/ in which she /outright stated as Word of God/ that Dementors are /depression/, right? This is a /real illness/ that /people actually suffer from/, and /yes/, many of them /would/ prefer to be dead over being clinically depressed.

***** Just to clarify here, but she didn't say that Dementors /are/ depression, she said that they were /inspired by/ depression, specifically her bouts of clinical depression. When people say that Dementors don't make a lot of sense as depression, that's because they're not depression. But I think that people around here get it confused with HPMOR, where Dementors are much more literally death. Rowling's Dementors were just an analogy.

***** Yeah, I know that by the Word of God, they're depression and nothing more. But there's also such concept as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor][Death of the Author]]. So I think, that if only clarification is the World of God (not inside the work itself), it's fair to argue, that author's presentation could be interpreted a certain way, even if the author didn't mean it that way.

That is a pretty neat explanation of what rational fiction is all about I do have to say. And apparently writing it is the closest you can get to simulating the actual practice of science. One day rational fanfiction will be assigned by professors in place of term papers.

** I think the point comparing to governments messing up would be more salient in response to people who respond to things that they wouldn't do, or they don't find acceptable with "That would never happen" if people /in real life/ didn't have that exact response to things that are /in real life/.

It's the old joke about people having taken 101 classes and then looking at the world with that knowledge and just being completely exasperated, before you follow the (often quite long) chain of hows and whys things are the way they are (which are often misleading or potentially unknowable for that person), the initial reaction is to do that, and since people usually just react in reviews that seems fine to me. Especially when you consider that none of that information is known, people have deduced that the population of Harry Potter is small, but reading the books you have no indication to jump from: seeing apparent flaw in universe, to long list of rationalism for it, instead of assuming it wasn't important enough for the author to spend time making sense on it, which was again a lot of peoples reaction to the student number of Hogwarts too, especially when if they do you have to assume that the author then researched this information to compose this, but then spent that effort doing that but didn't bother adding a throw in line to make it clear.

** Mostly offtopic, but is there a good description of Eliezer's beliefs re: monetary policy, etc? (This is apropos the quote "On the other hand, right now (2014) the European Central Bank is making textbook economics errors causing trillions of euros of pointless damage to the European area"). I've seen NGPD Targeting be mentioned, but never explained or advocated for clearly.
