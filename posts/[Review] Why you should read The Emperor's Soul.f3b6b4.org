I recently reread one of my favorite novellas, The Emperor's Soul. I believe that in addition to being a fantastic book, it is rational-adjacent.

In this world, all objects and people have a sense of self - that is, a sense of what they are and should be. A chair will not think itself to be pieces of wood nailed together, but as a whole, a chair.

A Forger, then, is a person who specializes in magic that changes this object in a way that is believable to the object - the more believable it is, the easier for the magic to work. For example, if you want to break a door, you couldn't change the wood to sand; the door knows it is made of wood, and such a blatant lie won't hold. But you can instead make it so that the wood has flaws, or was gradually eaten by insects; it will remain a door, but a weak one.

The main character, then, is tasked with creating a counterfeit mind for the Emperor, (who was reduced to a vegetative state following an assassination attempt) in a way that will not only fool people who knew him, but also fool himself; after all, if the person senses contradictions or something wrong, the magic will weaken.

The reason I think this story is rational-adjacent is because the protagonist literally tries to game people; to learn everything possible about a person, and use it to their advantage. They think things through to a surprising degree, always preparing in advance with countermeasures in a way that is impressive yet believable.

As for why it's a good book? The magic system is captivating, the characters are deeply thought out and written well, in a way that is unlike for Sanderson. The prose is well-polished, again in a way that is uncommon for Sanderson. Overall, it's a fantastic and short read that I would recommend /especially/ to people who eschew Brandon Sanderson.


** Yeah, Sanderson does some excellent hard magic systems. Most of his stories are not rationalist, but the world building is consistent in a way that makes many of his stories rational by the definition on the sidebar, at least.

** I agree with this; I bought this book for easy rereading just for the planning, thinking, and how all the book's factions play together. It's a really well fleshed out set of characters who all have plans, desires and actually act on them. There's lots of subtlety and it's great fun reading the reading all the moves and counter moves.

** The description of the magic system sounds almost identical to soul casting in the Stormlight Archives.

To anyone who's read both: Is it basically the same thing? Or are there more nuanced differences in the systems than the surface level idea of convincing the "soul" of an object to change its form?

*** They're related, but distinct, as far as I can tell. We don't fully understand soulcasting yet, but it seems to rely more on perceived authority, confidence, and being persuasive to the spirit of the object you're trying to change.

Forging, in contrast, focuses more on the plausibility of a change. Plausibility here means something like "is it possible that the desired effect could have been the case, if something in the past was different" Instead of convincing a chair that it would would prefer to be broken, you use your magic to make it so that something that /could have/ happened, insects chewing up one of the legs, /did/ in fact happen. How much magic and skill it takes to accomplish any desired effect is dependent on how much of a bend in reality it would take for that desired effect to be true.

If you want to make a wooden chair turn into solid gold, you would have to essentially convince reality that the creator of that chair decided to make the chair out of gold, instead of wood. Maybe there's some extremely unlikely universe where that happened, where an emperor happened to want a chair made out of gold and picked this artisan to make it, but that's such an implausible change that the magic is almost guaranteed to fail.

*** Soulcasting works (as far as we know) by convincing the object that it would like to be something else. Forging works by constructing an alternate history that makes the object something else, then stamping it with a pattern that encodes that history. The tinier and more plausible the change, the better/longer it will take.

*** Hard disagree. Sanderson [[http://daystareld.com/stormlight-archives/][can't even follow his own laws]], let alone write rational fiction:

Spoilers below for Stormlight Archives (and some minor ones for Mistborn). Extra warning that this may mildly ruin the books for you even if you enjoy it, maybe, but I'm a strong believer in being able to look critically at things that I can still appreciate for other elements.

So there's four main criticisms I have of the Stormlight Archives (maybe more that I've forgotten), not all of which are spread evenly over all three books. In fact the sequels get a lot better, by my reckoning, and may be worth reading through the first one to get to them. But hoo-boy, that first one's got some problems, and I'll try to highlight those as I go.

First off, the author cheats. He was bad about this in the Mistborn trilogy, and it's no different here. For someone who's codified the “laws” of how to write magic systems, you'd think he would be able to get through a book without pulling some new shit out of thin air to resolve a major conflict. Seriously, pretty much every single major conflict in Stormlight is resolved by a character suddenly having a philosophical breakthrough that gives them new superpowers. It's fine to have superpowers tied to resolve or oaths or wisdom or whatever, but when there's NO indication ahead of time of WHEN these can manifest, or WHAT those superpowers are, or who they work for and not work for... it may feel awesome the first time or two, but it quickly gets more and more cheap and anticlimatic once you see it coming. They start to feel like deus ex machina, which is complemented by all the diabolus ex machina that keep ratcheting up the stakes for cheap tension throughought the series. This may be the only one of these flaws that is actually not as bad in the first book as the later ones.

Second, and even worse, Sanderson hands Idiot Balls out like he's playing Hot Potato. Why did it take three books for Adolin to use that nifty Shardblade-throwing technique he developed, despite multiple circumstances where it would have been the perfect solution to the problem he faced? Guess he just forgot about that. Why doesn't anyone put two-and-two together about Elhokar's mutterings about seeing spren, even after everyone was in the same place and talking about them? For that matter why didn't he try saying the words just before the battle at Kholinar, rather than waiting until his life was in danger? It goes on and on, I could probably list a dozen in each book and still find more with a reread.

But the most egregious of Idiot Balls is in the first book, where Sanderson hands it to a god. The CENTRAL PLOT of book 1 ends up hinging on whether or not Dalinar could trust both his visions and Sadeas. He does a SMART thing by demanding the visions give him one clear answer to see if he can trust them, rather than vague and ominous statements. In return for his question of whether he can trust Sadeas, the vision says, unambiguously, “Yes.” Full stop. Followed by “This is important.” Full stop. Followed by some more vaguer comments that seem to tie in to trusting Sadeas.

And after Sadeas betrays him, he asks the visions why they lied, and finds out that they're just recordings. That the god who sent them is dead, and this god somehow decided that randomly saying YES like they were ANSWERING A QUESTION was a smart thing to do. This would be bad enough on its own, but the fact that Sanderson wrote the story so that Dalinar would finally ask THAT question at just THAT moment to get THAT response is so infuriatingly hackneyed that I nearly stopped reading the series then and there. Because there were so many better, simple ways to have the same effect, and he should know better.

Third complaint is that a lot of the characters feel soulless in Way of Kings. This is a general problem I have with Sanderson's writing, and YMMV, but I've talked to a lot of people about his books and this does not seem to be a unique view of mine. It definitely gets a LOT better in the sequels (in direct contrast to Mistborn, where the first book felt like its characters were more alive than in the later ones), but most of the Way of Kings feels like a slog in part because I just didn't care about most of the characters. They don't act like real people to me, they don't seem to care enough about solving the problems they have, they talk like they're reading scripts. The pacing here is part of the problem too: each of the different storylines feel like they take forever to get from point A to point C, and like you're just rereading Point B again and again and again. How many times did we really need to read about Shallan agonizing over whether to steal the soulcaster, or Kaladin struggling with his depression, or Adolin being frustrated with his father? It feels like at least 1/3 of the book could be cut out without much loss.

Fourth complaint is a fairly niche one: Sanderson is not great at writing non-theists. Again, he gets a bit better with it in the sequels, but listening to Jasnah justify her atheism in book 1 made me want to pull my hair out with how canned and unconvincing her arguments were, especially coming from someone who the text keeps insisting is exceedingly brilliant. I can't fault Sanderson for trying, he's at least very clearly treating atheism with RESPECT, but I still can't help but wish he found some better atheists to beta read and give feedback so he could better understand the epistemics that go into skepticism. Also I'm still wary Jasnah might eventually recant and realize the error of her ways, similar to what happened to Mistborn's atheist.

So yeah, that's it just off the top of my head. There's certainly a lot to admire in the series, and I enjoyed the sequels more than the first book, so maybe it's worth reading for that, but I'm not holding out hope for the author to get past these flaws overall. Despite his amazing skills in worldbuilding and designing magic systems, Sanderson has disappointed me too often for me to ever see him as some shining beacon of the fantasy genre that others seem to perceive him as.

**** Alright - I'm gonna have to wall of text this, because every single one of these objections is... kinda contrived.

1) "There's no indication ahead of time when or how the oaths will manifest." followed by "it gets cheap and anticlimactic once you see it coming." Yeah, that's what happens when a mysterious ancient power gets to be slowly understood. It always had clearly defined rules, you didn't understand them and they seem like Deus Ex Machina, then you do and they seem anticlimactic. This objection makes no sense. If you already knew the normal progression of a surgebinder, book 1 wouldn't have a dramatic ending. It would be an expected victory lap for the clearly standard path the main character is following.

2) "Adolin took too long to learn to throw his shard blade." You see him practicing it, he references how he's still practicing it in book two, and then he throws it in book three to so-so effect. Considering the relatively quick timeline of these books, it's really hard to call that one an idiot ball. That's a normal progression of a minor skill from a secondary(ish) character in a series that highlights the difficulties of training martial skills.

3) "Why didn't Elhokar say the words just to try them out?" Considering his obsession with the concept of being a hero, he certainly did. But it would undercut the dramatic moment that I wont spoil here if it had been shown. It's fairly well established that just saying the words doesn't do shit - there has to actually be understanding behind them on the part of the speaker (in fact, the actual words and their phrasing don't seem to matter as much anyway). Not showing the entirety of a tertiary character's journey for the sake of allowing perceptive readers to predict the dramatic moment is normal for any well written book, rational or otherwise. And he never talked about talking to spren, I don't know why this guy got that impression. He talked about people following him and being watched - which, for a paranoid king who tried to organize his own attempted assassination, has a much simpler explanation.

4) Why did Dalinar test the messages from the god and then correctly act upon the results of his test? Gee. Would he have gotten different results if he had conducted a different test? Of course. That's how things work. But he didn't, because he wasn't handed a plot baton. He suspected something was amiss, tested his theory, and got a result.

5) He complains about not liking the characters. I think it's safe to say he's in the minority here. I suspect, however that this is his /actual/ objection to the series, and the rest is derived to support this dislike.

6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism. This is more of a wtf response from me as a lifelong atheist. Ignoring the fact that this is a world where literal gods do exist (and I would expect the arguments in such a world to be different), Jasnah's arguments are all both reasonable and common in real atheist-religious confrontations. She even has a few that are somewhat unique to that world. He doesn't like that the atheist in Mistborn gained more nuanced views on religion as part of the process of /becoming a god./ Seriously, this one doesn't make sense to me at all.

I was prepared to accept real objections to the series, here. But these... just don't make any sense.

You missed the objection: it's not that they seemed anticlimactic because I understood them, they were anticlimactic because they were predictable as /story beats/ while also being utterly unpredictable in /effects./

#+end_quote

This is my point about predictability: you are basing this off of what is predictable for /plot structure/, not what is predictable for the magic system. You cannot claim that Sanderson's magic system is predictable and understandable when the trigger is something as subjective and internal as "when the speaker truly understands them." It's a gimmick that works well for letting the author decide when they want things to happen, but is not compatible with a truly rational and understandable magic system.

Which is fine, if that's the kind of magic system Sanderson wants to write. But he wrote the Law of Magic that states that the magic system's ability to solve plot points should be proportional to how well the readers understand it, and yet he constantly solves plot points with a magic system that is not just unpredictable in its development of new aspects, but also its effects.

  6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism.
#+end_quote

I did note this is the most subjective one, but my actual problem is that the arguments for atheism are not actually good ones considering the world she lives in. You even bring it up yourself: "where literal gods do exist." If you're writing an atheist in a world like that, particularly from a brilliant academic who's the premier skeptic in her world, I expect a better class of argument than the ones Jasnah used. If they were acceptable to you, great, but I found them very weak.

#+end_quote

We must have read different books here. There are only two people who's powers aren't fairly explicitly defined on arrival (maybe don't skip the epilogue that lines out how they all work). The first is Kaladin at the end of book 1 - and they're foreshadowed heavily both by his own story and the presence of someone who specifically outlines how they work in the prologue. Testing the details about your powers (ala Shallan's lightweaving practice) is a common trope in ratfics anyway. The only /real/ example you can point to is a single action by Dalinar at the tail end of book 3 - and given that we have no reason to believe we're not starting another cycle of "explaining how that was a normal progression" (there's no book 4 yet), I'm giving that one a temporary pass until we learn more.

#+begin_quote

And you can't come up with a reason that someone wouldn't throw away their weapon before training on how to do so with effect? More to the point, it is explicitly called out as something very difficult to accomplish at all (let alone use in combat) by Hrdalm, the person he saved.

Shallan sees Cryptics, not Jasnah. And I absolutely remember it, because it was one of the clues for the aforementioned "perceptive readers." Let's stop speaking in generalities. In the middle of a speech about how he sees assassins everywhere and thinks he's being followed, Elhokar says:

#+begin_quote
  I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman.
#+end_quote

He says this to a room full of people who do not know anything about spren (or even the concept of sugebinding), and who all know that he is a paranoid little shitbag. It would be insane for anyone to call him out on it. I mean genuinely weird. I mean "how can you even think that would be a reasonable response" weird.

********* Well, it's true that he could have handled that more gracefully and rephrased his point.

But from what I understand, it /does/ seem like you completely misunderstood that very short point.

Given that you apparently also disagreed with every single one of his other points, it does give the impression that you stopped honestly weighting and/or trying to understand his arguments at some point and just rejected everything on principle.

*So*, let me rephrase his arguments for you. (Bear in mind that I haven't read the series in question.)

*He says:* The god sent prerecorded messages. He did not only (somewhat stupidly) not declare them as such, but did also (very stupidly) send messages like "Yes.", "Yes - definitely." /without any context whatsoever/, like some deranged Magic 8-Ball, instead of an intelligent being. This constitutes an idiot ball.

*You reply:* Had the guy receiving these prerecorded messages replied with different (unread) messages than he canonically did, he would have come to different conclusions than he canonically did.

Your "counterpoint" is a true enough statement. But it does not contradict the point that the god is acting like an idiot. What the receiver of the messages does or does not do is completely irrelevant to [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s point.

*EDIT:* Note, I am not claiming that [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s point's is correct. I do not know. I have not read the books. [[/u/DaystarEld]] might be mischaracterizing what happens, or the received messages might be out-of-order, altered or fragmented for some legitimate reason for all I know. (Though in the latter case, the plot might be attacked on the grounds that it requires a ridiculous contrivance of coincidences.) All I am saying is that your point does not at all address his point, which makes you latter statement be quite out of line.

Thank you, this is in fact exactly what my argument was. The god does in fact say that it's all a prerecorded message, but the character and readers don't know that because the character apparently just forgot about it due to how traumatic the visions were, which I also find... difficult to swallow, but even taking it for granted, the actual criticism is that this entire event is utterly contrived to get the protagonist to trust the visions to disastrous effects.

Which makes it all the worse that he breaks it in practically every book.

The equivalent in, say, HPMOR, would be if Harry first uses his Patronus 2.0 in Azkaban, when his life is suddenly in danger and it's the only thing that can save him.

Where HPMOR would have failed at this is if he used the knowledge that lets him cast Patronus 2.0 to be able to get the Dementors to stop. Instead this fails, and he just resorts to threatening them to drive them away.

The rational way to solve the plot in a way that's still interesting is to have the characters think of using powers both they and the readers already understand in new ways. I can't recall a time when this happens as the actual thing that solves a plot point in a Sanderson book I've read. Most of the major plot conflicts are solved by entirely new powers being realized, or in people utilizing their powers in ways that they were not capable of doing before.

And it's fine if people enjoy Sanderson despite this. Keep in mind that my original objection was to the idea that he writes rational fiction. He writes well constructed worlds and magic systems, but his characters and plots are very far from rational.

If you're going to disqualify anything with something that in some way reflects the structure of the universe their religion believes in as being a reflection of their religion, you're not going to read much. Objecting to some trivial trappings of religion being used as source material and inspiration for a fantasy work is cargo-cult atheism, forgetting why religion is bad and using it as a boo light.

***** The Mistborn trilogy is highly overrated, and I barely managed to get through The Way of Kings despite everyone praising it to the high heavens. The second and third books were a lot better, and I can see why people enjoy him now. But he's not nearly as good as he's hyped up to be. Despite his world building and magic systems being great, Rothfuss, Martin, and Butcher are all much better authors imo.

I enjoyed KKC and Dresden, but they have their own sets of problems. KKC has the problem of not fucking going anywhere, for example. Two books into a trilogy and hardly anything has happened with the main plot. Yes, the prose reads quite nicely and the magic seems interesting, but where is this train going?

******* Certainly, but their problems are lesser ones than Sanderson's, in my view. I like long and meandering stories as long as character development is occurring, and in KKC that's satisfied, for me. The idea that the "main plot" isn't being advanced feels more like a matter of expectation.

For example, I don't expect the story to be wrapped up by the end of the third book of KKC, and I don't know what would make this seem the case when the story starts with the world clearly in dire straits. I think the first 3 books of the trilogy are just going to end with why Kvothe is at the inn: it's his origin story, basically, and the whole thing with the Chandrian is clearly still ongoing and will have to be dealt with afterward.

******** Do you believe that the Doors of Stone is going to:

- cover Kvothe's history with all its character-/crucial/ details up to the point where he moved to the inn, and

  - (skipping some character-important details clearly will happen, and has happened in the previous books, but not /crucial/ details)

- be at most 10x the combined length of the preceding two books

I don't think that's remotely plausible. I don't think that there is enough space to cover all of the things the plot to date requires that it cover. Which include:

- Kvothe kills a king or does something which the public construes as him killing a king, making the name of the trilogy appropriate

- Kvothe fights in a war

- Kvothe meets Bast

- Kvothe encounters the Doors of Stone and understands why this is significant

- Kvothe steals a princess back from a sleeping barrow king

- Kvothe meets his mother's family and knows he has done so

- Kvothe does or experiences something so horrible that he renounces his name, and probably his Name, and becomes Kote. This quite clearly is not just him being a wanted man, despite his claim.

- Kvothe becomes so impressive that he unarguably needs three days to tell his life story

The story as framed in the first two books of KKC is clearly the /tragedy/ of Kvothe, though whether it's a Greek tragedy or a Romantic tragedy is not totally clear. It is not an origin story, it is the story of how he became the person who is hiding as an innkeeper in a small village and yet is worth seeking out for his life story. Will there be loose threads? Absolutely; what kind of person he is after Chronicler's tale is written is a fascinating loose end that must be raised. But there is an arc, and it has an endpoint which is possibly the most /immutable/ endpoint of any novel series, and Rothfuss has made barely any progress toward that endpoint.

********* Dresden Files feels like a good TV series that has run too long. The first few books were really punchy and stuck to the detective formula, and the recent stuff has been /slow/ and not as good. +I'm not aware of any clear plan for an end to the series.+

ASOIAF was supposed to have a timeskip and Rickon was supposed to matter. GRRM has no idea how to stick to a plan for his series. The brutal political maneuvering and low magic is good, but if he knew how he was ending it, the last seasons of the TV series wouldn't have been such a dumpster fire.

KKC has all the problems you described above.

So, one of my favorite things about Sanderson is just that he has a plan for the entire arc before he actually gets my hopes up with published prose. This lets me get excited about speculating / fanboying because things that seem like hints or foreshadowing probably are going to actually come up, instead of just being dropped in to be mysterious.

Specifically, after 20 books of the episodic Dresden Files, his plan - formulated ca. book 5, IIRC - has been an apocalyptic trilogy where all the big threats start arriving. Skin Game was the first novel which started seriously prepping for the endgame, and it turns out Butcher could only churn out a book a year like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxi-90UMu0M][Sanderbot 0-7]] while he /didn't/ have to make them prep for the endgame. I forget if he has a name for the trilogy, but the books have names already: /Stars and Stones/, /Hell's Bells/, and /Empty Night/.

Stormlight was fine up untill they left the bridge. He was building up to something he couldn't deliver.

The third book was just boring, after some meandering on book two. The spren world is... so bland and underwhelming for creatures which were embodiment of concepts.

Kaladin also gets power as the plot demands, plus everyone is a fantasy mormon and sex is icky, so they feel inhuman - 'Oh lol, let me charm you by talking about shit during dinner.'

It's very clearly because it's 'expected' 'normal' behaviour that Adolin doesn't want to do it. He's a romantic and he believes himself better than the others of his generation because of his purity and virtue.
