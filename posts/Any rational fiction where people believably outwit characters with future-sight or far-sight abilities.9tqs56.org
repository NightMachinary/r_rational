** There's a sequence around the midpoint of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] that I think fits that description but I'm not sure how to say more without spoilers.

In a more general sense though I'm not sure what "crazy advantage" implies. In general, the best way to believably beat a precog IS having a significant advantage, either in planning the engagement or combat power, otherwise the precog "ought" to win every time.

*** Another instance of that happens at the end of Worm.

Scion also has the Path to Victory power, he used his to find a future where he sees his partner again, but when he gets there, he only finds the dead flesh garden left behind by Cauldron.

Also, this hasn't been confirmed by the author, but it makes sense: The defeat of Scion. I am fairly certain Scion could have used his power to escape the mental torment, and in fact, tried to do so. He asked his Path to Victory power for a way to stop the pain. His power extrapolated Scion's mental development, and concluded he would never move on from Eden. So it looked for alternate ways to stop him hurting, and arrived at one simple answer: "Hold still"

*** I just found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5zfdns/worm_showerthoughts/dexweow/][this comment]] on how the scene you're talking about played out from the POV of the precog. It's fucking horrifying:

That final Coil scene, when he is held down at gunpoint while the Undersiders have a nice long chat about the moral implications of murder and what it means to be a villain?

He tried to escape a hundred times. He grabbed for the gun and got shot. He jumped and got shot. He tried to talk, bluff his way out, and Tattletale told Taylor to shoot him. He crawled and got shot. He ran and got shot. He tried to twist so the bullet only hit his shoulder, but the second bullet got his head. He ran and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. One time he managed to disarm Tay Tay and got killed by Grue. He ran the other way and got shot.

Every second he tried something new, he got killed, and he split the timeline again, to try the impossible. Until the bitter end. And nobody knew, not even Tattletale stopped to think about it.

That's why he gave up his safe timeline and committed to being there; so he could have one timeline where he didn't let them talk, and another where he allowed it. We don't know what happened in the timeline where he didn't bring Lisa, but I assume details on everything he did and owns was broadcast across the entire US.

******* To add another opinion. I have probably read about 80% of Worm. But near the end it was increasingly getting more and more of a drag, and I never managed to finish it.

The thing is just too damn long. It goes on forever. The plots starts to repeat, the characters are stuck without growth. Villain that ought to be killed off are kept around for chapter after long-winded chapter.

The thing is about as long as the entire Wheel of Time series, which most people agree on being waaaay too long. And Wheel of Time has a ton more characters and a ton more things happening along the way.

In Dutch we have a saying: "Schrijven is schrappen", which means something like "Writing is scrapping" (though in Dutch it alliterates). The hard part of writing a story is often not putting the words on paper, but condensing the story into the best possible version of itself. To remove all the fat until you're left with the best possible story.

Wildbow is an imaginative writer, he's clearly very good at creating interesting characters and setting up a good plot. But he needs to learn to write more concisely. Or perhaps he just needs a good editor.

Worm should honestly be at least 75% shorter.

** There is a pretty interesting contrast in how this was handled in /Worm/ and /A Practical Guide to Evil/.

In Worm, they had very reliable information about the ways their opponents power worked. Coil used his power to predict the short term outcomes of choices and choose the most beneficial of two options. It allowed him to always know whether to attack or bide his time, when his enemies would attack, ect. So they lay the groundwork very very slowly and very very patiently, working against him in countless subtle ways aimed at depleting or subverting his resources so that by the time the confrontation came his ability wouldn't be relevant as he lacked the resources to act on the information it gave him.

In /A Practical Guide to Evil/, the situation is the opposite. They know very little about their opponent, only that they are called "The Skein of Fate" and that they can "read stories". In order to win against someone who gets to skip as far ahead in the book as he likes before deciding what to do, we got the kind of overly aggressive self mutilating insanity that is the hallmark of plans made by Catherine Foundling.

A series of conditional orders was prepared. If Y has happened then open X kind of thing. Some written down, others stored as sealed memories. Then she had the parties /memories erased/ so that people wouldn't be able to predict their own actions. As conditions were met, orders would be acted upon or memories regained. Then the party separated, so that they would be acting independently and less able to influence each other. The goal was to create as much chaos and as many unpredictable elements as possible. When your opponent knows whatever you plan, throw so many plans at him that he can't keep track. Just overwhelm him with bullshit, set everything on fire and bullrush through.

**** As someone who trains MMA (with a crew of guys who fight amateur), having even a half-second glimpse into the future movements of an opponent would be a /monumental/ advantage. You would know what was a feint and what was a real attack, you would know the angles, you wouldn't be surprised by a trick move, or need to worry about not being quick enough to spot something incoming.

People who fight aren't deciding on their actions at the last moment. There is a lot of thinking happening. You notice someone drops their lead hand after a jab, so you leave a hole in your guard to bait the jab, then slip and hit them with a hard right. That's all premeditated. When you get good, you no longer consciously have to process a lot of things, but you're still thinking and making decisions, you just delegate that thinking to lower levels of your mind.

In Mistborn, the precognition is powerful for combat applications. I think three seconds is more than adequate in a fight between skilled opponents. If there is anything about the scenarios that stretched my suspension of disbelief, it was the way Vin overcame it by not making any decision at all until her opponent was committed to his action. I think the consequence of her strategy should more realistically have been a dead Vin.

It's worth mentioning that atium is almost like a drug, it makes you feel godly and all powerful (which makes sense as it is technically part of a god), so it leads it's using to overcommit and make mistakes in ways they normally wouldn't simply due to the absolute certainty that their action is correct.

I won't say it was 100% skill or would work every time, just that it makes sense that it would in that exact situation with that specific opponent. Vin comments on the possibility of others knowing the trick by saying it isn't the kind of technique a Mistborn would ever share as it would possibly negate their greatest advantage. From more personal conjecture, Mistborn are basically magical super assassins, anyone trying to spread the knowledge would likely find a obsidian knife in their throat.

******** Since Atium mistings are a late phenomenon in the first Mistborn series, anyone burning Atium would also have access to pewter and tin. Vin's situation was not unique in any way.

Not that this really matters, but your reference to cognitive dissonance misunderstands what it is. Cognitive dissonance is what happens when, on reflection, someone has to reconcile two contradictory beliefs. This psychological phenomenon does not involve being shocked or confused at any level, nor does it imply slowed reaction time. I get what you meant, but you should have just written that he was shocked.

Your point that no one would share this particular trick is valid.

I just don't see how Atium can have such a fundamental flaw and also operate as it does in every other scene. If you're fighting someone, you are reacting to them. I mean, it's not like they were shadow boxing by themselves and a Mistborn happened upon them. Everything their opponents do is predicated on them being there and doing things. This is such a fundamental contradiction that I cannot accept it. Either Atium makes someone capable of predicting the actions of opponents (who are lacking Atium) or they can only predict actions they did not themselves influence, which is pretty useless in a fight.

You mean you expect a power derived from mainlining the body of a dark god bent on the destruction of the world to be a flawless advantage? Ruin would never make things so easy for anyone.

Furthermore, there were already built-in weaknesses to Atium, most notably Electrum. Allomancy is the power of Preservation, so he got to mold how all the other metals worked. Ruin only got Atium and its alloys. Preservation, as usual, cheated and built in ways of circumventing his opponent. It was never a flawless advantage.

** Well, assuming the precog's reflexes aren't similarly enhanced, a straight fight is likely an option. Don't have to do something they can't predict, just do things so quickly that their reflexes can't keep up. Not exactly "outwitting them", though.

This also depends on the exact nature of their powers. If they see from their own perspective, then a sneak attack might work. They'd see their vision go dark ahead of time, but not know where the attack came from. And if you used something where they can't escape in time with however far ahead their precognition is, say, a bomb, you could guarantee their death.

On the opposite end of the scale, if they're omniscient and are intelligent enough to handle all of that information, you're pretty much fucked.

The problem is persuading the precog into that fight in the first place since they presumably know that they're not walking away from it.

** It depends on what seeing across "space or time" even means. Like - can they see their immediate future? How far ahead can they see their future, if so? How does that gel with their actions taken as a result of their seeing the future changing the future that they would see? If they can see and comprehend and understand every molecule in the entire universe simultaneously throughout all of space and time from now until the eventual heat-death of the universe as the last particles eventually decay into nothing, and also all the possible different futures that could arise from every permutation of their own actions simultaneously, then pretty much every approach one might consider is doomed. The difference between that godlike omniscience and complete apprehension of every future, and the sort of cognition that could plausibly fit inside a single human mind - in short, their limitations - is going to define how you approach this problem.

For example, if the person in question can 'see' exactly but not more than 24 hours into their own future from their own perspective and they couldn't do a [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][Black Pill Infinite Future Info Relay thing]], then an attack that would reliably effect them 25+ hours from the attack becoming unstoppable would be an approach that might have merit. If they're doing a Coil-style A/B testing of the future out to infinite time but with limited practical branching points, you have to take a totally different approach.

The second part is what you want in terms of 'defeating' them - do you need them dead? imprisoned and ineffective? merely set back in some way on some goal of theirs? If your terminal value is 'stop their scheme to take over the world', then that's different than if your terminal value is 'have this person actually die'. It also matters if your values in this scenario include any other goals such as your own survival or well-being.

** It's a while since I read it, but in Mistborn, Atium let's you see a short distance into the future of what your opponent will do.

[[http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Atium]]

If two people burn atium, then both see a sea of possibilities as both their actions change as the other might respond to the changes so it effectively cancels out.

In the book the heroine doesn't plan her moves, but reacts to where her Atium burning opponent is attacking based on seeing she /will/ /be/ thereby making her actions a function of his actions which nullifies his predictions of her actions.

It's clever, and I don't have the passage to hand, but I seem to remember it feeling believable when I read it.

  She snapped her eyes open. He had the dagger raised; it glittered as it swung. Vin prepared to attack, but didn't think about the strike; she simply let her body react. And she watched Zane very, very carefully.

  He flinched just slightly to the left, open hand moving upward, as if to grab something.

  There! Vin thought, immediately wrenching herself to the side, forcing her instinctive attack out of its natural trajectory. She twisted her arm---and dagger---midswing. She had been about to attack left, as Zane's atium had anticipated.

  But, by reacting, Zane had shown her what she was going to do. Let her see the future. And if she could see it, she could change it.

  They met. Zane's weapon took her in the shoulder. But Vin's knife took him in the neck. His left hand closed on empty air, snatching at a shadow that should have told him where her arm would be.

** The classic science fiction short story /Minority Report/ involves this as a major plot element. It's also in the movie but I think the short story, while maybe not being rational in and of itself, would be nevertheless interesting to the sort of people who hang out on [[/r/rational]] as the ending is really neat (and naturally different to the movie's ending).

Brute forcing it with numbers. Assuming that opposition has limited attention capacity (otherwise struggle be pointless) throw billion ordinary people with randomized independent plans on it.

** I once wrote a fanfic that included a section where the Evil Leaper (from /Quantum Leap/) Leaped into one of the villains - with no sign of Samuel Beckett to counteract her. So, the villain had the advantage of access to news reports and official records of the future (which could only change as a result of her own actions), while the heroes had no future knowledge at all. The heroes were, however, familiar with her capabilities (due to a previous encounter with Dr. Beckett).

So the heroes put in place no less than four separate plans to stop her plans, in different corners of the city. (Fortunately, revealing certain information was enough). Any one of them would easily work if she didn't stop it, and all four were ready to go on the same evening... then they kept an eye on /her/ location, running with whichever plan was /furthest/ from her. The result was that, simply by moving across the city, she stopped whichever plan she was headed towards and triggered a different one in a different part of the city instead... and, future knowledge or not, she couldn't be in four places at once.

** I can't remember where I read this, but I read a rational/rational-adjacent short story once in a D&D-style universe where the main character stole an artifact letting them see something like 10 minutes into the future. They used the power to steal a ton of other powerful artifacts, but it turned out that the original owner of the precog artifact had anticipated this, and had set up a time-locked vault to seal just after the end of the precognition window.

** The most central problem with being a precog is that you do not know at which level you are playing against yourself.

You cannot know whether what you saw was you acting out the future, you reacting out against the future, or you reacting against your reaction to the future, etc.

In typical tropes, you see this a lot in all kinds of self-realizing prophecies, where protagonists use foreknowledge to take measures against something bad happening, only to have their actions become part of the bad thing happening.

That is why the better rational precog makes zero assumptions and instead follows gut feelings or some unique absolute objective, rather than act relative to circumstances.
