*** Oh, I don't know. I'd say is almost certainly finished (not yet, but it will be). Because (1) aliens are probably going to f*ck everything up and only a small human population will survive, (2) the owner/CEO (Zephyr) of the company is on record ignoring the OCP rules, and (3) Zephyr is going to meet the aliens and (I think) cause them to notice Earth and its people.

**** Yeah, and if Zephyr gets a positive result from this (for example, they see something that makes the abandon the attempt and they return with critical info), it's likely the company will be fine. We'll have to wait and see.

***** Your scenario is plausible. More plausible than anything I came up with on the positive side. Overall, I think things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. But we'll see how the story plays out.
