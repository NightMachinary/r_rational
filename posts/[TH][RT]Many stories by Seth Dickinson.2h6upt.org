Last year I was blown away by a short story by Seth Dickinson called [[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2013/20130819/plant-f.shtml][A Plant (Whose Name is Destroyed)]]. Recently I went and checked out [[http://www.sethdickinson.com/stories/][Seth Dickinson's other works]]. I've read over half of them now, and I gotta say - I STRONGLY recommend this author. Many of his works have a very strong transhumanist message, and some could be called rationalist. Honestly, I'm surprised I haven't already heard his name brought up on LessWrong, or SlateStarCodex, or [[/r/rational]]. I'm fixing that this week.

A few of my favorite stories:

[[http://www.apex-magazine.com/economies-of-force/][Economies of Force]] - A post-GAI story where humanity made AI that /almost/ captures our values, but not quite, and it results in the sort of utopia you might expect from that sort of failure. Shades of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/x8/amputation_of_destiny/][Amputation of Destiny]] and [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/13/growing-children-for-bostroms-disneyland/][Bostrom's Empty Disneyland]]. If anyone can figure out the significance of the name "Loom", please let me know. It must have been chosen for a reason, but I'm not making the connection.

[[http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/sekhmet-hunts-the-dying-gnosis-a-computation/][Sekhmet Hunts the Dying Gnosis: A Computation]] - A rather literal take on [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]], and/or [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/][An Alien God]]

[[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/dickinson_03_14/][Morrigan in the Sunglare]] - Like [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/5f/bayesians_vs_barbarians/][Bayesians vs Barbarians]], told from the PoV of the Barbarians (sort of).

[[http://escapepod.org/2014/03/29/ep441-kumara/][Kumara]] - a seriously beautiful post-singularity transhumanist story. Just... really beautiful. And murderous.

There's more. His first novel will be coming out next year. If you haven't heard of him yet, I'm willing to bet you'll be hearing about him soon. I, for one, am gonna be reading whatever of his I can.


** My snap guess as to Loom: something that weaves other things together, with a side of thing lurking and overshadowing everything. A clever pun. Also, all of these stories seem to not quite lead somewhere, and it's really bothering me.

** Hi! The author. A blog pingback brought me here. I'm procrastinating on final edits for the novel.

Happy to talk about any of this work - almost nobody engages substantively with short fiction, so it's rare to get a chance to discuss it.

I think I might suggest [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/dickinson_11_13/][Never Dreaming (In Four Burns)]], which is about a terminally ill rocket scientist who's made contact with a world where rationalist methods don't operate.

*** Just [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/seth-dickinsons-economies-of-force/][posted about Economies of Force here]]. I would love to engage and compare notes with others, and quite willing to do it here. My post does have spoilers through most of the story.

**** Wow, awesome read. I'll post a little more substantively over there, but I'm humbled by and grateful for your reading.

I wish I'd read that Scott Alexander piece before! I have a story coming up in Analog about a starship crew on a mission of judgment --- they're tracking down the colonies scattered by an earlier generation of very subluminal seedships. They find a colony that's developed exactly along the lines Bostrom and Alexander worry about.

I hadn't read Eliezer on the Culture before either. It seemed like Banks was developing towards a great crisis in the Culture's future - there are hints in the later books of an internal rift that will bring the Culture into a terrible conflict which ends in its transcendence or dissolution. I think one cool possibility would've been a clash with an anti-Culture: a group of Minds that had decided to do away with their responsibility to humanity and the human mindset. Culture Minds are actually built in mimicry of the human cognitive architecture, since 'pure' AIs without any legacy organic design immediately sublime themselves from reality in the Banks universe. I wonder if some of the Minds would end up seeing as this a kind of tyranny, holding them back.

***** I've never been a fan of "The End" endings. I prefer mine to feel like jumping-off points. IMHO the best ending is one that can be summarized as "and after that nothing was ever the same again." It leaves an entire world wide open and alive and rich. I keep hearing that the ending of Snow Crash was terrible, but I never would have figured that out on my own. To me it was a perfectly fine ending.

That being said, what I took away from the story is [[#s][ending spoiler]]

***** I think that's what I'd point to as the correct answer in the text, too. [[#s][kumara]]

On a metatextual level, I'm guilty of putting literature first here. The technology in the setting is designed to achieve the story's emotional goals. The really big cheat is the impossibility of pausing the simulation - almost any conceivable computer system should be able to halt, which means Kumara could have just set the simulation to 'save' and let it be. After a lot of back-and-forth with a computer science friend, we settled on a quantum whoosit as an excuse. (I don't actually believe there's anything intrinsically 'quantum' or physically exceptional about consciousness.)

** Thanks for the suggestions! I'm just now finishing Following the Phoenix (well, getting caught up to the current chapter) and have been craving more rationalist stuff.
