**** Eh, I personally doubt it would go down that way; it would leave quite a few hanging plot threads, which is unsatisfying from a narrative perspective--and for a story that runs on narrativium, that's saying quite a lot.

** Finally Aaron behaves with a modicum of common sense.

No moral soul... well, Sarah's problem is simpler than I thought. She doesn't need therapy, just someone who knows the right name.

Speaking of that, this chapter seems to contradict Chapter 1, where it is stated that the neshamah is the divine spark given by the Vital Name.

He doesn't love his daughter because his heart is taken by his wife? I don't think that's how it works.

**** Still, if the options are:

a) allow the powerful name-wielding amoral love-crazed AI the possibility of learning at any time that there's someone else you love more than her, or\\
b) slot the powerful name-wielding amoral love-crazed AI into a valid family relationship, which i) gives her less reason to worry about the constancy of your love and ii) allows her to call the other woman "mother" instead of "rival"...

...then it's time to step up and be the daddy.

***** Familial love and romantic love are not the same thing, and Sarah pretty clearly wants the latter and not the former. It's not at all certain that she'd be willing to settle for the beanie baby dog of paternal love when what she wanted was the flesh-and-blood puppy of romantic love.

****** I don't think that is clear. It's pretty obvious she doesn't have well thought-out ideas about how love works. She /is/ only four days old. She might not grasp the difference.

****** Yeah, it wouldn't be what she wants, but it would at least let Aaron say he /shouldn't/ love her like that, as opposed to saying he /doesn't/ love her like that, with the greater risk that entails.

(...assuming that one can understand 'should' in reference to other people without a moral soul of one's own, anyway.)

Plus it's odd for this story to suddenly act like love is a finite resource which there's only enough for one person

The Comet king lost The Most Holy Name to Metatron.

If the mankind is wicked there will be two prophets.
