As frustrated as I am with the premise of this article: [[http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jpm.1986.10]]

Which somehow, in the pages I don't have access to, shows that due to the fact that prices are not stable over time, we aren't subject to time traveling arbitrageurs.

So how do *you* as the only owner of a fully-functional two-way time travel device get rich, but without showing a significant effect on the markets?

Assume lots of people would presumably want the power to travel in time and would likely want to steal your device, and some of them might not be nice about it either, and might be willing to kill you (or your grandfather) in order to get it. So you better keep your secret pretty well hidden.


** Use the time travel machine to win a big lottery once. This is your seed money. Winning the lottery once is hardly suspicious.

Then use the money to start an acquisitions firm. A company that buys out failing companies and restructures them to be more profitable. Design the company such that you draft operations plans that the company then follows for months/years at a time. With someone else as the executive officer.

Then buy out a company, and make a plan to flip it (and give it to your 2nd in command). Travel 5 years in the future to see how profitable it is. If it's not profitable, go back, try a different plan and/or company, repeat.

From core-timeline, you'll just appear to be a business savy genius. It's not exactly low-key, but few people go from nothing to wealthiest-man-in-the-world without some public scrutiny. Maybe even throw in some big public failures from time to time to make it more believable.

Maybe at some point you can branch out into the insurance industry. I suggest moving to Omaha first, if you go this route. Because this is basically Warren Buffet's plan-to-get-rich (except replacing "being born wealthy to start with" with "winning the lottery").

Also, a lot of modern technology required many peripheral advancements to be viable. Modern computers required advancements in materials science, miniaturization, manufacturing techniques, design techniques, ect ect. Many other products are similar.

There are relatively few cases where a new technology came along by itself. And if some lab started pumping out discoveries in 4-8 entirely different fields of research that all converged together, that would be both notable and highly suspicious.

** First point in rational analysis with lots of unknowns: assume you are *not* in a privileged position. That means you have to act as if there are other people with similar time machines right now. So to speak. Whether from the future or "native" to when you acquired your tech, you have to assume they exist. It doesn't matter what you think you know, you can't assume you alone have this ability.

I'm also not sure why "making money" instead of "living in a medical and technological wonderland in the future" is your goal, but fine. It is. You will live in the "present" and only travel to the other times to make money in a way that is useful and significant in the "present".

Also, this is assuming we have reason to believe that time travel isn't horribly dangerous for various unavoidable reasons beyond grandfather killing and the like. Even then, I'd say anything involving your own past is off limits, unless you want to deal with all your friends, family, and loved ones being lost the first trip you take.

Since it isn't maximally dangerous, we must posit that you yourself don't disappear, Back to the Future style, after a single change. It needs to be paradox resistant time travel, if not actually totally free of such complications. But there are still major issues.

After returning to your "present" from the now-changed past, using almost all realistic time travel mechanics, everyone in the light cone will now have a new, changed history and present reality, even if it isn't obvious. There will also be two of you, unless you really fucked things up. Which is likely. Uncomfortable to say the least.

That leaves your own future and back again. This is still mind-bogglingly dangerous time travel, so keep it simple.

--------------

I'd just do a present-future-present open loop scam, and screw "the market". Basically, an item dupe bug. Load a warehouse with something like rare earth minerals or expensive computers (not gold, diamonds, or drugs -- remember, low profile). Things with elastic demand, relatively inelastic supply, and high value for their size.

Go into the future. Grab your own future stuff from your own future warehouse. Go back to your origin point. Drop off the stuff. Now you have twice as much stuff with no messy paradoxes (most likely). Fudge accounts payable numbers and pay all your taxes and no one will ever care. It will make /me/ wealthy to have a successful business, one that has an unreasonable edge over others, and it doesn't interfere with itself by depending on the future being anything but physically present. There are a lot of options there, but this one has almost no risk.

Hell, if you're really the business type, set up a "just in time" process to deliver stuff to businesses unreasonably (though not impossibly) quickly. Invest in companies you see doing well in the future -- not a sure thing, but better than playing stupid financial games like that article suggests isn't happening with time travelers. Claim exactly what Walmart did in the '90s -- that your advanced computer ordering and prediction systems are just that good.

While you're at it, assume the Waldens, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and other outliers like them were and still are time travelers. And assume they have ways to detect time travel and try to develop those yourself, with a crack team of scientists sworn to secrecy. Your background checks will be nasty, because they'll actually be checking into your future from secret hidden bases your employees don't know about, to see if they ever betray you after you hire them. Most defection scenarios are easy to catch this way, at least in the short term.

*tl;dr*: assume you are not in fact alone. Deal in physical goods taken from the future. Make your own future from future knowledge instead of murdering your own past. Don't play games where people might be watching, like banks, stockmarkets, or gray and black markets for expensive goods.

** This strikes me as akin to gaining the ability to teleport and using it to ensure that you never miss your bus again. Money is just so /limited/ a goal when you have time travel.

The first and most important question is whether this is a single-immutable-timeline universe or if it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe (these are the only two types of time travel that are logically consistent).

If it's the immutable timeline type, you don't have to worry about disrupting the markets - they have already included the effects of your time traveling and all you'll do with your efforts is to make them turn out the way they did. So if you want to make scads of money in this scenario you'll need to do it secretly. False identities, shell corporations, buried treasure you can dig up later, that sort of thing.

If it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe, there's two strategies you could take. One, you could try to emulate the immutable-timeline scenario by working hard to be behind the scenes. This is a lot trickier since it's actually possible to fail at that in this scenario, but on the plus side if you fail you can just jump worldlines and try again. Or two, you could just "go nuts" and steal as much high-density valuables as you can cram into your time machine and then cache them all at some point in the past before your depredations. Then maneuver from there into a worldline that you didn't otherwise tamper with.

Personally, though, I wouldn't be so worried about wealth. I'd want enough gold coins stashed under the time machine's seat that I could get stuff done no matter where I wound up, but my main purpose would probably be technological and social betterment of humanity. I'd try to craft a better world to live in rather than trying to be rich in this crappy old current-day world.

More true, but that is not the same thing as mining them.

The way bitcoin works, it would be easy to determine the physical location of a single active bitcoin miner. All mining servers are connected. That's how they work. Messages are sent between them constantly. This makes them easy to locate, especially if you were a government or powerful interested party. And nothing interests people like the NSA like cutting edge computing they had no idea existed.

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, doing it too much could devalue bitcoin.
#+end_quote

No, it wouldn't. That's not how bitcoin works. Bitcoins are designed from the ground up as a deflationary currency. Limited total possible supply drives individual value gradually up so long as use is (in a complicated way) increasing faster than they are mined. There simply aren't that many unmined coins left for those sorts of effects, even from a very fast and efficient miner.

At worst, such a miner would simply gobble up all remaining coins as a very gradual and already pre-set rate. I'd expect action from the bitcoin server community long before then, however. They'd push out a software update, something to limit the output of coins even further (which they've done before) or negate a single bad actor like your system would be seen as.

But even through massive quantities of bitcoin transactions, you couldn't affect their value that much. Nor would you earn much money, relatively speaking. Not time machine money.

I know that typically miners act as nodes to maintain the block chain, but what would prevent a miner from simply connecting once they've discovered a new bitcoin?

Worst case scenario, you could just connect to the network, claim a bitcoin, then disconnect and reconnect somewhere else or through a proxy or vpn.

Since anybody can mine, there can't possibly be any limitations on that kind of thing.

As I understand it, the pre-set rate is controlled by increasing the difficulty of mining. If you had a supercomputer from the future that could come up with the next bitcoin at the press of a button, that would walk all over any attempts at keeping the process gradual.

So yeah, you could gobble up the remaining bitcoins as fast as you cared to move your computer around to maintain your anonymity.

That is what mining is. Being connected to the peer network to authenticate user transactions. In between doing that, miners churn on hard problems that are publicly agreed on by their peering software, trying to make new blockchains based on artificial difficulty settings to represent the act of confirming user transactions. This encourage people to make their servers do real user transactions as fast as possible, and to leave their servers online.

They aren't curing cancer or something with these blockchain work proof problems, just doing the computer equivalent of reps at the gym. Bigger and faster systems do more, faster, completing more reps overall, with each completed set (sort of) being like a lotto ticket for the next bitcoin prize.

By design, new blockchains require "proof" in the form of lots of busywork being done publicly. Servers therefore need to be connected to get awarded a bitcoin for solving the problems at all, and also to get any transaction fees for real user transactions handled.

Sort of. It is a peering system with artificial difficulty inserted by agreement between all major miners using the same software with the same settings. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining][Mining rates are intentionally kept constant]]:

#+begin_quote
  The bitcoin system adjusts the difficulty target number every 2016 blocks so that the average time the entire network needs to find a nonce always remains about ten minutes.
#+end_quote

So you couldn't make it disgorge bitcoins faster than once every ten minutes or so. And you'd be doing nothing but busy work the rest of the time. Of course, there would be about zero chance of anyone else getting a coin, but that still isn't amazing, financially speaking. Most bitcoins have already been mined, and it would be easy to force you out by all the other miners updating to a version of the software that explicitly or implicitly excludes your system or negates your advantage.

There has been a lot of talk about someone like the US federal government trying something similar, specifically to spy on people or run other man in the middle tricks. Bitcoin advocates have been working on ways to beat someone doing just this, and they think they've got it solved. I don't know the latest details, but I give them the benefit of the doubt on that.

Mining bitcoins isn't a future tech get rich quick scheme, and it certainly isn't done in secret. Someone would notice if all the majors stopped getting awarded their expected bitcoin returns and Russian goons would quickly track down who was doing it and kill their mother...boards.

******** Time machines can solve NP-hard problems in polynomial-time. This is fundamentally different to just having huge amounts of computers and increasing the difficulty will actually just make the disparity worse because everyone else now has to put in exponentially more effort for your polynomial increase.

To make things even worse, you can also roll back arbitrarily large amounts of the block-chain to perform double-spend attacks.

Tor also makes locational secrecy viable, since you only need to be able to communicate with a single full node for this to work, so no Russian goons are going to interrupt you.

Regardless, the main result would be to destroy bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrency) as a viable anything.

Conceivably you could go back and try to adjust some of the great ancient civilizations and try to nudge them into an industrial revolution. Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, Japan to name a few.

Imagining what the Egyptians would have built with even steam power available to them is thought-provoking. If the Egyptians had managed to enter an industrial revolution at their peak, and their building fixation had been adjusted to something a bit more community-minded rather than giant places for dead rulers, we would have been on the Moon and Mars a thousand years ago.

Entirely possible. But the horror is still that you can't ever go back. Go back too long before you time and everyone you knew is lost to you. To you, they are as good as dead, as you are to them -- unless you can do something more like dimensional travel or dialing in other timelines.

That's why /Sliders/ worked: they weren't time traveling, just dimension jumping. That (mostly) didn't affect the next "world" they ended up in while allowing for spooky similarities. That kind of thing doesn't make sense for time travel.

Well, with events and people new /to you/, if you went back far enough. A corollary of being in a paradox-free timeline situation is that going back before the voyages of discovery doesn't result in the third US President being someone else, it means the US most likely doesn't /exist/ as the US anymore.

Paradox resistant or automatically resolving universes (high irony environments) for time travel is fun sometimes, but seems like the least likely. Either all time travel should be already accounted for casually speaking in a single timeline, or stuff should likely get really wild for any time traveler heading into the past.
