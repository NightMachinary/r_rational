*Spoilers up to Arc 13*

*Before I start with my issues with Worm, I'd just like to say that I still find Worm a very engaging read. I think the writing is great, and my only issue with it is that it doesn't fit the rational genre.

I'm currently on Arc 14, so I'll only reference stuff prior to that*

My requirements for rational fiction include a rational protagonist, a consistent world (with people acting in their own interests), competent antagonists, and evidence building up to major plot events (if I can look back at earlier chapters, I can see the event happening)

In my opinion, Worm doesn't really have any of this. At this point, Taylor hasn't acted rationally at all. She has no plans, no real contingencies, and she just reacts to events. She's competent and clever, but she doesn't think rationally. She doesn't even think about her moral qualms rationally. Also, her plan to free Dinah is pretty much just "impress Coil", and she doesn't have a plan in case that fails.

The world is inconsistent, and there is nothing really rational about powers. They just *exist*. This isn't bad, it's just not rational.

The people in the world seemingly have no self-preservation, and they mouth off to a supervillain with /SuperEvilBugPowersTM/ who is trying to help them. This completely broke my suspension of disbelief because it just isn't realistic, and I can't picture anyone actually doing it

The antagonists are incompetent, and they all lose to a brand new villain. Mannequin, a superpowered robot, fails to do any sort of planning, and loses to spider silk. He has no tricks accumulated from his many years of villainy. In the second fight, he loses to a puppy.

The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter, so I think that also breaks a core principle of rational fiction.

I'd like to say again that this isn't a critique on the story, it's just why I don't think it belongs in [[/r/rational]]

*Edit: I admit I was wrong, and that my assumptions were based on a small slice of the book.*


** This opinion isn't even unpopular ...

But I found this line so baffling that I have to respond to it:

Rational fic doesn't mean literally every plot event is predictable. That wouldn't even make sense - every core concept has to be introduced at /some point/. There's no point before the introduction of the Endbringers where you would need to know about them to understand what's going on.

In particular, the reveal of the Endbringers is the /introduction/ of a conflict, not a resolution to anything.

** Wildbow have stated that worm isn't rational so you seem to be barking at a dead horse. That said

"Having not yet read half of the story I can confidently assert that there is no information in the remaining book that could possibly make the setting internally consistent"

If you really want it spoiled read [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Entity][here]]. Worm does a good job at creating a internally consistent world in which superpowered people in capes hit others like them, though at your point you lack the information to see the underlying reasons.

Coins don't shoot people. Don't make irrational arguments.

Entities with the name Endbringers in a superhero setting probably deserve the name.You know, doing things like destroying cities. And they wouldn't be much of a threat if they just handed a calendar to the president showing where and what day they are going to attack for the next 300 years.

Skitter thought they were a possibility in attacking the city, Tattletale thought of the idea morbid not silly, showing again that the city being attacked is a very real possibility. Imagine Skitter going

"Tattletale imagine one of the Endbringers attack, oh just in case you haven't heard of them even though you are not a cave girl who just time traveled from 20k BCE. Anyways the Endbringers are monsters who randomly attack cities and stuff, for example Leviathan attacks coastal cities with his water powers. He sank Newfoundland and a chunk of Japan into the sea before, you might not of saw or heard the news about that or noticed all the Japanese refugees. Oh just in case you haven't notice even though you been to the boardwalk, our city is a costal city."

That was actually the point I was making. Nobody expects coins to shoot people the same way nobody expects mentioning the Endbringers in conversation summons them.

While I don't disagree with the point that foreshadowing isn't required for rationality, and that I was wrong in believing otherwise, I think my metaphor was pretty apt in explaining why mentioning the Endbringers in passing didn't make the attack forseeable

**** I agree that the Endbringers aren't really foreshadowed in the text. That said, I'm willing to forgive this for the most part, because they're foreshadowed by the genre. Monsters so dangerous that they force the strongest heroes and villains in the world to team up to fight them are a staple of superhero fiction---for instance, Thanos, Ultron, Doomsday, Darkseid, and more. I didn't see Leviathan coming, but IMO, it still felt like he fit into the setting once his role became clear at the beginning of arc 8. He's one of the Doomsdays of the Wormverse, one of the kaiju.

** Taylor tries to figure out solutions to her problems, in life and in battle, rather than waiting for a Voice of Wisdom to tell her the Author's Approved Answer.

Taylor tries (clumsily!) to make her life and her world better, rather than accepting that Just Because I Have Superpowers Doesn't Mean I Should Actually Try To Fix Things.

Taylor lives in a world where masked superheroes mostly feel like a force of actual chaos and social breakdown, rather than Somehow The World Isn't Changed.

Those three are what makes /Worm/ rational-appealing for a lot of people.

As you say, there are a lot of anti-rational elements. Taylor is /not/ sensible about her life choices outside battle tactics. The justification for the repeated failures of cooperation is mostly hidden from the reader until very late. Taylor keeps hitting world-scale people and issues like the Endbringers, for reasons that have a lot more to do with a fun story than justified logic.

But a story where the POV actually /tries to figure out answers while we're reading/ is so rare that /Worm/ ends up feeling rational-appealing to a lot of us anyway.

So if your definition is "how sensible is this hero?", /Worm/ isn't rational.

If your definition is "how likely is this series of events?", /Worm/ isn't rational.

But maybe your definition is "how much does the story approve of trying to figure out answers? Of using your situation to make your life and world better?" In that case, /Worm/ is definitely a rational-adjacent delight.

***** Massive spoilers for both Worm and Ward below

I think I have to disagree with you on this. Given what we learned in Worm about how the S9 was formed and how the Shards are interacting with each other, I don't think it's inconsistent. Mannequin may not have had to go through the same tests as went down in Brockton Bay. The Brockton Bay Trials were a way for Jack to entertain himself, whereas he may have been piqued by the contrast between Mannequin and Sphere already.

Furthermore, as Taylor has the Queen Administrator shard she is going to subconsciously get fed information about the weaknesses of enemy capes. Her shard is designed for information and coordination and will happily pass that information to its host. You see similar things in most of her fights, actually; her ability to detect weakness is probably not just natural ability.

Also, we know that Tinkers are very, very susceptible to planning issues. They can be ridiculously overpowered if they prepare for the right situations, but if they encounter something they haven't already prepared for then it is almost impossible for them to improvise a novel solution. Especially if someone is feeding their enemy hints about their weak points.

** Since somebody else brought this up, an adjacent complaint: the Entities' goal/plan is asinine. It's roughly equivalent to the Pentagon deciding to test the F-35 by breaking up all its systems and distributing them randomly among a bunch of chimps who didn't understand them to see what they did with them. One ape gets the guns, another the sensors, a third the engines, a fourth the computer, and they all bumble around the jungle using these new tricks to dominate each other and secure the territories with the best hunting and fruit trees.

What would that tell you about the performance of the entire plane by a human pilot who understands its purpose and can use all of its abilities together to achieve vastly different ends? The same thing human capes can teach Scion and Eden: bupkus.

** 1. If that's your criterion then I can't fault you. I have less stringent expectations from protagonists of rational fiction. If they and their biases are consistent and dynamic the way a smart person in their position plausibly could be, it passes my test. No real life human is perfectly rational after all.

2. By that argument none of the fantasy fiction on here is rational fiction. Even the most internally consistent magic system still either "just exist" or were intelligently designed by some super-being.

3. People throw stuff at armed convoys belonging to invading foreign forces IRL.

4. The antagonists lose to a new villain with backing from an old villain. I won't go further due to spoilers. Mannequin is certifiably insane.

5. The Enbringers were foreshadowed multiple times. Like before the bank robbery for instance. They were a part of the setting from the beginning and no less out of left field than a hurricane.
