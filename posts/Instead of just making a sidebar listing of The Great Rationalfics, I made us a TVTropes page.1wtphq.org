** Thank you for doing this, I don't know what we would do without you!

Btw, I think you should put [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]] (originally by name The-Day-That-Santa-Stole-Christmas) in the other fics. It's written really well (although a bit short) and it uses all rational tropes fantastically.

** It's a good page. I understand why there is currently such a heavy emphasis on fanfiction on the page, but do we expect that emphasis to fade with time, to the point where a more general page might be RationalFic*tion*? As an aspiring Fantasy author myself, I like to imagine everything above the Bonus Points section applies to my project.

********* I would actually do it if I knew that most people wanted it. Like, do we, as a community, want to rename it to Rational Fiction? I'm not sure if it's that good because it kinda makes it sound a bit like every other fiction is horribly irrational and dumb, whereas RationalFic sounds a bit more palatable.

...or maybe I'm talking out of my ass. I don't really know.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander%20effect][*Bystander effect*]]:

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The *bystander effect* is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology)][social psychological]] phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs. These variables include: ambiguity, cohesiveness and diffusion of responsibility.

*** I assume you meant Wiz Biz, by Rick Cook.

I really don't feel like Wiz Biz teaches any useful lessons at all, really - I mean, it has the trappings of computer science mixed with the trappings of magic, but overall it has basically no lessons to teach, and it isn't particularly well-written - basically, it has nothing to commend it to my attention as particularly rational, or even interesting.

I don't hate it. It wasn't interesting enough to hate, or even feel strongly at all about. I just thought it was sort of 'blah'.
