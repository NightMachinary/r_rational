** What an interesting story. I'm only halfway through the first chapter and I'm already intrigued and quite charmed by the writing style.

Edit: Lord a'mercy, four chapters and already it's a wild ride!

**** The very imaginative kind, the kind that I have exactly zero concept of where it might be going. Give it a read, it isn't long, and then you can come to your own conclusions.

** I do so wish I could converse as the woodland creatures appear to do on demand. T'would be a merry trick for congregations.

Also, nega-Alice is loony as all heck and would make an excellent villain. I wanna try to make her a DnD character somehow.

Also also, Sheriff freaking out in Texan at going 20 mph is hilarious.

** "So I was like 'Help! My wife is a pokemon!', right? But then I realized Detective Pikachu was actually a pretty great movie! ....

Where was I again?"

"You were explaining why your life /isn't/ a Pokemon mystery dungeon crossover."

"Oh, uh yeah. I guess it's got more in common with the Detective Pikachu movie than Mystery Dungeon or regular Pokemon. Except, you know, the part where we actually try to tell people that Pokemon have human level intelligence instead of keeping quiet about it."

*** Oh, thank you! I'm going to blame all the extra spacing on some artifact of the conversion process from a word doc to RTF, and try to find a better way to do it in the future.

** Still enjoying this very much. The interlude is an absolute pleasure to read.

EDIT: Not sure if this is intentional due to not-Alice's whimsical internal narration, but the phrase is "all of *a* sudden."

** This is wonderful. But they should check if she is running on 3.pf rules, or just Pathfinder.
