*** it's been pretty good. right now we're in the "system exploration/slice of life" part of the story. However, the entire story's labored under a sense of paranoia, secrecy, and unease, as the life, relationships and abilities of the lizard person are explored and tensions around the campus are ramped up. So while nothing dramatic's happened /yet,/ it's creeping closer.
