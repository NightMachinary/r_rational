Got it done on time this week!

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/03/01/chapter-12-5/]]

As ever, let me know how I'm doing; feedback helps the story improve. For those of you who haven't run into it yet, Pyrebound is a dark high fantasy serial, slated to last about fifteen arcs/chapters, with a vaguely Mesopotamian flavor. The world is brutally unjust, and human society follows suit; our hero is the little guy in over his head. The first chapter of PB starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thank you!


** Loved the "this changes everything" failure of communication bit. When unprepared, Ram assumes his Ensi is on the same page, when of course he's not.
