Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a time leap ability that is blessed with suck. Every second, there is a very small chance that you will be forcibly time leaped backwards by 5 minutes. On average, the ability triggers about 10 times a day. There is no way to predict when the ability will be triggered, and no warning whatsoever. The ability can even be triggered consecutively, sending you much further than 5 minutes backwards in time.

There are no signs of the ability triggering. You simply suddenly time leap. So for example, if you are just standing still and admiring a work of art for a long period of time, you may not even notice your ability activate during that period. Similarly, time leaping while you are sleeping is unnoticeable, your sleep will not be disturbed by your ability (unless you time leap to before you got in bed, at which point you could fall over and probably wake up from the impact).

On the other hand, the time leap can be somewhat disorienting if you were in a very different situation 5 minutes ago, such as transitioning from walking to swimming. So certain actions, like driving, can be very dangerous.

How would you use or deal with this ability?

*** Hire someone to push notifications to your phone every 2 minutes or so about what the best performing stock/best stock to short in the previous 2 minutes. Spend a lot of time on your phone doing whatever, but make sure to memorize the push notifications whenever they come up. Whenever I notice a skip, immediately tell my person what stock to buy. Roughly 5 minutes later they can sell it again. Doing this there's a good chance you can make enough to live very comfortably and always have someone drive you places, as well as pay the person that's pushing you notifications. I'm sure the military would also pay for random 5-minutes from the future reports even if they can't control when it happens.

You could also just spend the day enjoying watching a sport that has heavy batting on the outcome, and same situation. Don't bet until you notice a jump.

*** If it triggers roughly 10/day, there's an expected value of (10 leaps in 86400 seconds/day + 10 leaps/day * 300 seconds/leap = 0.000112 leaps/second); multiply this by 300 seconds/leap to get 0.0336 "extra" leaps per leap - the expected value of getting a second leap before the first is over. This will happen roughly once every (1 extra leap / 0.0336 extra leaps per leap = 29.8 leaps per extra leap; 29.8 leaps per extra leap / 10 leaps/day = 2.98 days per extra leap). However, this is equally likely to be a leap on second 1 or second 299 of the initial leap; if we restrict to, say, the first 30 seconds of the initial leap, we take our math above to get 1/10th as many useful events, so we get a second leap within 30 seconds of the first - a total jump back of between 570 and 600 seconds - about every 30 days (one in 300 leaps). If we want a third, we'd get that once in every 300 _second_ leaps, which would be about 50 years; let's not count on that.

All this is to say, we can reliably count on going back slightly further in time, with which we can build in all sorts of slightly more complex behaviors. This is a modification to all of the other suggestions on this comment, not competitor to them.

** I read an interesting magic in a [[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/2357][glowfic]] recently. The fic was incomplete and old, so I'm filling in the blanks to make it more definitive for the purpose of a Saturday munchkinry thread, and making it take slightly less time, to make it slightly easier to munchkin.

By repeating the exact same action, over and over again, down to the exact same muscles used in the exact same way with the exact same tools, until your muscle memory is perfect and automatic, followed by visualizing and exertion of willpower, you can acquire the ability to telekinetically apply this action. This basic telekinetic tool is referred to as a memni (memnos plural).

The muscle memory stage typically takes 3-6 months of practice (depending on the complexity of the action and assuming you practice correctly). It generally takes another 6 months of practice with visualization/willpower exertion to get the first initial bit of telekinesis, followed by several more years of practice to get the telekinesis to the same strength and precision as the practiced action. 2-3 years for a simple/fast action with a simple tool, closer 5 years for a more complex action or for an action that uses more complicated tools. Subsequent memni can be learned somewhat faster, the strengthening of the telekinesis take about half the time.

Existing motor skills can sometimes be leveraged to develop a memni faster (maybe around half the time for a motor skill that has been already perfected), but then this doesn't result in any improvements to the time to develop subsequent memni.

Interrelated memnos can form a synergy together and form a single more flexible, more efficient, and more general usage tool, refereed to as a memnodyne.

So as a basic example, lifting a rock vertically and holding it for a year would get very limited vertical lifting telekinesis. After another two years of practice, you would have telekinesis that could precisely lift objects that weighed equal to or less (but still close in weight) than the rock your practiced with, to the same precision as your hand, moving a distance equal to or less than the height you lifted the rock to, at speeds equal to or less than the speed you lifted the rock, with range of about arms length. Spending another year practicing moving a rock horizontally would get very limited horizontal telekinesis, followed by another year to get horizontal telekinesis up to strength and synergizing with the vertical telekinesis. Once it synergized into a memnodyne, you could move object in any direction, with improvements on speed/max distance/max weight,range (improvements generally being the combined values of the memnos that made up the memnodyne).

Memnodyne, and to some extent memnos, can also apply some esoteric effects. A memnodyne composed of several woodworking memni might allow for directly applying a mental image to the wood and rapidly and nearly instantly forming it into such. At an extreme example, combing multiple medical memnos (applying anesthetic, applying stitches, cutting away rotting/infected tissue, applying a sterilizing substance, applying a bandage) could be combined to get a memnodyne that allows rapid healing of various types of wounds. (This is an extreme example, it would take over a decade to learn and require practice on living subjects.)

So munchkin ideas.

- Best single action to make into a memni?

- What memnodyne would actually be economically worth it to develop? In modern times or in less technologically developed times periods?

- Given unlimited practice time (or much faster learning of memni), what memnodynes would be most powerful/flexible.

- Ways of getting economic value out of people who are practicing? (At a simple end, subjects that can be learned over audiobook while they practice, and a more complicated end, Amazon mechanical Turk type tasks they can perform while also practicing)

- Best weapon memni? (Note if you wanted to make a bow-and-arrow memni, you would have to use the same arrow every time (to get arrow like telekinesis) or make the memni just of the bow (to get telekinesis that launches object that are sufficiently like an arrow). Also, if your arrow/bow breaks, you are out of luck...)

And a few munchkin ideas I've already had:

- Use sensors to detect body position to ensure optimal practice.

- Precisely crafted simple machines (levers, pulleys, rails, guides) to develop memni for heavy weights and to make the motor action as simple and fast as possible to make practicing easier and faster.

- Sensory memni/memnodyne. (Looking through a pair of binoculars, looking through a magnifier glass, sweeping your eyes over the same way again and again).

*Edit:* I don't think I explained what can get included as a tool correctly. During the visualization stage, you can decide what counts as a tool and what is included. So for example, if you repeatedly swung an axe, you can either get a telekinesis that swing objects (if you don't include the axe), or telekinesis that chops objects (if you do include the axe).

*** Typing. (Or really pressing one keyboard button.) (Or phone button!)

This is an incredibly simple and fast action, and you would repeat it almost all the time anyway, so I imagine it would be incredibly quick to master with very little effort.

But now we have a question: what are the range/restrictions on this telepathy? Can I type on my home computer's keyboard while I am outdoors? Do I need to be able to see it somehow, like through a camera? Do obstacles matter? Can I "type" in someone's heart to kill them?

For that matter, does it need to be muscle memory from an "active" muscle? Can I just use my heart beat, which beats all the time anyway? That would be even faster to learn than typing, and could be used to pump all kinds of things other than blood.

Blinking could also work, but it would be a really really weak telekinetic force.

​

Edit: Re-reading the rules again, I find myself confused. Rock lifting lets you telekinetically lift other lighter objects, but gun-firing only lets you fire one specific bullet and nothing else? Why?

#+end_quote

I'll edit the rules to explain them more clearly... for the rock lifting, you would need to practice with the exact same rock but the resulting telekinesis would apply to a more general category. If you wanted to get a "bullet force" telekinesis (telekinetic blasts that hit with the force of a bullet) from practicing firing a gun you would need to somehow fire the same bullet over and over again when you practiced.... although now that I think about how I described it, you could get gun telekinesis (launching objects of a similar/smaller size of a bullet at bullet speeds) as long as the gun stayed the same across your practice. I'll try to describe that better.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It needs to be an exact set of motor actions that you do. So you would either have to make a single keypress the memni, or maybe make several separate key presses with different fingers into separate memni and then combine them into a memnodyne.

And to follow up on the gun/bullet distinction. During the visualization/willpower stage, you can decide whether the keyboard gets counted as part of it. If you didn't include the keyboard, it is small telekinetic presses. So if you included the keyboard, your memni wouldn't be generating button pushing telekinesis, it would be telekinetically generating the electrical impulses that a keyboard outputs. The power would cheat a bit, especially when it reaches the level of memnodyne, to make the output of the keyboard work towards the end result, i.e. if you tried giving the output to a computer that lacked the drivers of the keyboard you practiced with.

#+begin_quote
  what are the range/restrictions on this telepathy? Can I type on my home computer's keyboard while I am outdoors?
#+end_quote

The range would be that of your arm's reach initially (for telekinesis). With practice it might extend a little. If you included the keyboard, it might be the length of the keyboard's cable. To get long range, you would need to combine it with another memni that has a long range. So use a bluetooth keyboard when you develop it initially (to get the range of a bluetooth connection), then develop memni for longer range pieces of wireless technology.

#+begin_quote
  For that matter, does it need to be muscle memory from an "active" muscle?
#+end_quote

It needs to be something that you consciously exert control over for the visualization and willpower focusing part of the exercise to work right.

#+begin_quote
  Can I just use my heart beat, which beats all the time anyway?
#+end_quote

If you gained precise enough control of your heartbeat through biofeedback, you could maybe make that work? So even if you needed less practice of the movement, you would need to practice biofeedback to get control over your own hearbeat. The resulting memni sounds like it might be really useful... telekinetic circulation of blood (if you don't include the blood as part of the memni) or telekinetic distribution of oxygen and nutrients (if you do include the blood).

*** I think walking and/or running would be a popular one, because the muscle memory stage should be easier to reach. I assume you'd have to be walking in a straight line though, turning is a different movement. I'm not sure what effect it would have though. My initial assumption is that it would let you levitate yourself horizontally in a straight line at walking speed, which seems fairly useful. Does using a memni tire you out at all?

I could see some sort of farming related memni being very common at some point in the past - planting, maybe, since that doesn't necessarily require a tool and can be used for multiple crops?

**** Walking should result in levitation/hovering with forward motion at a similar speed to your walking speed. Combined with several other memni and you might have limited flight.

The complete memni doesn't require any physical exertion, but the process of developing a memni requires completing the same motor actions over and over again, and if you get so tired you can no longer maintain the precise movements, that limits your ability to practice. So if 4 hours of walking (with precisely controlled movements)!is tiring enough to prevent you from walking 4 more hours in the same day, your practice schedule is going to take twice as long (the training time assumes 8 hour a day practice).

Farming tools sound like an interesting idea. You would need to refine your movements to make them precisely the same, but with enough care you could still be doing work as you practiced. And a complete farming memnodyne might have useful esoteric properties, speeding up the plant growth for example.

*** Do all your muscles need to be used in the exact same way, or just the ones relevant to the task?

Could driving a car be a memni? Specifically pushing the gas pedal and visualizing the car as a tool.

In less technologically advanced societies, a fire creating memni would be very useful, but I can't think of how you could develop a fire creating memni without something like a lighter, because I assume most other tools would wear out too much.

**** All the muscles under your active conscious control need to be used the same way. So the smooth muscles in your intestine don't mess up your practice, and even actions irrelevant to the task that you don't think about (like blinking or eye movements) won't mess up your practice, but actively doing something else with different muscles will.

The car could be a memni. You would need to make sure you can maintain the car without outright replacing any major parts for the entire process, and because a car is such a complicated tool, it would take on the longer end (5 years) for the memni to fully develop. The end result would be something along the lines of hovering and forward movement (depending on the visualization and how the car is accelerated).

If your society has glass working, a magnifying glass could work. Depending on the exact visualization, it could get you a memni that creates burning heat at a point or a memni that bends light towards a point. Combine with several other light manipulating memni (using mirrors or glass), you could get a pretty useful light manipulating memnodyne.

A sufficiently durable fire bow drill could maybe work (maybe you could make one out of metal). The base board and kindling are consumed and thus cannot be part of the memni, but the drill shaft, bow, and hand piece are all constant and could be part of the memni. The resulting memni couldn't create fire out of nothing, but given a softwood and/or kindling could generate friction and heat on them.

You could use an oil lamp to transfer fire around. The should get a straight pyrokinesis memni. Combine with one of the ignition techniques described above and maybe a few other memni (fans or bellows for aerokinesis), and you could get a pretty powerful, general purpose memnodyne.

** Suppose there exists an exotic form of chemosynthesis driven by gravitationally-interacting dark matter, and that this chemosynthetic process suffices to support multicellular organisms without regard to the cube-square law: As long as the organism is exposed to a sufficient concentration of unrespired dark matter, it is transported to and from individual cells by naturally occuring dark matter currents without any effort on the part of the organism. As long as the organism avoids regions of low dark matter content, it can subsist without respiration and only requires food and water insofar as they are required to support growth and cell replacement. This form of chemosynthesis can occur on a cellular basis in individual chemoplasts, but is considerably more efficient if performed in a dedicated organ composed of a particular kind of nacre-like biosilicate. Due to gravitational effects, the required form of dark matter increases in concentration as one descends in the gravity well.

Suppose that both photosynthesis and more conventional forms of chemosynthesis also evolved in this hypothetical universe, in addition to this dark matter based 'nyctosynthesis'. How does this change the history of evolution? What sorts of organisms would arise, and which ecological niches would they fill? Would you see photosynthetic and nyctosynthetic life in the same environments, or would they compete to the point of one or the other going extinct?

*** Earth probably wouldn't survive nyctosynthesis, but Mars could! And it would be fascinating.

The big problem here is nyctosynthesis effectively creates energy out of "nothing", assuming its use of dark matter does not have any other effect. The chemical energy will be used to create large molecules that are eventually burned, either by mitochondria or by forest fires.

Effectively, the planet could have artificial GLOBAL seasons that are independent of its orbit. First, there will be a Growth Season, where large masses of nyctosynthesis organisms grow and spread everywhere, creating tons of chemical energy.

This chemical energy would get converted to heat energy over time, bringing about a Burning Season, where global temperatures rise so high that most of the organisms die off. There could even be a catastrophic chain reaction where the higher temperatures result in more fires that turn more of the chemical energy into heat.

Finally, the planet cools down again in a Cooling Season since most of the chemical energy has been used up. Once temperatures drop far enough, the next Growth Season arrives as the few remaining organisms once again experience explosive growth.

Any intelligent life that evolves on this planet would be truly pitiful.

Although eventually the heat would be too much for even this life and it would die out to, unless it had a way of self regulating, like maybe going dormant at too high temperature. So you might get a heating season/cooling season like you described, or it might form a homeostasis at just below the maximum temperature life can function at and fluctuate around it as various life forms go dormant when it goes too high and active again when it drops.

*** So more massive planets would favor nyctosynthesis and smaller planets would favor photosynthesis, both for surface area available and forge gravity well at work. Given how rarely life has occurred in our universe, and the diversity of life that has evolved, whatever planet does develop life will probably eventually evolve both types of life (just as our planet as chemovores in specialized niches), although one or the other may end up being very niche and only existing at the fringes.

For a nyctosynthesis dominated ecosystem... Initially, prior to the evolution of multicellular organisms, life would occur at various the interfaces of materials suitable for life. These areas would be maximally colonized by nyctosynthesizing bacterial mats. The first multicellular organism would burrow through the layers of mats to get at biomass and serve to diversify this monobiome. Also, depending on how frequently the dark matter currents shift, I could envision mats blooming as the current waxes and then dying off and being scavenged by chemovores and more energy efficient nyctosynthesizers as the current wanes. Burrowing organisms would adapt to follow the current and to reach now sources of scarce materials. At an end state, the planet's crust would be thoroughly processed and intermixed to be composed of biomass with an abundance of energy but intense competition for biomass toward the core and and a scarcity of energy toward the edges. Photosynthesis would exist as a niche on the surface where nyctosynethesis is at it's weakest and sunlight available.
