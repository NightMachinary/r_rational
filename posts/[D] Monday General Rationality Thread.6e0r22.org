Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I am depressed about politics again and hate how much hatred I have allowed myself to feel towards my political opponents. It's not even Trump that gets to me anymore, it's the fact that his supporters and allies continuously fail to question his competence or admit his failures. The White House didn't even deny the $2 trillion accounting error in the budget proposal and people are still backing it.

I hate this so much that I worry that I may become a hypocrite towards my belief that all humans deserve equal rights and all suffering should be prevented. I care less and less about these people who proudly choose to follow a path that will harm themselves and others, so I'm worried that I wouldn't be willing to aid someone or prevent them from suffering purely because they disagree with my political views.

I don't want to be that kind of person. I used to identify as a centrist because I was worried about bias from both parties, but now I fear one party so much that I'm allowing myself to feel bias against anyone who voted differently from me and doesn't regret it. I want to be the kind of person who's better than that, someone who feels compassion towards everyone and does not compromise their views.

This is kind of an alien idea for me since I've always hated stories about revenge. I don't feel catharsis from seeing evil people get punished, just stopped from inflicting more harm. Except...part of me would be okay if the people I hate suffer and I'm not adamantly rejecting these thoughts as strongly as I used to. I just know on a detached intellectual level that such a course of action won't make me happy and won't make the situation better.

Understandable. But consider - there are sane viewpoints that agree with /everything/ that you think about Trump and /still/ would defend a vote for him.

The simplest and most straightforward of these viewpoints is the idea that Trump is not significantly worse than any other politician - he is merely worse at hiding his transgressions. This point of view relies on the idea that /any/ President would be as bad, but at least with this one everyone can /see/ how bad he is and work on mitigating the problems.

The second possible viewpoint is the single-issue voter - a person who thinks that one single issue is /so important/ that Trump's support for it (and his opponent's lack of support for it) is so incredibly vital that it outweighs all of his problems.

Mind you, I'm not saying that either of these are necessarily in any way right. I am simply presenting these as positions that sane people can hold.

(Personally, as someone who doesn't live in America, I have no say in your voting; but I think your entire electoral system is broken and needs some serious revision).

I remain in full agreement with this stance. And further; it is /important/ for the American political establishment to take climate change seriously.

It seems that Trump is not taking climate change seriously. The next question, then, is obvious; had his opponent been elected instead, then would said opponent have taken climate change seriously?

From your previous post, it seems that the answer to this question is 'yes'. Which leads to the following question; do the people who voted for Trump agree with you on this?

A man who thinks that neither Trump nor his opponent will do anything good on the climate change front will not consider this matter when deciding where to vote; in his mind, he's deciding on a dead heat, and must pay attention to other factor instead.

(Mind you, you Americans /do/ need to deal with the climate change problem properly. Have you considered organising a protest march to the White House, or as close as the public is permitted?)

we all have limited time and energy, and that cuts us off from some possibilities, especially when there are people actively working against us, including the recently elected political regime. there is nothing wrong with pushing that suffering onto the people causing it in the first place in order to help the people they would try to hurt, even if the only reason to do so is so that you have more to help others with. it is a difficult decision to make, but it is the rational thing to do.

*** I've been through this myself, and I've decided that recognizing that I hate these people (and more so, that hatred is the only emotion appropriate to feel for monsters of great magnitude) is not a moral failing of myself, but simply accepting a fact. I tried very hard not to hate them, to make excuses, to see whatever shreds of worth they might have, but ultimately I failed.

These people are objectively wrong about every single thing they believe. There isn't a single position they hold where they can be said to be morally or factually correct. All of their ideas tend towards maximizing human suffering. My realization is that I should not hate myself for believing that.

At first, this felt horrible. Like I had compromised something precious that I could not get back. But that didn't change the fact that I hate these people. I can recognize this fact about myself, accept it, and move on.

It is a sad fact about our world that sometimes you are forced to behead all of the blood purists. That no matter your convictions, evil people must be prevented from ever holding a shred of power, no matter the cost in misery or broken faith.

Liberal voters tend to be less hawkish, and while many conservatives talk about how the US is spending too much time/effort caring about other countries, which is a part of isolationism, they're also often the first ones who support overt military action to resolve conflicts.

See for example the recent wild beating of the war drums against Iran during Obama's presidency. I believe Rand Paul is the only well known Republican who speaks loudly and consistently for isolationism, and that's because he's mostly a libertarian.

I'm just so angry about this. I won't call it irrational anger, because it is rational to be angry at existential threats to human civilization (referring to climate change denial here), but I am /extremely/ angry. And I do, at this point, believe that if there were a button I could press to instantly de-Nazify all neonazis and their ilk I would press that button in an instant, no matter the cost to myself and no matter anyone else's qualms about mind control.

I know being this angry isn't terribly helpful to me, but I've been angry at one thing or another for practically my entire life. I don't exactly know why that is, but it's true.

I've just decided that recognizing my anger, rather than trying to hide it or pretend it's something else, is better for me. I am /enraged/ by the concept of climate denial. It makes me incredibly angry when someone tries to spew blatantly false apologetics for healthcare in this country. It would be rhetorically accurate to say that I am racist against racists. I don't know how I can change any of these things about myself, and considering that all of those are due to my wish to protect all of humanity from death and misery, I am unsure that I should.

Thinking on it, I think it /would/ be easy for me to have been a racist scumbag in a world where I was raised by some. Instead I was raised by the good kind of clergy: those who preach about justice and mercy and actually attempt to walk that walk most of the time. As a result, the people I cannot tolerate are the people who don't try to do that. I think it's better this way.

The last time fascism was normalized in an industrial nation 60,000,000 people died, and it is simply not worth taking risks around that kind of proven threat.

I don't know how we de-normalize this scrap. My ultimate goal is to make everyone who believes it slink back into the darkness in shame, but the box has been opened and we have major news outlets giving time to people who openly advocate violence upon innocents. The last time this started happening, war became the only way out.

I don't want them to die (most of the time. I do get irrationally angry about this stuff sometimes). I just don't see how we stop them before it gets to that point.

Moving on, I also work in healthcare and there are several obvious solutions to the innovation problem which you don't appear to have considered. For instance, we could massively increase funding to NIH, taking the burden of funding preliminary research entirely off Pharma's shoulders. We could give stupidly generous tax benefits to any company which spends some large percentage of revenue on medical research. Sure, things would almost certainly be worse for Pharma, but "collapse the pharmaceutical industry" is alarmism. There are better options available than allowing millions of Americans to have no access to lifesaving preventative care.

If it helps, I've more or less resigned myself to the fact that Trump may be approximately as incompetent as his opponents claim. As far as I'm concerned, he's still a categorically superior choice to the alternative we were presented with, and he's already demonstrated his value as a vehicle to drive more people to ethno-nationalist and dominionist movements. Even all else being the same, his rise coincided with tons of people becoming woke on the JQ, the thots, race realism, etc. We won't be lied to by the international cliques and the rootless cosmopolitans any more, and as long as Trump's in power we have a reasonable chance of keeping our 1st and 2nd amendment rights to transform beliefs into actions.

***** If you're an omnihedonist like Singer, you have exactly zero credibility pretending to be outraged from a Christian moral standpoint. There can be guilt in pleasure, and virtue in suffering. Both possibly to the extent that they override pathetic considerations about autonomy and non-aggression.

** Starting to see where Eliezer's opinion on politics as the mind-killer comes from.

Everyone is talking in circles about their hatred for the current US government - yet no one seems to be discussing how to actually fix things.

There really are only two opinions:

1. It's impossible to fix.
2. It isn't.

If you earnestly believe (1) then why bother bringing it up? It'd be like ranting about gravity.

If you believe (2) then you should be discussing how to attack the problem. Ranting about it just wastes time at best and helps the target of your hatred at worst - I suspect Trump's victory is in part because of the brand recognition received by people mocking him.

Alternatively if you're not going to attempt to fix the problem, then this must be for the sake of catharsis. If that's the case, you're going about this the wrong way.

News spreads because it seems important and controversial in the moment. But that gives you a method for dealing with it, just step back and assess how important it really is. You wont feel so hot blooded if you wait a month before peeking at the shenanigans of government.

Sorry if this has been overly confrontational, but we're supposed to a community of aspiring rationalists.

In other news my GP has prescribed me antidepressants - specifically escitalopram. Anyone got any on the ground experience they could offer?

*** I think a lot of people feel that they're incapable of influencing large-scale politics and so just take a back seat. Not exactly the best approach but I can understand it.

I don't know about those specific antidepressants, but I do have unwanted advice in general about them. The biggest thing that I see incredibly smart people fall for is the idea that now that they feel better, they don't need the medicine anymore. I think it's better to look at it as something that improves your life in a positive way, and something that you should get used to having for the rest of your life, even with the common stigmas people have about mental ilnesses and medicine.

Completely unwarranted advice but I just felt compelled to say that after seeing it happen so often. Hope that the medicine works well for you, depression is a bitch.

**** I second the importance of continuing the medication, but it's worth noting that it is sometimes (often?) possible to reduce and eventually discontinue the dosage.

The crucial thing is that you follow medical advice (i.e. ask your doctor before altering your dosage), and that you carefully monitor yourself for signs of depression or suicidal ideation until you're stable (for at least a month after you've ceased intake, preferably 6 months), and to inform your psychiatrist/GP if

I'm not on escitalopram, so I don't have any specific advice. In a general sense, depression medication is at least partially a stop-gap measure. Whether you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or not, depression impinges on your ability to live your life. This is, obviously, a bad thing. Medication may not cure you in the short term, but it should allow you to regain more ability to function.

This is an important concept. The thing that will ultimately cure your depression is you, whether it's through lifestyle change, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even continued use of medication. Medication is what allows you to get to that point.

There may be side effects, and that's one reason why the end goal is usually to discontinue the medication if it's safe to do so. Make sure you know what side effects escitalopram can cause, and notify your doctor if more serious ones occur.

It's like any other prescription, really. If you had epilepsy, would you stop taking the medication that helped control it just because you hadn't had a seizure in a while? Hopefully not, but you might be able to stop it if your doctor agreed that a non-medication treatment plan would be sufficient (and, it bears repeating, you'd monitor your health and tell them if you relapsed).

*TL;DR:* Depression is an actual illness that needs to be treated. Medication is often a key component of that treatment, either temporarily or indefinitely. Don't ignore the treatment plan just because your disease is neurological.

*** My partner is on a high dose of escitalopram. Like most SSRIs, it is very likely to interfere with your bedroom function (the equipment still works OK, but getting to completion is an issue).

In terms of doing "what it's meant to", he seems pretty happy with it. He's gained a lot of weight since he was on it though, and sleeps almost all day (he's got a script for modafinil that he takes daily, and he will still regularly sleep 2-6 hours during the day). He also has sleep apnoea which can't help.

But he's on a big dosage (40mg/day) so you may not have such a hard time with it depending on how much you're getting. Another friend's on it and they only take 10mg a day. Partner has severe OCD so he needs a higher dose than someone with depression does.

**** Well it would be difficult especially because people would fall to the coordination problem of voting to a new party that doesn't seem like it's going to win so people see voting the third party as letting the opposing mainstream party win, and people seem to prefer to be divided in two opposing big tribes rather than more. But it is possible, for example here in Spain it happened ,two new parties where created , in the end they took some bad decisions and they weren't able to pact which each other and we ended up whith the same government as before but they actually won in some regions and in the capital. Maybe the situation in EEUU is different, maybe not but unless people try nothing is going to change , half the country already decided they wanted to change things and voted to trump that will change things to worsen them( and the intention is not what counts in this case) , for example climate change , now the other half of the country has to stop complaining and find ways to actually change things for better and convincing the other half to also do so ,and maybe a lot of them would keep voting trump but at least some of them only voted trump as a way to vote notHilary so they can be convinced for the next elections to vote a new candidate try to repair all the damage that trump will cause .Also before new elections come there are things that can be done , Elon Musk keeps trying to convince trump to do something for the environment , and maybe he won't change anything but he has more possibilities of doing so than any of the people that decided that they didnt want to have anything to do whith trump.

***** From my (external) point of view, it looks like a lot of the people who vote for one or the other party in America do so purely in order to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mg/the_twoparty_swindle/][keep the other guy out]]. I don't say it will be easy... but this does suggest that it might be possible for an alternative party, with the right advertising and PR strategy, to put forth a reasonable challenge to the big two - by trying to woo all the voters who are sick of /both/ major parties.
