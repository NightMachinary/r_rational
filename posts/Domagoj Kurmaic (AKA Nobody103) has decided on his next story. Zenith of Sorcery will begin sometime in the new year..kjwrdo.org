** The story premise for Zenith of Sorcery sounds like it could easily also be the premise for The Continuing Adventures of Zorian and Friends, which is kind of funny to me for some reason.

*** Honestly if he's gonna do Zenith he would've just done a story focused on Zac or Zorian like 10 years later. Or even Kirielle like 30 years later starting with Zorian getting assassinated. Already have hints of the interdimensional plot line, multiple fairly developed continents, and established Archmage characters. Only major setting difference seems to be that he wants the gods to be ascended mortals (and more importantly, for everyone to KNOW that the gods are ascended mortals). Including all the Tolkien races is a change too I guess, though MOL already had multiple sentient and humanoid races, plus multiple continents and difficult enough travel to allow newly discovered continents.

Stories that start with a super strong protagonist often run into issues pretty quickly.

** zenith has me slightly worried because it was the second half of mol where the quality dropped off imo due in large part to zorian becoming ultra powerful. hopefully this is good though.

I'm still nervous about how well he'll manage setting out the full array of the protagonist's powers without it force feeding us 30 chapters worth of infodump at the start, but with MoL he's definitely earned enough trust for me to watch him try.
