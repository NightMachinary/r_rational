** You're producing these at quite a pace! Continuing to enjoy them, and as a bit of extra positive reinforcement, really enjoyed the Pallet Town music that kicked in during the first episode. If you could add Route or Battle music into the start of scenes that would be pretty awesome, though maybe it would get too repetitive if a scene goes on too long in the future? Just thought I'd mention it :) Looking forward to the next one!

*** I agree! I'll look into music and sound options to see if any artist is willing to allow use. Good to hear you're enjoying them thus far-

** [[/u/marsfilms]]. You have these hosted somewhere besides sound cloud, right? It is shutting down and I don't want to see these vanish.

*** I've heard mixed things about this, but was under the impression that it's okay for the near future. Did something change?

**** Two of their main offices closed about a week ago, so it's up in the air at this point. SoundCloud closing would certainly be troublesome, i hope it works out! I have a backup company in mind should that fall through.

****** I took a look at either Spreaker or Buzzsprout, depending on how regularly I post, how long they get, and how much total content there is.
