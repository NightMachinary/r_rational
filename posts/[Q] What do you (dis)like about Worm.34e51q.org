Something I've noticed recently: I don't remember ever seeing a criticism of Worm. They are probably out there, but every time I see it mentioned it is solely in positive terms.

What do you think the good and bad parts are of Worm? What was it that made it stick so hard in the memesphere of our community and adjoining communities?


** The good:

- The setting is interesting and reinvigorates the idea of a world populated by super-powered costumed hereoes and villains. The idea is a bit inherently silly but suspension of disbelief holds up.

- The characters are varied and well-realised and their powers are diverse to the point of there being no exact duplication - not an endless parade of "Dudes who can shoot energy beams and punch stuff".

- Also on powers, a lot of them require some genuine creativity in their application, and not everyone is a tank capable of trading heavy hits, so there's some subtlety to the fighting rather than levelling a city block in every encounter because the only way to make a point of hitting someone /hard/ is to throw them though a building.

- The plot is moved along mostly by people doing stuff for their own reasons rather than people doing stuff because the plot needs to move along.

- The action moments in the big fights are suitably intense, but there's also some good down-time and character fluff and humour in between them.

- Our protagonists seem intelligent and relatable but not overly perfect, and the antagonists aren't just evil for the sake of evil - they have their own stuff going on which we occasionally get to see through interludes. Mostly. Not always. Some of them are just psychopathic assholes.

- Speaking of interludes, interludes are pretty awesome as a change of perspective - either to see the villain's side of things or explore some backstory, or occasionally to be shown a decidedly /different/ kind of mind.

- Similarly, there are some chapters that feel like Wildbow was daring himself just to see if he could take something that's difficult to render into prose and make it /work/, and it generally /does/ and that's pretty cool.

The bad:

- At times the 'intensity' of all the fights hits the point of oversaturation, and can become hard to follow when you're reading at the pace the text feels like it demands... this is somewhat a criticism wrapped in praise, since it's generally a sign of something good when the inherent pace of the text is able to make me read faster.

- Examples of the above would include the first 8 arcs where it seems like they're fighting every other group in the city one after the other without much pause, and also some of the arcs leading up to the end... I need to re-read those some day because I really didn't manage to follow the details of where they actually /were/, to be able to picture the setting beyond "underground tunnel" or "generic research facility".

- The time-skip is abrupt and jarring and weird and leaves us in an odd place where we're /told/ that Taylor has been with her new team for longer than the entire rest of the story before that point, so now she's theoretically closer to them than the Undersiders, but we never got the opportunity to make that journey with her and really feel as close to them as we do to the "good ol' days", or to develop the same understanding of who they are as characters. I mostly just kept wanting her to go back to the old team ASAP.

- I have real trouble keeping the giant character-roster and their respective stories/powers straight in my head. Although that doesn't actually impact too badly on reading the story - if it's plot-relevant then there's generally an easy reminder and then I go "Oh, it's /that/ guy".

- Power/scope creep is real. I found it /fun/ (if I'm honest I'm torn as to whether this is a bug or a selling point), but looking back on it, it's kinda ridiculous just how far things escalated, from running into some genuine difficulty with taking on a handful of young capes in the process of robbing a bank, to defeating a whole /swarm/ of cloned S9 members without really seeming to break a sweat, and then having to basically fight God.

I'm sure there's more to say on both sides (I'll probably think of more and edit it in) but this is what came to mind first.

*** As a devout Worm-lover, two criticisms of the "bad". It's pretty explicitly said that Taylor /isn't/ close to the Chicago Wards. Except for Golem, it was all a working professional relationship, and even with him they weren't so much "close" as "on the same page".

And as regards the S9000, the 9 of them were battle-hardened, veteran cape psychopaths, with years to decades of experience. The 9000 were phlogiston and b-roll memories cobbled together with secondhand tinkertech. Considering the forces of "basically everyone" arrayed against them, it didn't really break my suspension of disbelief at all - on the contrary, I found those segments as suspenseful as anything else. At least the parts actually shown, I think most of the slaughtering happened off-screen.

But I do have to second the time skip criticism. I think the story really needed another 1-3 arcs fleshing out that transition, expecially with some more breathing room.

It's like reading early Doc Smith (except without the racism). If you've never read the Skylark series, every couple of chapters there's a new super-science power-up.

****** It's good, but it's very.... dated.

This is where HJPEV gets "Kimball Kinnison" from, he's the main character of the first few novels.

Reading through it, you can tell it was made in the 30s. Sexism is pretty rampant. They have spaceships /with no electronic computers/. Everything is done manually. They have adding machines, but no automatic systems.

At one point, Kinnison has to set up a widget with some string and levers to /randomly pull direction levers/ because their interstellar starship doesn't have an autopilot.

It's flat Good vs Evil. No grey areas at all, and no problem wiping out entire enemy planets because obviously anyone on their side is irredeemably evil.

It's very much a heroic story, Kinnison is the focus, he's a larger than life self-effacing hero, who is good at literally everything he ever does (excepting perhaps, talking to women, which is again very traditional). He's basically a Solar Exalted.

The technical details tend to be written as "they took a wrench to it and fixed it in 20 minutes" or "the boys back at the lab licked the Death Star Laser problem". Though there is a scientist who tags along on one mission who seems to be an alright sort.

** A criticism of Worm that I've heard before, and can somewhat agree with, is that it constantly escalates with little to no breaks in the tension. Aside from a few (and I mean very few) miniscule happy moments in the earlier sections, it all just kind of goes to hell. And keeps descending. After the Leviathan attack (not that things were that happy before) things just keep getting progressively worse and there's little to no relief, barring the end. And even THAT comes with its own baggage and hangups. It's less of a “Happily Ever After” and more of a “Well...at least we're not all dead?” sort of vibe. So yea. Worm isn't a happy story. And unlike other stories that aren't happy ones (mysteries, horrors, etc.), Worm is especially massive in length. It's a long time for things to just be depressing all the time. I believe that's the main criticism people have for Worm.

Overall, Worm is wonderfully gripping. It's deep, thought out, was updated at a RIDICULOUS pace (Seriously, I wonder if Wildbow wasn't some sort of AI, he'd write 30k words in like 2 days!) packed with action and superpowers, in a unique way. It's just...you never feel like the main characters are winning. At least for more than a chapter or two, because an even bigger threat rears its head almost immediately.

** I am going to assume that this thread is spoiler scoped for Worm.

One of the big things that made it stick was length. Worm is 1.68 million words, which means that to get to the end requires a very, very large time investment. People are a lot more apt to talk about things that they've spent a month reading than they are to talk about something they read over the course of five minutes. Worm wouldn't be nearly so popular if it could be read over the course of an afternoon.

Worm also does characterization well. The interludes are all fantastic, and for every character you get the sense that they were fully fleshed out and thought about - from the skinheads to the PRT.

The powersets of the characters are also really well done. They have enough flaws to be interesting, and enough variety that each one that gets introduced is their own little treat.

Things that I /personally/ didn't like:

- Every character is holding the Conflict Ball. This is explicit to the setting.
- The time skip isn't any good. It bypasses too many important things while at the same time not changing the status quo /enough/.
- The setting limits itself in certain ways that I find displeasing - the Manton effect and the nearly complete lack of mundane utility, and the fact that the world has been designed to resembled comicbook worlds instead of growing into that organically. It's a lot of clever ways of getting to a Superhero Kitchen Sink world, but taken all together it feels false to me. Tinkers are one of the biggest offenders here.
- It's too dark and grim, without enough spots of light or breaks in the action. The edit will probably fix that.

Them and Endbringers. Remove endbringers and suddenly heroes are allowed to be a lot more ruthless with villains, worldwide productivity gains are not overshadowed by wiped-out cities, and tinkers with idealistic goals are allowed to make a lot more progress towards utopia without being murdered. And when you learn the Endbringers' rather unsatisfying origin story, you can't help but see them as a contrived plot device to keep the setting from straying.

Short version:

It's not in his best interest. This is going to be a giant wall o'text, but the tl;dr is: given how Amazon has structured their payments, he will make way more money if he sells it as novellas where each novella ends on a cliffhanger and has a line at the bottom saying "Story continues in the next book, 'Worm part 4007a'!"

Long version:

Here's what I've learned about publishing ebooks on Amazon from having done it:

Standard price on Amazon for a novella (~15k normally) is $3 USD (well, $2.99). Standard price for a novel (~80k words) is about $7 ($6.99), plus or minus $1.

There's something called "Kindle Select"; it's an opt-in thing that puts your book into the Kindle Unlimited / Kindle Online Lending Library program. If an author has opted-in to have his book in KS, then a reader with a KU subscription can either buy the book for the indicated price or borrow it for free. (There are some restrictions on KU, but they don't matter for our purposes.) For simplicity I'm just going to call this "opting in to KU", since the distinction between KS and KU is moot.

The amount of money you make for a borrow is a little complicated. Every month Amazon sets aside a pot of money; this month it's currently $3mm, and last month I believe it was the same but they added $6mm at the last minute to make $9mm. At the end of the month they take the total amount of money (M) in the pot and divide it by the total number of borrows (B) to find a number P that is how much you'll get paid for a borrow. (M / B = P) Last month P was $1.34. So, if you got 100 borrows total over the course of the month, you'll get paid $134. Notice that P is completely unpredictable for the author and is also completely under Amazon's control.

The last trick here is that *you only get paid for a borrow if the user reads the first 10%*. That's extremely important.

The amount of money you make from a sale also isn't simple. There are two royalty levels you can sign up for: 35% and 70%. 35% is the default; you can only get 70% if you opt-in to KU and therefore allow your books to be borrowed for a price P which, again, is completely unpredictable and completely in Amazon's control. (There's also some restrictions on the 70% but they aren't relevant here.)

If you are in the 70% club you don't pay the delivery charge. If you are in the 35% club, you pay a delivery charge of $0.15/M when someone buys your book. A normal cover image would be 2-3M unless you take some effort to shrink it down, in which case you can get text+image down to about 0.5 - 1M.

[EDIT: I don't know what I was thinking, but I wrote the above backwards. Th 70% club pays the delivery costs, the 35% club does not. I've corrected everything from here on.]

Here are the scenarios:

Not in KU, therefore you get no borrows and you only get 35% royalties:

- 80k novel, $7, 35% royalties, no delivery charge. On a sale you make: 7 * 0.35 = $2.45
- 15k novella, $3, 35% royalties, no delivery charge. On a sale you make: 3 * 0.35 = $1.05

In KU, so you get 70% royalties, you get borrows, and you pay the delivery charge:

- 80k novel, $7, 70% royalties, 1M file means $0.15 delivery charge. On a sale you make: 7 * 0.70 - 0.15 = $4.75
- 15k novella, $3, 70% royalties, 1M file means $0.15 delivery charge. On a sale you make: 3 * 0.70 - $0.15 = $1.95
- Borrow: ??, but let's say it remains at $1.34 (that's been relatively consistent for a few months)

Not everyone has a KU account, so obviously you make the same number of sales from non-KU people regardless of whether you're in it or not. People who are in KU are probably there because they read a lot and don't want to spend a ton of money, so they are more likely to borrow than to buy. Clearly, you lose sales on this group but you get borrows from them instead. This is important: you are much less likely to sell to a KU user. They are much more likely to borrow if they can or pass if they can't. (They are also voracious readers, so they are more likely to borrow you for that reason than a non-KU person is to buy you.)

Okay, having a NOVEL in KU means:

- Sales to people who are not KU get you $2.30 more than you would have gotten if you weren't in KU.
- For people who /are/ in KU, you make money that you wouldn't have made otherwise off the borrows.

Having a NOVELLA in KU means

- Sales to people who are not KU get you $0.90 more than you would have gotten if you weren't in KU.
- For people who /are/ in KU, you make money that you wouldn't have made otherwise off the borrows.

It is strictly better for an average author to be in KU. The only people for whom it maybe doesn't make sense are the very top-ranked authors with so much star appeal that even KU users will buy their stuff.

Finally, if you put up a novel (again, 80k words), then you *only get paid for borrows* if the user reads 8,000 words -- about 24 pages by Amazon's estimation. If you put up a novella (15k words) up, then you get paid if they read 1,500 words (about 4 pages). If the user gets tired of the book or distracted from it and doesn't hit the 10% part, you don't get paid, so you want that 10% to be as small as possible.

With all that setup taken care of:

If you have a novel (80k words) you can sell it for $7 or you can break it into 5 installments of ~15k each and sell each installment for $3. Either way you want to be in KU. Worm is /already/ written in installments and (I think) has a cliffhanger at the end of each installment, so doing the novella route is easy.

Most people that I've seen around who have started Worm have either finished it or at least read to the ~30-50% mark. Let's be conservative and say that someone who gets tired of it will stop after 10%, meaning 167,000 words. That's 2 novels or 11 novellas. Two novels nets you $9.50 in sales, 11 novellas nets you $21.45. You will also make more money on the borrows if your format is novellas, because the users are much more likely to hit the 10% mark in their reading.

So, yes, if you break a novel into novellas, you make a ton more money given how Amazon has structured their payments.

Its length, and a dedication to a specific brand of gritty "realism"--in answer to all three questions, Good, Bad, and Stickiness.

*Good*: it's long and well exceeds certain minimum levels of plot-driven storytelling and world building.

*Bad*: it's too long and wallows around torturing characters and the world itself with +almost+ fetishistic fervor and detail.

*Stickiness*: people at a time HPMOR was sleeping really wanted large servings of speculative fiction that wasn't YA, Hunger-Games-esque /meh/ or modern comics and their endless plotting failures. There was better stuff out there I'm sure, but Worm was in the right place at the right time, for the right price (free), and in huge heaping servings regularly updated. It continues to stand out because it was many people's first original, uncompromising rational fiction, among other obvious reasons.

***** Yep. I've said it before, I'll say it again: I didn't even realize how "grimdark" Worm was while reading it until afterward when someone mentioned it and I thought back on the story. Taylor is such a strong, active, and oddly /optimistic/ character, even when she doesn't seem to be, that I never have time to wallow in the darkness of it all. No matter how bad things get, she just powers through in a heartening and sometimes heartbreaking way, such that the few times she has moments of self doubt, I'm just like "Don't sweat it girl, you got this."

No matter how bad things got, I knew Taylor would never, ever give up. That was the light at the end of the tunnel that kept things from seeming as bad as they were, for me.

****** Yeah, Twig is doing better for me, because Sy always seems to have a plan, or is at least able to tweak his enemy's nose. We get the feeling that even if the odds are against him, he knows more than he lets on.

Blake, on the other hand, almost never had any idea what was going on. This is a plot gripe, not a character one; it was entirely reasonable to be in the dark when he was thrown into a new world without any guidance. I /liked/ Blake, maybe even more than Taylor and Sy -- Taylor seemed too inconsistently ambitious and passive for me, and Sy is a little too nonchalant about everything except Mary, which hurts my idea of what's at stake. It's just that even Blake's temporary victories are usually framed as defeats. I think that the only time in the entire story that Blake had an unambiguous win of his own that didn't foreshadow doom and didn't involve an extreme sacrifice of his future happiness was the fairy with Sephiroth's sword at the beginning, and even then, the lawyer's presence was kind of tainting that.

The universe and world building is amazing. Creative and rational in the sense that Wildbow tries very hard to keep things consistent. The characters seem realistic, although I cannot empathize with Taylor's constant guilt-depression. Probably subjective.

I would prefer more celebration and moments of awesome without a depressing overtone. E.g. there should be a heartwarming party after Leviathan is gone. Humans need such consolation even after depressing catastrophes. The Undersiders should celebrate after successfully robbing the bank.

Too long, but that might just be due to the "web serial" format. It should be split into 10-20 books with clear endings and only minor cliffhangers. Compare Harry Potter.

** I've heard a lot of people say that Worm is too dark to really enjoy. I might have felt that way at first, but after some time I became fairly secure that Taylor and her allies could take whatever came at them. This was obviously shaken a few times, but a story should do that.

In terms of what I don't like:

To me, Wildbow's writing style seems too suited for the serial format. Some stuff feels very rushed, he sometimes slogs on in a scene for too long, and his descriptions of locations, complex concepts, or action can be a little too limited for me to get a clear picture. Taylor's goals seem a little all over the place, and it really seems like the Undersiders are destined to fight literally every group they hear about.

On the other hand:

What I like about Worm is what makes it different from other stories. Worm kills off major characters at a rate that keeps things interesting without becoming predictable (I'm looking at you, George R. R. Martin, and your once-a-book slaughter). It keeps the stakes high and holds a reader's attention. Obviously, the worldbuilding is top-notch, and the power use on the street level is amazing. Those are its real selling points, and it does them just about the best I've ever seen. On top of that, Wildbow made me care about his characters, and his picture of a frightened young girl trying to cope with a shitty life and a conscience at the same time was really captivating.

In Pact, Wildbow improved on his descriptions, though the esoteric nature of what he was describing was so out there that it sometimes made it just as hard as Worm. On the other hand, it was like watching your college roommate get into an MMA fight with a 250-pound 'roided-up Krav Maga enthusiast, then get wheeled out, broken and bleeding, only to have his girlfriend spit on him and break up.

It was just the tiniest bit difficult to read, is what I'm saying.

But probably my least favorite of all was taking such a long break from Taylor's POV to get the entire backstory of the Travelers. I did not care that much about them and certainly not so much to be happy reading about them while Taylor's stuff was unresolved.

There needed to be a bit more downtime than have every chapter be a cliffhanger, I know it was serial fiction but if it ever gets edited I'd want some more downtime to process events. If Taylor actually got to a plateau or mini-resolution, and was stable and happy, maybe THEN take a walk down memory lane and spend so much time on the Travelers.

** Worm has an eventually compelling main character, some good arcs (16-23), a lot of cool, neat powers, a ridiculous update schedule, frikkin endbringers, and, like, lots of bugs. It's smart and tense and you always want to know what the next guy's power is and how they're gonna get out of this one. As far as serial fiction goes, it basically does everything it should, constantly ramping things up, introducing new characters and plot elements and powers, always ending on a hook, never giving the characters any time to rest. It's probably better read as serial fiction chapter-by-chapter than in big chunks.

I think it suffers from a lack of clear motivation in its main characters. Before we find out about the shards, it's unclear why the Undersiders are motivated to fight other parahumans rather than use their powers to make money or just live a normal life. That seems like something an edit would have a hard time addressing unless it wants to reveal more about shards early on. Also: character voices and personality types are too similar and limited, probably something the edit will struggle with as well if that's just how Wildbow writes his characters.

***** I think Wildbow intended for her to be deeply flawed. The superheros in this world are "birthed" through trauma, invariably. Outside of the Cauldron capes (which make up a small percentage of the parahumans of the world) every single hero has to have a deeply traumatic experience to "trigger". In essence, powers in Worm are a *really* kickass form of PTSD. With the added bonus of alien mojo pushing you to seek conflict. That's a lot of power and crazy put together. And Taylor is heavily damaged, that's part of what makes her interesting. We get to watch her heal and grow. Now, whether who she heals /into/ is healthier is a debate for another day.

And to address your comment about how she seems at the beginning of the story, and her "magic powers that could easily solver her problems", can I ask you to propose some ideas as to how she'd do that? While we've grown with her and seen how she grows to munchkin her bug control, it's not THAT strong of a power without the experience of it. What could she do to fix any of her problems? Do you suggest she attack her attackers? That would lead to her being discovered. And if she attacks them in a way that can't be linked to her, then what's the trio's incentive to stop the bullying? Ok, let's say she decides to incapacitate them. What's the incentive? While their effects on her psychology are titanic, they haven't done anything worth being injured to that degree, especially to someone like Taylor who just isn't that mean. And do you not consider her resourcefulness a positive quality? She's not a happy person. So she's not going to have happy thoughts, at least not a lot of them. But she's resourceful, intelligent, strong. Those are fairly good qualities, wouldn't you say?

** What do I dislike about Worm. From a entertainment point of view, very little.

From a rational point of view? Probably the origin of the entities themselves. The entire idea of a planet of trillions of independent beings existing for millions of years in fierce competition, and none of them coming up with the idea of cooperation until one brilliant individual happens to consider it is... difficult to swallow. The fact that they all immediately agreed that it was a good idea, and then ate the innovator just makes me throw up my hands in the air with a giant WTF.

But that was backstory :)

There's plenty of other things that don't make sense. Wildbow doesn't write rational fiction. Worm is more rational-feeling than most super-power fiction (IMHO) because it's a grey-morality world instead of the typical black-and-white super-powered world, and the backstory gives a clear reason for the irrationality of capes.

** I, um, didn't finish it. So some of this might resolve later in the story.

If I had to put a finger on /why/ I didn't finish it, I think it's because there's just too many powers for me. Too many superpowers, too many variables, the entire game can change with new Super at any time. There's no way for me to predict things, solve puzzles, or really explore the implications of a single power.

Also, it's too action-oriented for me. If I had some of those powers you can bet I'd be involved in stuff unrelated to plotting and combat. And the characters mostly interact as allies and enemies, rarely on any other plane. And while I enjoy a good machiavellian plot as much as anyone, my suspension of disbelief breaks whenever there are several extremely convoluted ones interacting.

For the above reasons, I'm not really sure why worm is "rational". But, I think these criticisms say more about the genres I enjoy than they do about Worm, though.

** Mostly criticism, since you said that's mostly what's harder to find:

- Action scenes go on too long. Wildbow does a great job of describing action, but he often continues with a blow-by-blow with uniform detail throughout the scene. Tons of these scenes would do better with "and then we did that some more" or just deciding that the first hit wins more often.
- Many arcs build up to a climactic point, then nothing happens, then we build to something with less weight behind it, then that works. I remember feeling this way about the S9 and Noelle arcs, but can't remember exactly where the faulty climaxes were anymore.
- Early in the story, we have massive changes on a regular basis - Taylor joins the undersiders, Leviathan wrecks the city, Taylor starts trying to be a proper supervillain with turf - and I was very impressed that the status quo never was restored (especially after Leviathan). Later on Taylor settles in to a routine of mostly fighting, and the city gets re-trashed repeatedly, and very little has deeper consequences until we hit the timeskip.
- The timeskip is badly executed.
- Occasionally we get character development moments where Taylor talks about something we haven't seen her think about much for a long time, and how that influences her decision to do something that seemed unlikely before.
- The order that the arcs are in is hard to remember, because many of them are just a series of threats.

** OK, so with spoiler warnings full in place:

First of all, I read the whole damn thing because for the most part it was compulsive, well written and exciting. There are some interesting themes to grapple with and mostly I enjoyed the ride.

With that over:

-The underlying idea is super nihilistic. Everyone conflicts with everyone, and this really isn't limited to people with shards. Many adult characters are incredibly unsympathetic and horrid (directors, school teachers, excetera), to the point where we somehow find ourselves liking the Indian supervillain in the Behemoth arc over the various directors who then tell Taylor off for helping him!

-It is too episodic for such a long story, to the point of hurting pacing. There are some later fights which feel utterly inconsequential when you know the world is going to end.

-As other have noted, it's too long, and some characters are introduced far too late for us to care about them, or really understand what their point is in the story.

-The escalation is sometimes a bit frustrating. The Slaughter house 9000 arc was just a bit trying for me

-The Slaughterhouse 9 somewhat stretch my suspension of disbelief too much anyway. The idea of a group of working together sociopaths who follow a set of rules except when they don't. There's only so much you can excuse with shards, you know?

-And of course, there's the extreme body horror and explicit violence. It get's really unpleasant in the first slaughterhouse 9 arc.

Here let me just:

This has further links to even more plot hole pointery as well as a pastebin with some snide and condescending remarks by me.

Just remembered another thing. You know how at the end Taylor gets all superpower and shit. Well Wildbow could have avoided all that unnecessary, plot induced, "It all returns to nothing EVA cry tear saga", oh noes she is losing her mind story, IF HE SIMPLY LET TAYLOR PUT BUGS IN EVERY LIVING PERSON TO CHEW ON NERVES AND BRAIN IN CASE SHE DIES OR AS PAIN INTIMIDATION.

Same effect and fear inducing control, without having to play a telenovela drama crossbreed with snuff porn.

We already know she can sense parasites into dogs and this would have been a great foreshadowing.

People need to stop calling Worm rational. It is not a rational story.

Now for the good things:

Long.

In comparison to other stories, the world and effects of superpowers are more detailed and reasonable.

Updated regulary.

Long. Like so long, goodbye, I'm off on a trip to the moon, will return in a year.

Can you please not do this?

Your plan remains incoherent. Taylor would never have done something as drastic as that without the destruction of the earth already underway to motivate her and by that time it would have been too late to set it up. Even if she had somehow been motivated to set it up in advance, how would she get the bugs into the people, set up the hostages without herself becoming a threat to be fought against by all?

And if you find solutions to those things as well, then we're obviously not talking about the "SIMPLY" you shouted at us about, we're talking about an entire and complete rewrite of the entire second half of Worm.

And what exactly is it that you're /objecting to/ that this is supposed to be the solution? You've just strung words along like "A cry tear saga, oh noes she is losing her mind story", as if we're supposed to know what it is you're objecting to already. You've not offered a coherent description of anything we're supposed to dislike, and yet you're offering an unfeasible 'solution' and bashing Wildbow for not writing the story as you would have written it.

And it is simple for a girl like Taylor.

As for the EVA cry tear saga, I am referring to her losing her mind, then people being turned against her because of her power, then finally dying by bullet to the head. The whole part is supposed to make us feel sorry for her and how she lost everything and how its all returning to nothing.

Even assuming that was an accurate summary, which it isn't, what exactly is the problem with that story that your story supposedly overcomes?

Your basic idea, which is that Taylor could try to pull a Bakuda, isn't inherently objectionable, even if I don't think it would be a great plot device. The way Taylor's personality and powers change near the end certainly feel like an asspull and I think that there is a good point you could have made here.

I think the way you presented your case though was pretty bad, and bad enough it made discourse worse. I downvoted you to reduce visibility and because I have precommitted to downvoting certain kinds of behavior, and explaining why I do so. I think in general you have been caustic and not explained yourself well, and then acted more caustic when people didn't immediately buy into your explanation or agree with you.

Things like "wildbow get it together", "suck on these facts", accusing people of being irrational, and calling people liars just because they disagree with your alternative idea for a worm plot arc are unacceptable. I have therefore downvoted those comments, and this message is here so that you can adjust your behavior in future discussions and avoid future downvotes.

  Eaglejarl you bupkiss. Go check the archives.
#+end_quote

Hah. That's the first time I've ever been called 'nothing.' And you're right, I didn't do the archive dive; mea culpa.

Before I read the comments on that thread (so as not to be influenced by others' opinions), I'm going to lay out my own thoughts about Worm.

The good:

1. Inventive setting.
2. Many intriguing characters with complex motivations.\\
3. Really interesting and unique powers.

The bad:

1. Only Taylor is allowed to munchkin her powers.
2. Superhero villains make no damn sense. Just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CutLexLuthorACheck]]. Sure, maybe there would be one or two crazies who want to put on tights and rob banks, but society would rapidly say hello to them with a sniper rifle (or etc) and then get on with their day.
3. Many of the major villains (e.g. Slaughterhouse 9) are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][EvilForTheLulz]]
4. Power creep was ridiculous and fighting gods is boring.
5. As several people remarked, it's got a bad case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]]
6. Wildbow set up this cool thing in the beginning: there are parallel dimensions with parallel people, and there is trade between them. After that brief mention he never did a damn thing with it until the last few pages. The only other dimensions that we actually spent time in were unpopulated, making them no different than a random location in the middle of nowhere on Earth.
7. The early part of the story amounts to "Taylor wants to be a hero, Armsmaster is mean to her, so she becomes a villain."\\
8. Wildbow set up an interesting, clever, reasonably articulate protagonist with relatively weak powers that she munchkined into really powerful powers. He then turned her into a mute, somewhat crazy(ier) character with overwhelming powers who was [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne][the only one]] that could save the day.
9. The biggest issue: the only way that Wildbow could find to make sense of all this was "alien worms are mind-controlling them to make them fight." This is a narrative cheat of the highest order.

Now that I see the responses in this thread I realize that yes, I have seen one criticism: the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]] seems to be a common objection.

As a question:

The Endbringers exist because...um...Eidolon needed an opponent? Or, as an incentive for capes to fight? I think? They were spawned by the worms, I think? I remember most of the stuff about the worms--aliens, absorb bits of other races to increase their own powers, came here to spawn, dropped shards to get us fighting, etc. I don't remember anything about the point of the Endbringers. Can someone clue me in?

I seem to remember mention of there being significantly more of them held in reserve that, had they been used to full effect, would have allowed them to be a constant presence but simultaneously less continent-wrecking and more an environmental hazard for area denial.

/But/ Eden went and crashed and died, so the normal plan mostly went to hell. Then Eidolon had his critical moment and the "worthy opponents" comment was perfectly calculated to utterly wreck him psychologically, by implying that they were only active because his power manifested something for him to fight, regardless of whether it was true or not (which I'm still not sure of).

I agree with you points, except 7. It had to do with Taylor wanting to gather info on Undersiders, so she stayed a villain for too long. Problem is the info gathering is too weak in comparison to other Taylor's INT applications, so it does feel forced. The transition itself is good, it's the delivery that's the problem. This could be fixed by actual data gathering and possibly spying on teammates via bug tracking or something like that.
