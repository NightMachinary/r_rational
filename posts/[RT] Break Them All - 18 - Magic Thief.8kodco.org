**** I think the author decided to post the rest, now that he's far enough in Heromaker's Legacy that new chapters aren't spoilers. Don't quote me on that, though.

*** #+begin_quote
  it's just a story about a guy learning about and playing around with a computer program-like magic system without much of a plot. Still surprisingly good with a very slow updating rate. About one chapter every 4 to 6 months, but it just updated last week which is why I'm posting about it here.

In that thread someone requested that new chapters be posted on the subreddit, so here it is.
