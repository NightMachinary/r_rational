** This is an interesting series, but I have to wonder... is one of the goal to give *every* named character--or at least one of each species--their version of the Roar?

The story is creative, and worth reading, but it's rapidly beginning to reach the Syndrome Threshold.

*** Eh, I get what you're saying, but Scar's goal really was literally exactly that. So it's not like there isn't an explanation for it. On reflection, maybe I should have cut out Bunga having the roar, as that was mostly meant as a joke and doesn't really add much to the story. I could probably could have kept Jasiri normal as well. But the main heroes and villains do need to have some kind of way of standing toe-to-toe with each other. If your opponent has magical superpowers and you don't, then 9 times out of ten (assuming no guns) you're just going to be cannon fodder.

The other reason is that fights which just involve characters biting and clawing at each other are really boring to write. I like my superpowered fight scenes :(
