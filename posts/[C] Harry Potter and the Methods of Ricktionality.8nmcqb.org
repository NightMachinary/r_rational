** This was nowhere near as terrible as I expected it to be. In fact, it was thoroughly entertaining. As much as I love both R&M and HPMOR, many fans of both are quite cringeworthy, and many people hate both, so I expected this to either be uber-cringeworthy or some sort of mudslinging denigration calling itself "satire."

This tickled my fancy a great deal. Pure, undiluted crack. Bravo.

** This... I can imagine it being a real Rick and Morty episode.

  *Rick:* HAHAHAHAHA, oh man, Morty, when that wears off everyone's gonna go full Cronenberg. Damn, son, you Cronenberged HPMOR! Hahaha, I didn't Cronenberg up /my/ first universe until, uhhh, forget I said that, but /man/ you really fucked this one up, haha!
#+end_quote

Yup. I can picture that very scene. Can't say it was 100% Rick and Morty style, but it kept the important bits, at least.

This was a journey. A bit of an unfocused journey, frankly- in the beginning I kept wondering when we'll get to Harry's adventure. There was a good payoff to those moments, at least.

The techno babble was on point, and the conflicts of out-sciencing one another were appropriately ridiculous and over-complicated. In fact, there was /a lot/ of this bizarre world-building that wouldn't look out of place in the show. Plenty of competently handled topics.

Rabbit were the funniest, got to say. Especially the song.

So... crack. High quality crack. Sold on the corner of your local university, right next to the philosophy department.

** Not gonna lie, I skimmed most of the beginning as it felt like it was taking too long to get interesting, but after I got to the good part went back and reread it all. Suprisingly well done, and honestly with the added bonus of the improvised song (that I heard in the appropriate voice in my head) and end-credit scene, this deserves to be called a legit fan-episode, imo.

Well done! One minor nitpick: the burping mid-sentence has gone way down in recent seasons, which I think is to its benefit, as it ups the weight of each when they happens. Might be worth removing a few here and there so it interrupts the flow less :)

*** Thanks for the critiques! I felt that the exposition at the beginning was necessary because the information all comes back later, one way or another... and also so I don't have to do it in a sequel if I decide to write one. I agree that the exposition is a bit too long, but I'm not sure how to shorten it. As for the burping, I don't know if you noticed, but after the beginning, it happens a lot less or not at all. I used it to set the tone, and then dropped it because it's unsustainable.

Don't know if I'll spend too much time editing this, though... it's not the sort of writing that demands perfection...

By the way, knowing that you read r!Animorphs, how would you feel about a sequel, "Animorphs: The Rickoning"?

**** To cut down exposition weariness, might help if all the trips to random dimensions have purpose, maybe they're important to building their superwands, while to Morty it just looks like they're grabbing random stuff as usual. What beats hair of unicorn tail for a core? Dried piece of squid intestine. Maybe the wand itself is made of sapient rabbit bone. It's a bit of a big edit, but at least things would be happening meanwhile.

***** That's a good tip. Don't think I'll bother editing, at least right now, because I need to stop procrastinating on my real-world stuff.

I think I'll write an Animorphs sequel eventually. (Let's be honest, I was going to write it anyway). I've already begun plotting it in my head. The problem is that I'm such a fan that all my plots are turning serious. I don't necessarily want Rick and Morty to be in "God mode" again, but when they have vulnerabilities, Visser 3 becomes too serious of a threat the minute Rick makes a mistake. Fun problems to have.

****** Yeah, and having that problem kind of elevates it from "crackfic," imo. Like it's kind of hard for R&M anything not to be automatic crackfic, but taking it that seriously shows that it's not the default, for r!writers at least :)
