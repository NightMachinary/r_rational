So my gut instinct about Prime Directive-like laws is that they're terrible, but I wondered why. Lots of universes have justifications for them.

First two I thought of, off the top of my head:

*Marvel*

The Watchers are reluctant to give any advanced tech to less advanced species, but given how many fuckups Marvel universe people tend to have with their advanced tech/ powers, it seems somewhat justified.

*Star Trek*

The thing is, the Prime Directive's imperative for the Federation. Normally, there isn't just one justification for such important rules.

So... the most common justification is that aliens might adopt explorers' cultures. Does that seem likely? Given how many alien planets seem to have been influenced by human cultures in the Trekverse (the Nazi planet, for instance), this seems like a reasonable explanation, although doesn't explain why the assumption of Federation values is considered bad.

One other reason that seems less likely to be spoken about in-universe, though, is that the Federation is basically a democratic alliance. If, say, Klingon-like aliens in the Federation sets itself up as an uplifting group, it can influence the aliens it introduces to more Klingonesque values, and Klingonesque values now have more vote weight in the Federation (and we know that there are Federation aliens with different values, like the carnivores that consider all their prey sapient). So why would, say, humans have the right to uplift others?

And if you just contact an alien species to help them out and then leave, they are going to try to follow you to the stars, with all the cultural influence that implies.

Your thoughts? Any other universes with reasonable/unreasonable prime directives?


** This doesn't apply to Star Trek, but it's an idea I've been playing with...

There's no such thing as an unarmed space ship. In fact, there's no such thing as a space ship that is not a weapon of mass destruction. And when it comes to interstellar flights, there's no such thing as a space ship that can't render an Earth-like planet uninhabitable. Furthermore, such threats are basically impossible to defend against. As a result, there's no such thing as a winnable war between spacefaring civilizations. The typical shape of a war is that one side wipes the other's homeworld, and then the other wipes the first from a hidden base, and the only survivors are those who were in space at the time. Generally not enough to repopulate either race.

If you can't win a war, you need to avoid one. There's diplomacy, cultural and economic ties, hostage exchanges, and threats of retribution. But most importantly there needs to be a culture on both sides that regards war as unthinkably evil.

If a civilization without such a culture developed interstellar travel, the devastation would be vast.

This doesn't happen all that often. It usually takes several centuries to go from fusion bombs to warp drives, and civilizations without peaceful cultures rarely last several centuries with fusion bombs.

/Unless/ someone gives them the technology.

That includes visiting them with no intent to reveal anything, but then getting caught, and one's ship stolen and taken apart.

So contact with pre-peaceful civilizations is extremely restricted.

I agree with everything you've got here, except to point out that you're assuming a one-world civilization on both sides. Given enough worlds in each culture, it would be likely that a few would survive. See the Bolo series for examples.

******* "No user serviceable parts" - Starships are ridiculously advanced tech. So is long-term off-home-world life support. And the various medical and cybernetic mods the crew, themselves are using. All of that is going to require a large and very complicated economy to maintain - Far more specialties involved than can fit on a starship. By necessity, it must have the capacity to run on it's own for a minimum of one return trip, but that is almost certainly going to involve consumable supplies that simply cannot be replenished without the aid of someplace with an actual industrial base.

Feedstock. Chips. Cutting heads, cloth, needles. (.. a stupid amount of needles, actually. When doing fine work / sewing silk, have to use very thin needles. And they bend. Fortunately, they also cost cents..)

Slow matters because if you don't produce life support hardware fast enough, you die. More importantly, this entire thing is a part of that entire industrial web. Not an alternative to it. Believing it to be so is an error. What it is for is art and customization - I can (and do!) pay in time instead of money to have silk lined suits in nice wool that fit, and make shelves that conform exactly to that odd corner. I can't hex silk, wool or teak into existence. Which a colonist on an asteroid cut of from the homeworld would need to do. It isn't just the formal industry that would need to be replaced, its the biological too.

However this is assuming you managed to find an exponential resource aquisition and utilization method involving automation.

Which leads to very different kinds of wars and empires.

  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_M._Banks][Iain M.

The rotation of the ring simulates both gravity and a day-night cycle comparable to a planetary body orbiting a star.

  Its inhabitants, often numbering many billions, live on the inside of the ring, where continent-sized "plates" have been shaped to provide all sorts of natural environments and climates, often with the aim of producing especially spectacular results.

** The prime directive is a fictional reaction to real world colonialism. When it was written, Roddenberry was probably thinking of how the major powers of Europe had royally fucked up Africa and the Americas. If you had posited a show then (or even now) where the technologically advanced society came in and enacted extensive change on a different, less technologically advanced society, it would probably be read in a historical (or even modern) context, where you were taking about British colonists coming to the New World.

It's very easy to say "Oh, well they weren't as smart as us" or some other such thing, but you can see where that sounds like the sort of thing you can't really trust yourself on.

*** A lot of the damage that the Europeans caused was intentional, as a result of mercantilist policies. Look at opium in China and the divide and conquer strategies and destruction of the textile industry in India. A lot of other damage done by the Europeans was just because of neglect. For the most part, they weren't even trying to improve the livelihood of other countries. Obviously you shouldn't let your civilization's corporations to get anywhere near a less-advanced species (how you would enforce that, even with a prime directive, is another issue). There'd still be a huge risk when getting involved with a less-advanced species but I think it'd be worth it if you could prevent many generations from dying, suffering from disease, etc.
