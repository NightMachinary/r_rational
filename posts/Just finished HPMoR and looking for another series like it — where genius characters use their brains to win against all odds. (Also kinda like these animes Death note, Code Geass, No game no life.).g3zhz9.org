** If you've just finished HPMOR, go give Significant Digits a try. Unofficial sequel which takes methods of rationality and runs with it. I'd say it's better writing and there are bits that are bloody amazing. Def worth a read.

Otherwise Mother of Learning is my favourite - long, the writing style takes a while to get going, but is a very well thought out and iterated upon universe

** I'm shocked that nobody has mentioned *Worm*, I figured it might be very popular in a subreddit like this.

Worm is a webserial set in a grimdark superheroes-and-supervillains universe. Reading it completely dismantled my chances of ever enjoying another superhero setting again, because I know none of them is ever gonna come close to being as good.

--------------

Short blurb: Sometime in the 1980's, for reasons not fully understood, around 1 in every 10,000 people started developing powers. Parahumans -- or capes as they're often called -- can develop a /massive/ array of different abilities: Exuding gaseous shadow, warping landscape, shifting into parallel states of reality, shapeshifting the bones in their own bodies, constructing hyperadvanced modular technology, developing a supercharged ability to pick up on subtle hints and form conclusions, and many, many more.

Here's the catch: Capes usually manifest powers during the worst, most traumatic experiences of their entire lives. Villains are fucked up. Heroes are fucked up. Everybody in the series has more baggage than LAX on a busy day, and when you throw superpowers into the mix, that makes /shit go down./

--------------

Geniuses with mental powers act like geniuses with mental powers, working in the shadows to leverage events to their favor. But /everybody/ plays smart, thinker or brute, because those who didn't often wound up dead very quickly. All powers -- every single one of them -- have strengths that the users exploit and limitations that they need to cover to prevent being exploited. The victors are usually the capes that can outwit their opponents, discover the flaws in their armor, and drive the stake in deep before the other gets the chance to. Synergistic power combinations, truces, citywide strategy, negotiation, espionage, alliances, tactical retreats and logistics/counterlogistics operations are bread and butter for parahumans.

--------------

The ultimate example of this powers-as-chessgame theme is the main character herself. Taylor controls bugs. Specifically, all arthropods in a 1-3 block radius. This may seem strong in a vacuum, against normal people. But bear in mind this is a universe where people can literally bathe themselves in fire, use blades as if they had the range of a sniper rifle, transform into hounds of whirring metal saws, fly around nigh invincible, absorb powers, fire energy beams from their hands, increase their size and resilience 10x, hit with the strength of 100 men, conjure infinite weapons and level buildings with their bare hands. Oh, and did I mention that there are 3 massive cryptic beings called Endbringers which show up once every few months in an attempt to systematically genocide the human race? In this universe the ability to control bugs is often, on its face, ludicrously outmatched.

But her power is a lot more versatile than it appears on the surface, and Taylor is completely /brilliant/ at leveraging it. Let's break it down:

All bugs in a 1-3 block radius. Cockroaches, fleas, biting beetles, wasps, bees, spiders. She can feel the locations of people or things through their senses, perceive where each and every one her bugs is, and direct them all individually, but with the coordinated strength of a general commanding an army in realtime. Also, the number she can control is essentially infinite.

Her range of control is limited, of course. But if she chooses to cruise around in a van and collect millions and millions of insects into one place before initiating a fight, who's going to stop her? Spider silk is light and has all the tensile strength of steel, but in the real world collecting it is very slow and difficult. Taylor, however, can have them breed and weave silk all day long. So she gets near unbreakable cords with which to orchestrate her attacks, and can distribute silk-reinforced body armor to her teammates.

What else. Having wasps airdrop other insects that can't fly? Check. Pre-coating flying insects with capsaicin or pepper spray to further incapacitate opponents? Check. Planting insects on people to track them? Check. Manipulating objects with her swarm? Check. Creating simple doppelgangers by forming bugs into a roughly human shape? Check. Emulating speech through the coordinated buzzing and chirping of her swarm? Check. And that's just a few of the basics of her toolkit; how she uses each of these with each other, builds them up, and combines those abilities with those of the people she's fighting beside, is nothing short of genius. It makes her power one of the most dynamic and enjoyable in all of Worm's truly /massive/ cast.

--------------

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][You can read it free here.]] It's extremely long, at 1.7 million words (the entire Harry Potter series is just over a million) but excellent all the way through. As a web serial it was released in small chunks, so it's very conducive to being picked up and put down at your leisure.

If any of this sounds like the kind of thing you're into, then you owe it to yourself to give it a read.

**** Oh yeah, it's not a perfect series by any means, and the structure of the plotting is definitely a weak point. The author was forcing himself to keep on a writing schedule to practice, so it often does not come across as precisely plotted out beforehand. I will say though that this gets better with time as they author adapts to the webserial format.

Worm has plenty of weaknesses but to me its strengths are so notable and unique that they outweigh all of the bad. One of the most impressive things to me is how the author managed to write such a massive cast of interesting, dynamic and layered characters. It kind of blows my mind how well he understands his characters' needs and motivations on top of everything else.

But at this point I'm preaching to the choir. ;) Glad you're reading it, hope you enjoy the ride!

** This is more just an anime recommendation as this series only feels like the MC is a rationalist if one justifies it themselves in their head (but if you like anime): Knight and Magic. It definitely has some aspects of trope awareness for example.

Another that I just like a lot as good rationalism and would recommend to anyone after reading HPMOR is Worth the Candle. For the parts you seem to enjoy however it's a /very slow burn/. I'm talking like 1 in 15 chapters displaying the quality that you seem to be aiming for (e.g. in the ~200 chapters currently in the series I would say I can think of about a dozen "extremely smart MC outsmarts everyone" scenes (they are often the entire chapter) though I will say that in the last few blocks of ~20 chapters we got two and a half excellent ones and I really enjoyed it, and there is an implication of rising tension as the MC seems like he will soon be having to face more threats that have been built up throughout the series). I would say read till the end of chapter 14 (the end of first book, the first time this quality is displayed) to see if you like it or not.

Finally as a fantasy example that is somewhat less rationalist (but with a decently rational universe) I would recommend Practical Guide to Evil. It's /sort of/ "young adult" and feels a bit more adventure-y than say HPMOR, or say Death Note. But the main character's thing is definitely out smarting everyone.

** Liar Game is a pretty good Rational manga. Here's a summary:

#+begin_quote
  Written by Shinobu Kaitani (also the author of One Outs), Liar Game is a manga and drama series about the struggles of Nao Kanzaki against a mysterious and nefarious organization called the Liar Game Tournament Office that places innocent people through psychological games using their debt as bait. All its members wear masks and any participants of the game are free to drop out, assuming they pay their debt which the game forced upon them. With debt that frequently is in the 100 million yen range and quite often more, it's no small deal. Said organization will also collect the debt "any way possible..." Using the help of recently released conman/genius/Chess Master Shinichi Akiyama, Nao seeks to rid herself of debt and also save those who are participating in the games. Expect all kinds of plans and cunning to apply here, as it is a Battle Royale of wits.

**** 40MoC is truly amazing- a rational cultivation novel set in a sci-fi universe that isn't a mere veneer over a traditional one. Characters all have their own solid motivations, and there are layers within layers in plotting, evolving from what appears to be a standard beginning. MC is smart, but within reason since older, more experienced enemies can out-think him.

There are obvious references to Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, and others, but nothing that infringes on the story's own sense of fun. The author really gave a lot of consideration to working out his story and the background universe. Having read up to the latest translation (almost 1900 chapters out of 3335), I'd say it is my #1 pick for cultivation novels (and I've read a lot of these). Those chapters cover a lot of complete story arcs and should keep you occupied for a long time.

***** Agree. At first I was a bit annoyed, because of the edgy MC who got a powerup right at the beginning entirely coincidentally, and also the heavy-handed vengeance porn aspect of the first arc. Some people could have criticized the apparent millitary jingoism as well, I didn't though because I don't care much about such things in fiction. But then the powerup became less and less relevant, the MC chilled out, the demons got humanized, the jingoes became the antagonists, and even before that the story entered a stupidly long streak of being consistently entertaining.

**** Does it seem likely to complete within a definite time? <curiosity> I know of various manga which have had a planned ending reached despite popularity (e.g. Death Note?), but especially for shounen-manga (though also for light novel series...) I have a general impression of series being stretched on for as long as their popularity lasts. (Naruto comes to mind, in which it ending was a surprising blip in the background of it never ending despite not being of remaining interest.)

I would be inclined to recommend instead reading to the end of the first arc or first few arcs, then either dropping it or leaving it to accrue more arcs; it would be a shame if you kept tabs on it for years or decades, it finally ended, you at last started a complete collection of it, and then within a few chapters you realised "Oh, it turns out I don't enjoy this one after all.".

<moment of introspection> Not only in light novel series and manga, but also in long-running Chinese translated novels, I'm seeing a trend in myself of seeking out and enjoying the starts of stories, the parts where the premise is set up and all the interesting moments at the beginning that give a good first impression happen, then dropping out as soon as there stops being meaningful progression and the author drops into a rut/treadmill. The ones that hold my interest are those which can maintain enjoyment despite a rut or especially if giving an impression of meaningful change and progress... hmm. </introspection>
