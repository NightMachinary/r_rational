Bakuda protagonist? That's interesting. Although I have to say, when I first saw the title I instantly thought of Leet. I kinda want to write that one. There aren't many characters in Worm or even in fiction in general whose powers are constantly worsening with every use, and that would be interesting to pair with the mother of all self-improvement powers.

Edit: Also, I believe there is WoG out there somewhere that the reason Leet doesn't have the full cooperation of his shard is that he tends to play it safe and avoid conflict, which is antithetical to the shards' purpose. A time loop could fix that, even while it exacerbated the limitations inherent to his power (ie, the inability to repeat designs). So he'd probably improve at slightly different iterated designs that are functionally identical, and if he's lucky he might even learn the actual operating principles of very basic Tinker equipment after enough time, but he would still be losing access to specific designs with each and every loop.

******* As I explained in my edit after I thought about it a bit, I think yes, but at the same time you have to remember that, by canon and WoG, Leet has two real problems with his ability, not 1. He can't repeat himself, which is an inherent limitation of his power set by his Shard at the time he triggered, *and* the fact that his Shard hates his guts, which is a result of his behavior and choices. If I were writing it, I would interpret that as being sort of like his power is a DM with a grudge against the player. The limitation is the same, but it might be interpreted broadly, even unfairly.

A Shard that's cooperating with Leet might say "oh, that idea you had? It's a good one. Get some materials and I'll walk you through making it, but just this once." "Oh, you need something similar to an earlier project? Well, we can't do that, but maybe I can help you figure out just how different it needs to be, since we're buddies like that."

A Shard that's sabotaging Leet might say "oh, that's a cool idea you have there. Here's a sudden, migraine inducing flash of inspiration on how to make it. What, you didn't catch that? You can't interpret or retain that much information at once and you didn't even have your workspace ready? Well that's too damn bad, because I'm not repeating myself, so you can just try your best."

** Woo, family backstory! At long last!

*Daimen's Psychic Powers*

This chapter confirms it. I find it extremely unlikely that Daimen was trained by aranea or has as much experience sifting through people's thoughts as Zorian. I think there are three options for Daimen's control of his powers then:

- He discovered (perhaps unconsciously) how to control his empathy to the extant that it didn't negatively affect him.
- He has no control over it, but his empathy is weaker than Zorian's. This could give him his social edge without the drawbacks.
- He has been trained by another psychic.

I want to expand on a theory for point 3 a little bit. We know that Zorian and Daimen's abilities are inherited from their mother's witch lineage. Since Zorian received some lessons from his grandmother as a kid, it wouldn't be unusual if Daimen had as well. Perhaps Zorian's grandmother taught Daimen how to control his powers. Though it is never stated explicitly, it seems like Zorian's grandmother has since passed away---and before she could train Zorian, no less. Then Daimen either purposely keeps quiet about Zorian's psychic powers (because Daimen is a spiteful asshole), or doesn't recognize Zorian's symptoms as psychic pressure (after all, how could anyone be as special as him?). I guess we'll found out more about Daimen's abilities (and his awareness of Zorian's) next chapter.

*Neolu Foreshadowing*

From my perspective, this chapter confirmed that Neolu is an important character. She's been mentioned more than just about any other classmate at this point--even if it's just because she habitually eavesdrops and gossips. I scoured the earlier chapters for more references to her backstory:

From Chapter 7, when Zach first explains the time loop to Zorian:

#+begin_quote
  "You're the most interesting person I know of at the moment, and the only other person who believes me about time travel except Neolu,” Zach said.

  “Neolu?” asked Zorian incredulously.

  “She's an avid reader of speculative fiction and mysteries and is very imaginative and open-minded,” said Zach. “A naïve dreamer, her father would say. It was surprisingly easy to convince her I'm really a time traveler. I guess she wants to believe it's true.”
#+end_quote

From Chapter 63, when Simulacrum #2 tells Neolu that he is using a time machine to cheat at school:

#+begin_quote
  “Really?” she asked suspiciously, like he had just told her something unlikely but still entirely possible.

  [...]

  “No, I was just joking with you. I don't really have a time machine,” Zorian explained patiently.

  “Pity. Having a time machine would be grand,” Neolu said, smiling. “Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time and fix things before I mess up.”
#+end_quote

Though she seems happy on the surface, I think she seriously regrets whatever scandal she got caught up in back in Xlotic. We know one of the keys is hidden in the Xlotic desert, so maybe she will end up aiding Zach and Zorian in their search in a future restart. At any rate I think she will /at least/ be given the Raynie treatment---privately confiding in Zorian after he goes to her for more advice.

Yeah, it does sound like her wanting to go back and fix something is specific, not general. And it would be both logical and interesting for them to have her help in searching Xlotic rather than doing it themselves.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm not sure. However, his recollections of his grandmother seem somewhat positive, yet he told Kiri that she's the only part of their family he likes, so probably yes, their grandmother is no longer around. Not to mention how much she might be able to tell him about his bloodline, so surely he would have visited her at some point during his country-hopping if he could.

**** Yeah, I remembered Neolu talking back in Chapter 63, but I was honestly surprised when I found the earlier mention of her father and desire to time travel all the way back in Chapter 7. If this does end up being significant later, Nobody103 deserves a pat on the back. There aren't many authors who plan out their character histories so carefully.

Your reasoning re:Zorian's grandmother was essentially the same as mine. I can't help but wonder if her relationship with Zorian and subsequent death will be discussed. There could be an interesting story there. We /did/ eventually get an explanation for Zorian's aversion to the police and his lock-picking skills, so I don't think it's unlikely.

Stealing from the invaders/cultists might be a bigger source of income than you realize.

**** However, Zach already explained that he couldn't access the large majority of it, and especially that he needed Tesen's approval for using any large amount of funds. So no, this couldn't come from Zach. These were Zorian's and Zach's own personal funds.

They did mention in a previous chapter that after visiting the dungeon together for the first time, they left it with 3 large crates full of crystals. Considering that it's been about 8 months since, it's quite likely that they mapped the depths of the place much better than before, and Zach also knows the location of many rare magical creatures. So I'm pretty sure that this is where the large majority of their funds came from.

I'd agree.

If you put Zorian in a situation where he could either compel a teller to write him a bank check, and get out of the loop, or refrain and vanish into oblivion when the loop ends - no other options - then he'd be walking out of the bank with the check within 5 minutes, and the teller would have forgotten he ever existed.

*** Because the invaders are supplying an entire army with food and equipment, there is probably a lot of wealth to be stolen there.

Think 10k people, $10 of food per day, plus say $10 per person for miscellaneous expenses per day, for one month---so that's $6M right there. Say Z&Z get 10% of that. Plus crystalized mana, the simulacrum scroll, and whatever other artifacts and valuable carcasses they've found.

Oh, and Zorian knows the identities of the cultist red robed mages, who are powerful politicians with fortunes perhaps on the scale of $1--100M. Reading their minds could have given him access to their bank accounts. That's probably the biggest source of wealth for them by an order of magnitude or two. The mana crystals, loot, etc. might just be chump change compared to the combined wealth of several politicians.

Enlist seem simulacra to sell the wares around the country and that's a sizeable fortune, probably equivalent of $10--100M. And if their currency is 100 pieces to the dollar, then showing up with a check for $100k is 10,000,000 pieces, and that's definitely "a lot of zeros".

And that he uses it more as a passive guide in dealing with people than influencing them outright. Basically, "I'm pretty sure this person would like it if I did this, so I'll do that." and vice versa, possibly like how Zorian originally was with his empathy. If Daimen had gotten professional training in mind magic, either from humans or aranea, given how insular the community is, I think Zorian would have found about it in the course of his own training and investigations.

He explicitly isn't though. The crux of that theory is that he somehow activated a bakora gate or the sovereign gate at the beginning of the loop, which is already an outdated theory because we know Zach is the center of the time loop.

But he hasn't even been at his mysterious project. He's been hanging out with his girlfriend for "several" weeks, which as this isn't the end of the loop, likely means he's been there since before the time loop started.

So the theory now relies on Zach having become powerful enough to teleport to Koth before the end of the loop, which he can barely do now (seriously, how many updates did that take with Zorian's help?), having found Damien (who wants no visitors and has all members of the house he's at turn away people looking for him), then been either voluntarily bringing Damien into the loop via a temporary marker, or Damien somehow mind-probing him and getting in...somehow.

It's just incredibly unlikely.

#+begin_quote

RR used very crude unstructured magic after years of practice, and when he probed Zach's mind for details on the Aranea, he used structured mind magic (he's explicitly described as casting a very complicated spell, then placing his hand on Zach's head. Zorian's mind magic requires no visible gestures.)

Xvim told Zorian mind magic shaping exercises could give someone very crude unstructured mind magic. That's probably what Red Robe has.

Well, we know that Zach has a fully-intact Controller marker, and that RR either /couldn't/ outright eject him from the loop or couldn't afford to.

We know that Zach remembers spending decades and hundreds of iterations in the loop, and that it's only been going for about 30 years. RR, on the other hand, has clearly spent a long time there, but Zach found it easy to beat him in a straight fight (which might, or might not, just be because of Zach's abnormal mana reserves).

We know that Zorian considered Zach to be a prime candidate for the loop, with lots of underdeveloped potential that has now come out, whereas RR is most likely a cultist. With the gods silent and the Key scattered, the choice of Controller would have to be made by the Maker's agents, who are unlikely to favor the guy who wants to mess with a primordial.

And if Zach was the original Controller, we can easily think of reasons that he might have tried to include others in the loop, or been tricked/compelled into doing so, but if RR were the original, why would he have ever chosen to include Zach? And why wouldn't he have done more radical mind surgery /before/ turning Zach into a Controller?

We don't have definite confirmation from, say, the Guardian, because it's clueless about that kind of thing.

I'm pretty sure that you have to assemble the whole Key to mark someone, and we know it's /not/ assembled. So presumably it wasn't used to mark the original Controller.

I assumed that the Maker's agents would oppose the cult, because the Maker is probably a god, and they didn't like primordials at all.

#+end_quote

As you say, the keys are not assembled, so they are not necessary to mark the original controller. They may not be necessary to mark additional loopers either. The "soulkill" spell is precedent for a Controller ability that we've seen been used without access to the keys.

All we know is that unbarring the gate requires them, and that we have several lesser functions that do not. Thus, we can't assume loop inclusion requires key access.

It's very possible that the soul exclusion and inclusion functions are built into the marker, but Zorian's marker doesn't have those functions because his marker is disfigured.

--------------

This actually hints at evidence against Zach being the original marked individual---he lacks the soul awareness to engage with his marker. If the loop was well planned, you'd think the original looper, pre-loop, would have been been at least setup with a soul mage to teach them how to use the marker.

Although it's possible that Zach was brainwashed of soul awareness, however we know they long-term memory adjustment is very, very difficult, and trained skills are unlikely to be wiped. What's more, we do know RR has facility with the Controller functions per his use of the soulkill spell, which is a point in favor of him being the original looper---though admittedly brings up the nagging question of why would Zach be added to the loop then? It's more likely the cult was trying to piggyback on the original looper than Zach trying to piggyback on the cult.

--------------

If Zach /is/ the original looper, Zach's lack of soul awareness suggests that the loop may not have been terribly well organized or was a last-minute effort to impede the invasion. Again, this assumes skills cannot be easily brain wiped, which . . . maybe they can.

Also, while I do favor Zach being the original looper, I should point out that your statement

#+begin_quote

works both ways. The Gate being moved /from/ Noveda possession may also mean /someone else/ wanted access to the Gate---possibly to hack it to allow a second looper.

It's definitely a marker. Again, that's in chapter 55.

As for making it permanent...I actually had an idea about that, involving RR getting a temporary marker and then using mind magic to make Zach place it on him again in between the time when it wears off and the next reset. It's a way of gaining full loop continuity, consistent with all the known rules, and it would neatly explain why his control of Zach broke down (because Zach became too suspicious of him, overriding any embedded compulsion to ignore him, like what happened with Veyers, and then hid himself from divinations so RR couldn't get him again) and why RR then exited the loop (because without Zach, his marker is temporary). The outstanding question is how he a) used Controller abilities like loop erasure; and b) persuaded the Guardian that his marker was good enough to actually let him leave, since I'm pretty sure only the Controller is supposed to be allowed to do that.

On the other hand, it's theoretically possible that a temporary marker is sufficient to use Controller powers if you know how? We don't really know much about temporary markers.

*************** Hmm, okay. I concede that skill removal should be within the scope of advanced mind magic. But I'll point out that if the /only thing/ passed around between loops is the soul, and since Zorian retains knowledge between restarts, knowledge must be contained within the soul. This means the gain of knowledge and mental abilities /is/ soul modification. Alanic has no problems with this type of soul modification because it is natural.

We know that mind magic allows one to read or control a person's brain. We also know that mind magic allows one to permanently modify the brain---memories can be altered and the brain can be damaged. We also know that knowledge is imprinted onto the soul---not only from the above paragraph, but also because we know that a primary function of the soul is to be a record of a person's experiences. Thus, if mind magic can alter the mental record of one's life, then this means that such mind magic indirectly modifies the soul.

#+end_quote

I like this solution. If a geas were placed on Zach, he could include as many people as necessary.

As for temporary markers giving Controller powers, that's certainly possible, however I feel like that would be a terrible design flaw that the Maker would not have implemented. If the Controller judges someone incorrectly and includes them in the loop, that person could then cast the loop erasure spell inappropriately and a lot of damage, or maybe even start including their own people in the loop. However, maybe the temporarily marked person needs to be /taught/ those functions and RR simply ripped the knowledge from Zach's brain.

Another possibility is that the loop erasure spell doesn't require a marker at all---it's just a spell like any other, but it only works inside the loop. Thus, stealing the knowledge from Zach's mind would be sufficient.

--------------

There is another issue: If RR and Zach meet every loop in a situation where Zach is essentially at the mercy of RR, then Zach should be more easily controllable. Why isn't he captured every loop, drugged out of his mind, then memory wiped? Certainly, if abilities like soul awareness can be erased, then RR (and his allies?) could erase the memories of an entire loop spent in a coma---it's not like there would be many memories clean up.

This may be a point against your hypothesis, as it seems Zach is not so easily accessible at the beginning of the loop.

The above also makes me wonder: If the cult is in on RR being part of the loop, why aren't more cultists included in the loop? RR may be an independent actor, but in my previous reply, I indicated that QI probably knows of the loop.

Yeah, there are pieces of evidence suggesting that RR had a full Controller marker: he was able to exclude the aranea from the loop, and for that matter leave it. On the other hand, the more power you assume he had, the more you have to wonder why he didn't have his own army of time travellers.

Perhaps it's because only one can leave? He doesn't want competition, even from allies.

That may be a matter of "can't do much to him without his marker triggering a reset". If RR was only able to make a small number of changes to his mind with each loop, he'd probably stop bothering once Zach was sufficiently docile. I'm envisioning his control as being less "memory wipe at will" and more "pay no attention to the red-robed guy behind the curtain", which was enough while Zach was oblivious but broke down once Zorian and the aranea tipped RR's hand.

Because we see it withhold sensitive information, it's more likely the Guardian is either being forthright or is unaware that it's wrong. While it's been wrong about the marker due to shenanigans, my hunch is we can take its word here: the original looper's real soul is in the loop.

However, I can also see the sense in only using a copy. If real damage is done to the soul, if you have a previous loop's copy is on file as a backup, you just rewind one loop and the problem is solved.

This is a good point. RR knows something about how the Gate works, so he might know there's a threshold of mind or soul that can be done to Zach before the loop is reset.

****** He has the marker. You can't duplicate it any normal way, barring incredibly risky soul splicing that could just as easily kill you. That's how Zorian was pulled in. This method was stated to be so unlikely that an actual soul mage would discount it entirely, and Zorian confirmed with a tracking ritual that only two people (himself and Zach) had it.

The entity that guards the gate confirmed this. Red Robe must be using some other method to keep his memories intact (and fool the guardian)

Yeah, I mentioned that. It literally requires splicing the soul of the owner of the mark with someone else, which puts you in a coma for at least six months, and probably longer. If it doesn't kill you outright.

Red Robe potentially could have mastered soul magic, and copied or made a marker for himself. He would have /no/ reason to make that whole protected setup for Zach though, if he even could.

If Zach isn't the original Controller (and RR is) Red Robe would have had to have somehow removed the incredibly tamper-resistant marker system from *himself* (as he doesn't show up on searches for the primary marker), then somehow give that how setup to Zach. Then turn on him, and brainwash him, and escape the loop without him.

It makes no sense for RR to be the original time traveler, given what we know.

There's a difference between /being able to/ duplicate the soul by freak accident and /necessitating/ a freak accident to do it. It's not far-fetched that starting with a temporary marker and converting it to a permanent marker is another way to duplicate the marker, and that this process would be significantly easier and safer. If that's the case, it's certainly possible the Cult could have been able to make that happen.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe would have had to have somehow removed the incredibly tamper-resistant marker system from himself (as he doesn't show up on searches for the primary marker)
#+end_quote

Valid point, however if RR exited the loop at any point before Zorian learned how to cast the marker search spell, RR would not have shown up on scans.

It's also possible that RR left the loop immediately after his soulkill rampage. If he believed that the loop would end of a Controller exited the loop, and if he feared that now with many Controllers, there was a chance someone else might leave the loop soon, then RR might have decided to take the initiative and leave first. If this is true, there was no hope for Zorian's marker search spell to detect RR because RR was months gone already.

Also, I should point out that Zorian's search spell only ever defected himself and Zach, which means it did not distinguish between original mark as Zorian's mark, even though Zorian's mark /is absolutely different/ from Zach's in that it is an incomplete mark.

This means we cannot assume that Zorian's tracking spell would not ping the temporary marker, because even deformed markers are similar enough. I'm not saying that's a certainty---Zorian's marker may be intact enough to seem like a good copy to the tracking spell---however, we have no basis to assume one way or the other.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The Gate spirit confirmed the marker Zach and Zorian have is the mark of the controller
#+end_quote

That's not great evidence, seeing as then Guardian /also/ said the Controller already left the loop. In other words, the Guardian /also/ confirmed that RR had the mark of a controller. What's more, RR has abilities that may be consistent with him having a Controller marker---namely the "soulkill" spell and knowledge of the Gate's location and operation.

--------------

Lastly, I must concede the point that I see no obvious reason for Zach to have been included in the loop after the fact. However, I can imagine a few scenarios: For example, maybe the Cult was trying to recruit young, vulnerable, and easily manipulated noble heirs to their ranks and thus it was their MO all along to include Zach and Veyers. I don't believe that theory---I'm just saying one can imagine reasons that are within the bounds of reason.

Kael discusses this in chapter 39.

#+begin_quote
  "I'll be blunt," said Kael, ignoring his glare. "Your marker shouldn't work." Seeing Zorian's confused expression, he moved to explain. "I was immediately suspicious when you described how tightly the marker's entwined with your soul -- why would someone make such a deeply embedded marker and then make it a simple unchanging identification stamp like you assumed it was? The desire to make the marker resilient to damage and harder to remove could explain some of it, but it was still excessive -- there are less invasive means that would have only failed if the soul was so mangled that the person was effectively dead. Those methods do have a noticeable flaw, though -- they are a lot easier to copy than what you have rooted in your soul. That, I felt, was key. The marker was designed to foil attempts at copying it to other people. And in order to do that-"

  "...there are some things about its functions that are obvious to me, and one of them is that the marker is designed to consult the soul of its host -- the core, unchanging part of it, anyway -- and alter its identification tag according to what it detects. Transplanting the marker to another person should result in a totally different identification value...It's broken."

  "...But the main part of the thing works?"

  "In a sense. It does everything it is supposed to, consulting the core of your soul, but for some reason it is still stuck on the same value it had while it was still inside Zach. It's broken, but it's broken in your favor."

  "...If I'm right, then whatever convergence of circumstances aligned to pull you into the time loop along with Zach was a fluke. A fortunate fluke, but a fluke all the same. It is not consistently reproducible."

Simply reading minds and erasing memories doesn't seem like much compared to what Zorian can do, but in Xvim's estimation, for a non-natural mind mage to do that would require at least several years of dedicated study.

Chapter 42:

#+begin_quote
  "Can you also use telepathy and mind reading in unstructured manner, too?" he asked Xvim, acting on a hunch.

  "Me, personally? No. I've never had an interest in anything other than defending myself," Xvim said. "But if you're asking whether it's possible, the answer is yes...with caveats. It requires great dedication for rudimentary results -- such an aspirant would never be able to duplicate the attack you just casually did, for instance, even after a lifetime of honing their skills."
#+end_quote

Chapter 12

#+begin_quote
  The main issue was that one of the participants usually started to mentally and spiritually dominate the other, making them more like themselves in mind and soul, not to mention disturbingly obedient and deferential. This was a good thing when binding animals as familiars, since it was almost always the animal that got dominated by the human, and animals actually tended to benefit from such domination by developing higher intelligence and better control over their magical abilities (if they had any). Sentient beings usually had issues with someone magically subverting their entire personality and worldview, however. At least until the soul bond finished, turning them into a servile clone, that is.

Chapter 61

#+begin_quote
  Unfortunately, it soon became clear that either the new ignition ritual was faulty or that some kind of specialized training regimen was required to stabilize the ignited state, because Veyers started losing control over his emotions and magic. He became prone to rapid mood swings, laughing uproariously in one second, only to be reduced to near-suicidal depression in the next, and then erupting into murderous rage when confronted. His non-structured fire magic started manifesting itself based on his subconscious desires, frequently spinning out of his control entirely, almost as if *it had a mind of its own.*

Emphasis mine.

In which case, Veyers/RR probably both planned the early activation of the time loop and his own expulsion to capitalize on that.

As Veyers would be part of the true ritual, Veyers would have to be part of the inner circle. If Veyers has a soulbond-like tie to a fire elemental, his magic can potentially give him insight to subjugating an alien force. Assuming this is true, then Zach's early loop activities (convincing anyone he can of the time loop) could have got the inner circle's interest. When Zach sought out Veyers, for a laugh, the inner circle used that meeting to set a trap to capture Zach & study him at their leisure. This theory means that anyone of the inner circle could be Red Robe. However, as the time loop seems vulnerable to unstructured magic, Veyers' unstructured fire magic may have given him a slightly better opportunity.

Regardless of my theory, I think its likely that Red Robe is an inner circle member. At the very least, Veyers would be prime cultist material for his /potential/ hatred for Eldemar & Cyoria (looting his House & training commoner mages), as suggested in ch 50 by Tinami.

1. He's recruited by the cult due to his wealth and nobility, and perhaps he is soul bound to an elemental, which might be old enough to have knowledge of the primordial.

2. Knowing the time loop will occur, the cult has Veyers plan to hang out with Zach somehow with the goal of being brought into the loop. He uses the fact that he and Zach share somewhat similar upbringings as the young living heirs of their houses.

3. Veyers feels his friendship with Zach has progressed enough and Veyers is brought into the loop. The cult tutors him and also conducts research on his temporary loop marker to figure out how to make it permanent.

4. Once finished, Veyers and the cult set an ambush for Zach. They steal what knowledge they can, wipe his memories, and then proceed to perfect the invasion process. Veyers continues his training.

********* I invoke complexity penalty.

While step 1 is possible, step 2 is extremely unlikely. And 2+5 even less so. Why? Because Veyers did anything but befriend Zach.

Veyers was alienating the whole group, Zach included. If he was an agent at the time, his performance would be surely reviewed, and corrected. It wasn't. Next, Veyers escalates some unknown to us minor conflict to a physical fight with no one else but the person he's got to befriend, Zach. If that wasn't enough, he got threatened with expulsion that would make his task harder. But he fails that, /again/. Instead of having this shit together he loses it and gets expelled about one week before the loop. He just /has/ to suck it up and endure the humiliation if he is an agent. This makes even less sense if he or his superiors have a prior knowledge of the loop imminent. So up until this point, this can qualify only as a low level Gryffindor.

Several days before the loop starts, Veyers goes MIA. The loop starts. This is the unchangeable timeline, this /has/ happened. We know it from Zorian, an independent source.

Now, for your theory to be valid, he'd have to reverse his behaviour, straight up do a 180 heel-face. Then in one month he is supposed to undo all the damage to his relations with Zach, convince him to give a temp marker, and then maintains the facade for 5 more months. This is highest level Slytherining right here. Making amends with Zach and being not suspiciously friendly would be downright impressive for anyone.

Veyers /as a person/ is simply a sub-optimal agent, from every perspective, outrageously so. I mean, I can improve this plan in two easy steps: a) the agent is a hot grill, b) the agent kisses Zach in the face, instead of punching. I think these would more than make up for the lack of nebulous unstable connection to an unknown elemental.

Veyers is so bad that I consider the scenario of Veyers' body being completely hijacked by some hostile soul/spirit/lich, which then carries out the plan, to be infinitely more likely. It's still unlikely overall (complexity penalty! complexity penalty!) but less so.

********** i concede the complexity penalty, but even without the elemental possession, the plan still pans out if there's some other connection between Veyers and the cultists. Seeing as how some wealthy politicians are in on y cult, this is not far-fetched.

As for befriending Zach, think about how Zach would react to the following:

"Zach, hey. Uh, listen, i want to apologize. I've been going nuts lately with the stress from my house guardians. I know you can understand with what Tesen has put you through. Can I buy you a drink or something?"

You know Zach would eat that up. Done. IMO that's entry level Slytherin.

As for the expulsion, it could be part of the plan, and it would be a part of plan I hey Veyers would just love to carry out. Getting expelled gives him more leeway to act as an agent and more time to spend with Zach without having to raise suspicions at school and without Zach being like, "Hey, how are you so willing to abandon school for this potentially fictitious time travel story?"

Instead it's, "Well, it's not like you have to go to school anymore, so what do you have to lose?"

And he wouldn't need to do a 180 to accomplish this stuff. He is expelled from school. He could just show up at Zach's estate the first day of the loop. Zach would accept that after being expelled, he'd be MIA for a little.

Same applies if his behaviour was genuine and he was recruited shortly before the loop. Why bother? Why risk the one-in-four-centuries chance relying on this unstable kid?

As for fitting the MO, I don't think it's that complicated for the Boronova family to have ties with the politicians who belong to the cultists. They hear of Veyers getting expelled, know they need to target Zach, and that they could make good use of the Boronova house's resources.

What's more, Veyers doesn't need to be their only attempted vector to Zach. They could have given a few people with tenuous connections to Zach this type of mission---and maybe Veyers was among the first to get close enough to be included into the loop.

Of Zach's classmates, who would you expect to join your terrorist group? One of the kids still in good standing? Or a disenfranchised student who was just expelled and probably has a chip on his shoulder? Case in point.

And we're not talking high-level James Bond stuff. I'm convinced if he just approached Zach to apologize and reach out at the beginning of ten restarts or something, Zach would have forgiven him. I mean, Zach /did/ punch Zorian in the face, but otherwise was happy to join up with Zorian. Zach is a forgiving and easy going person.

While I admit that a feigned apology pales next to a positive first impression, you have to understand that, from the cultists' point of view, their avenues to Zach are limited. If I were them, I would plant several people. And I don't know Zach or his classmates well enough, but the only one I know of who seems likely to join a terrorist group and betray Zach is Veyers.

Okay, so say Zach lets Boranova in and talks with him. The cultists coaching him for two or three days would be enough for the following:

Veyers "opens up", discussing his frustration with his House caretakers and how they try to control him, how he realized after leaving school that he's pushed everyone away in his life and he has no one. He decided to start with apologizing to the people he was especially shitty to---Zach being a good first candidate.

After some more discussion, Veyers asks Zach what he's up to. Zach, having lived through the month several times, decides---what the hell, I'll tell him about the loop. Veyers is one of the few people that believes him.

It's not that hard. And what makes it more credible is that Veyers doesn't have to be the only person they tried to recruit.

Yes, get someone, /anyone/, and so maybe they put out feelers and, surprise, none of Zach's teachers or other classmates don't seem terribly interested in seeing the world burn. And a random perosn Zach doesn't know shows up to the Noveda Estate asking to hang out with Zach and . . . of course is dismissed as a nutter. But a former classmate from the Academy and son of a Noble House ? Okay, the gatekeepers are willing to bother the Noveda heir with that request.

We're unaware of the power structure, that's true, but I have a hard time believing the individuals with the red robes were even a little disorganized. The human resources infrastructure and planning needed to summon then mentally subjugate a primordial seems like it would demand as much. And seeing as these red robes are bigwigs, they're unlikely to be strangers to organizing. Whether the cult far below them is organized or not is less important because RR was recruited right into the ranks of the top brass.

Also, Veyers being an easily manipluated idiot has its merits. His lack of willpower and experience means he would be easy to subjugate with mind magic. His resolve could have been artificially bolstered and dialogue could have been given to him via mind magic.

Whether or not RR is Veyers, the above point is important because we know that RR probably inexperienced. We know RR is a weaker mage than Zach although he had been looping, but that he was a stronger mage than Zorian in most respects, but not all respects.

It makes Damien a much more valuable opportunity for their clan.

If Damien is a untrained psychic, then he might not notice the compulsion. If he is a trained psychic, then there is still a chance its more of a biological compulsion then a magical compulsion. Finally, he might be turning a blind eye to it as he wants to believe he is in love, or was falling for the girl before the honey pushed the him right into 'love'.

Also, it'd be cool to see it pan out as fatalistic love. His empathic powers pushed her over the edge and in response she /had/ to be with him. Hence magical honey to ensnare him with love. It could be tragic or comedic, but it'd be a cool interplay of magics within the world/setting.

***** There are serious moral issues with the love potions trope. Love potions are essentially advanced roofies. From certain perspectives, they're worse than rape because they create a life long commitment without consent, however they do so with none of the trauma (assuming the love potion is permanent), so in an uncomfortable sense, they're not as bad. However, I don't really see any room for it being comedic. Abusive relationships are not terribly funny (how else would you characterize using a substance to force someone to love you?); dramatic would be the appropriate tone.

Either way, I don't feel this love honey approach and the ensuing ethical discussions really fit the tone of MoL---though I wouldn't mind it at all. I'd welcome a good treatment in fact, especially because Zorian needn't do anything about now other than discuss the moral dilemma. It would be a project for once the loop business is settled.

However, I also don't see the love potion happening either because it would allow Zorian's mother to incorrectly assume the moral high ground. For Zach, Kirielle, Zorian, Daimen, the readers, and the author, having to listen to Ms. Kazinski gloat would be utterly insufferable. That's not a great reason not to do the love potion, but it's a decent reason.

Also, Daimen's girlfriend is already enough going for her that I doubt she'd a love potion. She's a princess of a magical family with an intriguing specialization in a land far away from his parents. She's probably well-educated and well-read and she seems to like adventure, seeing as she came along with her family's trackers for Daimen's expedition. As long as she has a chill personality, she sounds pretty awesome.

However, the suddenness of the marriage is a little surprising, so I agree with huh there, and the special bee honey was mentioned . . . and seeing as how competitive treasure hunting is, I'm surprised Daimen is taking the time off for all this. Plus, if the Taramantula House requires a male heir, it would definitely be worth her while to wed Daimen, especially if they know he's a kind mage because of their ability to mentally, perhaps, control bees.

However, he /did/ supposedly discover something recently, so maybe he figures he'll celebrate and take some time off.

****** I do not mean to demean the ethical dilemma of magical roofies, but in a world where an individual can strip your soul and create an animate body puppet while you can do nothing but watch, it really falls by the way side on the moral scale. This is doubly so with mind magic able to alter and implant memories being a thing. Also, "dancing" magic also can force people to do actions they are not willing to do normally. Love potions are fairly tame if they just incite feelings of love which probably fade with time as the potion works its way out of the system.

Regardless, I was using comedy in the archaic sense where it two groups are in an amusing conflict, not in the modern 'haha' funny sense. I'd find it amusing to see two compulsive magics duke it out and thinly veil it as relationship troubles.

As for your points, most of the story has had character interactions centered around Zorian breaking his assumptions of individuals. I would not be surprised if we saw his mother really break down act motherly and not act gloatingly. Also, we know nothing of the girl except whatever has been told to Zorian via his family, which could be very biased. Again the author likes to break Zorian's views on people, so it wouldn't surprise me to see the girl being plain or underwhelming.

We can even turn every point you brought up as a positive for the girl into a negative. Being a princess would mean restrictive potential match pool making bagging Damien more important. Her 'intriguing specialization' might limit her pool further (control raw elemental forces vs bees, wonder which one most people would choose), or it might make Damien more attractive (using the assumption that they know he has mind control genes). Being well-educated and well-read are base necessities that who ever he chose would fulfill. As for her thirst of adventure, if they knew Damien was a potential catch, sending your daughter off to interact with him isn't a bad plan.

As for your quote, didn't this chapter indicate that it was a lie fabricated to allow his mother to not tell him that Damien was engaged? Also the wording is ambiguous enough to allow the important thing be a wife.

** So Damien is psychic but didn't see fit to tell Zorian about it, wonder why that is.

He could just be a dick and didn't tell Zorian about it cause he's an asshole but a theme I've noticed so far is that the more Zorian actually gives his family a chance the more he finds out his initial impressions were at worst wrong and at best missing some critical info to explain the behavior. Like Fortov giving him space or his sister's reasons for stealing all his crap. Admittedly, Fortov is still a dick for the creeper rash thing and his Dad doesn't seem to pleasant.

Also I've noticed all of the bad stuff we've heard about Zorian's mom has come from his own internal musings or talking to Zach about all of which could just come from Zorian being bitter. There hasn't been much in terms of specific examples regarding his mother's, for lack of a better term, maliciousness. The closest to actual evidence I can remember seeing was her criticizing Zorians appearance every restart to put him in a bad mood when the subject of taking Kirellle to school with him comes up. So admittedly she's manipulative but I doubt she has malicious intentions.

We haven't seen Damien's psychic abilities yet so I suppose it's possible that Damien still has no idea that he's psychic and has just been using his passive empathy to become more successful. That would bring up the question of why Damien didn't encounter the same problems that Zorian had growing up.

Earlier in the story they were talking about people with large mana reserves not being able to control their mana as well as people with little reserves. Perhaps with Damien having a large mana pool his psychic abilities aren't as sensitive as Zorians thus avoiding the whole problem with crowds and such.

Personally I'm betting that Damien isn't trained as a psychic, No way is he as good as Zorian and maybe he's received some training to shut off his mind or something, maybe even the unstructured mind shield but I doubt much more than that.

Interesting to note that the house he's marrying into is able to control bees, combined with the somewhat ominous title of the chapter apparently relating to Damien's fiancée I wouldn't be surprised if they control their bees with mind magic in some form (maybe like Zorian and his golems or the crows). If their method to control bees involves mind magic I highly doubt that Damien, a (I'm guessing) genius untrained psychic from a faraway country just so happened to fall in love with the heir of their clan, it just seems way too suspicious to me.

Additionally Damien was supposed to be hard at work researching something, but he's apparently spent the past few weeks hanging out with his fiancée. Possibly out of character for him, at least his mom seems to think that nothing would get in the way of his work, and she seemed worried enough to make the trip to check up on him. I know Zorian thinks his mom is worried she wont be able to make use of Damien's connections but I wouldn't be surprised if Zorian is completely wrong about that and she's just worried about her son. Would also be a bit of a slap in the face to Zorian when he finds out his mom was just worried about Damien.

A lack of initial reserves is not something that can fixed with blood magic, or even really something that needs to be fixed at all.

Nobody103 stated that inherited magical abilities are always "minimum cost", as opposed to acquired ones, which have an additional cost depending on the efficiency of the ritual that gives them that ability.

But since reserve growth isn't negatively affected by inherited abilities, Zorian will also gain greater relative growth than a mage without an initial ability cost. Let's assume that the cost of Zorian's ability was 3 units, his max reserves should be around 44 [(8+3)*4], even if Daimen's cost less, say 1, he still probably has far higher initial reserves, if Taiven thinks they're "huge", let's say 19 or so, which would give him a max of 80.

Simply put, it's not a disparity that Zorian can make up for, unless he gets the same strange doubling benefit upon leaving the loop that Zach already has.

Daimen is kind of an ass, but I'll have to wait until next chapter to decide if it was at all malicious or just a mix general older brother jerkiness + popular/genius kid entitlement. If he was aware that Zorian's trouble with crowds and excited people stemmed from his empathy, but didn't tell him about it, then that puts him a bit more in the "ass" category. But if he's an untrained, weaker mindmage, he was probably using his empathy in a mostly unconscious manner. Which isn't that much of a defense for him, because he still should have been able to pick up on Zorian's hatred of the body puppet spell he practiced on him.

We know so little about how the Sovereign Gate works, there's not much point in speculating about it. Getting a marker requires either the Key, the Maker, or one of its agents giving it to the Controller. Do they need to be near the Gate to get a marker? Would they need the full Key or is one piece of it fine? Do they need to be near the Gate to activate it? Even when Zorian and Zach touched it, Zorian only was able to activate the Threshold since he sensed the Gate interacting with his marker. The researchers might be able to see signs of its activation in the real world the next day once it's exhausted its energy reserves, but that's meaningless inside the loop, where the Gate only really functions as a metaphysical doorway back to the real world.

That is to say, adding bits of soul is likely to make someone go crazy, but it doesn't mean they don't gain power.

As far as the Sovereign Gate goes, what we know so far seems to imply strongly that there are some people who should be aware of the time loop. If it's a ritual, someone has to enact it. The Gate is supposed to create a perfect copy of the world the instant the spell is cast - does that mean it excludes the person who cast the spell?

*** Didn't mind magic require a superior mana control? And isn't mana control and manipulation adversely affected by larger mana reserves (i.e. harder to train with more mana)?

So if Damien received both mind magic and large reserves, it could have limited his empathic resonance and that might be the factor that caused him to turn out like he did (sociable, outgoing, charismatic), while Zorian with his smaller reserves and mind magic had a became more empathic and he turned out as isolated and grumpy to shield himself.

Also most mages don't improve their mana control beyond its useful limit as they can just pump more mana to overcome any deficiencies. It could be that Damien just never developed his control and therefore doesn't understand what his mind magic tells him or doesn't link it with magic but just social cues.

**** You're at least partially correct, here's the relevant [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/chapter-52-fall-5200677][patreon post]]:

  2a: Zorians 'Natural Psychic' / 'Open Minded' bloodline. How does that work? When he uses his abilities like that is it actually unstructured magic using mana shaping and power from his mana reserve, or is it something else entirely, and if he depleted his mana reserve he could still use his mental abilities?

  2b: If this is an ability that can be acquired, any Zach (hypothetically) was given that ability, what would it mean for his shaping? Zach was supposed to be someone with an extra strong mana reserve, and correspondingly bad shaping abilities. Would he still have a large reserve and crap shaping ability EXCEPT in mental magic where he is a virtuiso?

  2a: Special abilities like that are effectively unstructured magic, but the users does not have to exert much effort into shaping the effect because it's all instinctive to them. If he depleted his mana reserve, he could not continue using his mental abilities, no. But they are extremely mana efficient, even more so than regular mind magic, which is already very cheap in terms of mana requirements.

  2b: Your guess is correct. In addition, his mental abilities would be far worse than Zorian's, because they would use his general shaping aptitude as a base to build upon, and he kind of sucks there. He'd be a virtuoso in mental magic compared to regular humans, but Zorian would still leave him in the dust. Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills, and not so much from awesome mana reserves, so he would be worse than Zorian in almost every way when it comes to mind magic.
#+end_quote

I don't think this necessarily precludes Daimen from having a weaker version of their psychic bloodline than Zorian. nobody103 doesn't directly address whether higher reserves affects empath sensitivity, just that "Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills".

As far as empath sensitivity, that seems to be something that needs to be trained separately from mana control. Zorian was affected by it before ever becoming a mage, so even after improving his shaping skills, people and especially crowds were still an issue until he trained with the aranea.

It's weird to me that Zorian thinks stealing secrets by breaking into a civilian's mind is wrong, but scamming them by offering a trade for their secrets that they don't know is temporary isn't.

I guess the idea is that if you restrain yourself to things that are only abusable within the timeloops, you won't have as hard a time adjusting back once/if you get back to the real world? I.e. scamming someone in a trade is less emotionally scaring for the scammer than mind-raping someone?

*** I was thinking a bit about this when rereading recently, and I concluded that there is a definite moral difference between giving someone a good, even generous deal, and having it negated by the loop, vs committing a crime against them and having /that/ erased by the loop.

First, it's a difference in yourself. "You are what you do," so it's much better to be in the habit of paying handsomely for what you get. It affects how you subconsciously think about people, how you approach hard problems, and basically your whole mindset. Zorian is very aware of that. If the loop turns a good deal into a scam, that's not something he can help; he didn't start it and can't stop it. How could he treat them any better? Sitting on his hands to avoid deceiving anyone would not save them from being erased at the summer festival. In fact, in light of the invasion and primordial summoning, teaching him is their best chance of surviving in the real world.

How are they being treated well? They're offered what they believe is permanent wealth or knowledge transfer, which is then being taken away.

No, I don't. Actually, I think that if it were feasible to explain the loop to all of them, and if they really believed it, then they would accept much /smaller/ payments, in hopes of ZZ saving their lives from the invasion. They might also want Kael-style deals - which Zorian is, in fact, doing to some extent for the golem-makers etc. Whether he'll have time and attention to get to them all and reward them in the real world remains to be seen, but he intends to try. And incidentally, it seems to me that finding a price they'll accept would help him to know what kind of real-world reward would work best for them.

However you slice it, he really is doing his best by offering outrageous bribes.

That says to me that RR isn't Open; he's just trained heavily, as Xvim indicated (chapter 48) is possible.

Plus, if RR was psychic, Zorian should have been able to recognise that when they fought.

*** the "You actually shot me?" was more of a reaction to bringing a gun to a magic fight. you're a mage so fight like a mage!

and as mentioned already in this thread, Damien is open. RR is not, despite being able to use unstructured mind magic. and unstructured mind magic is available to non-psychics, as Xvim has mentioned

**** "What kind of mage uses a gun!?"

This could actually say a lot about RR's character. What kind of mage thinks that mages shouldn't use guns? Probably someone from a Noble House, with a long tradition of pre-firearms military service and turning up their noses at such commoners' weapons.

It wouldn't make any sense for Daimen, who is civilian-born, to have this attitude.

*** Just FYI: Daimen is Red Robe is perhaps the oldest MoL fan theory. It's rarely mentioned anymore because it's so old---which is why on occasion someone comes on here and proposes it, thinking it was just their idea.

***** Zorian knows RR is not a natural psychic because his first exercise in studying kind magic was being able to distinguish between open and "flickerminds". However, we also know now that Damien /is/ psychic.

That's pretty much the nail in the coffin. Damien is very unlikely to be Red Robe.

** Interesting tidbit from chapter 51, now that we have confirmation that Daimen has emphatetic abilities:

#+begin_quote
  There was also the matter of his family. If his psychic nature was indeed some kind of pseudo-bloodline thing, then his mother and siblings were bound to have it as well, if only in a dormant fashion. He knew that most of them were not full-blown psychics, since he would have felt it if they were, but maybe Daimen was. His oldest brother did have an uncanny ability to understand people...Well, there was no way to confirm it one way or the other. Daimen was in Koth, and Zorian didn't think he could reach him even if he dedicated an entire restart just to get there...

** Hey, if the invaders' gate is based on realising that the Bakora icosahedron is a stabilizer, shouldn't it be theoretically possible to cast a stable gate spell inside a regular Bakora gate? I don't see why they need to duplicate the knockoff gate, unless they need to build a gate in a more suitable location.

** You know, in the previous chapter Zorian was hoping for Zach to give Daimen a friendly beating, but now he's pretty much done it himself, in true Zorian weak-but-skilled style, thoroughly embarrassing him in front of his prospective in-laws.
