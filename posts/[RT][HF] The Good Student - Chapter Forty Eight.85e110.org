** I am a full blown addict for this story. Nic is an amazing protagonist who is just so willing to shred his own assumptions in the face of new information. The supporting cast just makes it even better.

Simole just casually being a badass and Nic having no problem with that/ never acting insecure that it's the girl handing out the asskickings.

Fanny and Davo could have their own comedy duo with the way they're going. They ground the whole story in a way that is as necessary as it is hilarious.

Dizzy is great too. The way her character just /dismantles/ the whole 'long lost childhood friend' trope is brilliant.

Love this story. Love it to death. Can't wait for next week.

** Well, well, well. [[/u/MultipartiteMind][u/MultipartiteMind]], if I'm reading this correctly, it appears that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fqdbf/rthf_the_good_student_chapter_thirty_nine/dqen9ju/][we have called it]]. Nic had an insight regarding a demon's possible behaviour that the actual demon wouldn't have accepted: that there could be a situation in which a demon would want to /reject/ the truth.

--------------

*Prediction:* Mages are made by making demons possess humans, then brainwashing them to believe they're the humans they're possessing. Essentially uploading humans into Arcanum/demons' essences, then having said Arcanum possess the initial meatsacks.

--------------

Holy hell, the latest few chapters were just constant plot twists. I can't even keep the /genre/ straight. [[https://i.imgur.com/d83ioGS.jpg][Is it fantasy? Is it fantasy with sci-fi tropes? Is it secretly hard sci-fi?]]

I'll have to make a thorough analysis to break down out what the truth was vs. what people/entities at various points assumed was the truth vs. why (or by whose plot) they assumed that. It's quite a mess.

Hm, if Nic's demon is the last demon, what about the Librarian? Was she just an aspect/fork of her, as per Nic's wraith trick?.. Come to think of it, she did say they were in constant communication, and knew everything Nic's demon knew, e.g. the Green Demon story. It fits.

In fact, it /explains/ a few things. For example, it appeared to me that she was by far better at social than the other demon, and yet she wasn't the one sent to the Other Place, even though the All-Mother's plan was to acquire a demon who is good at understanding people (or so Nic assumed), which caused me some confusion... Wait, is that even relevant? It wasn't the All-Mother's plan, it was Winnum Roke's plan, and she didn't need a people demon, she needed /a/ demon to power her spacecraft... Ah, wait, Roke's plan included giving the world over to the All-Mother, and she still needed a people demon, it all fits then.

*** (Before I forget, the concern about demons being an exhaustible resource is that they would /run out/, unless there were means of replenishment. Or alternate sources.)

I'm now reviewing chapter 48 (the denouement), 38 (the story), chapter 40 (the almost-denouement), and our communication in chapter 39's comments.

Hm. Both the 'for a demon to have desires' and the 'failure because of a rejected truth' fit the mould of 'for a demon to accept it as a possibility, the demon must admit it to be possible which was thought impossible'. From 40 and the analysis of the 'Librarian', it suggests that the demon was already concept with the concept of a demon having desires, and was only pretending that /that/ was a worldview-overturning thing. (I came to the same conclusion as you about the Librarian, as primed by the wraiths!)

(I still don't understand the exact nuances of meaning in the pug conversation. Between Roke and the All-Mother, did either lie to the other? The situation sounded more as though they were in cahoots, with Roke lying to distract him and the All-Mother cooperating.)

It bothers me that the denouement doesn't slot into the rest of the story. If it's an ending-which-satisfies-but-doesn't-actually-follow, then perhaps in the same vein as the 'has blood ever returned to an open vein?' direct contradiction. Why would the demon's inability to lie make it fail? Why would its ability to lie depend on its acceptance of the truth? Would its acceptance of the truth truly grant it the ability to lie? Thinking back to the demon having been the Green Demon, in a sense--is that something that the demon in fact tried (to openly be accepted as a demon leader), but failed, and didn't know why? But the denouement makes no sense unless it's true, and the demon could really have become able to lie (not impossible?). A sneaky way (story, direct contradiction) to deliver the greatest shock to (/spring it on) the demon?

So far the genre still sounds like fantasy to me, but hard(?)/nicely-structured fantasy, with the 'sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic' applying. Or rather, 'magic' can be treated as a separate set of laws which haven't been coupled to known science or pseudoscience (whether wraiths are controlled via magic and force of wlll, compared with swarms of nanomachines, say). The stars don't necessarily have to be different from our stars for magic to apply. Speaking of which, I've lost track of what happened with the stars--were the stars blotted out only around the Academy, from the dome? Or were they all blotted out a long time ago, with Roke wanting to reach the real ones? Hm.

(Incidentally, the All-Father story was very nice, particularly the human's wish. It's unclear to me why the demon went along with it, instead of continuing to wait for a wish which could satisfy its aim and not sacrifice anything. Unless it also was happy to change, if that was even better for it than going home, and if that helps explain how all the other demons could be depopulated... there's also the question of whether other dragons come from, asexual reproduction or whether they themselves are demons.)

I'm tempted to put forward a counter-proposal that demons are how more dragons get made, but that wouldn't explain the unconsciousness when becoming a mage, unless... hm? The first human, /he/ became a mage while the demon became a dragon. The All-Mother knew of this, and knew that there were more mages and more dragons, but the demon didn't seem to have concluded that the same thing had continued to take place. If that's not it, then what's the secret?

Amusing if the demon becomes the 'human' and the human becomes the dragon, and that would explain the unconsciousness--oh, and the dragon-longing-for human would have gotten to /be/ a dragon, which would be awesome, but why have the demon think he was a mage (and die?), then?... oh, and incidentally conceiving of another pattern whereby mage-candidates (actually dragon-candidates) are turned into new dragons, and in the process an old mage (demon) replaces the new mage-candidate, taking on the new identity and memories, number of mages being limited by number of demons while number of dragons can slowly rise, limited by lifespan and deaths... both ways, there's the question of gradual demon depletion by either mage or dragon death, depending on which they are...

The above musing doesn't solve the problem of why, with more mages and dragons, demon conversion/exhaustion couldn't be satisfactorily posited/concluded even without going in person and determining the exact situation. And it's as yet unexplained how Simole exists! If the demon becomes the mage, turning the human into a dragon, then presumably she would be a human-demon hybrid, but then what the identity of her mother? Or else she'd be a demon who was raised from an infant, getting the full demon potential (with a human's outlook) rather than limiting it to the bounds of an already-formed human personality? That--an infant mage ritual--sounds simpler (Occam's razor) than a new unexplained hybrid possibility. A mage-from-birth, something created not because it couldn't be before, but because no one other than the Archmage (and collaborators) would dare to unlease such a dangerous/hard-to-control *weapon*...

I think that's just generally how lying works. If you don't know the truth you wouldn't be very confident in your lie.

Say you have to lie about the capital of Greece and you don't know a single thing about the history and geography of the region. It would be very difficult as you'd have to fabricate virtually everything.

Meanwhile, if you had a lot of knowledge about all these things you could use that to your advantage. It would be easy to come up with something plausible, you could mix truth with lies and you would be more confident at lying (as you're more secure in your own position).

***** That then would suggest that a demon could say something that was clearly an untruth, but be caught. Have demons (in this universe) in practice been able to say untruths, caught or not..?

(Related thought, I'm assuming the Librarian used phrasing that, at the most, only referred to herself in the third person, but did she in fact lie and state that merging had taken place, which hadn't? I should go back and reread that.)

More relevant to my earlier impression is that the lack-of-confidence matter only kicks in when talking about something that touches on the truth. If you want to lie that you're in communication with the other demons, but you're not, then you can be caught in the lie when you don't actually know the truth. However, if you want to lie about other things, such as to do with being a leader of humans, then you only need to know the truth about human things. Unless your actions are stemming from knowledge which you won't consciously allow yourself to admit, resulting in dissonance. But you would still have 'the ability to lie', just not about things where that dissonance was related.

Rereading; chapter 46. A lot of amusing 'I can read hers. As well as I can hear my own thoughts.'; 'I was as captivated as she'. But also 'She has merged with you, thanks to your story.'. 'You won her trust. She thinks you will change her'...'It was a wonderful lie'. Lies? If truly lies, then I could claim that the demon has, in fact, learned to lie. That I'm really curious about how, despite being able to lie to that extent, she still failed at being a human leader. When Nic said that she had to learn to lie, he should have more precisely said lie about /what/ that would have allowed the humans to accept her as their leader...)

(And now I'm thinking about the stories, and how the demon has evidently displayed the ability to at least communicate things not literally true, though the stories might still be metaphorically/euphemistically/non-literally true...)

#+end_quote

I think the All-Mother "lied" to Roke in the sense of letting her fail. Their agreement was, the All-Mother provides Roke the starship, Roke lets the All-Mother have the planet. Except Roke didn't manage to get anywhere with the starship, and I think the All-Mother /knew/ that this would happen, and let it so that she would have Roke's direct help with taking over human world (instead of simple non-interference).

That seems unclear, yes.

#+begin_quote

Yes, I agree. What fascinates me, though, is this part:

#+begin_quote
  For her it was always very simple. My truth is better than your truth. That didn't work here, with unlimited Arcanum. Everyone's truth was as strong as everyone else's.
#+end_quote

Apparently the demons lived in a post-scarcity society. Is the All-Mother their FAI?

#+begin_quote
  of which, I've lost track of what happened with the stars--were the stars blotted out only around the Academy, from the dome?
#+end_quote

Yes. I think those are entirely separate things. Roke's stars were blotted out because of her lack of imagination/Arcanum/magicbabble. The dome was the Archmage's plot, to fully isolate the invading demons in one place, nothing to do with stars in particular.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Maybe it didn't realize the implications right away. Maybe it was committed to granting the wish after Yagare told it, likes it it or not.

#+begin_quote
  there's also the question of whether other dragons come from
#+end_quote

Recall [[https://moodylit.com/the-good-student-table-of-contents/chapter-ten][chapter 10]]. There's only one male dragon, the All-Father, the rest are female, and it's mentioned they're completely subservient to him.

That said, in support of your theory...

#+begin_quote
  “The dragons the other day, they smelled their father on you. It was enough for them to bow their heads. Lots of bowing in dragon culture. Not so much like dogs. *More like people*.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, now that you've said it, that seems blatantly correct. It's also something Nic could have figured out instantly, and he did say he knew the truth already. Why didn't the demon figured this out...

- Did she not figure this out?

- Does she know the truth about the All-Father?

In fact, the mages system and Arcanum were, according to the story, a long-term assimilation plot by the demons. Unless they deliberately set it up to be +brain+mind-washed into becoming dragons, there probably should be some other (demon-friendly) way of creating mages, that the Royal College abandoned in favour of their own.

Maybe the demon doesn't know how the All-Father ended up, and thinks mages are made the way the demons intended it. Or maybe she figured it all out and just pretends not to.

#+begin_quote
  the question of gradual demon depletion by either mage or dragon death
#+end_quote

Seems simple: when "mages"/"dragons" die, demons the Arcanum entities don't die, just stop playing their roles and go back to the Royal College.

#+begin_quote
  Simole created by an infant mage ritual
#+end_quote

That was my interpretation, and I'm not sure why it's not Nic and Simole's default interpretation either. She was just made a mage before she could form conscious memories.

** So. Winnum Roke and All-Mother made a deal, ages ago - the planet for the spaceship. They swapped places, however Winnum Roke felt cheated because she wanted to go to other stars, but couldn't, due to her lack of imagination. Somehow, she was in contact with the Royal College and Simone, along with Delcroix, were a part of her plan.

Nic, however, seems to be a variable introduced by the All-Mother. To quote him directly:

#+begin_quote
  “It's like I had been prepared for this place. I guess that's why she sent me here. It's always been very clear to me that there is more than one truth, and that they can exist alongside each other..."
#+end_quote

The nature of the demons is very interesting. In this chapter, we've seen it become convinced it's actually one entity instead of many. Could something similar have happened at the very beginning? Maybe it's not a demon at all. Maybe the native people of Nic's world believed the advanced tech of the demon was magic, and through their belief, they managed to convince it to change its nature.
