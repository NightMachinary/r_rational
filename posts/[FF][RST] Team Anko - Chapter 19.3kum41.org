  "Shino, is it possible that you have a bit of a white-knight complex?" Anko asked.

  "A white-knight complex," she said

The way this is arranged hints Shino got confused and asked for elaboration first, but there's nothing there to indicate such. A mistake?

Hmm. I wonder what type of testing Orochimaru is putting Hinata through? Seems to be checking how well she can concentrate on tiny details in the middle of combat, where dodging blows would take up most of one's attention.

Also curious about which solution Shino will pick for the issue of his crush on Hinata, for that matter. The fact a poly relationship as an option was mentioned is new, as most people these days wouldn't think of it. Seeing as Anko /is/ in one of those types of relationships, though, I'm not too surprised she brought it up.

*** Shino has thought about (maybe not rationally) the poly solution in previous chapters. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the direction this takes since both Shino and Anko have brought it up.

Pretty much everything possible, although a lot of it wasn't shown on camera. He's already figured out where [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Byakugan#Abilities][the blindspot]] is, as well as the fact that she has an area of focus and everything else is corner-of-the-normal-eye indistinct.

*** You mean the cliffhanger? I think it was hinted over the last few chapters, so this comes as little surprise. Particularly in that it's likely a ruse of some sort to allow the team to escape.

I did like how it was covered Hinata was a bit harsh in dealing with her enemy, crippling then roasting her despite no longer being a threat. Wonder if she'd get reprimanded? Anko didn't seem annoyed...

******** Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble poly relationships don't work for most people rabble rabble NaruHina rabble rabble Hinashino rabble rabble NaruShino rabble rabble shipping lanes rabble rabble rabble.

I think I covered all the bases there.

I mean, me personally I would prefer the story NOT take a poly approach to romance, but my objection is based more on my personal knowledge of human psychology and sociology.

I think Anko's "less then even" thing is bullshit, to use a strong term, unless she meant "less then even" as "below 50%, hovering at around 0.05%". Poly relationships don't tend to work for real people, because real people rarely form romantic bonds (and I'm speaking purely of romantic bonds formed of mutual respect and/or adoration, rather then romantic bonds of convenience, emotional or financial stability and/or security, or their non-romantic ilk) that can stand the pressures of not being the central point of the other person's similar romantic bond (again, pure "I love you for you, and you for me" romance romantic bonds).

There is always the creeping uncertainty in poly situations of one point being weighted more strongly. To make an example, Naru-Hina-Shino triad may face the following relationship creepers:

- Naruto and Shino are in this because Hinata, but don't really like each other in any sort of romantic sense, and are doing this for Hinata's sake. Unstable in a myriad ways.
- Hinata's long-standing Naruto love is more noticable then a growing affection for Shino, and Shino begins to worry if Hinata actually loves Naruto, and just kinda sorta likes him. Unstable in a myriad ways.
- Naruto notices Hinata starting to warm to Shino in the same depth that she's warmed to him, and becomes jealous, similarly to how Shino feels now but more Jinchuuriki SMASH impulsive jealous (perhaps egged on by a bored Kurama). Unstable ain't even the word for here.

These are just the "off the top of my head" examples, and perhaps I am off on something due to the whole "child super-soldiers" thing fisking with normal psychology a bit, but I think the point still stands.

********** Ye gods, that was a long and convoluted read.

I had this entire long comment typed out as a reply to this, and then I realized I'm not comfortable posting that much personal information to the web, so it's gone.

TP;DW: I can see the comments [[/u/eaglejarl]] made, and I disagree with them, but my evidence is anecdotal and my conclusions are colored through a worldview that prizes monogamous sexual loyalty with a single long-term partner due to my disbelief that polyamorous relationships can work for the reasons stated in my above comment, and while it's great that [[/u/eaglejarl]] knows "tens of thousands" of people for whom it has worked, tens of thousands of 7.2827 billion people on the planet is a measly 0.00006875 percent if you give it the generous round estimate of 50,000, 0.0000275 percent of a more conservative 20,000 people, which is a very, very small percentage of the world's population in either case, and fits with the theory that "it doesn't work for most people".

Hell, even if we bump that to 500,000 people the world over, the percentage becomes 0.0006875, which is still...well, 68 ten thousandths of a percent of the world's population. Well outside the norm.

******* I dislike the romance in the first place, so that's probably slightly different from the shipper flames. I very much enjoyed Anko calling out Shino on his shit. Anko is very into the realism, it's a refreshing perspective in contrast to the genin.

I think perhaps you are good at writing children after all.

*** Just wanted to chime in with a "yaay, thank you" -- the poly alternative to the normal teen angst love triangle plot (or worse, the anime harem plot where jealousy is used to demonstrate the immaturity of the female members) is refreshing and appreciated.

Given that Anko was described as being in a poly triad in the first chapter, it makes a lot of sense that it is developing this way. As in, even if Shino gets over his crush and it doesn't actually go that way, it's still good to see it being /addressed/ in the context of "yo, kid, these are some options you have" from Anko, and would be weird for her character if it didn't.

Can't speak from experience on how accurate any of what she says is, mind, just that it follows the story logic well enough and is believable for the given characters. So keep up the good work!

#+end_quote

Thank you, I'm glad you like it. It always strikes me as...well, not surprising, but a little sad, that people don't even /think/ about this as an option when they're facing a love triangle. Most people haven't heard of poly, fewer are willing to admit the possibility that it can work, and obviously most -iads wouldn't work. Still, I always find myself looking at the done-to-death jealousy plotline and thinking "wow, wouldn't this be much easier if these guys were all poly and willing to take a swing at it?"

Which, I hasten to point out, is not necessarily what's going to happen with Team Anko. I made sure the option was presented to them, but the characters haven't finished telling me what they intend to do about it.

** I like how you dealt with Shino's problem, not preachy nor forcing a path, instead providing multiple options. Anko makes a good point about youth behavior.

Orochimaru keeps skirting between gray and dark morality, which is a good way too keep his actions hard to guess by the reader. Liked how he goes teacher to tormentor role back and forth.

Good call on the throat injury. Makes sense to have some repercussions on such a fancy move.

Okay that's it so far.

Wait, just because he egged three Sound kids into getting themselves killed just so he could emotionally blackmail Hinata into voluntarily allowing him to study the Byakugan, you're saying he has gray to dark morality?!
