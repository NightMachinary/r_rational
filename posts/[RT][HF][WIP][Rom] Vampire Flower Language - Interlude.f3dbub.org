** I haven't read anything from this chapter yet, but I just wanted to comment that I was stunned to see this be posted on Feb 13th. Don't you think for a romance story, Feb 14th would have been more appropriate?

*** Pfft, that's if you bow before the false god of Hallmark. I bow before the real god of Beeminder which I have requiring me to post chapters thanks to IFTTT and an RSS feed.

Plus, this isn't a romantic interlude, and next chapter isn't especially romantic (not that I recall off the top of my head), so it's just going to be silly.

** This is just a real quickie about the janissaries (vampire servants) and why they do what they do. No "discussion questions" this time, no feedback sought: this is just a "hey, new content posted" notification.

RE the janissaries: I really wanted to make sure they were all distinct, rather than a formless blob of "plot". So we have:

- Victor, who has no time for any of this shit. Today he'd be the one sharing memes about how millennials only know how to twerk and be bisexual, while still needing them every time he lost the facebook icon by accidentally moving it to the second screen of his iphone. Now I guess he's whining that the greatest generation only knows how to buy war bonds and make clothing out of flour bags?
- Odette is just here for the wrong reasons. She's trying to impress someone; it doesn't seem to be working. She's destined to be one of the janissaries who ends up in a bad way.
- Jacques and Florence Rigal are part of what is a pretty common arrangement for vampires who don't want to be pestered finding a new janissary every 40 or 50 years when the old one dies: just get the family to present you with new candidates. Their craft is never specified but I imagine it being some sort of wood-working/furniture making.

This is about as much focus as they have (there is, I believe, a bechdel-test passing conversation next chapter), so enjoy this bonus, completely irrelevant information that I may declare non-canon if for some reason Odette's reasons for being a janissary become plot important in an idea we have in the future.

ANYWAY, HYPE FOR NEXT CHAPTER

Next chapter is relatively short (about half the length of other chapters) BUT IT IS THE CLIMAX. It is GOOD. My editor basically said she got chills. And the interlude after it is *italian chef kissing fingers* perfect. I'll post them together for this reason (probably with 24 hour cool off).

BUT THAT SECOND ONE IS LEGITIMATELY INTERESTING.

And, I assume, refer to them as "Mr." or "Ms." so that you don't have to learn new names, either. >:P

"Also, I'm no longer using gender-specific honorifics, because, um, something something, smash the patriarchy."

"...Something something, smash the patriarchy? Really, that's your explanation?"

"Okay, fiiiiine, I'm just tired of having to remember any of your personal features. It's bad enough that your faces don't stay the same from one generation to another."

*** For what it's worth, I'd really enjoy this story a lot more if there weren't so many spoilers from the author.

**** Hey! Thanks for leaving an opinion, I appreciate you taking the time.

What are you specifically not liking? The fact I comment at all, the fact that I don't use spoiler tags, or is it when I talk about future chapters being good or having a/the climax?

Or is it my golden retriever puppy level of excitement for everything I've ever done, which I'm sure isn't to everyone's taste?

***** Anticipating future chapters contents. We've had interactions in the past where you've disclosed future information too. It's fine, it just lowers my hype for future chapters.

Last chapter you asked me whether I think William had done mind control on Red, which I hadn't seriously considered outside of the specific instance where I thought it was likely and, though I recognise in that context I was providing authorial feedback, you gave me the answer as to how I was wrong. I'm not bothered exactly, I just prefer to avoid a trend.

Edit: To be clear, I don't think it's important to avoid ALL spoilers, but I do think you would benefit from not posting spoilers unless it benefits the story or the reader. I was happy to help at the time, but would like to avoid information about upcoming plot points (even knowledge that the plot points are short or perfect)

All good. I'll try to do some sort of balance between putting stuff behind spoilers / "DISCUSSION QUESTION" gates. It's really wonderful to know people care, so feel free to order me around like your willing servant! :)

#+end_quote

Yeah, I believe in death of the author, so I'm sorry I wasn't dead for you like I should have been. Until such time as the text contradicts something, every interpretation is canon as far as I'm concerned. (We-the-author-team have been known to ship, like, a lot. Though you'll pull *my* OTPs out of my cold dead fingers).

I /know/ I just get /so excited/ because... well, the golden retriever puppy thing.
