** *Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

Special thanks to [[/u/4t0m]] for offering to become a Beta reader.

This was a tricky chapter: Hannah needs to exhibit tachylalia or extremely rapid speech (bordering on cluttering in some cases) without actually being unreadable or otherwise looking as if the real problem is that I don't know how to write. There's probably going to be a lot of tinkering there as time goes on.
