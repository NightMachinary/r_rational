Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Is the emotional state known as /desperation/ ever a good state for a human being to be in, in real life?

Why or why not? Thinking of it as a consequentialist / munchkin, is there some /optimal/ amount to experience, say 15 minutes per day, or one 24 hour day per year, or something like that?

Thoughts:

1. Desperation implies stress. So for heart health and neurological health reasons, it's probably bad to have too much. But then, exercise also causes stress, so perhaps it's fine to have a little.
2. Desperate people are easier to sell to. Does that imply it makes you suggestible and vulnerable to trickery? Or is it just that one is more inclined to make a purchasing decision / rational trade off (to the best of their ability to determine such a thing) in general?
3. Desperation can make a person stop putting off resolution to some kinds of conflict, e.g walk away from a bad situation like abusive job or relationship.
4. Bad decisions made out of desperation can trigger additional desperation when the results show up. So perhaps there are cycles where desperation/stress is maintained over the long term, resulting in more harm than if the person were to completely avoid the feeling of desperation. For example, a person may initially borrow money out of desperation, then miss the payments, and later borrow money at a higher interest rate due to their lack of credit.
5. Desperation is painful. So hedonic utilitarianism might imply that it should be eliminated in an ideal world. But then, using it to overcome a source of suffering (aging, etc.) would still be justifiable (assuming it is the most effective tactic).
6. Acts performed out of desperation can be seen as less bad, or more heroic. For example, stealing a loaf of bread is acceptable to prevent one's family from starving, but evil if done merely to save money.

*** My first thought was of course it can be good: Desperate times call for desperate +measures+ /emotions/. Desperation is very good at convincing a person to take immediate and direct action on simple and straightforward problems. Yes, there are side effects like bad decisions and being painful in itself, but they aren't necessarily worse than the ultimate results of decision paralysis or other emotional states.

My second thought was that I just skipped half of the question you wanted answered: If we could remove all desperate situations, /should/ we? My gut is saying that small amounts of desperation can be an overall good thing, as it teaches people about themselves and a broader range of human emotions, can give confidence in slightly-less-than-desperate situations, and entirely removing an emotion from human experience is part of a slippery slope that I don't like. My head was reminded of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/][this quote]]:

#+begin_quote
  At another point in the discussion, a man spoke of some benefit X of death, I don't recall exactly what. And I said: "You know, given human nature, if people got hit on the head by a baseball bat every week, pretty soon they would invent reasons why getting hit on the head with a baseball bat was a good thing. But if you took someone who wasn't being hit on the head with a baseball bat, and you asked them if they wanted it, they would say no. I think that if you took someone who was immortal, and asked them if they wanted to die for benefit X, they would say no."

** It's Tuesday, so I might not get a whole lot of replies, but I have a politics question.

Have you found the whole feminism/SJW/gamergate/whatever debate to be entirely one sided? Recently someone who's opinion I respect by osmosis (they're part of a group that generally makes good decisions) very firmly came out as pro social-justice-warrior.

I'm not asking for a debate on the topic, partially because it's not something I really discuss for concern of SPIDERS (also witch burning), but I would be interested in hearing if you've found the debate to be completely one sided, or if you have problems with SJW tactics or goals.

*** My experience of this whole shebang on Reddit and other places was one of walking into a room and finding people hurling molotov cocktails at each other and blasting blood curdling insults. Oh and SPIDERS EVERYWHERE.

And this question seems to be trying to find the group inclination on a political issue, by asking about perceived balance of evidence from others. Well, why base a decision on that? [[/r/rational][r/rational]] isn't some kind of arbiter on Rational Thinking, or of a Good-and-Righteous political platform.

If the question is about balance of evidence, well, go imagine yourself as that-label-you're-using-to-represent-those-who-disagree-with-you, spend some time collecting the strongest evidence possible (like half hour at least), and /desperately/ try to counter your own position. That may approach a teensy bit of the sufficient amount of de-biasing and honest assessment of evidence that's probably required.

Tbh, I haven't had the time to do that and such hostility as I usually see makes the whole thing unpleasant and seeming like it requires significant personal effort to expend concentrated thought on. Accordingly, I don't hold an informed/strong opinion yet.

If there was a consensus, that would be a very important data point. I'm not looking to know who's right, or anything like that, just checking to make sure I'm not on the wrong side (IE, not on the SJW side alone) of an obviously one-sided debate.

A bunch of keyboard warriors have found a thing that they can be shitty to each other about. Because the people who are the most outraged have the most to talk about, they're the ones who dominate the discussion. This is in addition to bad conversation driving out good and extremists driving out moderates. It's nothing that's unique to what their particular spat is about.

*** Oh, boy. I'm going to concur with [[/u/CaraCompanion2016]], and say that everyone here should just pretend we've been appointed /EVIL OVERLORD/ of our respective areas. Calling it Evil Overlording rather than governance at least keeps things a little non-spidery.

Now, that said, I'm promptly going to make things a bunch more democratic. You see, as Overlord, my biggest problem is /information/. Sure, I'm supremely benevolent and want to fill the world with happiness, light, and other nice things, but in actual fact, what I really need is /data/.

Who needs what? Who wants what? How are people relating to each-other? (That's especially given that such relationships form /at least/ a double-digit percentage of the proper /a posteriori/ definition of Fun.) How can I more efficiently convert negentropy into Fun? Who's dying, where, of what, and what's the most efficient way to put a stop to that?

This is why I'm implementing a more participatory government, and a more participatory economy too. Yes, that's right, it's time for some democratic socialist utopia imposed by an evil dictator, yaaaaay! And then we're going to gather a few other pieces of information, namely: what're the biggest [[http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/][bullshit jobs]], [[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/explainer-how-economic-rents-affect-inequality/][rents]] and [[http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Externalities.html][negative externalities]], and how can I tax or expropriate those away in order to fund the massive machine of scientific and technological research I need to actually accomplish my nerdy goals like renewable energy for everyone, a sustainable high standard of living for everyone, space colonization, abolishing death, etc?

But the point being, if I can organize things so that people mostly take care of their own basic needs, and manage to signal what their unmet needs are when they /can't/ take care of it themselves, that gives me the most efficient way of meeting those needs. No matter how benevolent I am, I can't actually be everywhere everywhen, and in fact, going for the "Godhood Victory" tends to make people extremely uncomfortable and give them a sense of being existentially overshadowed. In fact, one important subgoal is going to be coming up with a solid, a posteriori definition of /agency/ so that I can proceed to maximize the agency of the citizenry on individual and collective levels, since that will /mostly/ save me a bunch of effort, and also generates much more /morally interesting/ problems when it goes wrong.

Since my endgame /isn't/ to spend eternity as some kind of god-emperor of mankind in the first fucking place, I don't really want that anyway. People don't think through how /un-fun/ that would be, especially after your son betrays you and sticks your rotting zombie on a golden throne. I ultimately want /companions/ on the incredible journey that is life in the universe as a living, growing, learning sapient creature, and I /especially/ want to make sure I can engineer some kind of anti-inductivity into my subjects and companions so that we neatly produce Fun for /each-other/ rather than having to constantly conquer exponentially moar and moar raw space, mass-energy, and negentropy just to keep novelty levels up. In fact, that whole latter condition simply /cannot be met/ if I constantly keep other people below my own level.

This will probably mean quite a few centuries of working behind the scenes to infuse every major cultural meta-narrative, from religions to economic ideologies, with a bit more Spiral Spirit, but a race of powerful, spirited equals whom I can trust /as such/ rather than trust only from a position of dominance is worth it in the end.

So, how do we move in that direction? Concrete, actionable goals?

One approach would be to acquire a bunch of income, and then do micro-grants and other funding for small projects. Local infrastructure projects and such forth.

If the goal is explicitly to make more participatory economics, a friend of mine has plans for a platform similar to gratipay or patreon, but with networks of fund transfer. Like fluid democracy for economic power.

I'm not entirely certain what it provided over gratipay, aside from not being run by crazy people who are willing to implement some bad bad ideas involving anonymity for the sake of their SJW contingent.

But I digress. General world-domination strategies should commence.

I actually really like this idea.

I mean, I've always wondered what the fuck we could have done with crypto-currencies, for instance, if someone was basing them on participatory-anarchist principles rather than on trying to make digital "gold".

When I was a kid I read [[http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100238350][/Making Mondragon/]] and wanted to start a workers' cooperative when I grew up. Nowadays I rather think that business is /SPIDERS/ and I don't want to deal with it, but it still seems overall like cooperatives and cooperatives-of-cooperatives offer good ways to build participatory, democratic economic institutions without having to pray desperately for The Revolution to come.

On the internet, we've got a thousand gajillion Starving Artists and university students with hobbies. We've also got loads and loads of (sorry to toot my own horn) moderators, curators, and admins who keep sites running. Other than the occasional Patreon account for someone with generous internet-friends, /all/ of this is done /completely unpaid/, while "start-up" businesspeople like the ones running Reddit bring in ad revenue.

Admittedly, /reddit isn't actually profitable/ as an ad-based business, let alone if they had to pay wages to all the moderators!

What would be a way to start and run a community website of some sort as a users' cooperative, with content creators actually getting revenue and owning the site alongside the admins, mods, and whatever other form of active users there might be? There's all kinds of crypto-currency, crypto-ID, and open-source stuff, and I feel like if we somehow put it together with the right kind of legal charter, we could get something that self-sustains at least as well as other websites (eg: runs on a shoestring, always at risk of dying) /but is actually owned by the people who make it work/.

Here's a small tidbit: "If law-making is a game, then it is a game in which changing the rules is a move. Law-making is more than changing the rules of law-making, of course, and more than a game. But a real game may model the self-amending character of the legal system and leave the rest out. While self-amendment appears to be an esoteric feature of law, capturing it in a game creates a remarkably complete microcosm of a functional legal system."

*** Are you talking about a "Science is Awesome" epistemic rationality or a "We Will Unite Under a Single Goal" instrumental rationality?

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/]]

I think we'd all agree that #2 gets uncomfortably political, if we have deviating values. (Chances are, you and me actually don't deviate significantly, since we are posters on an Internet forum on "rationality", but our theoretical citizens would.)

To pull Instrumental Rationality values into a "Rational Constitution," I'd like to cite the Atheist mind/Humanist Heart crowd-sourced winners for the "10 non-commandments." It's a great start as a Bill of Rational Rights.

[[http://www.atheistmindhumanistheart.com/winners/]]

1) Be open-minded and be willing to update your beliefs

2) Strive to understand what is most likely true, not what you believe to be True

3) the Scientific method is the most reliable way to understand the natural world)

4) every person has a right to control over their body

5) God is not necessary to being good or leading a fulfilling life

6) be mindful of your actions and own up to the consequences of your actions

7) [the Golden Rule + awareness of the fundamental attribution error]

8) we are responsible for us, and for the future

9) there is no one right way to live

10) leave the world a better place than you left it

(1&2 are the Litanys of Tarski and Gendlin, 3 gives a shout-out to Bacon, there is an accounting of the fundamental attribution error, with some cultural relativism with notes of tolerance and acceptance... But there might be a direct rejection of the assumptions of #10 by transhumanists who want to make the world the best place ever, because they want to live like they plan to live forever)

Nah, as a sentence in colloquial speech, #10 is fine, especially when combined with #8. They both do the work of ruling fatalism out and responsibility in.

I would modify #9 to say, "Rightness of ways to live is not a metaphysical property", because I definitely want a worldview that lets me yield specific reasoning for why I object to paperclip maximization.

Anyway, if someone wants to explain: how are most conservative and reactionary ideologies /not/ Anti-Spiral? I mean, neoliberalism is a Spiral Nemesis wearing an expensive suit and looking to tile the universe in call options. A Spiral Nemesis is still Spiral, so I can kinda understand it.

But attempting to look at people who claim to be protecting their cultures and humanity and they're /not Spiral at all/, but actually /Anti-Spiral/, does not make any fucking sense.

(FOR NON-TTGL FANBOYS: "Spiral" can be taken to mean, roughly, "lifeist, in favor of life, growth, learning, freedom, evolution, and self-improvement", while "Anti-Spiral" indicates the specific belief, which I'd once considered a fictional strawman, that /all those things called Spiral are disastrously dangerous and must be suppressed or destroyed for the sake of avoiding the universal destruction they inevitably cause./ It's as if you viewed normal life-forms, at least the ones not under your command/optimization, as the moral equivalent of paperclip maximizers.

*********** The only bot we've got is [[/u/AutoModerator]], which was created by [[/u/Deimorz]] ages ago and is now baked into reddit itself (because he got hired as an admin). More at [[/r/AutoModerator/]]. If you'd like information on coding/hosting, go check out [[/r/redditdev]].

(It's possible that we could configure AutoMod to run Nomic, or that you could configure it within another subreddit.)

Automod is not turing complete by any stretch.

************* By "run Nomic" I meant "do whatever administrative stuff you need it to do". Make posts calling for votes on subjects, create discussion threads, etc. Which shouldn't require it to be Turing-complete.

Also, how sure are you that it's not Turing-complete? Or ... which features make it not Turing-complete?

************** I've played around with it a fair bit over on [[/r/3Dprinting]], we get a lot of spam. I've also looked at it's code a very small amount.

It's pretty procedural in what it can do, and doesn't have any recursion or way to store state.

So pretty sure. It's not so much that there's features that make it not turing-complete, more that it lacks any mechanism for establishing loops and passing data around.

The regexes you embed into it might be a bit closer, but evidence suggests that they're not, and they definitely aren't from a practical point of view.

*************** AutoMod used to be able to reply to its own comments (as a natural function of what it does) so I was thinking that if you could either enable that or work your way around it, it might be possible to feed the output back into the input in order to get some recursion going. Because it can read the input of every comment with regex rules, you could set up eight simple instructions similar to what brainfuck has. The only issue after that is having it act on data, which I think you might be able to do via regex somehow.

(So I still don't know whether it's Turing-complete, but your comment got me thinking of how you might be able to use AutoMod in unintended ways.)

**************** If it loops...

But how do they stop automod fork bombs? I didn't see anything in the code that suggested anything to prevent that kind of thing.
