** Just came up with this. If this were possible, what would you guys use the death note to check for?

** The URL seems to be wrong:

[[https://wordpress.com/post/justlustplus.wordpress.com/618]]

... will take you to a Wordpress login. The proper URL would be something different, like:

[[https://justlustplus.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/on-the-death-note-and-conditional-statements/]]

I've removed this, but please repost with the proper URL.
