** This was what I'd predicted, but I'm surprised Arros suggested it. When he began the trial by combat speech I thought he was going to challenge the empty portfolio or something, and take it.

Taking the portfolio of death doesn't necessarily seem as though it would be great for Suze though. A massive power boost, of course, but if gods are shaped by their worshippers and Suze takes Neklos' position, his worship may carry onto her, and make her evil.

Hm. Maybe, but I don't think so. Suze is older, doesn't look like that, doesn't always think of friends first, etc.

  Every Japanese celebrity writeup and every anime character description with any claim to authority gives the person's (or character's) blood type. Why? Because, thanks to a remarkable bit of Science! by a gentleman named Furukawa Takeji, many Japanese believe that a person's blood type affects their personality.

It's actually extremely common to give their blood type because of this.

** If Suze gained the portfolio, does it come bundled with an ascension, or is that a separate attribute?

This raises a few interesting questions. Of immediate importance, could Suze alter the portfolio, changing the nature of death in any way? For example, instead of automatically dying at -10, there's no limit to how far into the negatives your HP can be, and dying is now a free action alongside dropping items and talking.

Of past relevance, doesn't this kind of make the threatened divine punishment from making a perpetual Wishing loop moot? If a god needs a portfolio to be a deity, then Jake couldn't possibly use the ring of three wishes to steal a portfolio, especially considering that it seems to have ownership mechanics preventing any one deity from just nicking it when no one's looking, even when it's one that's currently inactive in the world.

** Emotions that don't make sense can't just be ignored, schizophrenic people often know what they're seeing is hallucinations or what they're hearing, that doesn't change anything, it doesn't make it easier to cope with or better, I'm sure there's some point in your life where you've had rational thought inside your head while your body did something else, it's the same thing. I really dislike that kind of concept where if you're angry enough suddenly Gods power doesn't work, as if Gods power and even emotion would function like that. As if people who cave into it like Suze just aren't angry enough or aren't using the right emotions that the main character is that obviously solves it!

They felt him vanish from the multiverse, but how did they even know that it was Suze who did it? They don't know it was Suze in particular so why do they think it was any of them? Where do they get that idea from?

If you felt that A GOD WAS KILLED, why would you BE POLITE? He's the fucking God of War, he literally speaks about not giving up advantage to be honourable, WHEN HE ISN'T IMMEDIATELY READING THEIR ENTIRE MIND?!?? Hell, I thought Gods always automatically knew when they were being lied to, isn't that part of the parcel? Are they really so simple they can't detect body language or any of a dozen other signs higher beings notice?

#+end_quote

How is he going to justify the Portfolio of Pain? Also, shouldn't like, everyone be immediately fucked as cells and bacteria fail to die?

Did Arros actually audibly have to cast Zone of Truth, is he the only God there that can do that? Can Gods not cast all spells? Do Gods need to go through POPE? No God of Truth or Honour or True Intentions?

"I just happen to know how to change the laws of Physics"

That's a direct lie, that's completely a lie, in every way.

He is also not trapped outside of time.

Also Macht interrupted him after like 2 seconds of talking about Einstein.

What the fuck? Are the Gods that stupid? Herrun and Loki seem infinitely smart to the other Gods, oh wow some new God known for causing trouble and hanging out with Loki suddenly volunteers some stupid suggestion that no one else is supporting BETTER ARGUE VEHEMENTLY. BUT WAIT, NO ONE WANTS THE GOD OF WAR, WHO AM I ARGUING WITH?!?!

I don't even understand why they would just be like "ok let's argue about her two suggestions"

The Gods portrayed as is I'm surprised the universe functions, they've existed with Loki for millenia and they're still led astray by the most obvious of things?

Ok, what the fuck? Trial of combat = death could just have declared war on every other God one by one and kept expanding his portfolio? That rule = one guy is powerful = RIP everyone else.

*** First point: Basically every review you've ever left, either on FFN or on Reddit, has come across to me as at least somewhat insulting and has expressed how something in the story bothers you. Furthermore, your comments often show that you have misread, not read, or misunderstood something. Then, at the end of your reviews, you often say "really enjoying it" or "can't wait for book 2". The combination of these three things is really confusing for me. No matter what, though, I wish you would phrase things a little more politely.

That isn't what happened; it was explicitly stated that Macht had hit Jake (and Suze) with the fear and then let it go. It was slowly wearing off, and Jake managed to get out from under it as it wore off. Suze, having been repeatedly described as "mousey", had a harder time fighting it off and it took her a little longer.

"They" didn't. Arros did. He's the God of Magic. His portfolio sense informs him every time anyone casts a spell anywhere. As a greater god he can even look into the past or the future to see who has been casting spells.

The Portfolio of Pain was never discussed; I'm unclear what you're asking for here.

#+begin_quote
  [Arros, Zone of Truth, etc]

No, most of the gods there were casters and could have performed the spell, if they had it prepared. Arros, however, is the God of Magic; he can cast any arcane spell as a free action without having to expend a spell slot. Why pay money for something that your friend can do for free?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The point of that section was that every god wanted the portfolio of Death, but no god wanted any /other/ god to have it. No one was starting the discussion because they all knew it was going to be a problematic one. Herrún got the discussion started by focusing the discussion on two separate gods, both of them very powerful.

Gods prefer not to fight directly. It tends to draw in their allies and turn into a giant war of god against god. Instead they stick with proxy wars, killing off each other's worshippers to weaken one another.
