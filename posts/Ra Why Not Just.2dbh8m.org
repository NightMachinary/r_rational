** That comment section is ... well, what happens when two sides of an argument both think that they are clearly right about something, complicated by the fact that a lot of people are talking at cross-purposes, or about different things.

**** Well I liked the fight. I think that I like all of the fights you write, actually. There's a part of Fine Structure that I often find myself pointing to and saying, "There, that is exactly how a superhero fight scene should be written."

**** The fight confused me at first because I had thought that The Glass Man was sort of like a "Incarnated Ra" built out of thin air like that mech created by Abstract Weapon all those chapters ago. You did a good job of establishing its dominance when it first nicked the Bridge from Laura.

But then in this fight it turns out to be a /human/, which is a step /down/ in power that kinda threw me off at first. Hope that makes sense.

** Looking at the comment thread and the author's responses, it's interesting how much The Glass Man comes off as a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint][Strawman with a Point]].

** One thing that confuses me is that even though the listening post is destroyed, the characters are still casting magic.

*** The listening post doesn't control magic, it just lets the Wheel Group have their admin privileges. Magic is run from that other complex where Laura found the Bridge.
