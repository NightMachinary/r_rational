tl;dr -- If I ran a Kickstarter for "Baby Blues part 2", would you chip in? If so, do you have a sense for how much you'd be willing to go in for?

A few months ago I ran a Kickstarter for a 5k-word rational horror story, "Pay Attention." It heavily overfunded and so I ended up writing three stories which were supposed to total to 27k words but actually ended up being 40k. In my opinion the best of those three was 'Baby Blues'; I think it may have been the fan favorite as well, because multiple people read it and then emailed me saying "oh my god, that was horrifying, and I loved it!" which was intensely flattering.

I'd like to write a 15k-word sequel to Baby Blues, and I'm thinking of running another Kickstarter to support it. It would pick up where Baby Blues left off [[#s][when]] Before I spend time putting it together, though, I want to check if there's any interest.

Setting expectations: My default plan would be to distribute the story to all backers and then put it up for sale on Amazon. I am also happy to have a stretch goal of "the story will be Creative Commons at launch."

So, back to question at top: any interest?


** Well... personally, I wouldn't, but that's more because the "horror story" part than that you're writing it. Not the biggest fan of the genre as a whole!

*** Aha. Thanks for letting me know. In case it matters, Baby Blues was psychological horror, not a gore fest. Very little happened on camera that was objectionable, it was what you figures out about the setting.

That said, would you pitch in on something else? Perhaps a rational superhero story? If you read either of the Change Storms books, that should give you an idea what I'm talking about. If you join my [[http://bit.do/dks-list][mailing list]] there's a link to the latest one, free download. It should have come down a couple days ago but hasn't yet, so grab it if you want it. (It's cool to grab it whether or not you would Kickstart me.)

**** I liked the world and story of Baby Blues but I really dislike any ending that ends on a depressing note... I read to relax not to be depressed at the end. So I would really only back if I know that it's not going to end as depressingly as last time.

Heh. That's fair. In retrospect I'm actually quite surprised at how those stories came out...I don't generally write downer endings, so for two of them to happen was really a black swan. Although, it's debatable whether Pay Attention was a downer ending -- I deliberately left it ambiguous. So, call it 1.5 downer endings.

** I contributed last time and would again. Baby Blues was definitely my favorite story -- I appreciated that the characters (and even society) acted rationally and still inexorably ended up in a dystopia. Pay Attention had a rational monster, but it was very isolated and felt realistically defeatable with a bit more individual effort: hence, not as "horrific".

Yeah, I was...mostly happy with PA, but not entirely. It really fought me. Out of curiosity, how would you have defeated the monster?

** I'm definitely willing to back you again (up to $20) since you delivered in terms of quality plotting and writing with 'Baby Blues'.

Don't forget to post an update to your past campaign to let your past backers know if they would like to back you again. Don't worry about feeling as if you are pestering them. Most of them backed you the first time because they thought you had potential and it sounds like you more than delivered on that front.

I recommend reading this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1pm2c6/some_resources_for_starting_your_own_kickstarter/][great post]] which has some handy links for further advice on how to best run a Kickstarter even if you already have experience under your belt.

*** Yes. Three ways:

1. [[http://bit.do/books-dks][Buy them on Amazon, $2.99 each]]
2. [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Sign up for the Kindle Unlimited program]] and borrow them. KU is $10/month and works like a library -- you borrow as many books as you want, read them, return them, get more. All of mine are in KU.
3. [[http://bit.do/dks-list][Join my mailing list.]] Just about everything I write goes on Amazon in the KU program, but /before/ it goes there I send it the mailing list as a limited-time free download.\\

Right now Baby Blues is only available on Amazon, but the second book in the Change Storms series (rational superhero deconstruction) is available to list members. It will go away soon though--probably tomorrow--so grab it now.

EDIT: The stories for the Kickstarter will /not/ go to the list. It's not fair to ask one group to fund them and then give them away for free to another group.

***** Heh no but looking back at it, it does sound a lot more sarcastic than I meant. I just wanted to mention the fact that it points to Amazon before others clicked on the link in case they had slow computers or something like that. Just thought it was simple courtesy.
