*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7og8ik/biweekly_challenge_forbidden_research/][weekly challenge]], post recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat here.*

First, go read the [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/][caveman science fiction comic]] if you haven't already.

This tends to be one of those tropes that crops up a lot in bad science fiction, mostly because hubris is one of the most common flaws given to intelligent people in general and scientists in particular. /Usually/ it's accompanied by that scientist being evil or unethical, but sometimes it's just a character flaw in an otherwise normal person.

One of the reasons that Forbidden Research is such a well-used trope is that it solves a lot of worldbuilding and plot problems right off the bat. It establishes a conflict (between the scientist and whoever is in charge of forbidding things), it explains why the superscience in question hasn't been done before (it's forbidden), and it usually sets up some kind of moral that's easy to follow.

In the real world, there are either relatively few areas of research that are forbidden, or loads and loads of them, depending on how you look at it. In the "little is forbidden" way of thinking, there are relatively few areas that have actual, literal laws that stop people from doing research (some examples would be cryptography, nuclear reactions, and human cloning). In the "loads of things are forbidden" way of thinking, there are an incredible institutional, cultural, and social barriers that forbid research in practical terms unless you're wealthy enough to self-fund a study without worrying about the professional ramifications (though you'd still have to worry about the legal ones).

(I'm personally a fan of forbidden research being combined with some new and exciting speculative field that the plot can revolve around, but it's entirely possible to do this sort of story about something that's not speculative at all.)


** Isaaac Asimov had a good story about forbbidden research into a device that can see into the past called [[https://archive.org/stream/Astounding_v57n02_1956-04_Gorgon776#page/n5/mode/2up]["The dead past."]]\\
Its got that early asimov feeling of lots of 1960s men arguing about academic politics but I've enjoyed it quite a lot.
