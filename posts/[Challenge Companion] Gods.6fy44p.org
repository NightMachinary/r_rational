** I will be interested in seeing how many submissions resemble /American Gods/ from a mechanical perspective, if not thematically as well.

**** I mean, it's been about 2 decades since the book came out. I am aware that many people have reused many the tropes since then. I'm wondering how many of the recent submissions will be similar (perhaps due to the new TV series based on American Gods).

** The only really interesting stories with gods in my experience are about pantheons with many non-omnipotent gods. It would be pretty cool to see rationalist!athena born from zeus' brain.

*** I think that's been done already. The main advantage to Greek mythology is that everyone is already familiar with the characters; you could get a lot of mileage out of using the trivially different Minerva instead.

** I tried writing a dialogue with some glue prose this time. I'm not sure how it worked out.
