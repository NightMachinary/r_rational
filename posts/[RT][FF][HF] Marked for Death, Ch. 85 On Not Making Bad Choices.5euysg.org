[[#s][Chapter reaction]]

--------------

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The first chapter is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][here,]] and the story-only thread (if you'd like to get caught up quickly) is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/][here.]] There's also a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/][guide to voting]] put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

The story updates every Thursday ([[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]]) and Sunday ([[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 Year Emperor]] and [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html][Induction]]).

*** Oh, on that note, I did want to apologize too for any part I had in fomenting the aggression and panic that happened as a result of the update. Though I was threadbanned before it dropped, and I was legitimately upset, it was not my intention to upset anyone. I'd intended to put this inthread once my ban was either rescinded or expired, but faflec's relayed comment warranted my own.

**** Thanks, much appreciated.

In a "lemons from lemonade" moment, I note that that we have far more people in thread than usual. Hopefully that will convert to a larger community and higher vote count.

***** Yeah, I was considering that as a bright side, too. I just hope that I don't end up getting anyone else banned accidentally because of moderators poking around as a result of my appeals. :p

****** I hope that they decide to lift the ban and let you back in; you're an active player with good ideas and nigh-always positive contributions to the community. That said, I wouldn't get your hopes up. The violations of rules 3 and 4 are arguable, but your post was almost a literal cut-n-paste from the "don't do this" list under rule 2.

******* My main argument was that given I've only made 11 posts outside of the thread (well, 12 including the appeal), that a 2 week ban was excessive for a 25-point infraction (which does not even yield a single-day forum ban by their system).

** You know with the sheer quantity of omakes that people keep writing and including in the threadmarks, you may as well link to the previous chapter in addition for the readers who don't want to miss a single piece of shining literature.

Or just assume that your readers are capable of clicking the back button instead of being lazy bastards. ;)

PS Does Hazou actually know that his bloodline is derived from Sasuke's? I can't tell if that's in character knowledge or only something that people use in the omakes.

***** It was initially decided when the bloodline was imagined, and confirmed by Word of QM when we were panicking over the /first/ time someone was about to get scanned by a Yamanaka

E: Specifically, Hazou being told about it by his mother was confirmed by WoQM

*** Do you mean I should specifically link the non non-canonical chapter previous to this one (because people might be interested in the drama that ensued), or that in general I should link the previous chapter in these types of posts?

**** Sorry if it wasn't clear, but it was meant as a little joke at how I have to keep checking for any new non-canon chapters whenever there's an update and how it was exaggerated today with 4 new omakes for me to read. It's such a minor issue that nothing needs to be done.

I wasn't actually aware of the ex-canon chapter Velorien wrote when I made my post, so I wasn't referencing it at the time of my post.

Carry on being such a wonderful writer!

***** Huh, I may actually do that - something simple like "previous chapter is here, omake since then are here here and here, today's chapter is here."

Thank you for the idea and the encouragement!
