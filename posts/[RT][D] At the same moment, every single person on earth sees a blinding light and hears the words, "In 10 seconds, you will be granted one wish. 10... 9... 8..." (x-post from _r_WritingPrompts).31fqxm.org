Assuming the wish was granted, I would then run a functional simulation of the current universe up until the present, creating backup copies of every sentient being ever in existence. Then start over, rewriting the laws of physics to eliminate the possibility of death and suffering of sentients, and which allowed every sentient limited omnipotence within their own pocket universe. Oh and of course the ability to travel to other's pocket universes at will, given permission to do so by the owner. Then copy everyone over and relinquish my total omnipotence.

I think that about covers it. I hope everyone would forgive me for denying their wishes!

*** I'm not sure if wishing for "the result of a perfectly worded wish for X" is any better than wishing for "X". You're hedging bets against malignant (or at least undesirable) interpretation of "X", but that same malignant/undesirable interpretation is still a possibility even if you specify "perfectly worded" beforehand.

Like...

I imagine there's this concept:

< a wish for X >

and this concept:

< a wish for an undesirable/malignant twist on X >

and this concept:

< a perfectly worded wish for X >

and you imagine that you can avoid the twist and get the good result by that proposed phrasing. But it seems to me that what could actually happen is this:

< the result of a perfectly worded wish for a malignant/undesirable twist on X >

I'm not sure if there is a way to get around that with only one wish.

For the first, this wish tell the genie to simulate all possible wishes on the topic and to give me the result of the one which most fulfills my intent.

For the second, literally no wish is ever safe and you should not wish for anything.

** *Assuming I think it's a hoax:*

I probably /do/ think it's a hoax, but the magical-seeming light and disembodied voice would at least put me in a mind-state to consider that Everything I Know Is Wrong. What's the worst-case scenario for participating, versus the worst-case scenario for /not/ participating? I'd participate, just 'cause the cost isn't too bad even if it's a hoax.

*Assuming I know everyone in the world is getting this same opportunity*:

Most of the folks in this thread are wishing for omnipotence in one way or another. What is the result of two omnipotent entities existing? I can think of two models:

- Omnipotent entities can destroy each other (or at least render each other non-omnipotent), in which case /properly using/ omnipotence is sort of a game of winning initiative.

- Omnipotent entities are immune to other omnipotent entities. For reasons, this results in a paradox; if this is how omnipotence works then only one omnipotent being may exist in any given reality.

How does the mystical force deal with contradictions? I don't think it is possible to figure this out in the timeframe alloted, but I can think of several models for this; there may be others:

- Whoever gets their wish in FIRST gets it, anything that contradicts this is null and void
- Any contradicting wishes are nullified on both sides
- The wish-source tries to maximize the number of wishes fulfilled and nullifies the smallest number of wishes that may be nullified in order to achieve this goal
- The wish-source gets as close as it can to fulfilling every wish, averaging them out in what it somehow considers to be a 'fair' manner (e.g. if 2 people wish to be omnipotent-and-immune-to-other-omnipotents, the result is they are both extremely powerful nigh-omnipotent beings but not quite omnipotent)

Hm.

I don't trust the vast vast majority of people to be omnipotent in a safe way. Destruction is much easier than creation, and whatnot. I'm not even sure I trust /myself/ with that kind of power, and I trust 99.9999% of the population even less (not 'cause I estimate myself more than all-but-one-in-a-million, but 'cause I, at least, would align things along my own values, whereas with Everybody Else I have to deal with the /combined/ factors that their values are different, and also, they may not be smart enough to wish/enact properly)

There's a lot of information about How This Works that we cannot know. There's a lot of ways this could end in disaster -- way more than actually achieving humanity's CEV, if there is such a thing.

My personal inclination when this sort of thing comes up -- with such a small timeframe for reflection, anyway -- is to, /as quickly as possible/, *wish for everybody else's wish to be cancelled.* I've worked this out ahead of time because of similar prompts to this, so I think I could get this in /pretty early/. Maybe wouldn't beat the other 7 billion people in the world, but could beat most of them.

In /some/ of the potential scenarios for how this could work, this saves everybody from themselves. If it's "nullify the smallest number of wishes" then I've just nullified myself and we are probably screwed. If it's "average out in the interest of greatest fairness" then I've helped a little bit, but we are still probably screwed. But, I'm not sure what I could do better in such a small time period.

*Assuming I don't know everyone in the world is getting this same opportunity, and I think it's only myself:*

- Can I wish for more wishes?

Usually not, but we don't have that information. My gut feeling is that using one wish to wish for more than one wish would 'fizzle' somehow, and it would be lost. It would not necessarily work this way, but I would have to work on /some/ assumption.

But I feel like using one wish to wish for one wish -- that might work.

I wish for another wish to be granted to me after three days. That'll give me more time to think about just how this is gonna work.

That /should/ deal with the wishes for no wishes, and should also deal with other omnipotent entities popping up that may or may not try to kill me. Omnipotence means you can do anything, so that technically means you can destroy other omnipotent entities. But if you do a wish that includes being incapable of dying... But omnipotence means you can do anything and that means that doesn't... You know what, I'm giving myself a headache thinking about this. I'm just not even going to /try/ anymore. Ugh.

With a wish for omniscience, you can see everything. That doesn't mean you can /understand/ everything, and it doesn't mean you won't immediately go insane. Really, all the wishes for ultimate power are always going to have an out clause that destroys the person making the wish somehow, especially if there's only 10 seconds to develop the wish.

****** Presumably, whoever says it first gets it, and then everything after that depends on them.

Really, everything is going to depend on whoever comes up with a significant wish. For example, let's assume the first million people wish for money or the resurrection of a family member, etc. - not really significant wishes in the long run. But if the million-and-first wish is that no wishes come true, the game is over. Or if the million-and-first wish is that they're omnipotent, then no subsequent meta-wishes will most likely affect that new god, but all other wishes do depend on those meta-wishes. It's all pretty random at that point.

Edit: I wish there was a way this post could time how long it takes for each poster's response. It'd be more interesting to see, sort of a model of how it might happen in real life. For example, [[/u/literal_hitler]] wishes for omnipotence at 8.2 seconds. Unfortunately for him, [[/u/Igigigif]] wished for arbiter-ship over wishes at 4.4 seconds and rejects this wish... but lets [[/u/JackStargazer]] wish to allow us to reach humanity's CEV. Be interesting to see what the final result would be.
