** A lot of Starwhisp and the Iktotch seem to be heavily inspired by the Babyeaters. There seem to be a couple of lines taken straight from TWC, in fact.

*** The Babyeaters are a spawning species that are somewhat less intelligent than humans, crystalline and silicon-based, highly rational, scientific and co-operative and perfectly at peace with themselves. And they eat their offspring. The Iktotch produce large litters, are more intelligent than humans, incapable of anything like a formal scientific method, protein-and water based (though not DNA based), four-limbed (usually), incredibly irrational and prone to bias, highly factional and prone to destructive wars. They enslave and brutally exploit other Iktotch, including their own children. Both species have a long evolutionary history of farming and were partly shaped by group selection. But the Iktotch consider cannibalism disgusting, if you're interested. I based Starwhisp on the mote in god's eye more than TWC but since TWC is also based on the Mote the similarities are there.

** The economics aren't realistic. No society without roads is going to build a space ship. A space ship has like ten million parts produced to exact specifications, and takes years for even large well funded teams of experts to build. The same goes for the memetics. Inventing nuclear power solo in one's backyard is not going to happen for anything remotely near human level intelligence. The author compares their scientific situation to the Reinassance and its geniuses, but even those guys were standing on a human pyramid of giants. Unless this species is immortal, it's impossible small groups of theirs could accomplish so much.

*** Iktotch are biologically immortal and live for centuries, and the historical description says that they do have a shared culture, it's just mostly oral and informal. So Iktotch build on the knowledge of previous inventions that's either passed on or stolen from other Iktotch domains. The geniuses who invent new technology are always in positions of power and draw up plans that underlings follow. All the components have to be plundered or produced locally but that's part of the reason it's taken them 15 millenia just to get this far. And rocket factories, being the product of foresight, probably would have some internal infrastructure like roads and pipelines. Particularly clever ruling Iktotch will build planned settlements with internal barracks and factories but such planning never lasts.

**** Okay, I guess that's plausible. I must have overlooked that part in the description. I am still somewhat skeptical of whether a culture like that could ever produce rocket travel, but my disbelief is satisfactorily suspended.

**** It's also worth noting that ruling Iktotch (and any Iktotch that doesn't have its independence hormonally suppressed), have an intelligence comparable to a human of IQ 150-200, as far as the comparison can be made. A single Iktotch lineage probably discovered the atomic nucleus, fission, nuclear bombs, nuclear reactors and then nuclear gas core rockets over a few dozen generations of tinkering and passing on notes, equipment and designs (remember the Iktotch language is mainly used for passing on factual data) from firstborn to firstborn, but once the technology existed it would be stolen or copied by rival Iktotch. And those Iktotch groups that don't copy the technology dissapear into irrelevance or get invaded.

Why? Since these particularly clever Iktotch are immortal, they presumably have to be removed by force (and if not, succeeded by their own near-clones who are very nearly as clever). But they would mostly be removed by even more clever Iktotch, who would continue the planning.
