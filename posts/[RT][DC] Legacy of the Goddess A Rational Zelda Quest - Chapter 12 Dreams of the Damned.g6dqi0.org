--------------

This chapter was written in collaboration with [[/u/MMK_II][u/MMK_II]] and the mysterious shadow QM. As ever, massive thanks as well to [[/u/Radvic][u/Radvic]] for his part in worldbuilding behind-the-scenes.

See comments below for prompts and VP ledger.


** u/Ethereal_Emissary:
#+begin_quote
  Observe time-sensitive changes to Link regarding Old Magic and/or Void Power
#+end_quote

I can confirm that I observed Link's essence being supplemented and altered to ᏇᏅᏇᎺᏯ'ᏨᎤᎾ ᏊᏫᏅ ᎹᏨᎤᏅᏨᏬ ᏪᎾᏅᏨᎤᎤ ᏭᏅᏅᏨᎤᎤ ᏊᎺᏅᎹ'ᏬᏨᎤᎹ'ᏅᏨᏨᎹᏅ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ' ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ during the Lightsworn initiation ritual. As directed, I spent 200 VP doing active scans on Link following the event and did not detect any ongoing changes or residual energies at work; probability ~80%.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Spend up to 100 VP on researching the old magic detection device to see if its effect can be duplicated without the device or if other magics (e.g. an "identify old magic" rather than a "detect old magic") could be potentially explored.
#+end_quote

I have spent 70 VP investigating an alternative mechanism to identify Old Magic, similar to that used by the device. Note that I am capable of doing this on my own at present by attempting to suffuse an object with Void Power; however, the artifact appears to be capable of the same with significantly greater efficiency.

Following my research, I believe it would be possible to reverse engineer a mechanism that would allow me to identify sources of Old Magic using approximately 50x less Void Power than my current approach. I estimate this would take an additional 575 to 950 VP to complete.

I have also spent 30 VP on research towards reverse-engineering the area detection ability of the artifact. I am not currently aware of any factors that would preclude me from developing such an ability for myself; however, I estimate it would require in excess of 10,000 VP to complete the research, and possibly significantly more.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  What qualifies as "heroic" for the purposes of generating Divine Power? What are the expectations of heroism for a Champion of Hylia?
#+end_quote

I do not at present have a more precise definition of “heroic” in this context than “acting as befits a Champion of Hylia.”

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Did you observe a spike in Divine Power earnings when Link fought the Kodongo?
#+end_quote

Link generated 406 VP during the timespan of 6 days which included the kodongo incident. Due to the close temporal proximity of this event to others, I am unable to give an accounting with finer granularity.

Fi, how much Void Power are you currently using when trying to identify sources of Old Magic?

Edit: Vecht kindly pointed out that we had data on this back in Chapter 8. According to my very rough estimates Fi spent exactly 347 VP and tested at least 14 times. That gave an average of 24ish per test. So reducing by 50x would reduce the cost of testing to about 1 VP.

** So I was updating the woefully out of date knowledge base, and when I wrote up Vesyrn's entry I rediscovered something we ought to take into account.

Prologue:

#+begin_quote
  “He was seen consorting with a Gerudo agent,” Vian said. “We caught her and learned she was part of a renegade faction camping out in the highlands that we've had an eye on for some time. Little more, unfortunately.”
#+end_quote

A renegade faction camping out in the highlands, sure sounds like the Sunseekers. Vesyrn also mentioned a patron. And well,

Chapter 11:

#+begin_quote
  Zelda knew she had to respond, but something in Naibi's words caught her attention. .../My patron./ Where had she heard that before?
#+end_quote

Furthermore, Zelda in character knows all this. She just hasn't been thinking about because +she's been distracted by the sexy maps and history lessons+ we haven't ever mentioned it.

Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  Zelda could only imagine what their internal politics looked like. She also had the thought that perhaps these “Sunseekers” might even be the group that was working with Vesyrn --- according to Fi's account of Impa's conversation with Vian. Wouldn't that be something?
#+end_quote

So maybe we should ask her about Vesyrn? And what happened to the fragment of power he stole? Seems like a dangerous topic though.

** Thanks for the chapter!

I'm going to hold off on making any kind of action oriented posts until we've had a chance for more people to read and discuss, but some initial commentary:

- I'm unclear on if Link actually investigated using Soothe to put himself to sleep. If he didn't, we should get on that.
- Zelda should also look into this if she's having difficulties with her own sleep.
- Pretty interesting that Naibi was hiding something in regards to the location in Link's dream. We should investigate that further.
- Round ears for the Lynx implies we're probably dealing with a Cosmere-hopper (human?) here. Could be interesting to try to figure out who exactly this is. " the color of a stormy sky" sounds like it could be a Stormlight reference?
- Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.

I'm frankly not sure the best way to approach the hostile likely world-hopper, aside from rebutting her claim about the most meaningful things we've done (which involve successfully repelling a Blin horde and making Link a Lightsworn.) We're doing what we can with limited information - and if she wants us to perform better, we need information to do so.

It's easy to act superior when you're coming from a position of having greater knowledge; it's unlikely this Lynx would have done any better when acting based on the same starting conditions we did. It would have been easy to do a lot worse.

Some thoughts on responding to Jerk #2.

If she doesn't give Zelda information, then Zelda's even more likely to 'trip over a rock and burn down the other half of the kingdom.' Also, why does she even care about Hyrule, it's not like a kingdom means much compared to the 'true foe'.

​

#+begin_quote
  /8th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

Have seen variations of this dream before. Obviously both parents are dead and it's bad. The King is pointing at something. Maybe there's a diary or some sort of clue in his effects? Wailing corpse could be a reference to the BOTW 2 trailer.

​

#+begin_quote
  /10th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

Ominous, some sort of calamity involving Lake Hylia. Zelda can't do anything about it. At least in her current state. Skeltons are probably Stalfos

​

#+begin_quote
  /11th of Last Brisk:/
#+end_quote

Something bad happening to Castletown. This might be what would have happened if we picked empower Impa, Save Zelda. Ocarina of Time reference?

​

#+begin_quote
  /12th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

Another ominous Lake Hylia dream. Zelda is also futile at escaping. Blood moon reference to BOTW

​

#+begin_quote
  /13th of Last Brisk:/
#+end_quote

1st scene is an attractive red-haired woman. Lynx is a attractive red-haired woman. Who's the child though?

2nd scene is a bottle shop. Obvious reference to the bottles from Zelda games.

3rd scene is a Goron smoking... drugs. Zelda complains that the stones are too expensive, maybe a warning to quit using mind altering drugs? Goron also says he's just a farmer when asked to aid Hyrule. Maybe the Gorons will be unable to assist? Although, Hyrule could sure use some more food right now.

4th scene is the happy mask salesman. Don't recognize the mask.

​

#+begin_quote
  /14th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

Someone's already doing the Blin Death Cult or will be doing it.

​

#+begin_quote
  /16th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

A few woman that looked like Niesis? Sounds like Fae. And we supposedly did just release the Fae unto the world. Sage Amauruth could be chastising her because we goofed. Or maybe he's a stand-in for the Lynx chewing us out in this update.

​

#+begin_quote
  /18th of Last Brisk/
#+end_quote

A river, but might be connected to the Lake Hylia dreams?

#+begin_quote
  /20th of Last Brisk:/

April 1st joke update.

#+begin_quote

*** I'm fairly certain that last dream was about the Skull Kid. Vanishing in a puff of leaves after playing a single note is something he does in Oot. Meaning that there's a triforce fragment in the Lost Woods* for when we inevitably have to gather them up.

*Or Faron Woods if we're ignoring meta knowledge**

**Then again, looking at the map, the Lost Woods looks noticeably denser than Faron, and the canopy in the dream was really dense, so I think it's reasonable to conclude that the fragment is in the Lost Woods using only in character information.

** Going to compile things into some semblance of a plan, although I welcome anyone else doing this (for this thread or the future).

*Plan: Riposte*

Conversation:

- General reply approach: Rebuttal.
- The Lynx is cherry-picking a single mistake from among our many decisions - and that mistake could have easily be avoided if we had access to more information. We've been flying blind, and answers will put is in a better position to make good decisions in the future.
- Choosing not to help us has a much higher risk that we'll do something unexpected in the future. Cooperation will minimize the risk that we will act without reasonable information in the future.
- We are no without our own accomplishments, even without Hylia's aid, such as making Link a Lightsworn.
- She asked us to come to her, not the other way around. We have been more than reasonable, deferring other responsibilities to come to a meeting that the Lynx requested. We will not be bullied or demeaned.
- Ask questions.
- What is the Lynx referring to when she talks about "our" Mother goddess? Who is /her/ mother goddess?
- Reiterate that the Lynx never answered about how she knew "all this" about Hylia, etc.
- Ask out who actually killed Hylia. Also /how/ and /why/.
- Ask out what the general capabilities and motivations of this Hylia-killing entity.
- How can we fight this entity?
- What are the Lynx's goals? Why did she contact us in the first place?
- Try to find out more about the location in Link's dream that may be nearby. If the Lynx isn't helpful here, have Link investigate through other means later.
- Try to find out more about the triforce fragments, locations, etc.
- Don't be afraid to abandon specific lines of conversation if they are obviously agitating the Lynx. We won't be cowed, but we can still be surgical with our dialogue choices.

Other: * Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.

** Something I noticed when doing some updates to the knowledgebase.

According to Fi, Hylia did actually contact Zelda.

#+begin_quote
  “I can confirm that it was indeed Hylia who contacted Zelda,” Fi said, seeming unfazed by Vestele's prodding. She floated in place, turning to face the priestess as she spoke. “Though, it is also true that Hylia is no more. Priestess --- I can only surmise that your belief stems from an event that happened many ages ago. Though it is likely the case that she was defeated and forced to withdraw from the world, she did not die.
#+end_quote

According to the Lynx, Hylia didn't contact Zelda.

#+begin_quote
  “The entity that empowered Zelda and possessed her body to turn back the Blin horde was /not/ Hylia. It was merely a shadow. A husk. A remnant. The shape of the void left behind by the passing of something far greater.”

  “A Fae?” Zelda asked.

  “No,” the Lynx said. “They are related, but not the same.”

  “And how do you know any of this?”

  “Do you doubt me?” she asked. “Ask your construct. I speak the truth.”

  /Construct?/ Did she mean... Fi?

  “Mistress, Master,” Fi said, her chromatic form materializing a couple paces ahead and to the side. “I can confirm; I do not detect any attempt at deception. I conclude that she believes what she says with certainty.”
#+end_quote

Buuuut, all that Fi confirmed is that the Lynx sincerely believes what she said. Now maybe this is just a definition dispute. Fi's definition of Hylia being somewhat more expansive than the Lynx's. But maybe it's something more?

** *Announcement:*

We are expanding the usage of player points on the website. They may now be used towards research for Fi (1:1 conversion), and to purchase limited PoV scenes for side-characters.

*Research:*

This is to be done on a per-request basis. If you would like to spend your points towards research, reply to the VP ledger post pinging me by username ([[/u/-Vecht-][u/-Vecht-]]). Note that points can only be spent on open research projects that have been started via regular plans. No new projects.

*Scenes:*

Below are the costs for purchasing PoV scenes for non-marked characters. This is limited only to side-characters that have previously been shown on screen, are not hostile towards your PCs, are in close proximity to an active marked character, and is subject to QM veto.

- 250 points - Single short scene / Vignette
- 600 points - Major scene / Chapter heavily features this character
- 1500 points - Character is the primary focus of the chapter

These prices are subject to change at any time depending on how frequently or infrequently scenes are purchased. By default they will increase by 10% with each purchase.

This is meant for fun/interesting interludes from characters who might not otherwise get the spotlight. It's not intended as an information-gathering tool---except, perhaps, in the sense that another character might have their own unique perspective or insights that one of the Marked characters might not. Please don't make us sad/frustrated that we offered this as an option. It will be revoked if it is abused.

If you would like to do this, ping me or the other QMs in the LotG discord channel or send one of us a PM.

** +*Voting time!*+ E: Voting is closed.

After an arduous journey you've arrived at the Sunseeker encampment and confronted the mysterious Lynx. She's hot! And also pissed off at you for some reason...

After an unsettling revelation and what seems like some sort of dressing down from the mysterious woman, the duo is faced with a question: Why are you here? Zelda gets the sense that she wants you to prove your worth to her before she is willing to engage with you as an equal.

*How do you respond?*

- Simple honesty: Well. She seemed like the best option for getting information about this unknown enemy. Information is at a premium. Help please?
- Offer her a rebuttal: After getting almost-assassinated /twice/ the very first thing you've done is come here for allies and information. You've done well to survive and make contact with such a knowledgeable woman so quickly, no?
- Get angry: Enough is enough! You have had it with these Mother-ficking riddles on this Mother-ficking plane. You're holding a kingdom together through sheer stubbornness and trying to save civilization from the brink of ruin and this tiger-lady asked /you/ to come to /her/ in the first place! Why is /she/ here, huh!?
- Get more quietly angry: If she isn't going to respect you, you won't respect her. Storm off and refuse to talk until she changes her attitude.
- Threaten her: You have a Link right here, and that's a nice (/very nice/) face she has there. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it...
- Other (write-in).

*What else do you have to say to the Lynx? Do you have any questions for her? What do you do next?*

Your previous Void Power total was 2628.

Fi spent a total of 12 VP for telepathic communications and 100 VP manifesting an ethereal avatar.

Fi converted 432 VP to magic, increasing the store to a total of 400 (previously 33).

As directed, she spent 200 VP investigating the changes to Link and observing any lingering effects from the ritual. She also spent 100 VP toward researching the tablet.

This update spanned 1 day and you have earned 36 VP from Zelda and 34 VP from Link during that time.

You have earned 215 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus.

*You currently have 2069 Void Power.*

**** To add to rebuttal option; we should probably mention that part of why were here is to make sure we don't accidentally burn down half the kingdom, or world. We've been working on limited resources and even more limited information, and were hoping that through this alliance, we can get more of both.

Put another way, sending the queen far into potentially hostile territory with a skeleton crew, while her kingdom was on fire, and after several assassination attempts, all for information and resources, is not that much riskier to us than trying to get that same info and resources from an ancient and probably friendly magical being.

Now that we're here though, she can at least steer us away from making any more major mistakes. Can't avoid potholes if you don't even know what a pothole IS, after all.

As ever, you are free to do as you wish. Note that I do not necessarily endorse any of the above options (a few are obviously humorous), and there are no magic answers. How you (the players) choose to proceed will determine how this plays out.

I will however offer a couple points for consideration:

- This meeting is not guaranteed to turn out well, regardless of your intentions (and the opposite is also true). I heartily advise reading the blurb on the "about" page, particularly the "Rational" section.

- Thus far the QMs have been /exceedingly/ helpful. Consider all the nice things you have that are not a direct result of player action. But now we are out of the tutorial, and the training wheels are off. Good luck. :)

* Mark of Harvesting Divine Power
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mark-of-harvesting-divine-power
  :END:
Spend up to 25 of my personal points on additional research toward *Lesser Marks of Transference* with their scope reduced even further. This further reduced version is called *Mark of Harvesting Divine Power*. (Some old discussion of the *Lesser Mark of Transference* spell [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/page-22#post-12737722][here]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/page-23#post-12742643][here]] for ease of reference.)

*Spell description:* *Mark of Harvesting Divine Power* places a mark upon an individual that passively generates additional VP based on the person's activities. This has none of the other functions of a Mark of Transference; it only generates VP. This still requires consent from the target, similar to a traditional Mark of Transference.

Relevant Research Data: We have additional data now that we've successfully marked someone ourselves (Link), as well as witnessing the Lightsworn process. We've also had experience with other forms of Void Power generation via Sacrifice, as well as absorbing power from a fae, and transferring MP and VP. We have more context for general void power use and constraints than before; this should be utilized for assisting in the research process.

* Byrna's Armor
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: byrnas-armor

Spend up to 25 of my personal points on researching defensive magic. We have previously researched the Cane of Byrna's defensive function, determining that it may be replicable, but seemingly at extreme cost. Attempt to research a weaker version of this function, using the Cane of Byrna as a part of the foundation, as well as observing the properties of imbued armor as a second point of data. If possible, figure out if it is possible to construct a defensive spell with a function similar to the described one below:

*Spell Description:* *Byrna's Armor*. While active, utilizes VP to defend the target against attacks. This requires an initial expenditure of VP to activate, as well as a maintenance cost to remain active. The efficacy and duration of the spell are both variable based on VP expended.

Based on the changes noted to Link during and after the process of his change to Lightsworn, attempt to narrow down what specific effect improved his magical aptitude and if this is replicable. In addition, run active scans on Link as he practices different types of magic. Run scans on Zelda when she casts the same spells. Compare any essence changes that occur for them. Try this with each individual magic type. (This latter part is intended to see if there are lingering effects on Link that are gradually improving his aptitude rather than doing it instantaneously.)

*Spell Description*: Expends VP to permanently alter the target's Essence, increasing their Magical Aptitude in a selected form of magic.

**** I would, if such would help with the precision of the research -- that is to say, the meta-level research on research -- supply 25 additional points on each of these.

Additionally, I support inclusion of these within the next update.

I'm saving my points for a Laylith scene though. :)

** Is there a noticeable physical effect when using telepathy? I assume not since Laylith tried to use it to pass along a secret message. And yet Naibi was able to tell that someone had sent a telepathy message to Zelda.

Does Zelda (or Link) know of a way for an 3rd party to detect a telepathy message being sent?

This has been shown several times on-screen but not stated explicitly. Using telepathy causes a person's eyes to glow with a blue aura.

** Really unsure how to deal with Lynx. So little information. Severe lack of allies. Would definitely appreciate more.

Should we even be trying to cooperate? We obviously already decided to try to and now feels like have to but that's sunk cost talking.

Don't feel like the angry options will go well. Otherwise, /shrug/.

** This may be premature, but what are everyone's thoughts on considering the Lynx as mark candidate #3?

She'd have a wealth of knowledge to contribute to Fi, and by proxy, Zelda and link, and she might be able to use Fi's powers more effectively than they (or we) can

*** I'd consider it, but only if she stops being so adversarial. Her intro did not give me the impression she's much of a team player. Seeing things from her perspective /would/ potentially be very useful, but we don't know enough about her to trust her yet, imo.

**** Very true

That said, if it turns out she's interested in getting a mark, we could use that as a bargaining chip, I.e. “I'll mark you if you stop acting like a dick”

Only, imagine that said eloquently and diplomatically instead

***** I think that someone who truly doesn't get along with us could find a way to screw our other marked once they have what they want (e.g. block our senses with a coppercloud, hemalurgic spike our other marked, etc.)

I would not assume that the "gives us a perspective" function is unblockable or otherwise fool proof.

*** Hmmm.... that would be quite powerful. If are goals are reasonably aligned, she should want that. We give her a VP budget for communication, and can bug her as much as we want.

We could even use it to confuse our enemies if they don't know FI's powerset. Make a big show of negotiations falling through, and tearing down all visible lines of communication.
