** For some reason I read Flint as female until Sympath 1 - IV. Take that, male by default!

** Starts really badly. Non-narrative start, too chipper and quirky, not sure what is happening or why I should care. In media res in a book I don't care about from this fictional universe makes me think I've stumbled into the writer's worldbuilding blog, not a serial novel.

Not downvoting, because it isn't OP's fault, but is this actually worth going further than the first dozen paragraphs?

*edit: Okay, look. That sounded harsh. Some background on this. As a writer, I see someone starting with background and characterless worldbuilding as one of the worst things they can do. That's where I'm coming from.

*read more edit: Writing isn't very punchy. Lots of back and forth dialog that goes nowhere. Throws out a lot of names that mean nothing to the reader with very little description on anything--which is modern, but not helpful in this sort of story. Someone is Indian, someone Canadian, but what are they like? Where are they? In front of a door? We've been in front of this door a while...

Second worst issue so far: the I...I...I problem. Starting too many sentences with "I" is sort of a novice first-person issue, and one a lot of writers miss until it is pointed out to them. It makes action and descriptions chunk badly and avoids those helpful declarative narrative statements that ground a reader in the world. The ones we do get are, yet again, character background.

Typically, you have a layout of action -> recover and review -> action. During action, you just jump in and go. During R&R, you lick your wounds and talk about your ex-boyfriend. Instead of starting with action, and for a second chapter in a row, we get background. People we don't know, with objectives that are not the focus of the chapter. Instead, we get a lot of people /talking/ about action. About how cool their powers are, and those of the people behind the door. We get talking about awesome stuff. Which is fine, but a slow start once again.

And a minor thing. Dialog paragraphing is sometimes off, with single lines instead of double-spaced. Sometimes, a lot of other characters' actions get stuck behind someone else's dialog in the same paragraph, too.

That's me having read the second chapter (or first plus prologue, whatever). I think this comment is done for now.

So again, worth reading more, if this is my opinion so far?

*** I didn't mind it, because I like that kind of thing and it gets to the meat quickly the next chapter.

** A superhero web serial in the same vein as Worm. When I read the latest chapter, I thought this sub would appreciate it.

*** Votes get fuzzed; I wouldn't take a '33% upvoted 0 points' particularly seriously.

I didn't upvote mostly because the layout of that page and the font are dreadful, and would make the story rather difficult to consume without Readability. The 'start here' button isn't very prominent either.
