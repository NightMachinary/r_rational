** Catherine has received a -serious- power boost with her ascension into Fae royalty. Even the spill off of it is apparently terrifying and changing the temperature of the room.

*** She has indeed! I'm sure she'll have trouble controlling it but will learn how at exactly the right time.

I'm looking forward to seeing if the combination of her Name powers with the Fae powers will act like a force multiplier.

*** Seems risky what with time passing differently there. It would really suck to have her troops Rip Van Winkled into irrelevance. But it's a good idea if she can figure out the rules.

***** As far as I can discern the Fae in charge set the rules. Catherine is set up as the /big/ Duchess for Winter and should have more than a little sway.

****** Interesting thought. She's been set up by the king of winter to do this. Perhaps he believes there's a story Cat can lock the Summer far into?

** Lots of pieces in motion now! Just some random thoughts:

- Someone remind what Daoine's deal is again? I know they have powerful Watch members that are bound to a god of some kind, but I forget why. Do they watch over the elves?

- On that note, what relation does the Golden Bloom phasing have with Diabolist? Referring to this: "And just like that, Diabolist kicks up the priority list."

- I don't recall the dragon general being named before, but regardless, General Catastrophe is an awesome name. Although I do have to wonder how his legion maintains morale if he's roasted, killed, and raised two thirds of them? I can't imagine that's standard legion practice either; maybe the Tower (and Black) just doesn't think it's worth the fight by demanding he hold back?

- Also, I would have expected the vampire general to be the necromancy-happy one, but oh well.

- Looks like the order of priority is Laure (Thief and the usurpers), which frees up Orim's legion. Then the 15th and 5th meet up with the 6th (Istrid) and 9th (Sacker) to beat back Summer. And after that they all convene on Liesse to deal with whatever Akua is cooking up. All the while hoping that the Golden Bloom stops... whatever they're doing. And that Procer stays put. And that Daoine either doesn't invade, or that the 4th and 12th under Ranker is enough to keep them back.

Ooooo boy, this is gonna be messy!

The last time the Bloom phased was the last time a Praesi villain managed to conquer the whole continent, via assloads of demons. If the elves think Akua might be Triumphant Take Two, it's time to be concerned.

**** I think that's exactly what Cat means. And it's the Wandering Bards fault - remember when she stopped those two elves from entering Liesse to deal with Akua?

*** I don't think we've heard what Daoine's deal is. My guess is they're upset because of what Akua is doing with their people. I hope that they will end up siding with Cat to deal with Akua.

** Interesting chapter. It's good to have the broad picture mapped out to go along with what we've already learned about what Akua has been up to.

I wonder how the confrontation with Thief will go: Will Cat and Thief end up working together or will the Thief die?

*** The Thief seems like she's a bit of an idealist. Besides, it would be difficult to make the character appreciably different from Archer.

**** Yeah, sorry for not being clear. I don't think there's any way Cat and Thief are going to work together long-term. I meant working together as a limited and temporary arrangement to that they can both get rid of Akua.
