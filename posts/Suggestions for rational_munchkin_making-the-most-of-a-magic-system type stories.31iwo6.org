Like, stories that involve taking the rules as given, to their logical conclusions, with as much magic system abuse as possible (meaning the main character has to be intelligent and think outside the box - a lot). I'm wondering what you'd recommend as I'm out of ideas. So far I've enjoyed:

- Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Harry Potter)
- Two Year Emperor (Dungeons and Dragons)
- Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (Harry Potter / Dungeons and Dragons)

Thanks!


** I hate that people now think that that's what 'rational' means. Rational stories are not about munchkins breaking their systems, they're about a set of characters who all behave like real people and make rational decisions from their /own/ perspectives.

Your second word ('munchkin') is a /much/ better name for that class of stories. Stories in which one character actually thinks about the system and tries to figure things out, and the rest of the characters are essentially part of the backdrop onto which the protagonist can reflect the GLORY OF THEIR POWERFUL BRAIN make me feel ill.

*** Agreement to everything written above, with the additional comment that the fact that most of Sanderson's characters are somewhat irrational is only a good thing! There's really only so many ways you can do 'rational' characters, and Sanderson's writing is so prolific that it'd be dull if every single character was the same sort of perfectly self-controlled optimizer.

** Try [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]] by Wertifloke. The pacing is really quick and some people complained about how Naruto is so meticulous with management of his chakra, but that's how scientific investigation works and seems to be what you're looking for. This isn't a spoiler, since this is revealed in the first chapter.

There's [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga of Soul]] by Sun Tzu which starts with using the magic system to help advance science and very early on, [[#s][Soul learns to]]

[[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] has magic as an unholy fusion of particle physics, fluid dynamics, and bizarre programming languages. I don't want to say anymore because it would spoil things, but it's a very long read.

** Stuff by [[/u/AlexanderWales]]. He's written several.

"With This Ring" over on Spacebattles.

There's a great Animorphs fic that has its updates posted here, /The Reckoning/.

**** WTR has a lot of coloured text in it, so it's pretty reliant on formatting. There's a Story Only thread, though; you don't have to skip past everyone's speculating between every chapter.

**** SB gets much, much, much more feedback. People reply to each others' replies, and it snowballs from there, which is good for an author's motivation. A story on FF that gets 100 reviews might have 30 pages on SB.

** it's not exactly rational, but really really munchkinny to make up for it. rick cook's wiz series puts a programmer into a fantasy world whose magic allows one spell to trigger another.

** I think [[http://www.erfworld.com/][Erfworld]] is pretty good, although it's not based on any actual game, and while the rules generally seem like something out of a wargame there are some that seem impossible to implement, such as predictomancy.

** Lots of books by Lawrence Watt-Evans in the Ethshar series have this. They aren't as over the top as some on here, but they definitely have some munchkin tendencies. I do find they're great relaxing reading with a theme along those lines. The nice thing is all the characters seem somewhat competent and intelligent and will exploit opportunities. "With a single spell" is a good starting book for the series. Pretty much "How to munchkinize a fireball: The Book."

** There's some pretty good optimization in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], and it's another free thing you can read online.

I'll second the suggestions for Sanderson, although you should be aware that not all of his characters are optimizers, and that his prose is very direct.

If you don't mind a little self-promotion, there's some of what you're looking for in my own book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]].

None of the characters are perfectly rational - each of them has one or more flaws that causes them to behave irrationally under certain circumstances - but they're all at least reasonably intelligent and pretty good at utilizing their own personal skill sets (better than most of Sanderson's characters, but not as optimal as someone like Milo who is aware he runs on game mechanics). There's a sample up on the Amazon page if you want to see if you like the style.

** Dungeon Keeper Ami is a border example, as the magic system hasn't been explained in detail yet. There /is/ a detailed magic system in the pocket of one of the authors somewhere...

But Dungeon Keeper Ami will definitely fit your profile. Find it at [[http://dkami.wikia.com][this wiki]].
