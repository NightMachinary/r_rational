Hello! I wanted to stop by to promote my web serial Wizard's Tower on Royal Road. Today is the final post of the first arc, and I will be taking a week break. Why am I telling you this? Because it presents a great time to start reading if you wanted to but haven't had an opportunity yet. Or if you weren't aware it even existed.

For those already following along, this is also my way of giving a courtesy heads up like 'psst - end of arc, one week til the next chapter'.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower][Wizard's Tower]]

The blurb is as follows:

The humans call me Nemon Fargus.  They call me wizard, and [Elementalist] and [Enchanter].  They call me teacher.  They call me adventurer.   But I don't care.  Not anymore.  For more than a hundred and fifty years I've served the Kingdom of Sena.  Through four Kings and a Queen.  Two wars and a rebellion.  I've founded and taught at a magic school.  I've fought against beast waves and dungeon breaks. But now?  Now, the one close friend I had left has passed.  So, I'm done with their politics and their economics.  The short and busy lives of humans are more burden than benefit on the weary soul of this half-elf.  Now, I'm looking for a refuge, a place that can well and truly be my own.  Away from the growing cities and the bustling markets, away from the pointless wars, away from the eager students and the arrogant adventurers.  It's too much.   I'm seeking the peaceful life of a wizard in his tower, studying magic to advance my spellcraft.  We'll see if that happens.

** I'm 44 chapters in, and it is my current favorite on RoyalRoad. It has a slice of life feel to its pacing, but it looks like existential threats to this world are on the horizon and the protagonist will have to be involved. The MC is pretty rational, personal quirks and some other circumstances aside, and the other characters actions are consistent with their characterizations, even if sometimes that is made more clear to the reader over time. The worldbuilding is not only thoughtful but does not just follow common tropes. I'm really impressed by how often the author will fix typos within a few minutes of a comment reporting them, as well as by the reasoned responses to criticism.

** I saw this when it was posted on the sub a little while ago.

I liked the conceit. I eventually stopped reading because the pacing felt very slow. (In the sense that the ratio of words written to distance advanced by the plot was too high.) I think I specifically dropped off during the carriage ride where we were learning about the previous ages..

Good luck with your writing!

** I'm not going to read your story, and I think you deserve an explanation why. Because your blurb has turned me completely off of reading it, and if that's losing you other readers, you should probably fix it.

I can break your blurb down into two parts: a backstory for the main character, and an idea of what the story is going to be about, and what the character wants. That's fine: it's a good way to construct a blurb, and you've baked some good world-building into it, too. The problem is that neither part is compelling.

The backstory part talks a lot about deeds that the character has done, of titles he has earned, but they're rhymed off like items on a grocery list. They don't have any weight. I don't think this is the problem, though: I think it's exactly what you're going for. Your wizard is weary, has lost interest in those deeds and titles, has lost all reason to want to interact with the world. In a word, he's depressed. And that could totally work: he's not a character who's a lot of fun, but it's often compelling to watch characters like that deal with what life throws their way.

Where you lose me is the second half of the blurb, By this point, we understand the character, so we want to know about the story. We know what the character wants; we don't know what is preventing him from getting that. And the second half of your blurb does next to nothing to establish a conflict; the most it does is to hint that this won't be the case by saying "We'll see if that happens."

As a comparison, if you look at a copy of /The Hobbit/, you'll probably find the following:

#+begin_quote
  Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.
#+end_quote

Your blurb establishes that this is a person who would rather not being out going on adventures, much the same as Bilbo. But /The Hobbit/'s blurb only dwells on that for one sentence, before telling us that there are forces which prevent him from living out his days in contentment in his hobbit-hole. That's what's missing from yours.

The heart of any story is conflict. And while a character struggling against depression is a decent conflict, your blurb makes it sound less like the story is less about him struggling against depression than surrendering to it, and the latter is not a story I'd care to read. And if that's *not* the story you've written, then your blurb should be revised so that it sells the story you /have/ written.

You're the first (and only) to bring that up and let me know, despite having the blurb up for more than a month on Royal Road. I feel a bit like I have been talking with a piece salad in my teeth and you're the only one who pointed it out.

This + the slow pace made me drop it.

** Im no mod, but I feel like excessive self promotion might be frowned upon here; instead of a post like this, you'd be better served by doing something like "Wizards Tower End of Arc 1" or "Chapter 44", since there's no issue with just posting links to your work. I guess people also don't want constant chapter spam, but you could just do discussion threads in batches of 5+ once per week or something

Related to that, you asked at the end of the chapter if people would mind if you switched to less frequent posting. I would suggest you do go to fewer chapters per week, perhaps 2-3 longer chapters. I think meeting a post per day requirement can have a negative effect on quality.

*** Thanks! I wasn't planning on doing any further self-promoting here for at least a month or more after this post (whenever the next arc is completed) so hopefully it won't feel like spam at all by then.

With regards to the fewer / longer chapters, thanks for that advice as well. The daily chapters is more intensive than I had originally estimated, so I could imagine the story taking a quality hit at some point in the future if I tried to force it.

*** Thanks for asking!

I answered that question 12 days ago the first time I self-promoted here, but have no problem answering again.

It meets, in my opinion, all five of the requirements listed in the about section of this subreddit.

It's been recommended here before (which is actually what led me to find this group).

I could go on BUT, before I do (if you want me to), I'd like to ask: what would convince you to consider reading the story?

  what would convince you to consider reading the story?
#+end_quote

- A spoiler revealing a self-contained, worthwhile and well written piece of your story.

- The size of your discussion thread on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and the general bitching : discussion ratio. (I mean I still read Delve, but god the comment sections here lol)

- If I recognized you from discussion threads here for other authors. This sub is a kind of tip-of-the-iceberg place, rational fiction goes a lot deeper than this and there are some very intelligent writers who are not well promoted outside of this environment. Basically, convince me you're intelligent and competent.

- If there's a signal I see, either in an early chapter / discussion thread / whatever, that you actually kill off characters then that's a +1 for me. An author willing to kill an invested character in their story is a strength, unless they do it poorly.

Other people will have different criteria and I'm sure my criteria aren't universal to this sub, these are just a few things I look for in RR fics specifically. There are too many poorly plotted powertrip fantasies to sift through and they have learned to make themselves difficult to identify, like Defiance of the Fall turning into a wuxia meme around 30(?) chapters deep.

That said, I'm going to give a go at reading your story without any further prompting, mostly because I saw you earlier on RR's Trending or Popular list and you had over a 4.5 average review.

Your synopsis definitely *isn't* a turn on though, it reads too much like the generic power fantasies that infest RR. There's nothing to catch a reader looking for anything beyond that /in the synopsis/.

I understand that having a reputation on this sub and being recognizable goes a long way toward establishing that you actually understand the culture here. I find it unfortunate because I am mostly a lurker that is here to read interesting rational fiction. I've been here for years, but I have hardly any proof because I didn't even bother to make a reddit account for a long while.

Us lurkers are just screwed I guess. If I ever wanted to self-promote a rational fic here, I'd have to reference a lot of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] stuff just to "prove my credentials" so to speak.

****** I could have phrased that a bit better.

I wouldn't take it that far, I'm just suggesting that /if/ someone were active and known here, they would be well received. Basically a free pass... skip all the other qualifiers... kind of. I'd still expect people to be pretty critical.

Most of the people who would qualify for that well-known list, at least in my mind, are already well-written authors who just happen to reach out on this sub. Not just people who post here occasionally.

Alexander Wales, Nobody103, Yudkowsky. Whatever they pump out next is going to get a good run here, even if it's not strictly rational.

I don't think anyone should care about 'proving credentials' outside of proving a capability of writing intelligently. I might be wrong, but to ask otherwise just seems a bit circle-jerkish to me. And if a newly minted author were active here, their writing would be a known quantity, to some extent. You haven't, I haven't, a lot of people haven't, so it isn't known. You're improving that reputation of competent writing just by responding to these comments.

You do you, write well and coherently, and even if this sub bitches about your work like they do Delve, well, that guy's making like $5k/mo. We don't matter all that much, the redditors here are just a small group of very critical and hard-to-please people looking for very specific niche fiction that is not well catered to.

****** Space after periods ought to be set using the same sort of formatting metadata as line height, font size, margins, or justification. Set within a CSS class or text style so that, unless overridden, it's defined in a single location for the entire story; maybe even presented to the user as an advanced display option.

Repeating the physical space character makes sense for physical typewriters, and monospace fonts, but not for web pages and word processor documents that already separate layout and styling.
