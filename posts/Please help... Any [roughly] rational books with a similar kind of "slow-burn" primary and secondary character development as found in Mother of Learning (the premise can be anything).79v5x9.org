** I assume that everyone subscribed to this sub has read Worm, but that fits perfectly.

I'd also say Vin's development in Mistborn is something like Zorian's: gaining new powers and developing her cognitive and social capabilities at the same time. Mistborn itself is probably not +rational+ rationalist, but as with all Sanderson the magic system is very rule-based and super fun to read.

**** As much as I enjoyed it, /Mistborn/ is about as rational as a dog with Alzheimer's. Every single character in the first book takes a turn with the idiot ball, the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed, and the twist with the Lord Ruler is like one story-long version of "the butler did it". The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought their motivations. (Which main character? Both.) Vin in particular is replaced with a completely different character going by the same name in the middle portion of the story, and I don't buy the "character development" that takes her there. She comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture. The only thing rational about it is that the author doesn't treat the enemy like a total pushover. (By making the main characters too stupid to challenge him on even terms until Deus Ex Sazed)

I've only read the first book so far, but I don't see this getting better in the rest of the trilogy. Not that I won't, mind, just that calling the book "rational" couldn't be further off.

***** Every single character in the first book takes a turn with the idiot ball can you give an example?

the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed

It was foreshadowed a couple times. "he is the only one powerful enough to wear metal in him, and everyone else imitates his fashion". The multiple discoveries of new metallurgic arts, the attempt to genocide his people and keep his power a secret. It would have been an idiot ball if he left his power source laying aroung.

The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought their motivations. (Which main character? Both.)

No, seriously, which one? Kelsier, who is fighting a corrupt king not for his people, but out of petty revenge for his wife? Vin, who had no real reason to fight, except everyone she ever had treat her kindly was in the rebellion, and thus fought for her friends?

Lets put aside "i dont buy the character development"

he comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture.

Judging what is relavent a third of the way through a story is an interesting trick. Most if not all of that is relavent through the rest of the series.

****** So with the idiot ball thing, let's start with Vin. Vin spends the middle third of the book in this weird state of cognitive dissonance where she denies the crimes of the nobility she's come to see as normal, only to come to the sudden revelation that they were really slimy all along - except for Elend, who is probably the most nuanced noble in the entire first story (not that it says much). My first question is why? Why did she infiltrate the nobility instead of doing literally anything else? She's Mistborn, not to mention less experienced. If you need a girl that fits the bill of a country yokel in order play Valette, why use her instead of some other peasant off the streets that's better at acting (And less likely to FALL IN LOVE with a random member of the country's tyrannical ruling class. No matter how it turned out in the end, it still had the potential to go ass-backwards.) It's not like keeping an untrained Mistborn as your infiltrator makes her somehow more resistant to torture and capture. The way I see it Kelsier spends most of the book tying up a major combat asset in useless busywork. And why does Vin suddenly forget all of her trust issues in the middle of the story? I can understand her loosening up around Kelsier and co. after a little bit of time, but the nobles look and act the antithesis of her personal philosophy, at least until she slips into her "mask". It feels to me like Sanderson just wrote that in because in stories people who are exposed to power get corrupted by it, so it's only obvious that Vin would /completely ignore/ her impoverished roots. And to rub things in, the only thing of any import Vin learned is that House Venture was responsible for those special mines. To make things worse, Vin doesn't make use of this information in a tactical way at all!

Kelsier time. Any plan that results in your own Martyrdom is idiotic by default, because there are literally a million other ways things can go down. It's implied in the story that the reason he needed to do this is because the Lord Ruler has soother stations, but if they didn't expect the soother stations from the start they had to lack brain cells. How can you use a singular strategy for recruitment and propaganda and then /not anticipate/ your vastly overequipped enemy has been doing the same thing only with better resources and more reinforcements? For a more concrete example of the Idiot Ball, the moment when he puppeteers that soldier in the cavern is top tier stupidity. There's a fine line between a morale boost and inflating your own ego, and that crossed it. He acknowledges it was a mistake later, but that doesn't really matter, because in a piece of rational fiction the main character doesn't make the first mistake that would raise dramatic tension, they make the third or fourth. Another piece of stupidity is forming the army at all - it's a huge long shot and he knows it. But it's not even a moderately successful long shot. The soldiers help out exactly zero times in the story, but distract from more fruitful endeavors like destabilizing the Noble Houses and hitting high priority targets.

There's more, but you get the point. I haven't even gotten into the meta-stupid stuff, that is to say the dumb ideas that only worked because the Lord Ruler's system was inefficient in some unexplained way. But let's get to the elephant in the room: the deus ex machina at the end. This is less important than the others in the book because I understand it's elaborated upon later. I wasn't talking about the metal piercings - that part was clever. I was talking about the fact that Vin "draws on the mist" in order to gain the power necessary to exploit that weakness. As far as I know that had no precedent or explanation in the first book.

The reason I didn't elaborate in my first post is that there's so much to get into, and I'm never going to talk about it all unless I write a dedicated review, and that review would probably be longer than the book itself. Just trust me when I say I've barely scratched the surface.

******* Just one thing regarding the deus ex machina drawing in mist thing, I think it works better when you read the whole trilogy as one continuous story. How and why that happened out of the blue all of a sudden serves as mystery for the second book and a critical part of the resolution of the last book. It itself serves as the introduction of that ability, to prevent a deus ex machina in the overarching story. Brandon has a habit of building stories on a larger scale like that, and while it's not an excuse for a first time reader or for anyone who ends up not getting hooked and reading on, but it's possible you'd feel differently about it when you know the full context.

This also sort of applies to Kelsier in the grand scheme of things, and that's all I'm going to say about that.

That all being said, as far as deus ex machinas go, this one was fairly mild. Vin already put together all the clues together and found the solution. The mystery was solved. All she needed was that extra push of power to actually pull it off.

******* Vin works with the nobles, because a large part of his plan is setting Vin up as part of the new ruling class.

So, recon work is irrational? Or is recon work where you dont find anything irrational?

but if they didn't expect the soother stations from the start they had to lack brain cells. How can you use a singular strategy for recruitment and propaganda and then not anticipate your vastly overequipped enemy has been doing the same thing only with better resources and more reinforcements?

I dont remember ever hearing that they were surprised, they were planning on that all along.

Killing a king doesnt make you king, it makes whomever has the largest army king, after the fighting is done. The second book

For a more concrete example of the Idiot Ball, the moment when he puppeteers that soldier in the cavern is top tier stupidity. There's a fine line between a morale boost and inflating your own ego, and that crossed it. He acknowledges it was a mistake later, but that doesn't really matter, because in a piece of rational fiction the main character doesn't make the first mistake that would raise dramatic tension, they make the third or fourth.

You are saying that middle of a fight, he should act with perfect forthought at all times? When watching an ally getting stabbed, when you have a magic power to stop it, stopping it is perfectly rational. He had very little time to stop and consider.

and inflating your own ego is perfectly within reason when your longstanding motivation is to set yourself up as the martyr that spurs your people into action.

from the sound of it I think the problem you are having is that everyone isn't perfectly acting in their best interests

I will admit that drawing on the mists would be a horrible thing if it actually happened at the end of the story and not the end of the first third.

***** I hesitate to believe you can make converts with long-winded lectures, but-'

The mist power she draws on at the end of the first book is not adequately foreshadowed for a stand-alone. Mist is described mystically, and The Lord Ruler's abilities are partially indicated but perhaps not as tantalisingly as they could have been.

But viewing the trilogy as a single work, the foreshadowing and partial construction step by step create a fairly large number of climaxes. The final battle, and the Superman-esque abilities whipped out for the first time rub me the wrong way in large part because those powers we're somewhat rational based upon the power rules, but the people able to use those powers are immediately withdrawn from the world basically bt the word of God.

If you establish self-consistent magic, and have your main characters eventually abuse it to the fullest extent, you shouldn't immediately remove that potential at the conclusion, in the sequel series.

It's rationalist, not just rational, so character actions and growth really have to make sense.

**** It's xianxia, so no. Xianxia characters tend to have a "might makes right" philosophy, xianxia antagonists tend to be two-dimensional, and xianxia protagonists can generally be spotted by A) some bloodline or artifact that allows them to gain power at a higher-than-normal rate (often being mistaken for a once-in-a-millennium genius), and B) nobody giving the protagonist any face, which is used as a justification for the protag to kick ass and not feel bad about it (see the previous point about "might makes right".)

It can be entertaining, but it's very much the literary equivalent of junk food.

It's even got romance, of a sort. I think it's 95 chapters in that the main POV character and the deuteragonist formally begin a 'dating period.'
