  With a thought, Rain pulled his training dialog forward. Before he could even read it, he let out a strangled yelp. His body felt as if it was about to burst like an overripe berry. No sooner had the pressure appeared than it vanished, leaving Rain gasping for breath. An icy shiver ran down his spine as if he'd been dunked into freezing water.

  ...

  Was that from the excess experience? I was at the cap when I went to bed, but in theory, Essence Well should have gotten me some stupidly big number. At least 170k...

  ...

  Yeah, I am totally going to do that again, aren't I?

We can guess (for Doylist reasons if nothing else) that he'll raise his cap in a novel way soonish.

But he's done a bunch of novel things lately that /could/ be the key. Feeding mana to slimes, making his interface do tricks, pushing past various flavours of soulstrain.

This is one more for the pile. We don't know enough about the true underlying system to predict which one will pay off. "Gaining so much XP that the level cap breaks" makes a certain kind of sense, but only if the system is sort of a physical object rather than an algorithm.

I kinda hate that this has paid extra chapters. I can't not feel that people are throwing this kind of stuff based on the future knowledge instead of actually just guessing.

I feel I can't participate in the discussions without being spoiled, because I'm at a disadvantage.

I understand that the writer wants to be paid, and I have thrown some coins with Patreon to some things myself.

My Patreon doesn't even work right now. :( Failed to pay last month for no apparent reason and they haven't answered my questions...

***** I'm not a Patreon reader and am guessing purely based on what's publicly available, for what it's worth.

Rain has been stuck at the level cap for many chapters, which is unusual for a litRPG, with only minor stat improvements to tide progression-fantasy fans over. This can't last. But Rain is not at all on track to visit a higher-level dungeon in the near future. And part of the appeal of the fic is seeing Rain defy the setting's conventions and baffle everyone. Thus, Doylist guess.

****** I've seen people talking about it before a lot, so I'd guess your guess has more to do with the discussion where people seem to be too sure of that stuff, than the source material.

Now, of course I could be wrong and it does not happen. But if he will end up leveling soon in a weird way, I will stop reading any discussions of stories that has patreon chapters if I don't pay myself.

Rain could advance in many ways. He can make powerful friends. He can learn to use the artifact that makes the dome, which I'd bet is exactly what is going to happen. He can learn other stuff and he can get political power by helping Velika. Not all power is straight up leveling. He can get items, and he can learn to use these things he just found.

There are not many times he could get a huge powerup from leveling. There is the silver, gold, platinum. IF the story is not short, and it seems to have a lot of stuff, other stuff has to happen too. He doesn't even need to get to the top tiers necessarily for a good story imo.

**** He has had a really easy way to gain XP almost the entire story so far: it is how he has unlocked viewing rights on all the possible tier 1, 2, and 3 skills.

Every time so far he has always made sure to spend the experience without "wasting" too much by staying capped. Him getting "multiple levels worth" of xp /while at the cap/ is a totally new thing

Yes, what we know /so far/ indicates that the only way to raise your cap is to kill an essence monster. But that still begs the question: how do essence monsters raise their level/level cap?

This is the first time ever he got a shitload of experience while also at cap.

of course /all of this is pure speculation/ right now, but think about how Delve has been written so far, it generally follows a loop where:

Rain experiences the physical reality of Magic effecting the world, and then later figures out what happened.

** An interesting bit of lore. Apparently there are three (presumably) Platinums still in the world.

- Warden Vatreece - Mentalist
- Potentate Fecht of the Adamant Empire
- High King Kev, the ruler of Ter'karmark

It also makes it seem like Gold+ are somewhat rarer than I had thought. So far all the non-DKE/Empire Gold rankers we've seen belonged to a single party, and that it's not like World of Warcraft or something where you can just find a pickup group for a gold ranked essence monster if you're strong enough (although, the DKE /sorta/ do that).

This also explains why Lavarro isn't gold rank. She's already in hot water with the watch, and now she's being abandoned by the guild. If getting gold rank is as much political as it is power, then of course she'd have trouble. I know that was a theory before but it seems virtually certain now.

*** Lavarro mentioned that whenever she fought her husband Halgrave, she always won over him, despite being just a silver compared to his gold. She also stated that Halgrave is a bit too soft, which is why he lost to Westbridge as he tried to avoid damaging Fel Sadanis, which really handicapped him.

Lavarro brought the fight right to Westbridge's own city, and I think it was stated Westbridge cared for his city and citizens so he was avoiding collateral damage which likely handicapped him. From the conversation about the fight, Lavarro likely didn't care at all about that and just went wild, which provides a huge benefit to her. She's also a kinetic mage or something similar and I would imagine snapping someone's neck at a distance would be a bit difficult to defend against, along with the surprise element. I mean, I don't think any sane person would just roll up into a Citizen's city and kill them and a bunch of other people.

Honestly though, I didn't expect Westbridge to die like that either, he was shown to have both experience and power, but I guess Lavarro is stronger than what her silver plate might suggest.

Also, I fully predict that people will start making predictions that Westbridge faked his death in a variety of ways. With Lavarro's help to fool the DKE, with the DKE's help to fool Lavarro and the Watch, all by himself to fool everyone, with the Empire's help to fool the DKE, and so on....

This is the problem, though. The big dudes are already those who ginded their whole lives basically and also got lucky in terms of abilities and all. They also know their shit, having done that their whole lives.

The newbie MC needs something extra to beat that. Here he was lucky to get the build that lets him get most xp AND learn the language and stuff, AND he was very lucky getting that blue monster. Luck, luck, luck. There is no way someone from another world could just outgrind those big dudes.

Of course there is. Most RPGs have it easier to level up at the start and harder later on. Delve has that as a major setting element.

And if there isn't, then the writer has done badly. Creating a system where there is no way for the protagonist to catch up, then bypassing the entire system, is far worse than creating a system where the protagonist can catch up.

The only way to defeat Sauron is to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom. The only way to defeat a high level opponent is to grind up until you reach it's level.

But this is not true at all. If it was, none of these guys would have levels, because they only get them by killing a monster that is higher level than they are.

But I'm not sure we are talking about the same thing here.

This system, and pretty much most systems, are those where the protagonist should not be able to catch up.

Rain is not where he is because he has been grinding. He is where he is because he got lucky as hell in many ways. He has been grinding quite little actually. Because he can afford it, because he somehow stumbled upon the optimal class for him.

To get to platinum, Rain would have to get lucky. It has nothing to do with grinding more than the other guys. It has everything to do with having the advantage to /not/ needing to grind as much as everyone else.

The chinese cultivation stories are a prime culprits with this and shows exactly what is wrong.

In their world, pretty much everyone is grinding all the time. Yet the MC somehow outgrinds them and finds all kinds of way to cultivate faster. Even though he started with knowing basically nothing, he keeps figuring out things these other cultivators never did with their history of thousands of years. Then he is killing gods in a year or two.

There's plenty of ways a lower level charachter should be able to beat a higher level opponent. Teamwork, builds designed to counter the opponent (something like water mages vs fire), etc.

But beating a level 20 at level 15 with an appropriate build, or just knowing how to use your build better than they do, makes sense. Beating a level 40 at level 15 does not. That should be absolute. If you're a team of highly optimised party of level 15 adventurers, and you find a level 40 warrior. Go out and grind. That kind of level gap should be an absolute limit. (If you want to say that in this system 35 levels is small, and you need 100 levels for a big gap that's fine too of course).

#+begin_quote
  This system, and pretty much most systems, are those where the protagonist should not be able to catch up.
#+end_quote

Why not? There's plenty of ways to grind up and catch someone ahead of you in a hypothetical litRPG system. The most obvious one is that the experience required to level grows faster than the rate of exp gain.

In Delve we can see that most of the gold-plates have, for one reason or another, stopped advancing. Halgrave retired to run a guild branch. The Citizens are all busy running their cities and don't go looking for ways to increase their cap. There is no way Rain's party that went into the dark-dungeon could defeat Halgrave in a fight, ever. Heck, he could probably stand there while they hit him with everything they've got and he wont even notice, his defences are that high.

But that party going off and searching for blues, raising their level until they are a threat to Halgrave. That is plausible. Especially since Rain the mana fount really gives an advantage. And they already have a silverplate to help the others raise their cap.

** Val is definitely in the Lair, right? He was unconscious at the start of the fight, and his body was probably dragged into a corner. Rain hasn't found his body. He probably woke up after the fight and went into the Lair, if only to get away from the corpses. He and Rain can then escape via the route Val took to get into the Lair without the guards spotting him (waterworks?).

I hope Rain figures out how to make and/or level up Essence monsters. Even if he can't make his own from scratch, if he can take an existing one, capture it, and boost its level with Essence Well and some of the Tel he conveniently got just before the dungeon run began, that would be plenty. I imagine each level requires mana/essence as well as Tel. Probably following the base system of fibonacci per level of Tel and mana. 100 and 1 Tel for level 1, 300 and 3 tel for level 2, etc. Maybe it resets at 25 and costs GranTel? That would prevent Rain from immediately being able to become a Platinum.
