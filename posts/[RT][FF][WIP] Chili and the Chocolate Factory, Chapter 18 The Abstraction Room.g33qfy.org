  Tide saw that Mr. Bucket had also stopped himself from decorating. The Abstraction Room was as barren as the Potato Room, with a one potato margin of error.

  "Children!" shouted Mr. Bucket. "Ignore the two potatoes on the floor! We are not here for them."

This work is a masterpiece of our time. I am in awe that of all the possible times I could have existed in this cosmos, I was so fortunate as to do so at the same time as this fic.

#+end_quote

The potato room had 1 potato and nothing else. A "one potato margin of error" means there might be one more potato, or one less potato, than the estimate.

This seems like a roundabout way of saying "zero potatoes", like so many other things in the story ("I am as far off the ground as something one meter above the ground!")

*** Mahuika does have a years-long headstart on /her/ power, but the requirement to focus only one thing prevents the ability to develop more than one psyker power. So if Tide is lucky enough, then she might have a favorable match up with mind reading against Mahuika's power.

I also hope that by specializing into /only/ Mahuika rather than the more vague and general subject of vaping, Tide's power will be more powerful due to being a more narrow domain.

  She smiled. "But I liked the attention. Mr. Bucket does too. I don't think he believes what he says. He might believe that he believes that, but he doesn't. He just wants to speak. The content doesn't matter."

The Omelas reference, man. And the fact the last child to be eliminated always seems to be in this room. Also, Bucket is probably lying about the stroke. This room clearly vinegarizes people and things.

(Vinegar is an essential component of pickle brine, too. Hmmm.)

** Considering how getting high on drugs can lead to out-of-body experiences where one views reality as false, a single world out of billions, viewing higher dimensions, or similar surreal experiences, I conclude that Mahuika gained the ability to be aware of being a character in a story.

She then capitalized on being a seemingly one-dimensional character to preserve the mystery surrounding her so that she would survive until the very end. After all, no character can die until they get a turn as the 'protagonist'. I'm basing that bit on Cleo in chapter 5 who died after we saw her spend time thinking and making wishes.

** This is probably the best fic I've ever read in terms of keeping me on the edge of my seat. I have no idea how its going to end. If all the children are secretly alive, or if even the winner gets killed after inheriting the factory. I can think of so many different endings.

Charlie is only giving up the factory because he wants to escape and do something else, but there must always be a chocolatier in the factory, and you can't end the curse until you pass it on.

All the children are secretly alive, and Charlie is offended that anyone thought otherwise. Or he reveals that everything horrible was a lie, this was all some fucked up test of character to see how they would handle a clearly evil demi-god.

Lee survived, and is gathering the other contestants plus the down room slaves for a revolution.

Tide unlocks psychic powers and banishes Mahuika to the shadow realm. Mahuika reveals that she has had psychic powers all along, and banishes Tide to the shadow realm.

Tide reads Mahuika's mind, realizes that she could never destroy her for moral reasons, and surrenders.

Tide realizes that psychic powers aren't real, she just went insane after a year with only Mahuika and two potatoes for company.

The story just ends right here, chapter 19 is never published.

I would care about each of these endings in a different way. I'm looking forward to seeing what the ending actually is.
