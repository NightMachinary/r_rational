** I like to think the Dead King treats his Revenants like some people treat rare cards in a card game.

Cat comes to negotiate with him after the whole escapade ends and he's like "You killed Thief of Stars? WHAT?! She's a super rare Hero! You only get one every five crusades, it took me over a thousand years to complete my stealth set!"

*** I would love it if that were the case, Cat and the Unspoken Horror could have a deal set up where Cat gets on Goods good side by giving heroes an 'in' to killing him... where in reality she's getting less pressure on her while also letting him grow his collection.

**** I think The Pilgrim would see right through that honestly with help from Above. And with Procer pulling their shenanigans to move around the peace agreements between Cat and Rozalla(sp), it won't really what happens because The Pilgrim and Saint of Swords will now full swing at Cat to take her down.

Just my opinion on how those "negotiations" would go.

*** It wouldn't be uncharacteristic for Cat to extort the Dead King a bit in exchange for getting his Revenants back. Dead king overlooks the whole arson thing and gets back the Thief of Stars and the Spellbalde's Spellblade. Dead King gets a laugh and Cat get off scot free.

** Oh, it's /good/ to see another fight scene. Cat finally coming to terms with her lack of humanity is a joy to see, also, this fight really puts into perspective how scary the bard is.

Cat is about as strong as a lowercase god right now, assuming she doesn't sandbag, right? One undead (and thus not at peak performance) elf can cheat enough to fight her off. The bard easily scared off two hale elves. Fuck.

*** We're three chapters into what's likely to be a six-chapter arc, and given that Akua's the one who supposedly made this plan in the first place, I believe we're about to see it unfold only to be derailed, so at least "Neshamah's plan" is a good bet.

*** u/Tallergeese:

  Needless to say the last thing Cat wants right now is drifting even farther from humanity.
#+end_quote

Sounds like Catherine needs to get laid pretty bad. Seriously, she hasn't had a relationship in forever. It'd be a frankly horrible idea with any of Akua (is she even corporeal enough for that?), Thief, or Archer, but I'm still kind of astonished that no one's brought this up as a potential salve for her withering humanity. A monster saving or regaining their humanity by falling in love with a human is definitely a powerful story trope.

I could see Hakram pointing this out in his blunt, matter of fact way or Archer pointing it out while being playfully flirtatious and then having one of her moments of sincerity when Cat doesn't take her seriously. Cat's certainly still horny enough, ogling literally every female she comes across.

(Also, Cat is getting more comfortable with shape-shifting her body, so that opens up some, uh, interesting possibilities. Even with Thief. I suppose that would run counter to the goal of staying in touch with her humanity though.)

also remember that this is a revenant, which are less powerful than their living versions. the spellblade probably has more power in elven society
