** Exciting!

I don't really get why he isn't a nigh unbeatable warrior. If his command allows him to learn easier then why isn't his fighting style perfected to 'snatch arrow out of air' level? Or were his tribe so against him due to his physique that nobody cared to teach him?

*** Learn interprets his Command in a way that doesn't give him any fighting capacities, so he's actually quite weak compared to other Orcs.

**** That makes sense( and also makes things more interesting) though it does somewhat contradict his last sentence in the new chapter. Or was it just an overtstatement?

***** He wants to learn everything, not spend all his time learning specifically about fighting - he's apparently supernaturally good at learning, for an orc, but only learning. I'd assume Maim or Smash or whatever would give you massively enhanced physical abilities on top of being just naturally good at fighting, while Learn has to, well, learn it, and while he likes fighting he wants to learn other things too, doubly so since however good he gets at fighting he will presumably never compete with a 'real' orcish Command.

** Story so far seems very interesting, but not very rational. But that could still come, the world building using commands seems fun. Hopefully we will see more of him learning, i like storys where characters learn and not only fight= )
