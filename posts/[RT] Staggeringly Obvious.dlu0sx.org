**** It doesn't appear in the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/SecretIdentity][list of ways]] to play with the trope of Secret Identity.

The closest trope is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityImpersonator][Identity Impersonator]] where you have a body double in the same room as you to 'disprove' yourself as the hero. In your story, it's simply a never ending case of a "failed" Identity Impersonator which I have never seen being done anywhere else.

Thanks for the story. It was pleasure to read such a novel twist.

**** I don't recall an exact case offhand, but for something related, there is Helmuth, of the Lensman series, who "speaks for Boskone" but the rank and file have never encountered actual Boskone, and the protagonist becomes convinced that Boskone is a fiction and it's all just Helmuth. The council of Boskone totally exists, they're just operating from another galaxy.

** This is delightful, and reminds me of the classic “Captain Gars” trope (the name of King Gustav of Sweden's alter ego, which was just an acronym of his initials) where the obvious alter ego is just maintained as a sort of “polite fiction.”

/Everyone/ knows who the alter ego is. Everyone pretends anyway, because refusing to go along with this lunacy wouldn't benefit them one bit. You'd just be making a powerful enemy and going against the grain of everyone else. I love the idea of people involuntarily being forced to play along from the sheer social pressure alone.

*** No, look, what happens in the sequel is obvious.

/Clearly/ the 'Goose (who is Bruce) survived the shots because he's the 'Goose. Then there was a moment when the attention of the crowd is on the shooter. He couldn't have left to change undershirts without being noticed... but he is known to be able to move faster than the human eye can see.

So, clearly, what he did was to take a bit of metal from his pocket. A key, some coins... something along those lines. Using his well-known power of thermokinesis, the heated up the metal until it melted, and then spread it over his chest evenly as it applying superspeed sunscreen. Then he waited - just long enough for it to solidify - before getting up.

He opened his shirt, claiming that the thin (and unmarked) sheet of metal was a bulletproof undershirt; and since the metal was moulded to his Masculine Mongoosely physique, it /looked/ exactly like a slightly stretched undershirt; though, of course, it wouldn't actually stop a bullet.

And then he left, before anyone could closely inspect the 'undershirt'...

**** I don't know why people are getting all conspiracy theory about this.

It's ridiculous - take away the colors and the flair and suddenly most people can't even recognize the supersuit that they've seen a hundred times before.

The Goose's suit has got to be one of the most advanced garments known to man - obviously he's going to want to wear something similar when he goes out as Bruce. And obviously he'll go with a copy of it that is tasteful and subdued and appropriate to wear under Mr. Kent's formalwear.

Mask Twitter has been all over this. If the logic of it all doesn't have you convinced yet, then go look up the thread comparing images of the "damage" that MM's suit took when he got rocked by the Piper with the pictures of Bruce's new "bullet wounds". Same suit, different color.

***** The suit? No, the suit of the 'Goose is just ordinary spandex. Besides, Bruce, being the 'Goose, won't wear that in his civilian guise because that would be proof that Bruce /is/ the 'Goose and while other's lips may be loose, Bruce the 'Goose is very public in his denials of being the 'Goose.

It only looks like a super-suit because it's attached to the skin of the 'Goose. Besides, Mask Twitter is probably in breach of a dozen cases of unmasking supers, and the only reason they're not prosecuted is because none of them have any sort of decent proof.

We already saw what Bruce has to say about his super undershirt and he went with the "we happen to have the same tailor" defense. No one bought it for a second, but you know the drill - Bruce's denials don't have to be at all convincing, it just has to be impossible for any of us to pin things down definitively.

But you still haven't explained why the 'Goose would take the potentially unmasking risk of wearing a version of his supersuit under his clothes. I mean, what possible benefit does it give that's worth the potential risk of proving his identity? It /can't/ be comfort; the 'Goose may be immune to chafing, but he can surely find at least equally comfortable civilian clothes. And the 'Goose doesn't need bulletproof undershirts.

******** Maybe we hang out on different parts of Twitter? I'm thinking of folks like @MasklessGeek.

One advantage of wearing a piece of the ol' supersuit while out of costume is that the suit is useful. No need to rehash the whole powers vs. tech debate, I hope I can just say that the Mongoose with tech is in at least a slightly better position than the Mongoose without tech. Can we leave it at that? If something comes up while he's out of costume he's got to be more comfortable having a bit of his gear. I'm not saying I would've been able to call it before we saw it, but considering how much effort he must've put into his costume it shouldn't be a huge surprise that he prefers to wear something like it even when he's out of costume.

And the other advantage which we just saw is that it gives him (semi-)plausible deniability. It is decidedly not "proof" of his identity, just another in a long line of hints; everyone (correctly) sees the Smart Guy's gambit as a failure despite revealing Bruce's "bulletproof undershirt." I don't know if the Masculine Mongoose envisioned this exact sort of gunman scenario (though he easily could have, what with all the death threats surrounding him), but he must've figured that if he had to pull something while he was out of costume, it sure would be convenient to be able to pin it on tech rather than powers.

********* I don't actually hang out on Twitter much at all, but wasn't there that one guy who got struck by lightning just after he posted what he insisted was the Weathermaster's real identity? I seem to recall that there was quite a lot of noise about that.

And sure, the Suit is useful when the Mongoose is on the job. I won't deny that (though I'm still not sure there is any actual tech in the Suit at all). But - well, let's talk analogy for a moment. Let's say there's a professional runner. When he's running, he wears running shoes, lightweight vest, etc. And this costume is pretty good for running in. But does he wear any of this costume when he is, let's say, giving a speech at a charity event?

No. No, he does not.

Similarly, the 'Goose no doubt has made sure that his Suit is exactly what he needs when in a standoff with the Weathermaster or something. But I explicitly /don't/ agree that that makes him in any way more likely to wear the Suit in his civilian identity.

In fact, I find it hard to imagine anyone, in any job that requires particular clothing, who would continue to wear said clothing on his off hours.

And it does /not/ give him semi-plausible deniability. If anything, it strengthens the case for Bruce being the 'Goose - not that that needed strengthening in the first place.

If the hero were Bruce Wayne, or Tony Stark, or Oliver Queen, on the other hand, and was just a badass normal with some high-tech toys, then this ploy would carry a much higher risk of backfiring, because assassinating the "millionaire playboy" would seem to be a workable way of ridding yourself of the hero.

#+end_quote

They don't. The Wards are explicitly forbidden from going into situations more dangerous than the PRT thinks they can reasonably deal with. They're used primarily for patrol and PR events, with supervision. It's only in a shithole like Brockton Bay that they actually see real violence on a regular basis, and it's only when the world is literally ending that they're put on the actual front lines of a conflict. Besides which, the costumes' showiness or lack thereof is kind of immaterial in the kinds of conflicts capes get into. Only for the extremely street-level capes, like the protagonist, are the costumes made to be camouflaged and combat-practical, and for most capes use of camouflage is rendered rather pointless by their powers. It's either redundant or completely blown the second they employ their powers.

#+begin_quote
  'Oh, I'm clockblocker, I can stop time with my hands.' - Try and stop a hail from a machine gun.
#+end_quote

Clockblocker could stop time for objects touching anywhere near his skin, not just using his hands. He was capable of freezing entire clouds of insects swarming his body, all simultaneously. It didn't really help him in that case, but a machine gun probably /wouldn't/ be able to harm him if he was on his guard. Likewise, Browbeat has his telekinetic shield and healing ability, Aegis has redundant biology, Gallant and Kid Win have Tinker-built armor, Vista can curve bullets, and Shadow Stalker can become insubstantial. Not that the Wards would be sent into a situation where a machine gun was even in play in the first place; the Wards were never used against Coil's gun-wielding mercenaries, for example. That's not to say a human with a gun is useless in the setting; Miss Militia's one of the better heroes in the city and her power is essentially just “guns, but with unlimited ammo.” Likewise, Coil's aforementioned mercenaries acquit themselves rather well, but people with guns are by no means an excessively dominant or insurmountable force in the setting, for mostly sound reasons.

#+begin_quote
  The 'super code' for another? Why would villains even bother with that nonsense.
#+end_quote

The “Unwritten Rules” are a thin veneer that binds the weak and not the powerful. It's discarded the second it's no longer advantageous to use as a cudgel. Coil, for example, outed the entire white supremacist gang, root and branch, when it behooved him to do so. A random street-level cape can't get away with being too rough, going after civilian identities, or going too far with rape or murder, lest the other parahuman villains and heroes gang up against them, but established powerful capes like Oni Lee, Hookwolf, and Lung can rape and murder all they want, because everyone else already wants to stop them anyway, but simply aren't strong enough to.

Justifications for superheroes are silly. Superheroes are silly.

You can have your superhero stories, they're fine, and occasionally entertaining. I like worm.

But I need to suspend my disbelief that the world would somehow devolve into groups of people in garish costumes that would fight in the streets in the open like that.

I need to suspend disbelief that a teen who fights for his life against criminals (you know what those people do, right?) would still accept to be treated like a regular highschooler. People get emancipated for less in the real world.

I need to suspend my disbelief that criminals would give up their anonymity - their biggest advantage, bar none - for 'reasons.'

I need to suspend my disbelief why wouldn't the government just clamp down on these para-military organizations with people that can level cities - or allow them to form in the first place - rather than creating a special police unit, at least.

There is a reason why the state is the monopoly of violence.

But every time this gets brought up, including rational, people come out of the woodwork to defend this genre tripe.

****** Not saying it's rational overall, but in My Hero Academia heroes are adults (well, the protagonists are teenagers but they're in school, do the occasional internship, and it's just generally accepted that in order to get good you need to start training early, like we do now for sports, so a bit of danger is par for the course) and they're basically private contractors that work next to the government. It's suggested that at least part of the reason why they exist is that, well, superhero fiction existed in this world and thus as soon as powers started appearing vigilantism sprung up. Then it was brought under control after some very messy years and the current status quo is a bit of a compromise. Still, powers are regulated and registered and can't be used without a governmental license, at least in Japan. There's almost no secret identities, heroes are more like celebrities, with the exception of All Might who has a secret that goes beyond just being a hero (his power is transferable). We haven't seen any example of villains attacking heroes at home, but they /have/ attacked UA school, and the school itself has security measures to try and prevent that. It helps that powers are relatively limited, there's generally no city or planet busters just going around willy-nilly (well, arguably, in the manga Tomura might be one now). A bullet is a bullet and will still kill most villains. Plus multiple teachers at school are also pro heroes.

I think that overall makes more or less sense. The existence of heroes is a compromise between the fact that superpowers exist, some are combat oriented, and they're very useful to apprehend superpowered criminals, and a bit of show business thrown in which makes these figures much flashier than they need to be. There's a lot of stress on public image and the rhetoric surrounding heroes. All Might was "the Symbol of Peace" and his disappearance has literally caused such widespread social turmoil it has come with its own surge in crime. Heroes, in this picture, are charismatic figures, not just average law enforcers.

  Not saying it's rational overall, but in My Hero Academia heroes are adults (well, the protagonists are teenagers but they're in school, do the occasional internship, and it's just generally accepted that in order to get good you need to start training early, like we do now for sports,

Man, I grew out of manga years ago - but let me say this: One dude creates blackholes. The girl makes anything out of her skin. And the best humanity does is... sponsored police force?

It's not rational. It's not realistic. It's fun, but can't be used as justification.

******** As I said, I think the justification for the existence of superheroes makes sense. Other aspects of the manga aren't rational at all. For starters, these are squishy humans fighting superpowered battles. They'd be dead at their first clash.

And you're right, those powers are ridiculously OP and munchkinable with some serious thought. There's some mention of using powers for work purposes - though you still need a license. I think Ochako (the girl who makes stuff weightless by touching it) mentions wanting to help with her parents' construction company, and Yaoyorozu (the one who makes stuff out of her skin) says something about there being rules to prevent people like her from breaking the economy - which implies they HAVE thought about her powers, they've just come to the extremely stupid decision that she should not use them for fear of depreciating the goods she'd make. I premised that I didn't think the work as a whole was rational.

But "growing out of manga" seems a pretty weird thing to say. There's manga of all degrees of maturity. Ever read anything by Naoki Urasawa? Or Inio Asano?

No it doesn't. As history shows us, if someone is stronger than the government, they become the government. If in japan there is an association with a guy who can make a black hole wherever he likes, he is the fucking absolute ruler of the nation, wether he overtly wants to or not. If a 'contractor' group is the government's army, they're the government, man. It's silly.

Superheroes are dumb, dumb, dumb. There are millions of better ways to apply super powered police/army sans the lack of uniform (which exists for a reason, really). Child soldiers school slice of life isn't it.

We don't know what happened. It's strongly hinted that there was a time of anarchy when Quirks first arose - and that the current peace is what emerged from then.

Sure, black hole guy is powerful. But this is not a world in which superpowers are uncommon. Like, 80% and counting of the population has a superpower, though not all powers are useful. And powers don't make you invulnerable by a long shot. If the really strong are a minority, they still wouldn't manage to overcome the vast majority that can simply shoot them.

There's a few broken powers that kinda violate that rule. Black hole dude depending on what his body is actually like, portal black cloud dude, Endeavour and Todoroki are no joke either... but a lot of them have pretty silly and limited powers. People like the girl with earbud jacks attached to her body, or Iida who can run really fast, or the guy who gets somewhat stronger by eating sugar. Those aren't world-breaking powers. If everyone was more like them it'd be easier to buy that their world does indeed make sense.

And the association which holds them all is the government. That's my point.

Isn't that basically what it is anyway? I mean, them being private simply means they have some degree of autonomy. But they're still tied to the government. We haven't seen much of MHA's politics (perhaps a bit too touchy a topic to go into in a WSJ series). But I mean, come on, whoever All Might said "this candidate is my man" of would have won ALL the elections ever.

That said, yeah, superheroes are kinda dumb, or at least they are if they're the major use of powers in a setting. I could imagine someone using their powers for fighting, and even wanting to be considered more special than the regular police forces, but they would be immersed in a society in which powers play a much larger scale transformative role.

************* But that is what I said. I can enjoy a series with super heroes, I just prefer they don't try to justify it because it's a pretty sad state of affairs. The justifications tend to be silly - because superheroes are a silly state of affairs.

**** Probably most of the more reasonable villains as well. Keeping such a code benefits every villain who wants to have a civilian life or who has people to protect.

*** Depends on what the Goose's powers and defences are. If the Goose is like Superman, then little point in a surprise attack other than making him even angrier at you. If he's more like Batman, maybe, but also depends on how many defences Kent has. He's supposed to be a millionaire so you'll expect his house to be a fortress (in fact it's necessary to keep up the fiction; it would make him more suspicious as a potential Goose, which is exactly what the real one wants).

Of course, in general, in a rational world, any superhero at all who's not some kind of abso-fucking-lutely invulnerable would simply die in action way before the villains get the chance to start pondering other attack strategies.

** Fantastic story idea, can't remember that I've ever seen it done before. Buuuut, I'm going to be that person. The conversation with the girl sounds very unpolished, to the point where it doesn't seem realistic (especially the girl's lines). I think if you went back for another pass you could make that scene clearer and heighten the tension as well.
