** A very numbers and mechanics chapter, setting some more limits on the benefits of accolades.

Rain's being a little harsh on himself in the first half of the chapter, what with taking on like four melee-specialist characters in melee while handicapping himself with not using his primary spellset, and then being disappointed at how much they're kicking him around.

And tinfoil hats really are good protection from mind-control rays. Wonder if aluminium's strength in that regard will come up at all with there being a major player with mind control powers running around. Maybe a long way down the line.

I haven't read it(and won't), but based on what you said he's actually being an imbecile. Some perceptions are natural to be colored by one's emotions and ego, can't avoid it without experience. Others are a sure sign of low intelligence and bad reasoning skills.

The author doesn't seem to know the difference, which makes his portrayal of Rain into a caricature.

***** This chapter wasn't really to my taste -- it was essentially just a math discussion at heart -- but I think it's the opposite of your critique. It showed Rain working hard to prepare for a dangerous situation, being smart about figuring out the rules of his new world, and finding a powerful exploit in those rules as well as important implications of them that will affect his actions going forward.

Getting frustrated with a story is fine, but in the end its completely free content with no obligation on you to read it. Going to the extent of wanting to remove it from the sub is the height of entitlement IMO, and mods encouraging that is like exact opposite of the job description.

I think that's a standard that few works aim for, and Delve isn't one of them. Teaching about the utility of ‘0' doesn't meet it.

Rationalist fictions, along with being rational, try to teach the readers (and characters) rational modes of thinking. From the wiki,

  * Teaching rationality
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: teaching-rationality
    :END:
  Rationalist stories make a deliberate effort to reward the reader's thinking, and teach him to get better at it. Characters are explicitly using and teaching others rationalist techniques, and showing the practical thinking processes which can be applied by readers.

  We can see characters being smart, not just be told that they are smart. They think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. The character's "brilliance" is conferred not by mutation or native brilliance alone, but follows from the explicit rules of thought, which readers are intended to pick up from the story and use in real life.

********** Sure, and I wouldn't call Delve Rationalist, but that is one Characteristic out of the ~6 there, delve at least attempts at:

World with sane and consistent rules

Realistic motivations

Intelligence (In the MC)

Deconstruction (If you can count gaming the system as deconstruction)

Topics (Rationalist stories tend to be about science, technology, transhumanism, futurism, or artificial intelligence.) - which Delve is more about this than 95% of stories.

Again, I wouldn't call it Rationalist, but it hits those points more than 99% (or at the very least 95%) of other fiction out there, so definitely would include it in the sub on these grounds even if it doesn't fully qualify.

*** I don't get why this story in particular would get removed, is there a meta reason for it?

Like, it's not the best high art out there, but it's competent enough, and way closer to being rational than some of the fanfic that gets shared here. So I assume there's some weird fandom issue in the background?

**** I think it's because of disappointment. Delve used to be quite popular here, little more than a year ago you'd be hard pressed to see people complaining it shouldn't be in the sub, even though it wasn't universally liked. The simple reason being that those who didn't like it wouldn't read it and that was that. But then the quality declined, some of the people who liked it before, now hate it and argue that's it's not even rational to begin with and shouldn't be here.

Delve didn't loose the characteristics that make it rational, there's still a lot of time spent on analyzing things, reasoning and justifying actions, even when people make mistakes, it's in character, not something that can only be attributed to an idiot ball. The story has many other failings however, the glacial pacing being the worst in my opinion, the MC's personality isn't very appealing to many people (the constant memes and idioms that no one else understands are very grating imo) and overall the characterization has always been the weakest part of the story. Add to that the fact that since he has been capped for a long time, the exploration of the system, a part that I imagine many people here find very interesting, has taken a back seat to other things like the mystical mumbo jumbo of fixing his soul.

So overall I think what's happened is that people got frustrated that something they liked declined in quality and “got bad”. Some might even have been patrons at some point which probably adds to the frustration.

ps: obviously that's just my opinion based on external observation and I'm no expert on what each person is thinking, but I don't think I'm too far off, considering the level of “hate” some people have demonstrated in the past threads, not to mention the whole report to get the thread removed thing.

**** I can't speak for anyone but myself. But if I were attempt to guess ... mods remove it because they are tired of all the drama and mod reports and sneers from both sides, which together with Delve being routinely downvoted to 60% eventually became enough to overcome their natural desire not to gatekeep.

Users like myself don't like it because we've been burned by having read it long enough for disgust at the memes and zero-velocity pace to become so great that animosity was born. And then the "You just want numbers-go-up (because you have poor taste!)" smears from within these comment threads extends that animosity to a subset of the people who post in these threads.

[I guess I should add also that I think I'm not alone in viewing Delve as far off-topic for this sub and downvote it the same I would downvote, e.g., Power Ranges television discussion in this sub.]

I'm probably leaving out important viewpoints and portions of the dynamics, but that's what I think of when I consider what's going on.

***** That's like expelling the bullied kid from school because half the year is bullying them.

Frustration aside, it is an attempt (whether successful or not) at rational fiction, that is worth more than 50% of what is normally posted here and exactly what the sub is for.

Delve is 100% free and given to you with no obligation. If you don't like it don't read it, and especially don't try and bully it off a platform it belongs where at least half the people like it.

Personally though I actually LIKE the criticisms people write on these threads, and would rather have them here then not.

See, I can't possibly imagine how anybody could say that. What's this 50% of things posted to [[/r/rational]], say out of the first 25 on [[/r/rational]]'s front-page right now, that Delve is ‘worth more than'?

Quite a few of us /don't/ feel that Delve is "exactly what the sub is for", and I begin to think that perhaps the mismatch here is that you and Delve's proponents have a /very/ different idea of what the sub is for than I do.

******* So in the 25 most recent posts I see about new chapters:

The daily grind

Pith

Animorphs

WtC

New humans

dear spellbook

Hermine and the silent country

Out of those, the only ones which are without a doubt better quality than delve is Pith, Animorphs, WtC and Hermine, while the ones which are more rationalist (again, whether it succeeds/does it well or not is irrelevant) is Animorphs, Wtc and Hermine.So yeah, about half those are just as good or more off-topic than Delve.

And "quite a few of us" don't like some of the other works mentioned above, and the mature ones "of us" don't try and remove posts about them because they don't like something about the story.

Instead they just ignore them, or post a comment if the criticism is particularly interesting or would like to share their opinion.
