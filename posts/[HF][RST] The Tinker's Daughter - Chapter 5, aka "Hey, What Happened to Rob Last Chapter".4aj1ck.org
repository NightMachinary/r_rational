**** Yeah, and in hindsight, you clearly said the head was the mana reservoir, and somewhere else you said mana is stored in water, so I should've put two and two together.

** Yes, last chapter was a cliffhanger. Here's the answer. Bonus points if you spotted the setup in the previous chapter.

** How did Rob get the battery into his head? How did he do it WITHOUT letting all the water out?

*** His head opens at the top. Think 'fishtank'. He popped the lid and dropped the battery in, then sealed up again. It happened immediately after the flash from the rogue mana that temporarily blinded the audience -- basically, he saw an opportunity and took it.

**** Why? I mean how much mana did the battery have in comparison to the mana he needs?

Also, the 'Previous Chapter' link is sending me to the third chapter instead of the fourth chapter.

Great job with the writing today!

Rob's power supply is mana-infused water. That's the standard power source for most magic items, since water is easily obtained, non-toxic, easy to move around, and has a decent thaumic capacity. Lead, on the other hand, has about 11 times the capacity on a volume basis. The battery was partially expended but it still held enough charge to make it worth grabbing, especially since Rob was starting to run /really/ low.

Oops! Fixed, thanks.

I'm more emotionally attached to Rob than I should be, stupid awesome AIs, you shouldn't make me almost tear up every time!

*** Yeah, it wasn't due until next Monday, but I did an early drop.

I'm glad you like Rob, and that you're tearing up; shows I've been writing effectively.
