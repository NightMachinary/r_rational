*Synopsis*

/A thousand-year-old rogue cultivator is ascending when he finds out that he is not wanted or liked up there. He thus gets bitchslapped through the cosmos until he lands in a dark section of the multiverse. He then wakes up in a valley, watching cute critters murder each other and trying not to freak out about how bad it smells there. Stripped of his entire cultivation base, he proceeds to do whatever he likes./

** Is this good? I was put off by the tone in the first chapter or so. The protagonist seems intolerable.

*** It's magic system is literally magic, it's barely rational. And yes, the tone/main character is pretty consistent
