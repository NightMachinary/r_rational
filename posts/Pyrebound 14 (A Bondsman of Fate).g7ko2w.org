I won't even get into all the hassles that got in the way for the last three weeks. Sorry for being late. From now on, I'll look to post updates as I finish and become satisfied with them. This may or may not coincide with Sundays.

Thanks for your patience. I'm really honored by your continued support through all this.

** This was really great. The revelation at the end made actually made me, well, hopeful. There's been enough death in this series that it was time for life to make an appearance.

**** Well, thank you for writing this. I love the setting. Something about the primitive river valley civilization with magic sprinkled in just does it for me.
