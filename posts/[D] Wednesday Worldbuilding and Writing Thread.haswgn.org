Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Here are some ideas I've been kicking around lately without much development other than contemplating them and writing down extremely rough drafts. If there are existing stories with similar premises I'd love to read them.

- Prehistoric societies dealing with cosmic horrors through eminently prehistoric intuition, cooperation, reverence and cunning rather than the modern sophistication, manipulation, disgust, and analysis which is more typical of the cosmic horror genre. It'd follow them step-by-step and detailing how the relationship progresses over the course of individual lives as well as generations.

- A superintelligent entity is reincarnated as a stray cat in Manhattan 1991, retaining a great deal of their cognitive abilities and some of their memories. The story of how they attempted to conquer the universe or pursue whatever grand goal they set their mind to.

- An alternate history where an early Proto-Germanic culture gained their equivalent of a Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great and as successful as the both of them combined. Essentially a world whose philosophy and politics are largely influenced by this culture instead of Greco-Romans.

- The atmosphere of Warhammer 40k but much harder speculative fiction built from the ground up. There'll be some level of handwaveium for certain aspects, the majority of the hardness will come from the anthropological aspects. The scale of the universe will be much more consistent and the weaponry will be dealt with much more realistically. No more, "impressive" shots from soldiers that are relatively amateur marksmanship. No more, "massive" wars that are eclipsed by the Eastern front in World War II. Even more traditionalist, romantic, and hawkish in its ethos.

- Hard speculative biology, religious missionaries in the far future trying to evangelize to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][starfish aliens.]] Roughly as alien in almost every way as sac fungi are to mammals, except both are technically sapient beings with some notion of spirituality.

- Similar starfish aliens trying to evangelize their religion to humanity.

- A hard fiction story about a vigilante who is a kinesthetic genius. Going beyond just an extremely good tactile learner, being able to learn physical arts multitudes faster than most people.

Feel free to give your thoughts and/or to steal them for yourself. Any one of these would probably demand a lot of research and creativity to truly execute well.

*** *Superintelligent Cat* - This sounds like a great premise for a short comedy, but I don't think it'd work well for a longer or more serious work, since the protagonist is actively opposed to what makes the premise fun. Eventually they'll run out of problems caused by being a cat.

*Harder speculative fiction 40k* - This sounds super interesting and fun as a setting, but I think it'd run into the same problems I have with 40k: I'm more interested in reading about it as a setting than in reading stories set there, because it's full of people who suck that I don't want to read stories about. But obviously there are people who still enjoy that, I guess.

For any land-war focused space setting, I'd recommend avoiding interplanetary-capable starships entirely and instead using a Stargate style transportation method. It solves a ton of problems.

*Evangelizing to starfish aliens* - Speaker For The Dead does this, and I think there might be more if it later in the Ender's Game series, but I lost interest in it shortly into the next book.

*Being evangelized by starfish aliens* - This sounds like it has a lot of potential, especially if it's somewhat working.

*** 5) and 6) sound fascinating, and 3) has lots of potential. I've been on and off thinking of doing similar to 4), but for /Star Wars/, not /Warhammer 40,000/. For 5), there's /An Alien Agony/ by Harry Harrison that you might find relevant.

** *tl;dr how can I be more woke as a writer*

Writing question:

Current events have made me want to be a bit more diverse in my writing in all manner of ways. As a cishet white person, I'm kind of at a disadvantage in terms of that: like, I have 0 of the experience necessary to write a believable Sri Lankan diaspora character, and I know that writing narratives about Blackness or Gayness or Transness or whatever are basically not what I should be focusing on. I should be focusing on including "diverse characters" and using them as "normal" characters, and let people from those communities write their experiences in their own works. This is great for me as I don't have any particular interest in Sri Lankan customs, so wouldn't want to write a story that featured them heavily. But I could just have a character who "happened to be Sri Lankan", learn some basic stuff so I don't accidentally have her celebrate the wrong thing, and off to the races.

Does anyone have any sources (articles, etc) that they recommend for how to be more diverse, or "do activism", in your writing as a cishet white person? What should be avoided? What are good ideas? What are types of diversity I haven't even thought of that I probably should?

--------------

In that vein I'd like to leave this great resource I found for writing skin colour (which is also like the second result on google so easy to find again): [[https://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/96830966357/writing-with-color-description-guide-words-for]]

I recall [[/u/tk17studios]] describing Marco's skin as "penny-dark" in the recent A:tR update and that sort of thing can be really evocative and poetic. I know I struggled when I learned that using food terms (tea or coffee coloured etc) to describe peoples' skin is considered offensive by many, but this article helped me settle on new terms that performed the same description while offending nobody. I especially loved how this series really helped outline some of the beauty in skin colour: I think they say you can describe dark skin as "purple-black" and that's /beautiful/ and not weirdly loaded or sexist like "dark chocolate" is.

**** I assume you're talking about the food descriptions of skin colour? Or something else? And yeah, I think everything depends on everyone, know your audience and all that. But if there's a broad group of people who find something offensive, it doesn't matter that the feeling isn't universal. Especially when it's something as easy to avoid and unnecessary as certain type of descriptions.

*** Today I learned!

I haven't dived deep in the Writing With Colour yet, but I wonder if the same food-term embargo does or should apply to hair colour? My first guess is that hair colour isn't tied to racial identity the same way skin colour is, so it doesn't have the same fetishization baggage?

**** I would assume it does apply to hair colour, honestly. Just a blanket ban on "don't describe humans as looking like food". Hair is not independent of race, and in fact they often go together. That said, we do say "strawberry blonde" as a common term (the article I linked also says that "olive" is the only food that's acceptable to use to describe skin tone for much the same reason), and something like "honey blonde" also seems fine. But the article (or one of the deep FAQs) also says that if you want to describe a white character as having creamy skin or mayonnaise arms then go nuts, but that doesn't mean you can describe their black BFF as oreo-coloured. So there's probably a general "the dominant racial/cultural group in the context you're writing can be described with food". And why bother with saying "honey blonde" when you can say "safflower" or "golden" or "amber" and not touch it?

So yeah... that's what I really struggled with. I was like, "my food comparison is fine! it describes my colour accurately! why should I change it?" and then I realised that the difference between me using that food comparison to describe the colour and me using just normal adjectives was 0 in the story and some non-zero amount to the sort of people who get offended by colour comparisons.

Sidebar on wokeness: the biggest thing that article told me was not to write white as the default, which is something I was guilty of (just describing a white character as having black hair and brown eyes and expecting the reader to infer they're white) but plan to avoid in future.

Sidebar on hair: I wasn't aware but I have found out over the past ~5 years that hair is important racially/culturally, especially in the Black community. There's big cultural debates about straightening hair, how to wear it, etc. You read about white families who adopt black children needing to learn how to style "black hair" and find barbers that know this too. There's stories of black teenagers being given dress code violations for wearing their hair naturally (as in, no product at all in it, just brushed) because it looks too poofy. There's all the controversy about whether it's culturally appropriative for white people to have dreadlocks (because white hair just doesn't naturally form dreads the same way that black hair does).

So yeah... it's quite a deep rabbit hole, in the Black community at least. I'm sure other groups don't have quite as much hair focus (or, hell, maybe even more because I'm ignorant and haven't exactly looked at the importance of hair in Khmer culture)

** In case anyone's curious; as of this morning, my mid-year NaNoWriMo is up to 47,235 words of a first-draft. I started just three weeks ago, on the 28th, so I'd say I've got the words-per-day part of my writing habits firmly in place. :)

I'm reaching a point in the draft that I have little experience with, and is really giving my poor skills a stretch: trying to write a satisfying climax. But since my goal is just to write a complete novel, even if it's a terrible one, if I can't think of some good text to write... then I'll just write the best I can come up with, finish this, and then start trying to write the next thing, which will hopefully be slightly less terrible.

If you'd like to help beta-read the first draft before I declare it complete, this is probably your last chance to offer constructive criticism; I'll be happy to PM the link to the GDoc to anyone who asks.

*** It seems like your trying to create a utopia. I can see some ways that it wont be perfect (I feel like a lot of the aspects would be rife with corruption). But the biggest issue I have with it is that I cant see how the heck the country would form. Maybe it just because I just skimmed it but that's my feedback.

EDIT: I read a bit more deeply and feel the need to expand upon my point. I just don't understand how such a system would come to be. So lets start with the biggest problem I see, the military. All it is your story is a social welfare program that also teachs people to shoot guns. If this was iceland it would make sense because they don't have unstable neighbors. Venezuela is an oil rich country surrounded by places that have had military dictatorship semi-frequently. I bet that they would of at least have needed strong military in the past. That would probably would of extended into the modern-day.

**** The assumption in the doc is that you need a really popular, competent and benevolent dictator to come into power in order to set this government up which is why I specified that. That requires a significant amount of luck, especially given all the competing greedy would be dictators who want that oil money.

The military is supposed to have gradually devolved in significance because of both reliance on foreign allies and this Venezuela dwarfing its neighbors in population/economic size. Nations having an underfunded military because of reliance on foreign allies is already pretty common, so this was just a different idea for how that could happen.\\
Soldiers do still get combat training and are required to stay in fighting condition to the extent they are able to. So on paper the military would probably be the worlds largest, even if say its air force wasn't larger than its less populous neighbors (but made up of US planes).

** *Just finished a first draft of a novel... any advice on what to do next?*

At the end of last month, I started a mid-year NaNoWriMo thing, to start regaining some decent writing habits by writing a terrible novel. (The point being to get a novel written; if it's not quite as bad as all that, so much the better.) It's relatively hard SF, with relatively intelligent (if not necessarily completely rational) characters; if anyone wants to help with beta-reading, I can PM you a link to the GDoc.

I find myself in a novel (ahem) situation, now. I just finished up the first draft; there's still plenty of fixes, tweaks, and general touching-up I'll want to do before making it public. But as far back as I can recall, my previous attempts at writing have generally taken the approach of shoving the first draft out the door as soon as I finished typing it out; so I'm a bit inexperienced about what I should do next. Anyone have any advice? For example, would you recommend a thorough re-read to fix every last detail I notice needs improvement, or starting some other project, or just throwing the barn doors open for anyone to read and comment, or posting to RoyalRoad / FictionPress / FurAffinity / etc, or something else entirely...?
