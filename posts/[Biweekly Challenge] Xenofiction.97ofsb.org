[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/93wi0c/biweekly_challenge_uplift/][Last time]], the prompt was "Uplift". Our winner is [[/u/SamuelTailor]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/93wi0c/biweekly_challenge_uplift/e3o3bee/]["The Doomsday Race"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/SamuelTailor]]!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
This time, the challenge will be *Xenofiction*. Write a story told from the point of view of a non-human, and ideally, something non-human enough that the story couldn't be rewritten with humans in place of whatever variety of xeno you're going for. Starfish Aliens are probably a good place to start, if you're starved for ideas, but xenofiction is a wide field with lots to draw from. Alternately, check out [[http://willsull.net/resources/HumanUniversals.pdf][this link [PDF]]] of "human universals" and start removing or abstracting things until you get a society that's understandably non-human.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 29th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Conversion*. Conversion is the changing from one state to another, often religious in the past, but now used more frequently with respect to altering the format of a file. The metaphorical and/or rhetorical use for the word has overtaken the original one, so feel free to go in either direction with it. If you started writing something for the "Cults" challenge and never finished it, now might be a good time to dig that up and see whether it fits here.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/29*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/97oo2e/challenge_companion_xenofiction/][is available here]].

*** I really liked this one. It covered the viewpoint nicely, I could tell what was going on, the dramatic arc flowed well. The alient felt really alien too, not just a reskinned human or animal.

*** The least obvious thing to cry over that I've ever cried over. Mad respect.

Have you ever heard of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWH_9VRWn8Y&t=3s][these penguins]], who like to wander insanely? There's an important commonality here. Mutation, as it exists in systems of ideas. The precept corresponding to mutation. It invites us to risk our lives in pursuit of imagined frontiers that we can't yet see, frontiers that reasonable members of our species don't believe in. Usually it kills us, but sometimes it doesn't. So we each hurl ourselves towards our frontier, we're all pointed in different directions, but mutation is one of the three ingredients of evolution, every living thing carries some version of that same basic drive.
