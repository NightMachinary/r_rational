** Please note that chapter 72 was changed to have completely new content. I would suggest rereading that first, although the order doesn't really matter.

** I really, really hope they're doing an alignment check prior to putting people through FLEA and POPE - it would just suck if they accidentally created a whole horde of evil folk with the standard set of magic items.

They've made a whole host of things that make it very very difficult for people to die, and it would thus be at least moderately difficult to stop/kill an evil person who got upgraded.

Then again, a Helm of Opposite Alignment Engine stationed near the Detect Evil Engine would work - you can always choose to fail a save.

** Ring of Heal Every round cost: 6 (Spell level) * 11 (caster level) * 2000 gp (for use activated magic item) = 132,000 gp.

Belt of +6 to all stats: 6^{2} (ability bonus squared) * 1000 gp (cost for ability bonus) * ( 1 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) (six different abilities to boost) = 135,000 gp.

They're already nearing the 200k gp limit for non-epic magic items. If they want more power they'll have to make more restrictions, such as making them only work for Good characters (30% cheaper) or something else.

** I am just going to assume that they have some big signs up about not putting a Portable Hole in a Bag of Holding or vice versa ...

That said, I'm a huge fan of vignettes, and enjoyed both those chapters quite a bit. I'd be quite pleased if Book II was more like an extended epilogue.

*** Bag of Holding / Portable Hole: Yep. Actually, I think they're just recalling all Bags of Holding, destroying them, and replacing them with as many Handy Haversacks as the owner wants for them. You can put a PH in a HH, and you can nest HH's in each other -- they are strictly better than a BoH.

I'm glad you like the vignettes / extended epilogue structure. I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to play out.

**** Its not just bags of holding, they better recall all belts of many pockets and similar items that are called out to work like a bag of holding. Bags of holding really suck anyway with the whole "contents are lost forever" bit the instant you exceed their weight capacity/rupture them.

I am so glad that the bit about handy haversack [[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Frg%2F20051101a][here]] is just an officially suggested houserule and not raw

***** No, it's just bags of holding.

Bag of holding rule: "If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. "

Portable Hole wording: "f a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process. "

There's nothing in there that says "a bag of holding /or anything that works like it/" They call it out by name, and it's only that exact combination that has a problem.

And because I've had this argument before: this is how I read the rules, this is how it is in 2YE. If you disagree with this reading, fine. It doesn't change how it works in 2YE.

** Hmm. Judging by her past actions, Suze was probably good or neutral. Capturing and torturing someone is an objectively evil act, by RAW. (So is creating and commanding undead.) She's risking her alignment here, but maybe that's /what usually happens/ to gods of death.

Calvin does deserve a comeuppance. To be tortured by a god seems a bit /excessive/, and unworthy of her. Which, in the end, is why we don't torture people - they might or might not deserve it, but the consequences /to us/ are not worth it.

*** Suze is Neutral Good and yes, torturing someone is not typical for her. Then again, she's 19 and she was just handed virtually limitless power. More specifically, she was handed the power of /Death/...gods are shaped by their portfolio (i.e., by the beliefs of their worshippers), and most people's view of Death is not a positive one.

She's got a tough row to hoe if she wants to hold on to her alignment.

**** Did Neklos' worshippers start affecting Suze when she took his portfolio? Or would they actually have to start worshipping Suze to affect her?

Hoping it is the latter so she has time to set up her dogma and get the good aligned worshipers going before the massive influence starts rolling in.

**** I think we are seing the intresting question between torture and dispensing cruel and unusual punishment as a duty. Part of Suzie's portfolio is to send people to hell, and like most "gods" to judge mortals. She's more enthusiastic torturing the poor rapist, but I doubt it's an evil act until she realizes that it's torture, but that's just my 2cp.

*** RAW is actually pretty unclear on undead being strictly evil or not. Some parts of the rules treat it as such while others say it is completely neutral. Not all undead spells have the [evil] tag and there are good undead. Some of the rules treat negative energy as inherently evil while others treat it as just another form of energy. etc, it is not super consistent since it was written by people who held different views and assumptions on the default morality of stuff. It ends up in DM territory to decide.

Torture on the other hand....
