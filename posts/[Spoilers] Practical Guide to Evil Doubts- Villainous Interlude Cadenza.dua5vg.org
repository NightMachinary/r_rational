I have some doubts pertaining to the chapter Villainous Interlude Cadenza.

I need answers for the following

1. Detail explanation of the ritual to kill Captain. I did not understand the relation between the height of the location of kills and the actual spell itself.

2. Who casted the ritual? Bard? Procer?

3. What was Tyrant's involvement in this? Only the taunt?

4. Did Assassin kill the mages casting the ritual?

5. What was the motive behind killing Captain at this particular juncture of the story?


** 1: Magical reasons that aren't really explained. The spell somehow relates to/utilizes the surrounding topography, which is why the height matters.

2 and 3: The ritual was by Helikean mages, i.e. the Tyrant ordered a bunch of mages to do it.

4: Yes.

1. Read and find out.

*** Thank you for answering this.

I was thinking Procer was behind the ritual since they were the only ones that could influence the caravan routes thereby creating the blood spill in the required locations. If this was indeed Tyrant's work, how did he accomplish the changing caravan routes? The caravans were sent from Procer to Nicae.

Also I have another post about doubt in pgte. Would appreciate if you could have a look at it.

**** The Tyrant influenced events in Procer through agents and stuff like that, most likely.

*** If you grew up in India and spoke Indian English (which really is a distinct dialect of the language), 'doubt' would be used interchangeably with 'question' or 'specific point of uncertainty'. The latter especially in the context of seeking clarification, such as: "I have a doubt, Ma'am."

** Thoughts on 1., the height: for myself at the moment (also remembering poorly) I'm unsure what the height-related ritual should have done, and whether it itself was a smokescreen to blind the Black Knight to the real intention (the story effect of Captain being the one carrying out the killings). However, whether the ritual itself was relevant or not, here was the relevance of height as I understood it:

Normally there might be a handful of deaths or diggings or actions that make no sense to you, but then you get to see it all from a bird's-eye view (on a map or on a flying carpet or similar) and you realise "Ah! It all makes a crucial pattern!".

Here, it's a spell formula: normally, if you have these things taking place at the right points relative to each other in reality as seen when projecting them on a 2D plane with the z-axis (height) flattened, their relative positionings allow a certain effect to be had (even if one position is higher than another). The twist here is that instead of flattening the height direction, you're flattening a different direction, so that if you look at the points from the right position to the side (far away) you can see how they make a certain pattern that you would normally expect to see from a bird's-eye view. Think of how constellations can look very different from a different star's planet, if far away enough from the star's planet you're comparing the view to.

*** This chapter doesn't talk about story as a weapon except /briefly/ mentioning narrative structure as one of Bard's potential restrictions.

It is possible that the idea of tricking your opponents into a story that ends with their death was introduced later in the serial; Black doesn't explicitly consider narrative based attacks here, though.

**** Yes, Black's learning about the story-as-a-weapon aspect of it was in Calamity III. I however do not remember if we ever learn what the height-based spell ritual was seemingly intended to target. "A killing stroke?" “Offensive in nature, at the very least,”--but I have no memory of what came of that magically, only of the hidden narrative effect.

***** The height based ritual was implemented by Tyrant (1) and killed its target (2). However, the Warlock usurped the ritual and aimed it at the Ashen Priestess instead of the Champion (3)

1:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, this is a projection of the illusion that would be formed if this formula was empowered.” Warlock tapped the table once, and spell light glowed softly. In front of them, a hand was rotating in the air. Only the middle finger was raised. “This is the Tyrant's play, then,” the green-eyed man murmured. “That as good as confirms it.”
#+end_quote

2:

#+begin_quote
  “You're right,” Wekesa admitted. “If you look at the pattern using the height they were killed at instead of the location, I can recognize the shape.” “How many do they need?” he asked. “Assuming I'm correct and the first killing was a decoy, four more,” his old friend said. “Nine in total,” Amadeus said. “Thrice three. A killing stroke?” “Offensive in nature, at the very least,” Warlock said. “We stop shy of what they need?”
#+end_quote

3:

#+begin_quote
  A single strand of hair was placed in the centre of the runic circle, and the curse meant to kill Captain found another target. Usurpation was, after all, the essence of sorcery. After it was done, Wekesa complimented the ritual. It was, apparently, not derivative of Praesi work in the slightest though it had been designed under the shared Trismegistan theory of magic. Behind the tall walls of Nicae, the Ashen Priestess died screaming.
