I just learned of this community, so I may be misunderstanding, but after reading the description, the first thing that came to mind were Neal Stephenson novels, in which the narrator and characters discuss and contemplate problem solving, categorizing, analyzing, and philosophizing about the natural, social, and technological worlds.

Am I off-base, or am I beating a horse that was dead before I got here?

Thanks and sorry if this post is inappropriate for the sub. I didn't bother lurking first; sometimes that's a problem.


** Maybe in some of his earlier works, particularly the Diamond Age, he was fairly successful at presenting rational characters in a well-designed world.

More recently, Stephenson fakes "rational" characters by putting anachronistic 20th/21st century people into past or future contexts. That was kind of the whole schtick of the Baroque cycle, I forget where I dropped that one mid-book because I couldn't deal wit the Swiss Family Robinson-ness of it all. But SevenEves was kind of the bottom for me. The first part was entertaining Kerbal Space Program fanfic, but everything after the landing in the gap was completely plot driven impossible fantasy.

There is no way any of the groups of "survivors" would have survived.

- Thermodynamics would doom the Earthbound groups (for example, you can't extract power from geothermal sources when the atmosphere is as hot as the upper mantle).
- And the lunar colony? There is no way they could have bootstrapped to the point of building new chips for their magic robots with seven people, none of whom have the background knowledge, and an already declining stock of robots.

And then the new society, thousands of years in the future, is basically 2000s Earth, except with a financial center in probably the most dangerous location in their society, but somehow nobody has thought of colonizing the rest of the solar system outside cislunar space. Perhaps the genetic engineering broke something in them, and froze them in a perpetual New England.

*** Nitpick: geothermal power requires a temperature gradient which is typically achieved because it's hotter down deeper but it doesn't need to be this way. If the surface were thousands or hundreds of degrees, you could make power by pumping that heat into comparatively cooler depths. After all, unless you're living near a volcanically active zone or near a fault-line or something, you actually need to dig quite deep before it gets hot

Right now I'm listening to brandon sanderson a rhythm of war, which isn't great and follows a pretty terrible book, and I'm fuming because this dude cut the legs out from underneath a perfectly good story. Like half of each of these books are flashbacks, and he could have just opened the series earlier, led us through these characters lives and built some empathy for them, and instead he kills half of them in the first book then makes us sit through the slice of life stuff for characters that are already dead.

*** I think you're being too harsh on Seveneves. Addressing your main gripes in particular:

1. The survival of the people on the surface I don't remember enough to comment, but I do recall thinking that the survival of Dinah's relatives was an extreme stretch. I don't recall them saying that they used geothermal, however, and the very existence of the submarine people indicate that not all water on Earth got boiled away either. That they could survive the hellscape deep in the Marianas trench implies that even if 99% of the oceans were boiled away, somewhere there are still locations where temperatures were survivable and usable.
2. I can confidently state that you missed the point with the lunar colony. They didn't bootstrap themselves back in one generation with only seven people, none of which who have the background. They survived and multiplied with the old stockpiles of material for generations before they were able to bootstrap anything back up. Seven people didn't bootstrap their civilization back. Seven people bred more people who bred more people and did all the bare minimum things needed to survive before they got back to where they got to. It was five thousand years after all!

It also makes damn sense that their culture ended up echoing the modern world once again, because they were in the extremely unique position of recovering from a fall where *all the records of the past civilization, especially media and science, were available to them in digital format*. We can't rebuild the civilization of Stonehenge because we don't know how the people of Stonehenge lived; by contrast, these people literally had to survive off our records and our media for countless generations. Even then, you can notice how it's not at all identical; there are plenty of subtle differences and a few glaringly obvious ones like actual races.

Finally, yes, it is a plot point in the last half of the book that their genetic engineering really did break something human in each of them. Each of the new races were caricaturized because the allied races knew they could depend on each other to make up for the other's oversight or weaknesses.

​

I don't believe the last third of Seveneves was at all an example of good writing (actually it was pretty atrocious), but as worldbuilding and ideas? I think you missed many points.

**** I don't believe in the survival of the submariners either, but they were so unlikely there's no point mentioning them.

The lunar colony simply could not have survived a century let alone millennia. It would be unlikely for them to survive until the first generation could take over.

They're starting with basically our level of technology, with no resupply, and hardly any supplies. There is simply no room in the convoy for generations. They're trying to use precision laboratory equipment for bulk production. The breakdown rate will be horrendous.

***** For the first generations, they actually have a considerable proportion of the supply meant for over a thousand people from the other habs which broke down. They even addressed food, whereby the ISS-icehab combo managed to preserve the vast majority of its stored food supply. Similarly, they do have basic fabrication, oxygenation, and food production, from the algae farms amongst other things. The most plausible fate normally would have been a slow, agonizing death for the colony as they run into a lack of A or B and slowly wither away, but survival isn't provably impossible. They domed over the ravine early on, giving future, less capable generations time to follow routine and do the basic minimum needed to expand and survive.

Taking several steps back, however, some of your declarations are simply hyperbole. We know they have oxygen production (I recall they had an immense supply of scrubbers, amongst other things), and they have packaged food meant to sustain hundreds of people for years if not decades (the other half of the convoy was the one that ran out and fell into cannibalism). Split amongst the seven of them, this changes things. They don't have minimal supplies. They have minimal supplies for one thousand people. They have all the supplies and then some for just seven.

The 'unlikely to survive until the first generation can take over' screams is only true when we consider that they are stuck living in zero G. This first generation need merely eat packaged food and crap around and do nothing to live out their natural lives, and even the next generation can do much of the same.

My point is, you missed almost all the details and points with the lunar colony, and are portraying its survival in an unfair light. It's not necessarily plausible long-term, but short term? 10-30 years? We have a very different story. Chances are, your negativity towards that part of the story blinded you from even looking for the details the author put in which made such survival not impossible. Even if it remains implausible.

******* Of which they have even more stockpiled. As they mentioned time and time again, they originally sent up enough of the core chips to last a colony of a thousand for virtually centuries; these chips are amongst the few things that would not get eaten up by the descent into cannibalism either, and can be trivially salvaged if need be (although I recall virtually all of them were stored in the ISS anyways). In fact, this is one of those things which is valuable enough and lightweight enough for them to have sent them up in absurd bulk quantities, which they explicitly did, and then went out of their way to jealously guard from radiation.

The author thought about this. Half the book was spent dealing with this exact problem. It was one of the reasons they needed the ISS and the asteroid so much; why there was a schism in the first place.

I find it plausible that by the time they actually run out of relevant electronics, they'd have enough warm bodies to misuse in their place instead.

Their robotics, especially as of the future society state, are absurdly advanced though. They explicitly say that their future society is less advanced in integrated circuits, but more advanced in robotics somehow. I don't think that computes.

*** I really enjoyed Anathem. The fact that it was a YA novel strapped to the side of a Spec Fic novel enhanced my enjoyment rather than took away from it.

It was pretty much a throwaway line, but I found the Technie Sammann's dialogue on "Bogons" to be very insightful and applicable to the modern internet and disinformation.

#+begin_quote
  “Early in the Reticulum---thousands of years ago---it became almost useless because it was cluttered with faulty, obsolete, or downright misleading information,” Sammann said.

  “Crap, you once called it,” I reminded him.

  “Yes---a technical term. So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.”

  “What is good crap?” Arsibalt asked in a politely incredulous tone.

  “Well, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It's a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors---swapping one name for another, say. But it didn't really take off until the military got interested.”

  “As a tactic for planting misinformation in the enemy's reticules, you mean,” Osa said. “This I know about. You are referring to the Artificial Inanity programs of the mid--First Millennium A.R.”

  “Exactly!” Sammann said. “Artificial Inanity systems of enormous sophistication and power were built for exactly the purpose Fraa Osa has mentioned. In no time at all, the praxis leaked to the commercial sector and spread to the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies. Never mind. The point is that there was a sort of Dark Age on the Reticulum that lasted until my Ita forerunners were able to bring matters in hand.”

  “So, are Artificial Inanity systems still active in the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies?” asked Arsibalt, utterly fascinated.

  “The ROBE evolved into something totally different early in the Second Millennium,” Sammann said dismissively.

  “What did it evolve into?” Jesry asked.

  “No one is sure,” Sammann said. “We only get hints when it finds ways to physically instantiate itself, which, fortunately, does not happen that often. But we digress. The functionality of Artificial Inanity still exists. You might say that those Ita who brought the Ret out of the Dark Age could only defeat it by co-opting it. So, to make a long story short, for every legitimate document floating around on the Reticulum, there are hundreds or thousands of bogus versions---bogons, as we call them.”

  “The only way to preserve the integrity of the defenses is to subject them to unceasing assault,” Osa said, and any idiot could guess he was quoting some old Vale aphorism.

  “Yes,” Sammann said, “and it works so well that, most of the time, the users of the Reticulum don't know it's there. Just as you are not aware of the millions of germs trying and failing to attack your body every moment of every day. However, the recent events, and the stresses posed by the Antiswarm, appear to have introduced the low-level bug that I spoke of.”

** I'd say (conditionally) yes:

- Stephenson frequently writes highly intelligent characters and does it well (arguably his greatest strength next to prose). That's not to say they never make mistakes or never make irrational decisions, but those decisions and mistakes they make are in line with the character, so it makes sense
- Stephenson's worldbuilding is thought out and the implications of the fictional elements are considered in a wider scope.
- There are very few instances where I can point to a decision a character makes and say "this happened because of plot purposes, not character motivation"

While I wouldn't call Stephenson a "rationalist" author first, he definitely embodies many "rational" principles in his writing.

** Hell no. I've read a fair amount of Neal Stephenson and while there are some entertaining aspects, there are some infuriating ones.He's got generally good ideas then just blows them to shreds. Read Cryptonomicon and Anathem then stop there.

Fall; or, Dodge in Hell (kind of sequel to Reamde) had a couple great elements, but 3/4 was just so boring. I would have read a whole book about the road trip through Red country and the Purdah system, but instead all those trees wasted.

Most fiction relies on zero or one weird things (aka coincidences) to happen to be entertaining. The more you get than one, the more it's clearly the author putting his thumb on the scale. Oh, random droid escape with the plans to the great weapon just seconds ahead of the evil lord? OK, cool story. Oh, those droid are salvaged by the hidden son of the evil lord on this random planet? That's a stretch. Oh, those droids were built by the evil lord when he was a child? Oh, that son was never found by his evil lord father despite having the same last name and living with his immediate relatives? For fuck's sake, that doesn't make any sense.

SevenEves was just absurd...They never address who destroyed the moon. If it was a highly unlikely random event, ok, weird coincidence that that happens now when the world has just enough capacity to survive. Then Part Three of Seveneves made me throw up in my mouth. The evolution was dumb of all three groups was just dumb. That they remembered each other's ancestors from 5,000 years ago? GTFO.

Reamde was pretty dumb. Oh, you do some shady stuff and get wrapped up in a Russian mob's mission to find the hackers? Ok, cool reason for a story. Oh, your mission to find the evil hackers means you choose a random door that accidentally results in you attacking Muslim terrorists? Dumb plot turns galore.

I don't think the Seed is Finkle-McGraw's idea. It's presented, in-universe, as being the Celestial Kingdom's hypothetical counterpart to the Feed. It shows up in the Primer because that's what Hackworth is working with among the Dreamers.

The Primer isn't a "dangerous and untested form of nanotechnology." It's a storybook. One with an agenda, which can intelligently and reactively change its plot, and which is acted out by actual people, but a book.

The Primer is the *only* way that Miranda can stay in touch with the girl she's been raising as a daughter for years. Carl isn't really much of a character in Nell's story, so I don't know why you're bringing him up. Constable Moore, you maybe have a point about (especially given that he's part of the Dovetail community).

I'm not going to dispute your characterizations of X and Fang, because I can't remember them all that well.

  Are you talking about the Primer, or the Seed?
#+end_quote

I'm talking about the Seed, yeah. Finkle-McGraw sends Hackworth to help the Dreamers develop it, and seemingly sets up Nell to help see it released into the wider world. But in the same briefing where Hackworth gets sent off, the intelligence goons are all very certain that the Seed is going to give everyone access to nanotech weapons and worse. This makes me say that Finkle-McGraw's plan is, at best, needlessly reckless with countless lives.

#+begin_quote
  If you think that Nell was raised by a book, I think you missed the point.
#+end_quote

The content of Nell's education was decided by the book. Miranda provided the voice and the emotional character to the Primer's rearing of her, which is itself very important. But that doesn't change the fact that Nell thinks she's being raised by a book, and that the book's actual lessons are based around a years-long quest in which Princess Nell outwits and overcomes a series of malevolent authority figures. It's definitely teaching her to be subversive, but it is a very naive sort of subversive that doesn't understand the value of central coordination. It leaves her with a seemingly pathological inability to reach out to authority figures, even benevolent ones.

#+begin_quote
  The wellbeing of your children is a hell of a motivator.
#+end_quote

I'm not objecting to Hackworth wanting to steal a copy of the Primer. That part was totally plausible to me. I'm objecting to a man who we are supposed to take as one of the better nanotech engineers in his phyle being totally unaware of the nanotech-based law enforcement tools which result in him getting caught pretty much immediately after stealing the book. The aerostats weren't even a secret - random children knew enough about how the system worked to successfully subvert it. It is deeply weird that he got caught like that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Consider the scene where Nell stabs her pedophile stepfather. Miranda is horrified that Nell was molested (good! she should be!), but seemingly fails to notice that the Primer has been neglecting to teach Nell about Stranger Danger in favour of encouraging her toward martial arts training and half-baked ambush attempts. This ties back into the thing where the Primer keeps hammering home the point that adults are not to be trusted. Even in situations where Nell should absolutely be trying to find a trustworthy adult, the Primer doubles down and forces a small child to attack a grown man with known violent tendencies and three to four times her body weight. Nobody comments on this.

****** Great, now I actually have to pick up my copy and find out the specifics of what you're talking about.

#+begin_quote
  Finkle-McGraw sends Hackworth to help the Dreamers develop it
#+end_quote

I'm not doing a thorough re-read, but from skimming through various Hackworth chapters, I'm *pretty* sure that's Dr. X.

#+begin_quote
  seemingly sets up Nell to help see it released into the wider world
#+end_quote

I think that Hackworth did that under his own initiative (he is, after all, the King Coyote in Nell's Primer); having solved the problem, he had to entrust it to someone, and he didn't want to give it to Dr. X, who had commissioned it from him, so he hid it in the Primer as the Book of the Seed in King Coyote's library.

Which, yeah, that's a questionable choice, but given that Dr. X said that the Celestial Kingdom would figure out the secret in another decade or so, I'm reminded of some people's belief that the only/best way to prevent an unfriendly AI from coming into existence is for a friendly AI to happen first. If someone is going to have that technology, shouldn't it be someone trustworthy?

Again, I'm not exactly sure how Hackworth determined Nell would be a trustworthy person to hold that secret, so YMMV as to how rational that is.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't know; she doesn't seem to have an issue reaching out to Miss Matheson or Constable Moore. A blind *trust* of authority figures would seem to be an even worse idea than a blind *distrust* of them.

#+end_quote

He didn't. The mites were flushed out of his system by the immune system of the New Atlantis Clave; that's as far as they could track him. He got caught because he had his name written on the inside of his hat. Which suggests to me that he didn't expect to be accosted (and if he hadn't been, he wouldn't have been tagged by the mites, either: the assault is what triggered the aerostats to release the mites).

Although I'll concede that criming while wearing monogrammed clothing, especially that which can be easily lost, is its own brand of stupid.

You keep going back to this as an example of how the book failed her, but I just don't see it. She lives in a lawless part of town, with a neglectful mother and her series of abusive boyfriends. To what authority should it be directing her? When her father died, the authorities said the following about Nell:

#+begin_quote
  "Who will save her?" Miss Pao said. "We have the power to punish; we are not given the power to raise children."
#+end_quote

The authorities are not willing to take her away from her mother, and her mother is not willing to stop bringing home abusive boyfriends. What other escape was there for her? What adults were around for her to trust?

Yes, I'm willing to admit that having a girl result to violent self-defense and escape was a less-than-ideal solution to abuse. But, given where she lived, who she lived with, and the authorities' unwillingness to protect her, I'm not really seeing a better one.

When she actually gets to a place with trustworthy adults (again, Moore and Matheson), the Primer doesn't seem to in any way direct her away from them.

** Only having read Seveneves, tentatively no, not really. I found Seveneves to be great as a [Science] fiction novel, in the sense that countless little bits of scientific phenomena are brought up and are actually grippingly plot-relevant (ex. painful death by radiation sickness and how to somewhat survive it, comet mass sacrifice, delta-v considerations, etc.), but few of the characters explore the depth of thought normally seen in rational fiction, and at times there were definitely railroads of sorts (ex. everything to do with Julia's evil behavior).

Rational fiction, as far as I've read it, is very much focused on the personal experience of each character and their thought processes. Seveneves doesn't do it very much justice, and when it does it's usually focused on the powerful emotional moments, much like traditional literary fiction rather than the gripping thought processes of rational fiction. Which is also why it's a crying shame that Neal's writing in Seveneves is terribly bland. His ideas in the book were amazing, many scenes were poignant and poetic to the point of bringing me to tears, but most of the characters were cardboard and it feels almost like Orion's Arm in how great ideas are horribly restrained by mediocre writing.

Edit: Let's analyze it with the definition:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  - This is partially true. Some characters do this, and do it very well. But there doesn't feel like there's a focus on this - the focus is on the overarching epic of humanity's struggle for survival, and our incredible ability to both come together and accept our fate... and fall apart and ruin each other. It does this to some degree, but not at all in the way rational fiction tends to do it.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  - If anyone can really explain Julia/the American president for me, then please do so. As a background character, and a hard woman making hard decisions, nuking Venezuela made sense. In the last half of the book, however, she became mostly an unrepentant monster, and a caricature of politicians in general. Overall, I'd say that the book fails to convey this point very well.

- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  - First half, getting off Earth and Earth's end: Yes. Ish. This can be disputed; I think the poetry of humanity's civilized end may be clouding my judgement.
  - Middle part, civil war in all but name: God no.
  - Finale with the future society: Not in the slightest.

- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  - On character's thinking - some characters yes, mostly no.
  - Improving their reasoning abilities: Not in the slightest.
  - So not rationalist.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  - It's conveyed terribly, but overall it is reasonable worldbuilding, if not necessarily the most plausible outcome.
