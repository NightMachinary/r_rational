** The concept of the Nantek is incredible.

A species that's only sapient for one part of its life cycle, and treats those not currently sapient as tools and beasts of burden.

** Got some /incredibly/ high tier original worldbuilding going on here. The creating mythology post was just as interesting as the sentient species one, IMO. I just wish that more of this lore had been used in the actual MoL story.

** u/DerSaidin:
#+begin_quote
  Though largely impotent, the restrictions placed by the gods could not be made perfect, and the heart of the world dragon rages endlessly against her bounds.
#+end_quote

Is "impotent" the intended word here? Seems like the opposite word would fit the rest of the sentence better [[/u/nobody103]]

*** The dragon was made largely impotent. The restrictions were good enough to make the dragon largely impotent but not perfect.

**** Ah, I first read it as the restrictions were impotent.

e.g.

  Though largely effective, the restrictions placed by the gods could not be made perfect...

** This guy's worldbuilding is incredible, but I worry that by publishing it like this he won't feel free to recycle the ideas into his next actual novel (provided it doesn't take place in the same world)
