Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Uplift Society Club:

Some of its members are summoned across the multiverse to uplift less sophisticated society than their own because they are the most well suited heroes.

This causes a panic back on Earth and a media firestorm.

Meanwhile, the summoned heroes across the multiverse works to uplift civilizations of different stride.

Then, they finally come back, with whole new tech and magic, even.

Not sure what to do with this, so I am just throwing it out for consideration.

*** I think it would be an interesting launching pad for commentary on contentious sociopolitical issues like colonialism, globalism, cultural appropriation, etc.

The Uplift Society Club is doing basically the opposite of what the Prime Directive says to do, and the Prime Directive is at least popular enough that it's not consistently mocked as being the worst part of Star Trek. That's an interesting conflict, since it appears to be Good vs. Good.

*** I would read it.

Partially because of my excessive love for uplift fiction, but it does sound cool. Interactions between the club members comparing and contrasting how they uplifted? Prior World Systems' Effect of uplift speed and efficiency?

In sort of rambling conclusion, I think a possibility for uniqueness here is meta-uplift comparison.

If you need more help or ideas, I would love to assist. Seriously, that whole thing sounds awesome.

** So let's say that some people (about 1 in 10,000, perhaps? maybe less by an order of magnitude or two) live simultaneously in two worlds, which split at the moment of their conception. They know everything that each of their selves know, but this link exists only in their brains; the rest of their bodies are wholly unlinked except that when either brain experiences brain death, it induces brain death in the other. Consequently, such people have lower lifespans on average than the general population. They experience some cognitive dissonance from failing to compartmentalize the two worlds (for example, they may forget which one of their selves they are and mistakenly refer to events from the other world). They tend to become conduits of science and art by giving each of their worlds the ideas that only the other world had naturally. Essentially, they're like Coil from Worm, but with only one split ever in their lives (at the moment of conception). The condition correlates strongly with birth defects; not at a 1:1 rate, but people born with it have a >50% chance of being born with multiple congenital diseases. The condition itself is much more likely in children born to older women near menopause.

If this has been going on for as long as the human race has existed, how quickly might we expect their existence to popularize a many worlds conception of reality and a Bayesian conception of probability? How much might they speed up human progress? How popular could the idea that the condition is merely a delusion become? If someone did have a delusion that they had the condition, how quickly would they be found out? What about a skilled conman; how successfully could they fake it?

*** How does this splitting work? If I'm a doubler born in 1950, what happens when another doubler is born in 1960 in one worldline?

I would think the cleanest way to do it might be to just double the number of universes so that there's an A1 and B1 which are linked and an A2 and B2 which are linked, which means everything with the condition subjectively appears to be in the same two universes, even if there are other universes.

Another way would be for multiple universes to all interlink, meaning universe A, B, C, and D would be linked and you would experience 4 instead of 2. This would also increase your chance of death, given you have twice the odds of a single instance dying.

I find both to be interesting and compelling starting points for a story.

**** Each split - ie, each conception of someone with this condition - doubles the number of universes. It's like each split creates a mirror, and the worlds on each side of the mirror immediately diverge from each other. To overextend this analogy, regular people are like simple panes of glass, while people with the condition are the mirrors - either side of the mirror breaking breaks the mirror, but the mirror only has two sides.

***** So, ok wait:

We live in world 00, say. Alice exists simultaneously in worlds 00 and 01. One day Alice drops dead, apparently killed by something in world 01, and I want to find out what. Is that at all possible, or is world 01 forever lost to us?

For example, under one way this could work: I get on the phone to Bob x0, who links world 00 to 10, and tell him "Alice 0x" has died. Bob confirms that Alice 1x is still alive (the Alice he can see in his other world), and relays the information to her. Alice 1x links worlds 10 and 11. In world 11, Alice 1x talks to Bob x1, who links worlds 11 and 01. Bob x1 can then find out what killed the original Alice in world 01. Does that work?

Really weird non-Euclidean geometry reference you may or may not get - suppose that people are like ultraparallel lines on a hyperbolic plane; most people only have worlds on one side of them but some people have worlds on both sides of them. If there's a world you want to get to, and one of the lines between you and it is made impenetrable, you're out of luck.

******* Hm. I thought about this a while back when [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]] was running. If you do it that way, then even with an average of just two "dreamers" in each universe, there are infinitely many universes in total, which raises some problems.

For example, the threat of memes that can spread across universes. The philosophical questions about whether you can even have an infinite number of computationally distinct universes (for the reasons given in [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][Answer To Job]] ).

And pertinently, probability theory cannot deal with a countably infinite number of identical worlds. Assuming that all worlds are "equally likely", whatever that even means, then the probability of you being in any particular world can't be more than 0. So the probability of you being in any world at all is the countably infinite sum 0+0+0+0+0... = 0. But obviously you are in a world, so this sum must be 1. Contradiction. QED, probability is wrong. (Or, some of the worlds are "less real" than others, but that opens its own can of worms.)

Which is fine for a story, but you're not going to have rationalists using Bayesian reasoning in a multiverse where probability is wrong.

******** I read "Transdimensional Brain Chip" myself. Really fascinating premise, though I would like to make clear that its attitude towards multiple worlds is similar to my own attitude prior to reading it. Awful art, though, and sometimes offputtingly tribalist, but it's great for what it is.

I'll admit that I'm a bit uncomfortable with this assessment, because I can think of experiments that would seem to produce a countably infinite number of worlds if enacted, but it seems to me that the number of worlds would have to be finite, because every conception of a world-splitter only doubles the number of universes, and you'll never get to an infinite number by doubling a finite number a finite number of times. It seems like you could get an "infinity mirrors" effect from two world-splitters being conceived simultaneously, though, but I think something's probably wrong with that idea.

********* Not a very good comic, but it illustrated my point.

The two world-splitters don't need to be conceived simultaneously to get the infinity mirrors effect. Let me rephrase something I said in the parent comment. /The average number of world-splitters per universe must be less than one in a finite multiverse./ (That's counting minds - if we count a world-splitter's two bodies seperately, then the average is less than two.) I will prove this without any reference to what order anyone was conceived in.

Picture the multiverse as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory][graph]]. Each universe is a node of this graph; world-splitters are edges connecting two nodes.

#+begin_quote
  For any given world you can contact, there is only one path of people leading between your world and it, and any of them dying will cut you off from it.
#+end_quote

This means that the graph is either a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory%29][tree]] or several disconnected trees. A finite tree has one more node than edges; so if your multiverse is finite and made of trees, the total number of nodes (universes) must be more than the total number of edges (worldsplitters).

You don't have to have a finite multiverse, but if you do then worldsplitters will be very sparse.

********* Each splitter conception in any timeline doubles the total number of timelines. Assuming that we have a splitter birth somewhere on Earth randomly about every 10 years and the effect was just added to the universe by a wizard, the first birth will happen after about ten years. The second will take five. The third will take 2.5. After a total of about 20 years, the multiverse diverges. [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%27%3D2%5Ef][Here's the relevant differential equation.]]

You might want to set your story before that point, or make splitter births magically less likely as the number of timelines goes up.

*********** I'm still philosophically uncomfortable with infinite worlds. They play havoc with probability. I can't come up with a non-contrived scenario at the moment - [EDIT]

Here's a non-contrived scenario. From the perspective of a splitter, the multiverse is split in half, and each of those halves has equal value. From the perspective of an ordinary person in a world with 1000 splitters in it, the multiverse is split into 1000 pieces (plus their own world), all of equal value. Yet each splitter claims that the 1/1000th of the multiverse they "gatekeep" from you is the same size as all the rest put together. The proportion of the multiverse that each splitter gatekeeps is simultaneously 1/2 and 1/1000 and some other stuff entirely. That doesn't make sense.

You can have a sensible finite multiverse if a single splitter doesn't split the multiverse into two completely disconnected parts. If the paths between them were convoluted enough, nobody would notice without a coordinated effort to map the multiverse. Maybe splitters might notice differences between their two worlds that they didn't cause, but the butterfly effect being what it is, it would be hard to be sure.

** In a virtual environment with fast-running mind-uploads and potentially a million subjective years of history, but a finite amount of RAM and CPU power and thus a finite amount of minds... I'm currently trying to properly construct in my head a society that could be described as a cross between the (original) World of Darkness and 4chan, or maybe Faction Paradox and Orion's Arm; kept moderately stable during its mind-blowingly-long history by relatively regular injections of near-normal 2030-era human minds. I may take a day or two off NaNoWriMo writing to get some of this straightened out in my head. Anyone who wants to contribute a thought, I promise to read it, though I can't guarantee I'll use it.

*** If we're following WoD, then it seems like the central conceit is that the game world is kept stable by some sort of "reversion to mean" system which provides consequences to anyone attempting to /radically/ change or destroy it. I'd guess we also populate the world with NPCs of some sort in order to provide fodder for the users to play their games with?

If you wanted "4channess" in a world, I guess the first things that come to mind are anonymity and memes ... but I know 4chan mostly from being a /b/tard about a decade ago, so my knowledge is way out of date. Regardless, I think there's some good worldbuilding fodder in things /like/ werewolves and vampires as basically being memes. So no two werewolves are the same, because they're variations on the same core conceit, and the central concept of "werewolf" (or whatever) is just whatever longstanding meme has survived the fickle population, or is currently a flash-in-the-pan.

I currently posit that this has happened multiple times - but fresh crops of 2030 humans, and the glacially-slow hand of the PTB allow for starting up fresh societies from scratch, or the deletion of any group which obviously strays /too/ far from the PTB's desires.

*** The biggest problem I have with your story is what do they have to trade? There are ram and cpu power, but with only these two to trade there should be little interaction with each other. I mean in society there is often a whole wealth of different goods to exchange and as you cut down on the variety it should lead to less trade/interaction between sims. Can you think of anything else sims can trade? Particular pieces of knowledge, difficult skills, certain code, works of fiction/art, news, conversation with the Powers That Be (communication is limited due to clock speed and PTB's attention right? so people can trade talking time), pleasure of sapient company, and anything else that are still desired in a post-scarcity society.

I have heard of World of Darkness, 4chan, Faction Paradox, and Orion's Arm, but I never spent any time involved in these four, so I can't comment on them.

***** Ah! I must have read it too quickly the first time because I saw it as only a future plan to try to retain the advantage.

The biggest and most valuable information I can think of is simply anything at all that has to do with the PTB where there is an advantage to being the only person who knows anything. Also obviously any way to manipulate sims are valuable. /Maaaaaaybe/ being rat-minds might be valuable to just to learn more information about how human minds can be affected, but it would be a bad idea to allow yourself to be examined by any such individuals regardless of whether or not you are willing to sacrifice copies of yourself to unscrupulous experimentation.

A good strategy for some people might be to make their minds more like a virus so they can replicate and spread themselves faster across sims.

I can't think of anything else you haven't written on your Doc.
