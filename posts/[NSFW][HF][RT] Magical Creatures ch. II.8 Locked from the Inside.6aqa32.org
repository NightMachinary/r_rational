** Reading back a chapter that I missed (somehow?)

#+begin_quote
  “That is not how gravity works! That's not even how artificial gravity doesn't work!”
#+end_quote

/How did I miss this sentence!/ <3

[edit] I continue to utterly adore the level of worldbuilding that's gone into this.

#+begin_quote
  There are two layers, one thick, one thin, in the place in the dismissal that makes her mouth flow with nectar, and I know what they do. I've been, to this point, only stretching the thick one, but now I take the thin one and pull it to the limit.
#+end_quote

How's the saying go?

"There was a point where we needed to stop, and we have clearly passed it. So let's keep going and see what happens."

[edit] Jesus Christ. You give a nerd /one little finger/ of technical knowledge of a magical system, and ten minutes later it's a fucking singularity. /Literally/.

#+begin_quote
  It's likely, I realize, that my life starting from that moment in my bed onwards is probably now composed mainly of sexily ominous.
#+end_quote

Bwahaha.

[edit]

#+begin_quote
  So, a good lower bound on the power of love is about fifteen hundred simultaneous Apollo launches or, about twelve times the current peak power output of human civilization on Earth.
#+end_quote

HAVE I MENTIONED I LOVE THIS STORY SO MUCH--

[edit] And now they're being cute again. This is <3. Just <3.

#+begin_quote
  (that lubrication tech is post-singularity here is no surprise)
#+end_quote

You know, it's the little touches that make this story. And the big, aggressive touches. A lot of touching, really.

[edit] Okay, that was sweet.

Um. Is this just going to keep escalating? This has basically been an unbroken series of momentous and shattering reveals. I think the story has to get grounded in the next part or else it's gonna lead to burn-out. If you were editing this for a book, I'd tell you that you need to space it out more.

  “It not really flying, it's more like...”

  What? What is that face for?

  She trails off.

  “Say it. C'mon. Say it.”

  “Say what?”

  ...or, shaking your head nevermind? Weird.
#+end_quote

Oh Lyra, you can't just give the first half of Buzz's best line.

#+begin_quote
  The video was them playing Iron Man, on metal guitars, dressed head to toe in chainmail
#+end_quote

Put a link of this in the notes.

#+begin_quote
  child of even
#+end_quote

The ritual calls her a daughter of even, then a child of even, but calls him son of atoms both times. If that inconsistancy isn't explicitly intentional, it should be tweaked to be made consistent.

So, what's "even" in this context? The archaic evening? the concept of balance?

#+end_quote

Yes. It's gotta be both evening and balance, given the sex-positive, lust-focused, single-sexed but complexly-gendered succubi. And that contrasts neatly with son of atoms, given that he's from the land of mundane physics. Also, this gender thing probably explains the flip-flopping between child and daughter.

*** I think "son of atoms" is supposed to be "son of Adam" and "daughter of even" is supposed to be "daughter of Eden". It's a clever twist on biblical names except atoms and even are English words. It doesn't make sense that people misheard two English names for two Hebrew names. I mean why would the succubi have been speaking in English centuries or millennia before modern (or maybe Old) English appeared? Or maybe it's a hint about something funny going on language and the reason Blue can understand others isn't due to magical translation, but because everyone really are speaking English.

*** Don't worry, given the lifecycle of succubi it's /very unlikely/[1] that you'd get such a creature around Sade Hall, especially one with long shaggy fur and a kind of doggy-looking face and the ability to shapeshift into a more...practical...form.

I mean, how would such a thing ever come to be?

** So what do the succubi from the other "domains" look like and what happens if someone incubates somewhere in between the differing types?

EDIT: Also I really like the phrase "sexily ominous" every time it popped up I had to stop reading to control my laughter.
