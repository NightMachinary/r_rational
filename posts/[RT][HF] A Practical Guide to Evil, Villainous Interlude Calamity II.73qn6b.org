***** Hedge can only use any given trick once a day, so once he scores another wound on her, she won't be able to shrug it off as easily as she's been doing.

Additionally, he mentions that her arm is more magic than flesh now, and we know from back when Cat got her leg injured that a limb replacement that uses magic for animation can be subverted by a skilled magician in a fight. I'm not sure what'd happen if he used Link or Imbricate on her arm to fuse its magic with the magic of the hells, but I doubt it'd be healthy for her, and that's assuming that he doesn't do something like just linking it to another one of the Tyrant's flying towers and making it violently explode.

***** Something in that vein.

though naturally, the story itself can't be to predictable, and Tyrant predicted a surprise, therefore, he lives.

(This is pretty circular now that i think about it, the story could also surprise us by not surprising us and letting warlock die.)

** Updated Chapter:Interlude counts:

- Book I - 28 Chapters, 0 Interludes (0% Interlude)
- Book II - 49 Chapters, 11 Interludes (18% Interlude)
- Book III (in progress) - 32 Chapters, 15 Interludes (32% Interlude)

(where "Chapter" = specifically a non-interlude chapter, and prologues/epilogues are not included in either count)

--------------

While I'm still enjoying the series, I'm not a big fan of the increased interlude ratio.

The first book was solely a single-perspective affair; now, it's /almost/ an ensemble cast (except it's too heavily skewed to Cat's perspective for that to be the case). Which is a shame, as the original single-perspective Cat narrative style is part of what drew me to the series in the first place.

While I can only speak as an avid reader of fiction (not a writer), it seems like a lot of the information from the interludes could be passed to us via Cat's perspective (rumors she picks up, chats she has with Black, etc), as is the case in a lot of other single-perspective fiction. So the interludes certainly aren't /necessary/ to the plot.

And if the author truly wanted to shift to an ensemble narrative, they could have explicitly changed the structure of Book 3 (e.g. "Chapter" no longer means "From Cat's perspective") - which would actually have been interesting, in that it comes with additional implications (including that Cat no longer has plot armor).

As it is now, the interlude-creep reads to me like the author is growing bored with Cat as the central protagonist. It's completely understandable, given the high content output; but as a result, I'm now wary of bumping up my donation to get to the "three chapters a week" tier, in case it leads to further author burnout (not to mention, as [[/u/Taborask]] points out, the potential decline in chapter quality in general).

*** I personally like the interludes, since they tend to be more dense in terms of world building. It dances a line between the game of thrones style protagonist rotation, and the worm style of occasional alternate perspectives.

The other advantage is for placing, it lets the main narrative play out at a more reasonable rate instead of being forced to constantly escalate, since we can get our adrenaline fix on "side characters". But I can see how it would be really frustrating if you just wanted to see more of cat and this other stuff kept getting in the way

**** A major part of the problem is that the world-building shifting narratives are at odds with the first person narrative style of the "main" Cat chapters.

I can think of plenty of well-written stories that focus on a central protagonist, but jump around to other characters for the occasional interlude chapters. However, almost all of them are third person. We're already watching the story from that "bird's eye view", so it's not jarring to slide from one character to another.

In /Practical Guide/, we're in first person. We're literally in the head of the protagonist, seeing the world through her eyes. Our interpretation of events stems directly from Cat's interpretations of events. So constantly cutting from that narrative to a /third person/ perspective of a different character is jarring, it breaks narrative flow, and in many cases (such as when we see a battle Cat's in, from one of her general's perspectives) is almost entirely unnecessary.

Worm does use that same style, but in a low impact way, in that the interludes are almost entirely in the breaks between arcs (essentially, the prologues/epilogues of /Practical Guide/). So we experience an entire arc through Taylor's eyes, and then in the post-arc "downtime", we get an interlude from another character's perspective to build out the world. No narrative flows are broken. The few interludes that /are/ mid-arc in Worm, are almost entirely unrelated to the arc in question - they're world-building short-stories, more akin to /Practical Guide/'s "Extra Chapters" (which I did not include in my counts, as I have no issue with them).

***** That's true. Maybe the real issue is just where he's placing the interludes then. If they took place turning down beats of the main narrative they wouldn't be so jarring

****** The current interludes are placed after the summer conflict aren't they?

The current positioning is probably relevant as it places all 5 calamities in combat at the same time.

As for its increase, its pretty probable it returns to normal levels as the current plot wraps up, as it seems to be the herald of the end of the calamities (which would be pretty unsatisfying if we were to learn it second hand)

******* I don't know, I think it could be impactful.

Imagine if there were no interludes throughout this arc, and we just got really focused and drawn into Cat's story. We hear from Black some vague descriptions of what the Calamities are up to, but nothing more. We get to the resolution of Cat's current plot arc, and shortly after she's victorious (or whatev), she gets a message that (Wekesa? Black? Captain? All three?) is/are dead.

THEN we flash back and get a minor arc of interludes, as we see what happened to the Calamities firsthand.

I think it would be more powerful for /both/ stories, rather than this constant jumping around.
