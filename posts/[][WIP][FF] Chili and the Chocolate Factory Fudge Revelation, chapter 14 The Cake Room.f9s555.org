** The marshmallows and the 15-minute wait were a reference to the Stanford marshmallow experiment. And Chili's "you all eat too slow, he could take the food away anytime and you'll be sorry you didn't eat when you could" was a reference to follow-up studies involving reliability. Any more psychology references in this chapter?

Also painfully invokes the real fears and behaviors abused/neglected children tend to develop. Foster kids whose original families starved them will often steal/hoard food or overeat when it's available, for exactly the reason Chili gave. (Eating to the point of vomiting, like he did in an earlier chapter, is also a real thing; kids who have been hungry their whole lives aren't easily able to tell when they're full.)

**** [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][Here's the link to the Wikipedia page]], but in a nutshell, the experiment was an attempt to measure self-control and delayed gratification in different circumstances for children aged 3-5.

They had hypotheses about how different activities would affect ability to delay gratification. They gave the kids a choice: one marshmallow now, or wait fifteen minutes and get two. They did followup studies on the kids later in their lives and found better life outcomes for the kids who managed to patiently wait.

Subsequent studies found that socioeconomic status explains a lot of this. So, Chili eating the marshmallow both reflects his background of abject poverty as well as predicting bad life outcomes for him.

** The vape room explicitly did not go where I expected. As Chili says, she has spoken multiple complete sentences before! Perhaps her zen-like brain-damaged state will mean Mahuika is the true winner. Except she vapes so probably not.

I love the reference to the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][Stanford Marshmallow Experiment]].

But what happens now that the title character has been eliminated? HAS the title character been eliminated? You couldn't do something like change the name of an ongoing story. Who would do something like /that/? Maybe somebody litigating a grudge. Some kind of grudge litigation.

We'll find out in a long time I guess! Thank you for this story so far, Gazemaize. It's been a highlight of every day there's been a chapter. It's the new weird thing I try to get my friends to read with no context. It's a love letter to Dahl but the writing style is also all you in the best way. Take your time and take good care of yourself.

****** A brief history of Korridor shamelessly ripped from this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvlxwu/what_happened_to_game_by_god_and_monsters_and/][comment]]:

- /Game By God/ was about a web serial writer who competes in a /Danganronpa/-style murder-mystery elimination game. It was put on hiatus a couple of chapters into its third arc because the author thought it was too ambitious
- /Ship Poster/ was about a virtuoso violinist hired to play for a luxury cruise ship that rich people go on to live out their final days. About two-dozen chapters were released in total before the story was also put on hiatus for reasons I won't repeat here (they were given in a blog post titled "You Fooled Me Once")
- /Serial Infringement/ had a really cool twist on a superhero premise, but only one chapter was released before the site (and the author's various accounts) went offline

They have nothing in common with /Chili and the Chocolate Factory/ other than meta-themes like when in chapter 6 where they talk about the nature of stories and audience expectations (remember the bit about marbles?).

All of the stories were pretty good on a chapter to chapter basis, but none of them have proper endings. They were well-written enough to the point that I'm still glad to have read them even with the abrupt endings. But your mileage may vary.
