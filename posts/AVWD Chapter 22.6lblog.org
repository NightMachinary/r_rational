Poor Winston, he worked so hard on sciencing the Athena and it's all for naught. Even worse he lied to sciency community about his work. Truly a hell for any self respecting sciencer. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/25534722]]


** Oh dang, I just realized people were posting about AVWD over here! I kind of didn't check, since I haven't been explicitly shooting for rationalfic with this one- it's just sort of the groove I fall into. I'm not putting in the same kind of effort I did with Cordyceps. I'm glad people like it anyway, though!

In checking out the threads, I noticed a couple key criticisms:

Firstly, that the "omnipotent simulation lord" angle [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6f52fn/oh_look_yet_another_new_chapter_of_angel_valkyrie/difkch1/][is a cop-out for worldbuilding.]] And I agree- which is why, without spoiling anything, I'll say that the world is only /sort of/ a simulation, in a way that should obviate those concerns about "well, this part of the world doesn't need to make sense in context, the simulator just decided it should be this way by fiat". It'll make sense when it's revealed who that omniscient narrator is (some people have already guessed the name correctly, but the nature is still not 100% spelled out yet.) (Oh, and- maybe this is sloppy, but I haven't been writing from the perspective of this narrator character most of the time- I'm only explicitly writing with that character in mind when I use the first person perspective.)

Secondly, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6b3iby/angel_valkyrie_witch_devil_chapter_15/dhjjhr0/][Winston isn't smart enough]]- there are moments where he could be more rational. And yes! Agreed! I've gone out of my way to avoid making Winston a Rational-protagonist- I try to give different strengths and insights to different characters, instead of loading them all up on Winston and having him be the hero. He's more the /default viewpoint character/ than the protagonist, and as such sometimes it pays to have him be a little slow on the uptake when I need a reason to be more direct with the reader. For all his engineering know-how (in limited domains- he's no neurologist, his work on Athena was only a step above tinkering with char-rnn) and high INT, this is still the guy whose personal motto is "Never accept the world as it appears to be- dare to see it for what it /could/ be", which isn't exactly the Litany of Tarski. /Mercy/ is more the Rational-protagonist, although she's loaded up with neuroses that get in the way. And if a particular lesson makes the most sense coming from a particular character's mouth, I let them be the one to voice it.

But yeah, thanks for reading! I'm having a lot of fun writing it.

** Point of order: I haven't read this fic, but every time I open this thread you immediately start spoiling things that happened that chapter before the reader even has a chance to find the link.

Instead, submit your posts as a direct link to the chapter, and add commentary as a comment.

*** Yeah that sound about right, bit hard for me not react about new chapter though.

Mind telling me why you don't read this? Just to satisfy my curiosity if you could.

**** It's fine to react, just put it in a reply to yourself. No issue with starting a discussion, it's just in a wonky place is all.

I don't read it due to sheer apathy. I've got enough stuff to keep up on, and Overwatch ain't my favorite thing in the world.

** Very interesting developments. It took me a minute to remember that Symmetra decided to call herself Becky.

I wonder if Overwatch/Sombra will realize that the God Program remains...
