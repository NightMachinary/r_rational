Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I recently took a stap at rereading twig by wildbow and I had forgotten how much I like that the protagonist is an experiment and is good at manipulating people. I am requesting recommendations for stories in which the main character is either an experiment and ones in which the main character is a skilled(but fallible) social manipulator.

Aside from Twig I am familiar with Super Minion but not much else.

*** Lightbringer by Brent Weeks has manipulators. It's not the focus of the work, but when it comes up the Guile family absolutely earns their name.

Glimwarden by Alexander Wales is unfinished, but has a delightful manipulator as one of the three main characters.

Seconding whywhisperwhy's recommendation of Lies of Locke Lemora.

Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card is at least one of these things, but I will not spoil which. Bean vs Sylvester would be a crossover fic I would love to read though.

The Murders of Molly Southbourne by Tade Thompson is about an experiment with some very weird side effects.

Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is about an experiment, and one of science fiction's classics.

If we included superhero stories where the main character is an experiment we could be here all day, so I'll just go with Vicious by V.E. Schwab and leave it at that.

**** I ate through it. Moderately pleasant read. I enjoyed the climax in the story but it felt like the protagonist didn't really get much resistance and whatever resistance he got was because he was really short sighted. There should be ranged attack chakra techniques in existance that had a good scaling with the amount of chakra you can pour into and the chance that they were in the library was pretty great. It also doesn't really feel like he earns his victories except maybe the one with syrup, though it was unclear why the syrup change didn't have chakra to absorb.

** Recommendations from previous threads that I worked through this week:

Master Assassins - Okay

Murderbot Diaries -- Pretty fun

Russian Doll -- Pretty good

Love is War -- Pretty good and pretty fun

*Master Assassins* (Novel): Best to throw out any preconceptions the awful title gives you because it's definitely not that kind of story. To some degree this feels like one of those genre fiction novels that gets a pass on not being particularly eventful or exciting because it has some mild literary ambitions that it vaguely comes within sight of. Not an awful lot happens, in many respects it's a travelogue. It explores the idea of family and what it means and it does an okay job, I guess, but it's fairly well trod ground that it doesn't shine any new light on. The characters are well fleshed out, not overly intriguing and only act stupidly when the plot demands it on the rare occasion. The worldbuilding is novel though there's not too much of it. The prose is fairly nice.

*Russian Doll* (TV): Character focused time loop drama. I really enjoyed this show. The characters were unique and their behaviour and dialogue was very often believable. Unconventional, quirky characters that aren't caricatures is uncommon in my experience. Great pacing -- the show is only eight sub-30minute episodes. Worth noting: do not watch for an interesting exploration of time loop mechanics or any form of competence porn. Also, the protagonist is not the most likeable of characters though to what extent will, I suspect, vary a lot for different viewers.

I recommend not watching the trailer.

*Murderbot Diaries #1* (Novella's): Short, easy to digest adventure sci-fi. It's about a security android who's hacked it's governing module, granting it 'free will'. What it decides to do with that is laze about on the job as much as possible by binge watching the future equivalent of netflix and avoiding human contact which it finds awkward and embarrassing -- a socially awkward combat bot. It doesn't suffer some of the pitfalls that you get from a lot of adventure fiction such a generic characters acting as the plot requires for cheap drama or conflict. It does suffer from the pitfall of none of the action being particularly original or clever and the 'mystery' is pretty pedestrian. Still, the characters are enjoyable and the premise is novel. I'll likely read the next one in the series.

(okay, I read the +next one+ rest of the series) Murderbot Diaries 4 > 2 > 3 > 1: Solid improvements on the first novel as the series continued. Plot's more engaging, new and existing characters more fleshed out, the wider universe feels more substantial. For short, light adventure novels they have a lot of heart and the dry wit is great.

*Kaguya-sama: Love is War* (Anime): With only a specific few exceptions i've discovered that anime just isn't for me and I think I enjoy this show so much, at least in part, because it's almost a self aware parody (in a non sneering way) of the exaggerated stylistics you get from many anime but that I tend to not enjoy -- dramatic voice overs, exaggerated proclamations, epic music, ridiculous reactions, training montages - all in the body of a rom-com. In the latest episode there was a detailed analysis of the social dynamics involved in a boy and girl sharing an umbrella in the rain, a list of scenarios in which such sharing is broached or occurs and detailed planning and scheming by the two main characters to instigate such a scenario without looking like they were doing it because they liked the other. Completely ludicrous. Utterly delightful.

*** I'm several episodes into Russian Doll and am pretty annoyed with the main character's incompetence.

Sure, I can understand how the first time you tried to say, "Help! I'm caught in a groundhog's day loop!" you'd fuck it up and sound like you're babbling.

But the show has had the MC give that talk to like 5 people. And every time the explanation is incoherent babble, and failing at theory of mind.

Like, there's a scene where the MC puts marker on her hand, resets, and then goes up to someone else going "Hey! Look at my finger! There's no pen mark!"

Its so bad that I spent a couple episodes unsure if the MC was losing memories between loops.

Kaguya-sama is fantastic, and I expect the male MC to hit close to home for a lot of this sub.

** I've been watching and enjoying /That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime/ recently -- would recommend as a feel-good portal fantasy, it's a bit more serious than the last one I watched (/KonoSuba/), and with a greater focus on... civil engineering, I guess, over adventuring.

Otherwise, these last 4 days I hosted a prospective PhD student, and we'd coincidentally shared a few literary tastes (e.g. we both adored Diana Wynne Jones). Over the years she'd read a few works liked by this subreddit (e.g. /Worm/, /HPMOR/), but otherwise had never heard of the "genre" and enthusiastically requested recommendations. What would be a good "introductory" text? (I'd already sent some recs [[https://i.imgur.com/qSZsohG.png][this morning]], avoiding the Naruto/Pokemon fandoms since those weren't really her jam -- likewise, if anyone knows of good DnD podcasts (she liked e.g. [[https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone][TAZ]]) or online multiplayer games, do say).

**** yep -- for my wife and I, something non-competitive and casual/easy, with at least a basic story (so some sort of campaign is a must, rather than e.g. just team deathmatch or w/e), that doesn't require much in way of fast-twitch reflexes. Games we've enjoyed have included the Divinity: Original Sin duo, Borderlands II, Diablo III (though wife /hated/ Grim Dawn, go figure), Portal 2, Guacamelee, Magicka 2, Lego LotR (though not the other Lego games), The Division, Unravel, and Portal 2, to give a sample (also -- nothing scary, esp. zombies. Dead Island was ok, Dying Light was not). Currently we're playing Far Cry 5, with Ghost: Recon Wildlands up next. Of the current gen offerings we only have a PC, but will probably get a PS4 sometimes soon-ish. Also open to older titles (via e.g. emulator). Either online-only or couch/splitscreen are ok, but with a preference for the latter.

For the visitor asking for recs -- specifically, she has a weekly DnD game (hosted online) but sometimes some of her friends can't make it, so they (4 people in total) fill their time with online games, but specifically Jackbox Party Pack. She doesn't really play games otherwise and wanted recs for good options. So probably nothing too technical and more pick-up-and-play-ey, but I figured D:OS would be fine given their familiarity with DnD.

Monster Hunter: World (I haven't played this one, but if a monster hunter game grabs you they're absolutely massive world's)

Survival/Base building: Minecraft (Always highly recommended)

Don't starve together

If you get a PS4 get one of the Just Dance games, even if you don't normally enjoy dancing it's a blast with friends.

I addition to these you could honestly jump into any modern MMO together since they aren't very competitive outside of PvP.

*** One of my favourite DnD podcasts is Critical Role, which is currently on its second season (same players, but entirely new characters and story). It's slightly more manic and mechanically-focused than TAZ - I know they pretty much abandon combat fairly early one but its still a common feature in CR. Additionally, there's twice as many people involved in CR than TAZ, and I know that put one of my friend's off because they struggled to distinguish voices.

Still, Matt Mercer is a fantastic DM and storyteller, all the players are voice actors who know how to make unique and interesting characters and take the story in fascinating directions. I'd highly recommend it, though I've only regularly watched the second season.

​

You'd think I'd include Savage divinity in the "One of the best stories in the genre" list, but fuck no, that book is garbage. The only reason why people like it, is because the MC gets beat down a lot, so that people can point and say "SeE, ToTaLLY N0t WiShFuFilLmenT!1111" except for the fact that the enemies are just all the negative tropes of the "young master, all the way up to old ancestor acting like fucking unrealistic retards" all rolled up into one without the Catharsis of the asshole MC beating the shit out of these fucktards. Rationally, an empire like in the story fill of idiots like this would have fell to demon invasion #123412345123 before the story even started. Then the author himself is so self-rightgeous about it that he doesn't even recognize the flaws(as opposed to WildBlow which is why even though I don't like Worm, I'll recommended it)Fuck that guy.

​

Hell, some people would even argue that the Author doesn't really know HOW people would act in clearly abusive worldy situations. . .like the whole damn world outside of the village. You can break S.D.'s story in 2 minutes, How? After the first "Young Master" arc where he ends up losing an arm and a leg, he would NOT leave the village EVER until he's strong enough to kill any young master plus his clan, plus some old ancestor plus anyone else that would screw with him, thing is, The Author has no idea how to make this interesting, so after TEASING that he was going to do this, the author makes up some silly bullshit (oh he can get a monster heart for his new weapon [something that REALLY ISN'T WORTH DYING OVER {Yes, he and his clan SHOULD have died after that adventure for the heart, but *Muh Plot Arm0ouR* card was activated}]) and his adopted mother was all like "yeah you should go" Then after almost dying again from more stupid world shenanigans, he doesn't even GET the item he almost died for! (Yes I know he go the elixir, but honestly not even close to worth it. AND they should have died. . .if you were being rational) That book pissed me off, I think I got to around chapter 97 before I binned that dumpster fire. Sorely disappointed after all the fan boys jizz all over reddit for that book. Jesus.

** I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost /designed/ to mainly have all those qualities, /sigh/. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate.

Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.

Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-/Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure/.

The problem with these is like 95% are abandoned or fragments and the authors update but don't sort it by quality. I have tried a couple of times to find something good in it and given up around letter C.

If a couple of people volunteered to look through sections by letter we could make a new thread with just the longer ones without going insane. Limiting to stories with threadmarks greater than 30k words would get rid of at least 3/4 of these and make it way more manageable. Then it could be sorted by live/dead (updated last 6 months), and by fandom and then repost it as threads on all the forums. At least a handful of these have to be good but they are buried too deep in fragments, weird fandoms, and long dead fics.

I created a document and will do a section if other people will help. If people are interested we could probably commandeer people on SV and SB to help also.

Stage 0: improve the instructions in the doc, adding ways to search, and a way to give assignments so people aren't writing over each other or out of order

Stage 1 would be posting the titles/links of the ones >20k and the length.

Stage 2 would be filling in the other details

Order to go through threads would be SV thread 2.0 alphabetically by author name, SV thread 1 same way, SB thread..., QQ thread.... (same order as posted above)

Alphabetical within each section by author letter since that is how they are currently divided and allows people to split up the work. The list could be resorted by other metrics once it is in a spreadsheet.

Link any other rec threads you have heard of on SV or SB!

***** If you can filter by word count without having to check threadmarks in all the different works that helps a lot!!! However, if you are going by the word count listed in the threadmarks section keep in mind some of the longest ones look like fragments because they are posted from an older thread of the same story in a way that messes up word count. Ex. Security by Ack which is 6th one down in the SV 2.0 thread is >200k words but has word count listed as 190. It might be worth missing these to save time but idk how common it is in longer/multithread fics.

I would also like to eventually merge the names of the fandoms that are written differently so once you find one you can find them all but that is lower priority and probably needs a different solution.

I would also like a way to go back and find the <30k fics once they get updated to 30k but again that probably needs a different solution. Once things are sorted in a spreadsheet people can just check if a newly >30k fic is already added and post it in threads on each of the forums if it isn't.

I have an [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-selected-links/][add-on]] that allows me to highlight text on a webpage and copy the selected links. So I highlighted and then copied all of the links in all 4 archives.

Then I opened [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]], and clicked on the plug-in [[https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3084025][FanFicFare]].

This results in calibre downloading all of the self-insert stories from all of the archives.

In reality, it was easier to break it into multiple batches at a time to download. It even worked with stories like Security! where there is no index and only links in the first chapter.

It's only half way done, but once it's finished (probably by tomorrow) I can get calibre to generate a cvs doc with the story title, author, link, word count, chapter count, and any other miscellaneous info that I think you could use somehow.

Unfortunately, fandoms are trickier to tag because calibre only adds in tags that the original author tagged to their stories and not every author added such tags properly.

Anyway, I'll post it as a shared Google Docs tomorrow once calibre finishes processing.

**** You might want to try skipping a chapter if you're feeling bored. I do that sometimes, and often I continue until I get curious enough to read what I missed.

In any case, I'm surprised that you stopped part way through. To me, it's one of those fics which is gripping enough so that if you're drawn in by the first few chapters, you'll read until you're caught up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

Would you mind sharing (in a spoiler) where you stopped liking it? I'm really curious, because this fic is definitely one of my most favorite SIs.

EmptySurface also stopped updating the FFnet version, and moved over to AO3 instead. The link is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][here]].

The rec for this fic the you saw is probably mine. I keep recommending it whenever I see "Naruto SI", because I like it so much. I'm probably gonna stop doing it whenever [[/u/Addictedtobadfanfict][u/Addictedtobadfanfict]] posts, though, since I did it several times, and he doesn't like it. Shame :(

It's kinda odd, since he likes Sanitize, for example. This fic is probably an intersection between that and some other fics he recommends, in that it contains many elements from different ones he mentions, but not all. An intersection, really.

I do kinda wish he put it up as, "I tried this fic and didn't like it very much, but /many many/ other people recommended it to me." Maybe mention how I find it's the only hurt/comfort fic that I like/does it well.

****** Yeah, you probably stopped at a low point.

The only people close to her that die are her mom and the other two on the genin team. We know that some get pretty hurt, but for sake of getting you to read it spoilers, no one else close has died. There are some extras that die, obviously, but let me tell you, no one cares about them. And I'm the type to get sad over minor characters dying. So don't worry about that.

You probably dropped it at the lowest emotional point in the story. Imo, the story is consistently amazing throughout, but in how exhausting it can be to read it, you probably stopped at the most exhausting point.

Don't worry about it though, I do that with fics some times. I stopped reading Pact for a year because it was so stressful, and I haven't had the guts to actually read Twig yet. Also, the other time I often drop good fics is when they use awkward comedy, like how many sitcoms are. I just cringe too hard and stop. It's never as bad the second time around though. It's definitely worth reading those fics (assuming they're good anyway).

I'd wholeheartedly recommend for you to continue it. I've mentioned that it's the only hurt comfort fic that does things well, and I definitely felt the same thing you do in your spoiler. After that point though, it really does become more about rebuilding. One chapter had a crazy battle in Uzu, where in a chapter or so afterwards, the war stops. That's the second culmination of the stress on Kyo, with the first one being the death of her team. After this point, it's more of dealing with a world becoming more peaceful, but not wholly peaceful. She still gets hurt, but it's really more physical. No more deaths. It's pretty fucking good after this point.

So yeah. Go for it. Make sure you read my spoilers; you should be fine where you are. Remember to read the AO3 version, too.

Happy reading! :)

**** I know I am clogging up the recommendation thread so I didn't comment last week for this reason. I also add noteworthy self-inserts I come across each time I post so there is always something new.

It's not like I am picking any random self-inserts to add to my list. There are so many self-inserts out there with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Archive-for-Self-Inserts-and-Original-Characters/117072/][the archive for self inserts and original characters]] alone having 10,000+ self inserts in it's collection. The problem is 99% of the self inserts available are unreadable trash. I go through like 20 self-inserts a week. I won't stop till my list reaches 100 until I find the 1%. I'm swimming through the great pacific garbage patch trying to find diamonds in the rough. If you see a self-insert added to my list you should know you are in for something out of the norm.

Also, the snake report is not a 'self insert' or fanfiction. I would classify it as an isekai. Self-inserts are suppose to have omniscient knowledge in the universe they are self-inserting in such as Juniper Smith in Worth the candle. Self-inserts in fanfiction are a whole different ball game because the readers are invested and know the universe of the fanfic they were self inserted in. That's why a lot of people are picky with self-inserts because when a self insert does stupid shit in the fanfic you are familiar with and gets away with it, you know the self-insert you are reading is irrational overlooked trash.

I just want to double back and recommend [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/frost-dragon-ball-si.6837/][Frost]] because it's easily one of my top 5 self-inserts of all time that I found a week ago. If you are into Dragon ball Z at all you would love it. I had to go through so much porn in questionable questing to find this self-insert. I would consider it rational adjacent.

  I think your definition of SI is overly narrow and not the way it's commonly used. SI with knowledge of the setting/universe before taken there would better specify what you want in my opinion.
#+end_quote

Even that definition is kinda narrow to me.

To me, an SI is the insertion of the author into an already established universe. Whether they retain knowledge or not doesn't matter, it's still an SI. (Also, there's the FI fics on SB, where the only difference is that a friend is writing it. This is interesting because the Author being inserted doesn't need to have knowledge of the work itself. It's still not isekai.)

An OC-SI is like an SI, but instead of the author being inserted, it's an original character instead. Again, they don't need knowledge of the material.

The only difference between an OC-SI and an Isekai, to me, is that the world being inserted in an Isekai is an original world, so that the fic itself is also original and not fanfiction. As far as I can come up with another difference, the ROBs in SIs are typically more out of scope than ROBs in Isekai, though both genres don't require a ROB.

Isekai will usually have a more generic protagonist, to be an audience surrogate, where an SI will typically be less generic and more like the author.

I actually prefer SIs without knowledge of the target universe, because then the fic often reads like time travel fic. That is, both time travel fics and typical SIs feature protagonists that meddle with the original plot, but I don't read SIs for a time travel story. I read SIs for someone with a reader/outside perspective on fictional universe.

For this reason, I like SIs that meddle with plot less, which is why I like fics like Sanitize or Hear the Silence so much. Other fandoms (besides Naruto and maybe Worm) typically have bigger universes, so the authors make up their own plots (Young Justice and Star Wars fics in particular). This means that even if the SI knows a lot about the universe, it's fine anyway. This is primely demonstrated in WTR, which is amazing despite Paul's crazy knowledge of DC and YJ canon.

This also means that I'm more fine to see the plot of those universes messed with, because I haven't been tired out by previous fics messing with their plot. Compare that to Naruto and HP, where I've read enough time travel and/or SIs, so that I really don't care about interfering with canon plot that much.

So yeah. SIs are complex and I have very particular opinions about them.

** I'd like some recs for One Piece fics that don't just run through the stations of cannon with minor variations.

And for once, I actually have some relevant recs of my own to offer! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1331586/Velkyn-Karma][Velkyn Karma]] has a bunch of quite excellent One Piece fics. Of particular note are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7387687/1/Asteria-Nightmare][Asteria Nightmare]]

#+begin_quote
  On this island, it's personal. The inhabitants don't just steal your body; they feed on your dreams.
#+end_quote

The Straw Hats try to figure out how these monsters work while doing their best to avoid being eaten.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6313329/1/Mindshattered][Mindshattered]]

#+begin_quote
  Sanji knew how difficult it was to survive the hell that was starvation. What he hadn't expected was that he'd need to get his nakama through it, too.
#+end_quote

The other Straw Hats, largely directed by Sanji, try to help Zoro through the aftermath of starvation. Velkyn seems to have done pretty well on his(?) research here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7614748/1/The-Panaceam-Report][The Panaceam Report]]

#+begin_quote
  Enemies might come and go, but information lasts forever.
#+end_quote

Sequel to Mindshattered. Further explores the aftermath of Zoro's ordeal as he and Sanji are forced to work with the source of it.
