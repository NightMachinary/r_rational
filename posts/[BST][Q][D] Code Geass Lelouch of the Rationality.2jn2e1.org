I'm currently starting on a rational version of Code Geass, but I'm having a bit of difficulty. In-series, they don't give much info on the geography of Tokyo (i.e where things are in terms of the Tokyo wards). I was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer advice or help, especially on the geography side of things.

Additionally, is this series something people want to see? Do people think it's a good idea, or would a rational!Code Geass fail?

** Lelouch's geass is too powerful. The obvious problem is that he can (metaphorically) wish for more wishes, which any reasonably rational person would do instantly. Particularly since (iirc) his power works on entire crowds at once, possibly through recordings or streaming video. The thing is, even if it /doesn't/ it's still way too powerful.

*** Geass obviously doesn't work via video, otherwise it would be able to affect Viletta in 2nd(?) episode while she were inside Knightmare. Also, Geass has maximum range of about 200 m, as Lelouch figured out a bit later.

About limitations - maybe people under constant Geass (unlike short one) could suffer mental breakdown. This could force Lelouch to be more accurate with his power.

Also, this wasn't explored, but Geass was extensively studied by it's Cult, which had ties with Britania. Thus, there could be safety protocols against potential Geass user (of course, their true meaning isn't known to people outside of Royal Family, and even then only to few).

Also, Lelouch's life could be made MUCH more difficult if Kornelia/Schneizel knew about existance of Geass.

**** Well, Knightmares don't use video, anyways. But you are corrrect in that it doesn't work via video.

I'm not entirely sure what limitations I'm putting in yet, but that sounds like a good idea. I'm also thinking about making it more specific, as in, Lelouch has to be more specific with his commands. Think programming.

There definitely is stuff to do with Britannians having anti-Geass stuff. For instance, Jeremiah had a thing that could cancel Geass powers. It makes no sense that he was the only person who had this.

I'm intending to make Cornelia and Schneizel the true antagonists of the series, rather than Charles. I'm intending to treat Charles as sort of a crazy puppet ruler that is allowed to follow his own ideas, just as long as they don't mess with everything else. Schneizel actually runs everything.

***** Charles can alter your memories and cripple you at will.

If you want him to be a puppet ruler then Schneizel needs code/some other way of resisting geass (which is probably a good idea anyway, or Lelouch insta-wins).

** I'm not sure whether you've already seen this, but the wiki has some information on Tokyo, like here: [[http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Tokyo_Settlement]]. It uses Tokyo railroad lines to explain the basic geography so it shouldn't be too hard to compare it to a map of real-life Tokyo and it's railroad maps. Beyond that, I doubt that there's very much information on it. The show was not very specific about these things, especially since the alternate history doesn't really make sense. Even the location of Pendragon in Brittania is not certain, though the wiki says it's somewhere in Arizona. I think it would be okay to just look at real-life maps of Tokyo and make stuff up as long as you're consistent. I would be very interested in a rational Code Geass story as long as Lelouch's personality doesn't change much. The show had its flaws, but the characters aside from Suzaku were the main appeal for me.

** What I'd like to see is justification for the mechs. Or, alternately, they could be replaced with tanks utilizing all the same tech.

*** Smart-ass answer: It's the best shape for the Sakuradite to power the entire body.

Real answer: Oh god, you're right, I don't know that. I guess I'm going to have to sit down and come up with an answer. Unfortunately I can't go with my usual answer whenever I write mecha, i.e "full body simulation/movement copy."

**** The Knightmare Frames were originally designed by some guy who had access to REALLY REALLY advanced technology, and then slowly given to various world powers in clandestine ways. They're not the optimal way to wage war, at that level of technology; they're comparable to, say, giving medieval knights access to pistols when you could just as easily give them assault rifles and rocket launchers.

Who this mysterious agent may be, and why he wants everybody piloting humanoid frames, is up to the author. Maybe the guy's just a mecha anime fanboy and happens to have the tools to make his dreams reality.

***** That's all very interesting, but unfortunately I have come up with a reason for why they use mechs.

I'll quote something I said further up in this thread:

So, my reasoning is "Charles came up with it, and it proved successful so they continued to go with it." I'm intending to make this from Lloyd's perspective, or possibly Suzaku's perspective, for the most part, so the main change I'm going to have there is that Lloyd came up with the idea of /not/ having incredibly ill-balanced, less-effective things.

Lloyd is going to design a much better mech that makes a lot more sense with the technology that they have available, but which is also more complex to steer. Suzaku, being almost superhuman (yes, I will be explaining why Suzaku was superhuman in the canon), will be able to use this mech.
