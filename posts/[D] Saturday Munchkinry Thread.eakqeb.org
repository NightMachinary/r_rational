Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Ok, say you have the ability to move and shape a cubic meter of snow/ice and the ability to generate about a fourth of that every five seconds via a line of sight cone with a range of 20 meters. You can only either make ice or control it, neither at the same time. the force you can put in to move/shape ice is the same amount of force your physical body could produce to move things normally.

How would you best use this ability in combat and to make money?

Edit: additional power details based on responses\\
You don't get tactile feedback from ice, so unless you have a microscope and some really good focus small ice particles wouldn't be able to be used for anything complex.

I'll expand upon the ice creation power, it's a breath attack, a kind of blue flame that eats air and forms ice onto solid matter while lowering the temperature.

*** - Small ice bullets. F=MA, since M is super small A will be really high.

- flying disk, or ice packs strapped to boots/limbs

- power breaks conservation of energy, so there's probably an infinite energy exploit somewhere

- exercise a lot, since power is directly proportional to how physically strong I am

- testing to determine how small a particle of ice I can control. there's probably all sorts of fun exploits if it's small enough, but the obvious one is nanoscale assembly

- if someone's got a shield or something, cover the bubble in opaque ice flakes to disable them

- power generalizes to a form of telekinesis, since you can use crushed ice to form pseudo-hands. you can control anything that's not hot this way

- assassination by mixing ice with other substances (easy delivery method, untraceable, and everyone will think someone with poison powers did it)

- test whether "line of sight" includes things like cameras, windows, etc. if it doesn't, figure out why air works but those don't

I don't know very much about current nanofactory efforts, but I'd bet that someone capable of quickly assembling prototypes would be invaluable to the people researching that stuff. High end scientific equipment is /expensive/ (like millions of dollars expensive) and I'm sure you could convince a big company to pay you gobs of money to sit in a lab and stick atoms together. And under those circumstances, having high-end microscopes isn't a big deal.

*** One combat trick would be to accelerate little bits of ice until they're going really, really fast.

A .308 Winchester round has about 2500 foot-pounds of energy. So, if I can push on my "ice bullets" for 20', it will take 125lbs of force to get them up to rifle speeds. That's basically a rail gun.

Alternately, I could swirl the bullets around myself like I'm using a sling. That lets me get them up to speed with much, much less energy.

I could also create an ice disk (or ice chariot) to fly on, and just leave combat, or just drop cubic meters of snow / ice on people, both if which would get pretty fatal.

--------------

For money, my genuine "Level 1 Intelligence" solution would be to go to a local law firm and see if they'd act as my agent.

I expect that they'd be able to line up a bunch of mundane work in construction or heavy industry that would amount to "use your magic ice powers to move that broken, high-voltage line to safety."

Would this actually work? Wouldn't you have to exert an additional force to keep them at a constant radius, which would reduce the force you could exert to accelerate them? In a sling, you get the radius-maintenance force for free because of the string.

***** You still have to hold the other end of the string. So, sling-speeds & sling bullets will take sling levels of force.

But, to explore the idea, a .308 Winchester bullet weighs 10g (0.01 kg), and has a muzzle velocity of around 900m/s. If I swing it in a circles with a radius of 2m, then I need a centripetal force of about 405 N.

Converting back to Freedom Units, that's a force of 91 lbs.

--------------

But, having done all this, I'm realizing that my math is silly, since if you can do 91lbs of force over a distance, then you can just railgun the bullet directly

****** Couldn't you use an actual sling? The munchkiny part of this is that you can apply the acceleration regardless of the speed and current location of the ice. You could put a block of ice in some container, attach it to a strong cable that's clipped to a pole and rotate it in a circle until you hit insane speeds before releasing it to fly off and hit your target. You could use a counterweight, or even a second block of ice, at the other end of the cable to reach higher speeds.

I think you're probably right about that, so my solution is "sawblade with attached marbles above head." But then, my intuition is that ice's tensile strength isn't super great, so the blade might break before it got up to speed.

How about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-gas_gun][light gas gun?]] Instead of an explosion, you'd cause the ice cylinder to expand and leave a vacuum inside. The atmosphere only gives 14lbs of pressure, so you'd need the piston's surface area to be 10x the bullet's, but that's easy. You could go 20-30x and reduce the length of the gun... or increase its final velocity!

Edit: You could also add your power to the piston, but the main trick here is that expanding the vacuum inside the main chamber allows you to do all the work for the bullet over a longer period of time. The other thing is, you'd best leave a little bit of gas in the chamber so it can efficiently transfer the energy to the bullet. Pure vacuum wouldn't work as well, unless you took your ice gun and stuck it right against the thing you wanted to destroy. Could use it for breaching walls, for example.

*** - Combat: useless. It's worse than a gun; I guess you can create ice inside people's mouth/nostrils so they suffocate from a distance so I guess you could be an assassin. But seriously just use a modern sniper rifle, this power requires you to be within 20 metres whereas you can get kilometres+range with modern weapons that aren't even guided.

- Money: Example options:

- Do some training in health & safety & become extremely highly paid for your work in colonising Antarctica

- Become a performing bartender (combining art with drinks mixing) - work in a high quality establishment (eg. michelin star or something)

- This power essentially doubles the power output of your body for free. You can use the ice to make a LOT of personal conveniences such as exoskeletal limbs which make movement easier, if you can lift yourself you can fly etc. So it's a pretty arbitrary power, but again, all that stuff is just convenience. Also requires that you're covered in or on ice so you'd need some kind of heating tech.

- Regardless of what you do, you're gonna need some kind of support, both legal and possibly military. Likely you wouldn't be able to do /anything at all/ obvious because drawing any attention could draw the attention of spy agencies or whatever, and they might be hostile, in the sense that your very existence with this power could spark global war. Not an /incredibly/ likely possibility, but something you'd want to be aware of.

Very sensible, but even before that you'd need to have reasonable confidence that, should some hostile organisation (even up to a nation-state) take an interest in you, you'd have some defense against that. Your personal power, regardless of how hard you munchkin is never going to be enough - you need another nation-state or entity with similar resources that is going to be able to defend your right to exist as a free person.

*** Depending on the precision of the control, ice sculpting could be a viable business. Without the need for tools, you could churn out high-quality sculptures to sell.

The ice itself could also be a viable product, depending on its purity. 100% pure ice, and the subsequent pure water, could have some use in scientific areas.

Speaking of science, as with any superpower (and depending on the structure of society), you could sell your time to researchers to research your supernatural power.

The temperature manipulation might be useful in cooking, or hand-done metalworking, or anything else that involves lowering the temperature.

The "eating air" part could also be exploited. If that means "destruction of air", then it could be used as a substance disposal method. Grind up radioactive waste into dust, spread it out on an airtight space, then have you breathe on it to solve one of the major problems with nuclear reactors.

In terms of combat, there's the obvious "freeze your enemies to death" route, or even "freeze their blood then rip it out of them". Else, turn the ice into needles and shove them into people. Or trick them into eating shaved ice or something and mess up their insides.

** You are teleported to a far-flung fantasy realm. All you have on you is the clothes you're wearing, and anything in your pockets.

However, you have one link back to Earth: a black tablet computer, with an inexhaustible battery. Aside from its touchscreen, the device is perfectly featureless and seamless. It has no ports or vents, no camera, nor any way to access or remove the battery. It is a solid lump of sleek plastic.

The tablet has a single app: an internet browser, that appears to connect to Earth's internet. This connection is comfortably fast, and 100% reliable. However, the only site it can access is Reddit, and then only a single subreddit: [[/r/818296][r/818296]]. You are the mod of this sub, and your account name is [[/u/818297][u/818297]]. The subreddit is set to private - only you can post links. This cannot be changed.

Furthermore, any links leading outside your subreddit do not work. Images and videos consistently fail to load. This appears to only happen for you - everyone else looking in on your subreddit can follow links and view videos and images just fine. Most of these people are coming to your subreddit from links being dumped in other random subreddits, supposedly by your account. These visitors have no idea what your subreddit is about, at first.

None of the locals in the fantasy world you're stranded in can see what's on your tablet. To them, the screen appears like the rest of the tablet's black plastic - blank and featureless. Further, the screen does not appear to emit any light, no matter how bright its contents are. It is unclear how you're able to view the screen's contents.

How do you make use of this connection to Earth, to aid in your survival?

*** I probably don't use the tablet, at least not socially. If I've determined that the tablet can only be used to access text data from a practically abandoned private subreddit in a world that doesn't share the same geography or even necessarily the same rules of physics, there's not much use in the tablet from a social perspective. Being in a far-flung fantasy realm, my best bet is to start learning about the things that don't work as I would normally expect, like magic (if applicable). If I can just one day show up in this weird realm, perhaps I can also learn how to get back.

About the only use I'd have for the tablet is as a way to make searchable notes. When doing experiments, I could log my results in the tablet and use it as a searchable reference. I could also copy other useful documents I come across that I'd like to be able to keep in a convenient and searchable format.

- Drain out the water, and grind into flour. Make a dough.
- Burn some wood, and cook the bread. It'll be bitter and flat and salty, but it's food.

If he can't grind them into flour or make fire (to preserve wood supply), he should just eat the acorns as-is. They won't be very tasty, but he will die later.

- In a different location
- in different soil
- using different materials as fertiliser
- Using /everything he knows/ about plants to hopefully make them grow (for example, does singing to plants actually encourage them to grow? This is his opportunity to test this theory)
- Practice swimming in a maximally energetically-efficient way in order to find algae/seaweed, which can potentially be food both for him and plants.
- Always keep an eye out for animals that may approach the island
- Perhaps early on, make a spear. Spears are incredibly useful; people can fish with spears, you can lean on it if you get tired, and in the case your only food option comes to be a shark or something you have a potential weapon to catch it.

A lot more preparations you could do, but yeah. You can't just assume the owner is going to come around soon - he might have forgotten about the island or even specifically wanting to test to see whether Eliezer Yudkowsky can escape by himself.

A further note: thinking is energetically expensive too, and you have extremely limited food. Just slowly and carefully doing one of the first things that come to mind until you get better ideas seems like a good way to start.

** [Reverse Munchkin] A Hive mind entity is capable of taking over dead bodies. It is also capable of taking over living bodies but the consciousness within can fight them so, optimally, dead bodies.

This Hive mind has the capability to send its people through time via FTL that is commonplace in setting. The only thing stopping causality breaking completely is a complicated series of laws for inter-stellar navigation, the suppression of the knowledge that FTL=TT, a police force to enforce these laws, and an extra dimension or two for time to fit all the extra universe in.

The Hive mind can only spread information to itself "in person" though. Signals still travel at c, and are ElectroMagnetic in nature, but you can't spread information to alternate histories or back in time without going there first.

The entity is bloodborne and needs to be able to maintain body pressure. Wounds causing massive loss of blood are fatal to that body, but the blood is still infectious and awake. The entity does not require a nervous system, and the only way to tell them apart from humans for sure is the lack of neural activity. The entity is capable of being quite personable.

The Hive entity is bent on "Temporal Anarchy" in that everything should play out as close to "natural" as possible. This is obviously bad because we die. The entity is hippocritical though and does not realise it. Think of it as an AI where ("This History" - "My home history")**2 is your cost function. It is very much a non-human mind.

Going back in time creates new histories rather than overwriting anything, and once you leave a timeline you can go back but Bill and Ted Rules apply. (San Deemas Time, TV Tropes) Time will have passed then as it has passed now.

Your resources:

-A similar entity that, for moral reasons will only inhabit one body at a time and requires permission from the previous occupant. The utility function for this entity is essentially Prefferential Utilitarianism but it understands it can be wrong sometimes and will usually accept advice from you. When one body dies this entity uses technology to send a signal out and using that as a beacon, sends another iteration of itself in to replace it.

-The ability to time travel yourself

-The ability to manipulate EM fields pretty much as precisely as Heisenberg will allow with the power output of a small nuclear power plant. Power requirements scale exponentially with precision.

-Hard Sci-fi weaponry. Think handheld railguns, bullets that break skin but not metal, shockthrowers.

How do we kill it? Or prevent it from enacting its goals permanently?

Aegis's power should be uniquely suited to dealing with Bonesaw's modifications without rejecting them, allowing for crazy tinkertech additions. If necessary, Bonesaw could teach Dragon to do biotinkering as well.\\
7. Aegis/Oliver approach Scion, and convince him to begin a new kind of Cycle. If they succeed, the world is saved. We can design a utopian future that projects humanity into the stars, and eventually humanity can become the collective Thinker in a new Entity Pair.\\
8. If they fail and Scion does Gold Morning, then get Panacea to break Aegis/Oliver (just like she did to Taylor) and fight scion straight up. His power is adapting his own body to stay physically effective, but it (I think) also works on mind attacks so his jail broken power should be pretty costly/slow for Scion to destroy. If I think it's necessary, I could get Bonesaw to graft Perdition onto the gestalt as well.\\
9. If that doesn't work, I can probably pull off a backup plan by teaming Scapegoat, Panacea, and a duplicator cape (Spawn or Furcate, preferably) along with Yangban-Null (power sharing), Yangban-Two (power magnifying) and any power-granting Trump (Teacher preferably).]]

[[#s][I'd probably also pull some real bullshit by teaming up Teacher, Noelle, and Valefor (or some other mind-altering Master). Together, they can clone key capes and keep the clones from being /too/ evil.\\
If the Mind-Altering Master doesn't end up being enough, Dragon can learn brain surgery from Bonesaw.]]
