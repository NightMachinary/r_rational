***** There's really no bottom to that particular well, but in a nutshell:

0 - The Fool: The novice at the beginning of the journey. Inexperience and naÃ¯vetÃ©, but unlimited potential.

I - The Magician: Wielder of knowledge. Resourcefulness, willpower, creation. Reasonably strong mythological associations with Hermes.

II - The High Priestess: Keeper of more subtle arts. Intuition, mystery, sacred knowledge. Minor association with the Torah.

III - The Empress: Motherhood. Femininity, fertility, the gentler side of the natural world. Minor associations with Isis.

IX - The Hermit: Inner search for knowledge. Self-reflection, introspection, analysis.

X - Wheel of Fortune: Luck and fate. Destiny, good fortune, the inevitability of change.

XVI - The Tower: Greatness brought low. Upheaval, disaster, hubris. /Strong/ associations with the Tower of Babel.

XX - Judgement: Rebirth. Absolution, healing, aftermath of the reckoning.

--------------

Juniper (like most protagonists) is an easy fit for The Fool, but I like Juniper-as-DM for Magician and he wears that hat too. Amaryllis is tricky since her outward persona might be more associated with The Chariot or Strength, but she has that maternal side that comes out every so often when circumstances allow, which works with Empress. I'd probably give Fenn the Death card for a long list of non-obvious associations, but the overt interpretation can't help but be too ham-fisted to overlook. After that it's like a 4-way tie IMO, but Wheel of Fortune is on that list and works for me. Grak, Solace, and Valencia are obvious enough fits that I can't really comment, except maaaaybe to acknowledge that there's an alternative (mediocre) argument to give Solace The Hierophant for its bridging of the mundane and divine. Bethel for The Tower works to an unfortunate degree so far, but we'll see where that goes in the future...

******* The Lovers' straightforward focus on interpersonal relationships - particularly romance - has some clear play, but I feel like it's ultimately a one-dimensional take on Fenn's role in the story. Ditto with how her role in the party dynamic works with The Sun's symbolism as a source of positivity and vitality.

The more I think about it though, the more I think I'm coming around on The Moon - the themes of trickery and deception fit for the self-appointed party rogue, and the internal themes of suppressed anxiety and insecurity work with her character arc before its conclusion. And the link to Celestar is blunt, but valid.

One criticism though, if you had looked at historical armor, specifically full plate which is what the story implies they wear, certainly amaryllis, very likely juniper. It would have fit better. I don't think grak's axe is double headed, mostly because double headed axes are kind of silly and were rarely if ever done historically..

**** Not my point.. There's an optimal way to cover the human body in metal plates that's based on our anatomy and physics. Historical armor is an easy shortcut to making armor design that makes actual sense, is functional and looks good.

Juniper on this picture for instance can't raise his shoulders, nor can't he bend his back forward. While the armor itself provides very little in way of coverage. Upper arms exposed, most of the legs, neck etc..

***** Somewhere on Aerb there's probably entad armour in the form of an actual chainmail bikini, that people still wear [[https://www.oglaf.com/breastplate/][because entad]]. The forge frenzy doesn't guarantee a result that's best-practice.

(Though, if Juniper couldn't bend forward that would probably have come up in text.)

That's fine and i've no problem with it. From the description of Amaryllis armor for instance, it's at least to me clearly full plate. Sure you could design and make it look different overhaul, but if you want it to be functional there are still articulation points you have to account for.

Humans spent actual centuries figuring out and designing optimized armor and weapons on earth, they look cool, are functional, effective, light, breathable, heat resistant etc.
