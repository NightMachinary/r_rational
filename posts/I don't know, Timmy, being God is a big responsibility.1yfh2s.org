  Each universe affects the next one subtly differently. But somewhere down the line the whole thing simply has to approach a point of stability, a point where each universe behaves exactly like the one simulating it.

I'd be curious as to why that should be the case. Loops of arbitrary length are a definite possibility. Or you could have, simply, pretty much anything.

*** This thing obviously isn't possible in our universe, at least it's very, very unlikely, so maybe the difference in the laws of physics causes this stable feedback loop in this universe? If something like this turned out to be true, it would have *huge* implications on the information theory and it's hard to know without further study what the ramifications would be.

**** She /made/ that machine and has to know a hell of a lot how it works so I would trust her judgement on this. She /could/ be wrong though.

*** Repeating attractors are definitely possible (albeit less likely). I think she was dumbing down the point to make it easier to understand, since they were clearly in a point attractor.
