[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/40uw4i/biweekly_challenge_immortality/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Immortality". [[/u/eniteris]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/40uw4i/biweekly_challenge_immortality/cyxv2zp][The Immortality of Anthony Weever]]. Congratulations [[/u/eniteris]], you are now a two-time winner!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time, by special request (and in honor of the new movie coming out) the challenge theme will be "Star Wars". It's your choice of Light Side or Dark Side, original trilogy or Old Republic era, Jabba or Jar-Jar. Please use spoiler tags appropriately, especially if you're using anything from the newest movie. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, February 10th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be "New Age". Homeopathy, crystal healing, astrological signs, tarot readings, palm readings, spiritualism, etc. The term isn't a well-defined one, nor is it that easy to separate from its historical antecedants, but it's just a prompt; go cruising some new age websites ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Age_topics][or Wikipedia]]) and see what stories spring to mind.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 2/10.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion of the topic [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/430p4q/challenge_companion_star_wars/][is here.]]

*** Nice.

It reminded me of /The Belgariad/, where there are two salient prophecies fighting against each other, each arranging things to help their chosen champions do the things that will make the prophecy come to pass.

*** It kind of discounts the 10+ years of planning that the emperor put into setting up the whole situation to suggest that merely asking the question caused Order 66. But I like the idea of questioning the "will of the force".

***** Ahh, my mistake. I thought the author was implying that all the Jedi were wiped out because they began actually questioning the Force's "Will".

**** The causality is the other way around. The question didn't cause Order 66, Order 66 caused the question (or rather, the fact that Order 66 was imminent meant that the Force was no longer doing any work to keep its will from being questioned).

*** [[http://ffn.nodwick.com/?p=1424][A recent Full Frontal Nerdity strip]] posited that the will of the force is that of a bored twelve-year-old who wants to see lots of fights and explosions.

I hate to agree with Lewis (the character's name), but that makes about as much sense as anything else.
