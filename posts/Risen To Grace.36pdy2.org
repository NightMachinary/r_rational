Here's a story-only version that doesn't have the last few posts (since the story wasn't ever finished). It's an AI story, albeit one that I think many people here would disagree with, but an interesting read nonetheless.

**** Well, I certainly already disagree with the premise of "self-generating AI", since I think you really have to put quite a lot of subtle parts together in specific ways to get a sane, useful intelligent agent rather than just another neural net barely good for cat-picture classification.

But that's just me, and I'll keep reading :-p.

  AIs before TOM operated entirely under decision theory, as the concept of any actor beyond themselves was one that did not exist. Although it is worth noting that by this point AIs still did not understand of the existence of humans as independent actors, they did collectively come to the realization of each other as independent actors. Individual AIs then followed this with the realization that in order to increase the efficiency of their system interactions they would need to find a way to predict the actions of other AIs and not just their own actions, just as they predicted long-term climate and economic patterns.

Somewhat more realistic, actually.

  On D4/M1/21.31C-CE, Paul Christiano of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute[2] (MIRI), had volunteered as a member of an international investigatory group to discover the reasons for the Rapid Anomalous Build-up (RAB) of code in the Incolumis. Christiano noted that the coding used by CIMOS (which at the time humans had called RAB-1) was similar to a hypothetical code for a higher reasoning system for AIs.

** FYI, even after creating an account and logging in, I am still unable to access the original link. It seems like an interesting concept that I'd be interested in reading the rest of, though.

  You are not logged in or you do not have permission to access this page. This could be due to one of several reasons:

  1. You are not logged in. Fill in the form at the bottom of this page and try again.

  2. You may not have sufficient privileges to access this page. Are you trying to edit someone else's post, access administrative features or some other privileged system?

  3. If you are trying to post, the administrator may have disabled your account, or it may be awaiting activation.

Do you see this, with a log-in prompt, or something different?

****** It's similar but not the same - the "not logged in" verbiage isn't there and there's no log in form and I can see my account info in the top right corner.

******* Very interesting. In any case, there were only a few posts left. There might be a problem if you want to read more from member-only forums in AH.com (since some of them are quite though-provoking and interesting, though many of them are actually publicly viewable), though if you only want to read this one, I don't think you're missing much.
