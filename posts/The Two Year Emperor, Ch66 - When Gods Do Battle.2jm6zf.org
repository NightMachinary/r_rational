** Herrún appears to be a goddess made up by you, so the dad part seems unlikely to be any part of established mythology. So, it's presumably because the books Loki wrote count as his sacrifices. Loki's color is silver which is rare in Grofhamr and the books made a silver color, supporting this.

Loki earlier said that sacrificing to Herrún makes her part you, so this would make her mostly him, in which context the "Hi dad" makes sense, since Loki contributed most of her being. Plus, her diction seems far more casual than in our other meeting with her, which could indicate that Loki had influenced her personality. Could just be because she isn't telling off a mortal though

Also, that god battle was wonderful

Thank you! I wanted to make it clear that Amilsandre was just /way/ more powerful and the best that Loki could do was run and hide.

****** Around what divine rank is Loki? Im guessing it is safe to rule out him being an overdeity. From the number of worshipers I imagine he has I doubt he would have the millions needed for being a greater, but that would limit portfolio sense from seeing the future. Still, I would guess he is an intermediate as future-portfolio sense is hardly necessary for his xanato's gambit with the other magic he has access to.

I would guess that, except...Loki is the god of trickery and has two brain cells to rub together. If he wanted to he could create infinite worshippers within the timespan of a single immediate action and has demonstrated the ability to hide actions from other deities. I wouldnt be suprised if Loki's past chicanery resulted in the majority of the stuff god's have outlawed now.

I think that I will choose to believe Loki's divine rank is more than all the other god's combined (arbitrarily high in fact) and he is simply playing his role here.

So then, to pull a fast one on Loki and have any chance at him not automatically knowing about it, Jake must plan his tricks to take place before the beginning of time or after its end. I think that would be a good start. This being D&D, that isnt actually that difficult. Now, to find a psion and some immovable rods...

******* He's actually fairly low-ranked. Not many people primarily worship a trickster god -- he's part of their pantheon, so he gets some charge off of them, but nothing like from a direct worshipper. He can't directly stop another deity from seeing something, but he can keep setting up things to distract them so that they don't choose to look. That only works for so long, though.

Also, the gods are fairly constrained on what they can do to mortals, and creating new ones is one of the most heavily restricted things. Can't just create new creatures ex nihilo programmed to adore you, and you can't use Dominate Person or direct divine power to force someone to worship you.

******** Well, creating mortals isnt the only trick he could use. He could always use ice assassin proxy investitude to have NI divine ranks as well. Infinite time stop gives him all the time he needs to enact any of a number of omnipotence schemes. Without epic feats, I do not know of any way for others to act within his time stop, making him basically unstoppable once it is cast.

** If throwing something someone else wrote in the sacrificial fire counts as their sacrifice, this seems like an incredibly powerful ability. If someone writes a note to a subordinate about some plan and you get it, you could wipe their memory of the plan altogether. Or, if someone you dislike is an expert in a field and wrote a book on it, you could sacrifice their book and wipe out most of their knowledge

*** I don't think that's necessarily what would happen. If I'm remembering correctly, you can sacrifice knowledge but sacrificing a secret is MUCH more powerful. So you could sacrifice the note but it wouldn't wipe the memory. If this is the case then I'd assume that Loki didn't sacrifice all his knowledge as a secret, as he would then lose it, but his knowledge is so extensive that even sacrificing it just as knowledge still outweighs everyone else.

  you can also sacrifice random pieces of knowledge. Just make sure that it's actually something that matters, and be prepared for the fact that you won't be able to learn it again---even if someone came up and told you what it was that you sacrificed, you wouldn't be able to understand them.
