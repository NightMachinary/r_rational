My google-fu is failing me. :( Does anyone remember a story, which I think was originally at Less Wrong, of a robot that had been tasked with preserving the cryogenically frozen heads of it's ten human creators? The world goes to hell, and in the post-apocalyptic hellscape the robot figures it can keep these heads preserved about 100 years. 10 years later it runs into a much larger robot that's preserving 200 heads. It says that it can preserve the smaller robot's 10 heads, in addition to it's own 200, for approximately 3000(?) years, if the smaller robot is willing to disassemble itself right now so the larger robot can use it for parts.

Anyone recall this, or what it was called, or have a link to it?


** Sounds like it's possibly an example used in the Sequences.

*** I doubt it. I recently read through all (I think) of the sequences, and it doesn't ring a bell.

*** I've certainly never seen it there, and I doubt it exists there, since Eliezer usually wouldn't be /quite/ so cliched about his scifi.

**** Cliched, really? That doesn't sound at all cliched.

** Did you look [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics][here?]] Nothing stuck out to me, but I only skimmed it.

*** It wouldn't have been in the Cryonics Sequence, it was an analogy, meant to question if our purpose is to pass on our genes, is that even something we want to embrace?

**** Yeah, but at the very least it has a link to all posts tagged 'cryonics,' and a story containing cryonics, even if it wasn't the primary arc, might be tagged such.

** I recall something like that in one of the FiO spinoffs, which I think was one of the uncompleted ones.

** Was it written by Yudkowski? I'm sure you can ask him directly in that case.
