** Started reading this, and I'm a little concerned. As a honest to goodness transgirl I've seen stories like this devolve into just fetish fuel one to many times and I hope that this story is not going to head in that direction.

*** May I ask for your opinion on another story that's been posted to [[/r/rational]], "S.I.", which also involves changes to sex and/or gender (among other things)?

**** I think it's been pretty tastefully done so far, which I appreciate. Bunny definitely has some signs of dysphoria that I can relate to, although coming from the other direction. My one 'hope' is that Bunny doesn't magically become better through acceptance of their new body. I know it's cruel to wish that on a character, but that would be the cheap way out in my opinion.

(My opinion may not be the correct opinion, your mileage may vary.)

Bunny may 'accept' her body, in at least a tactical sense, over the available alternatives; but I don't expect her various and varied psychological issues to change because of that.

#+end_quote

To a large extent, writing is mostly about being cruel to the characters. If nothing bad happens to the protagonist, then where's the story?

****** True, writing may be about that, but reading? I should be feeling more empathy towards someone in that position, knowing how horrid dysphoria really is. It's a trade off between my empathy and my wanting realism I guess. :P

*** Any advice to avoid it being less authentic in the way you describe would be greatly appreciated. I've become quite aware I'm probably the equivelant of "low potential for dysphoria if you managed to swap my physiology around". For a while this made me upset with stories that were focusing on that aspect of the experience. I've been trying to get a good and authentic model of what that's actually like (among several other aspects I seem to differ from others). The intent of this story is to explore these experiences both from a cultural and personal side of things. But present them initially with premise that 'should' initially make some one with your perspective nervous in exactly the way you describe. And for exactly those reasons.

But I don't want it to devolve into what that fear/nervousness expects. I want to subvert that particular expectation.

The deconstruction is not just monster girls, I'm trying out gender roles, sexism, racism, prejudice in general and a few other things about humans That confuse me.

Again any help making that actually happen will be appreciated.

**** I think, after reading Deeprise, that you should be very able to avoid it. Especially with me as a new reader submitting commands I can try and steer it away if need be. :P

I'm not sure what advice I would give right now because I don't want to taint your process too much unnecessarily, so if you have a question feel free to ask I guess?

***** I'm concerned I'm over playing abe's discomfort to cartoonish levels. Otherwise glad for the vote of confidence thanks.
