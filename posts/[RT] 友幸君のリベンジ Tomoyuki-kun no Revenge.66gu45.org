I just thought that it belonged here. The MC isn't stupid and uses his brain to solve his problems.

Disclaimer: not my story, btw. My Fictionpress handle is "Sherlock D Holmes", not "Tomoyuki Tanaka"


** Couldn't get into it. I felt like certain other characters in the first few chapters were transparently idiots, in a way that could only be explained by the plot being more convenient that way.

** I read the whole thing. It was... okay? It's very, very irrational - I enjoy plenty of irrational stories, but this story consistently and egregiously had characters acting in ways that no real person would, and only sometimes for The Plot, which is pretty goddamn threadbare. Honestly, I get the feeling the author is making the whole thing up as he goes and isn't thinking things through.

The story also consistently makes references to various other niche works I haven't read - not enough to affect my understanding of the plot (because I'm not convinced there are any important plot moments to miss) but enough to break immersion and leave me confused.

*** Im not the author but according to his profile, he's a huge fan of the anime medium, and he seemed to have incorporated that into his story.

Honestly, the whole thing reads like an anime. It's good nonetheless

*** as a second note... the title confuses me. 友幸君のリベンジ Tomoyuki-kun no Ribenji? 友幸君の復讐 Tomoyuki's Revenge? The name in kanji, followed by の followed by revenge in katakana confuses me. Granted, my Japanese is like, the definition of amatuerish so maybe I just don't know enough. Also, I believe the poster didnt write this, but that is just a guess.

***** hmm... I guess I understand the meaning and that is probably what is most important. The way he uses the language annoys me though, just enough that it makes me not want to read to much more. (specifically, if everyone is speaking japanese, why are we seeing everything in english except key words? manyh of which have perfectly good english translations.)

"the town looked so urban, with modern buildings, a shoutengai (商店街 or commercial district)" Hell, from what ive seen he means "market"

What is the point of that?

Why does he keep using "amenoshita" which could just be used as "the world"? Or using youkai, kami, and spirits? Why did he call the truck "Truck-kun"? Do I need to know what "chuunibyou" means?Besides trying to teach vocab, it makes me try to figure out what if there is more meaning...

****** Well, Truck-kun is a fairly old meme in the isekai-community. It's a common plot device to whisk the protagonist away from his mundane world by having a truck hit him, subsequently ending his life, allowing him to live out his new life in another world. The thing is: the goddamn truck is so ubiquitous, and has claimed so many lives from so many different anime that they just figured they'd name him Truck-kun.

Chuunibyou is also a fairly common word in the anime community, which basically translates to eight grade syndrome, or the feeling of self-importance that one gets typically at the age of thirteen. Symptoms include heavy delusions of grandeur, escapism, improvised role play and taking up pretentious hobbies.

I mean, Amenoshita is a place separate from our world, so using 'the world' would be very confusing. In fact, the word Amenoshita provides an easier way to distinguish the new world from the old one.

Yeah, the mixing of some really unnecessary japanese words here and there, like the Shoutengai, kinda does set me a little off. It's stupid because, as you said, shopping district or market works just fine.

******* Yeah. IDK. Ill probably give it try later, but this feels like it requires a very high amount of "being an anime fan" to really enjoy, and the main characters reactions seem weird. But I read almost everything on this sub I can.

******** That sums up my feeling pretty well. Although as a magic/monster hobbyist I really really wanna know why he keeps using "Youkai and spirits"
