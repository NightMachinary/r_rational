Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Guys, Beat Saber is /crazy/ good. I got it last Friday and played it every day since except one.

Doing so has actually been a very interesting exercise in watching how I learn. This was a mostly novel experience (I have a handful of other VR games and played Guitar Hero once) that has a good learning curve and utilizes skills that I mostly haven't ever had need to improve (swinging an invisible lightsaber around). It involves a good mix of both high-level coordination ("here comes X formation, need to be sure to get my left hand up in time") and low-level interaction (I can't tell you the number of times that it felt like my arms were moving on their own).

I'm /pretty/ sure (although this could easily be confirmation bias) that I noticed an inherent difference in the way that I could optimally use both right and left arms (I am right handed). When focused on the right hand I would typically do better with that hand, but when I focused on the left it would do /worse/. Focusing back on the right hand would lead to inexplicably accurate left hand usage, if a bit slow and clumsy. This made me think a lot about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8][CGP Grey's "You are Two" video]] about the apparently independent and competent right brain hemisphere, and I wonder how much that has to do with it.

In addition to the apparent competence of the unconscious right brain in particular, this concept sort of applies in general as well. I'm a fairly sedentary person, and playing a very active game for an hour or so every day was a big shift for me. After playing four days in a row, I noted that when I tried to play more I was sluggish and couldn't bring myself to improve speed any further. So I took a day off, figuring that my body needed additional resting time to make up for the change of focus, but coming back to it yesterday gave me a bit of a surprise: not only were my limbs back in working order, but I was able to sit down and complete all five or so Expert levels that so far had /completely/ stonewalled me. And it was /easy/, more or less; 1 try for three of them and only 2 for the other two.

I was left wondering how exactly I had made such a big leap, and I think it has something to do with the rest and giving my brain a chance to encode--it was apparently enough not only for me to have been able to practically master all the sections that I had tried and failed at previously, but the competence to smash the parts that I /hadn't/ played yet either. I was struck with the realization that, as in a lot of ways the brain is a manager or director of the body rather than a master of it, I, me, the algorithm or pattern or layer or whathaveyou that emerges from the brain is only a director of it in part--there are parts that apparently play video games better than I do, and letting them do so is actually somehow a better strategy than me taking the wheel.

** We're coming up on [[http://reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][three years of the (bi)weekly challenge]], and I've been trying to think about how I want to do a "best of" compilation. I've read /most/ of the stories, but don't remember them well enough to just make a list from memory. I also don't want to just have a list of winners, because we've already got that.

I've been trying to think about the pros and cons of different algorithmic methods I might use. Reddit doesn't expose upvotes vs. downvotes, just net votes, which means using the Bayesian formula for "best" is probably out. I don't want to do it by net votes, because that's sort of dependent on how popular the topic was, rather than the distinct qualities of the story (and I wouldn't want to penalize someone who wrote a fantastic story about a prompt that few people were interested in reading about based on the prompt alone).

Is there any way out of just doing simple human curation of a list? Because I don't think that I have the time to do that much rereading. Crowd-sourcing?

*** You could normalise the comment score via some measure of popularity (e.g. sum of all comment scores in thread + sum of votes on post). It's impossible to get rid of all confounding factors, but also unnecessary. There is so little data that any statistics would be quite noisy. Which does not mean it wouldn't be interesting to look at the results, of course, just that it is of no use worrying about details. Maybe grouping them in some fashion (by author being the obvious one) is better. One could use that to bias the probabilities. Which does not feel very satisfactory.

So perhaps statistics could be relegated to a preprocessing role: Select the TopN of stories and throw them into one big thread, then use that data to refine.

*** I tried to come up with a mathematical rule using the net scores, but nothing I thought of was satisfactory.

So, crowd-sourcing...

How about you randomly select some number of challenges, then for each of those you ask the winning author to name their favorite personal submission for any challenge? I imagine authors remember their own stories quite well and are capable of ranking them by quality.

This means a story won't be excluded from the running just because it didn't win or it won an unpopular contest--it just requires that the author won at some point and likes that story more than their winning story. Beyond that, this weights on victories and thus more accurately reflects how favorably the community views that author's work. Popularity is still a factor, but it's popularity of author rather than specific topic or story.

If someone is unreachable you can just go with their highest scoring entry, or choose a different challenge, or you could read all their stories and try to choose the best one. Even without responses this method significantly reduces the amount of reading you have to do.

  Romanization is often termed "transliteration", but this is not technically correct.^{[citation needed]} /Transliteration/ is the direct representation of foreign /letters/ using Latin symbols, while most systems for romanizing Arabic are actually /transcription/ systems, which represent the sound of the language. As an example, the above rendering /munāẓaratu l-ḥurūfi l-ʻarabīyah/ of the Arabic: مناظرة الحروف العربية‎ is a transcription, indicating the pronunciation; an example transliteration would be /mnaẓrḧ alḥrwf alʻrbyḧ/.

In browsing 4chan's /biz/ (nominally "Business and Finance", but actually mostly cryptocurrency) board, I stumbled across [[https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/wiki/FAQ][an interesting twist on distributed consensus]] (bold emphasis added):

        :END:

  #+begin_quote
    [tl;dr:] Holochain and blockchain are built for fundamentally different use cases. Blockchain is relatively good for systems where it's absolutely necessary to maintain global consensus. Holochain is much better than blockchain at anything that requires less than universal consensus (most things): It's faster, more efficient, more scalable, adaptable, and extendable.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has [its] own signed hash chain (countersigned for transactions involving others). After [information] is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT[,] where every node runs the same validation rules ([just as] blockchain nodes all run the same validation rules. If someone breaks those rules, the DHT rejects [that person's] data---[his] chain has forked away from the holochain.

  Every node has a resilient sample of the whole. Like cutting a hologram, if you were to cut a Holochain network in half (make it so half the nodes were isolated from the other half), you would have two whole, functioning systems, not two partial, broken systems.

  This seems to be the strategy used to create resilience in natural systems. For example, where is your DNA stored? Every cell carries its own copy, with different functions expressed based on the role of that cell.

  *Where is the English language stored? Every speaker carries it. People have different areas of expertise, or exposure to different slang or specialized vocabularies. Nobody has a complete copy, nor is anyone's version exactly the same as anyone else, If you disappeared half of the English speakers, it would not degrade the language much.*

  If you keep cutting a hologram smaller and smaller[,] eventually the image degrades enough to stop being recognizable, and[,] depending on the resiliency rules for DHT neighborhoods, holochains would likely share a similar fate[---a]lthough, if the process of killing off the nodes was not instantaneous, the network may be able to keep reshuffling data per redundancy requirements to keep it alive.

** Say you've traveled/moved to a country without jumping through the required hoops and obtaining the necessary paperwork, and are discovered and detained by that country's immigration law enforcement agency. They want to deport you to your country of origin. If you refuse to disclose that information to them -- how do they figure out where to send you? Maybe you claim you've lived here all your life, but have kept to yourself (so there's little corroborating evidence). Would they ballpark it off language/accent? What if your speech is identical to that of a local native speaker? Would they just hold you indefinitely? Send you to a country with very lax immigration policy? What? Can't seem to find a definitive (country-specific) answer on google.

*** In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has the burden of proof to prove alienage. If they can't prove that you're an alien, then the immigration judge will let you go. In the interim, you'll either be out on an immigration bond, or maybe without needing a bond at all, though DHS/ICE will still be keeping track of you.

I don't know how good interdepartmental cooperation is, especially across national lines, but if they suspected that you were from country X, they would probably try to obtain records from there. They would also look at your records within the United States, where they were either available, or could be obtained by warrant.

In theory, you wouldn't be sent to a random country, because the government wouldn't be able to pass the burden of proof that you're actually an alien. You'd need to dig into the case law to find the edges of what's accepted as passing that burden though.

**** It is probably worth considering the controversies around whether immigration courts actually follow due process. The justice department can review every ruling, judges can be fired for not working fast enough, and many defendants are not guaranteed legal counsel.

The law may place the burden of proof on the government, but the legal system is heavily biased in their favor and frequently incentivizes delivering a guilty verdict as soon as possible with relatively little evidence. That's all before taking into account the biases of the lawyers and judges.

I'll be taking up a full time job to keep myself occupied and out and about. But what really worsens things is when I have time to just think.

*** Juggling worked for me. The initial hump is being able to juggle three balls, which should take less than a week, and maybe as little as a day. After that, there are always new tricks to learn. I find that it takes just enough attention that I can have something on in the background (television or podcasts). It's also good for both indoors and outdoors, and there are usually juggling organizations if you're in a mid-sized city. Pretty cheap too, until you start getting specialist equipment.

It's much more common for me to have the "this speaks to me and of me in a way that nothing else does" for books though, which I think is usually the direction that people are gesturing in when they talk about "representation".

The first time brought me to tears. Edward from Edward Scissorhands. His complete lack of knowledge of social cues and inability to communicate well with others really struck home with me. Im always left sobbing at the end when he's forced to live in the mansion all alone with no one to care about him. It just hits me on a base level by magnifying all my fears and self image.

On a more comical note. Marty from The Cabin in the Woods. Im not really a stoner but all the ways he reacts to everything going on around him is how I would react, which is totally the point of his character. Also, that inevitable acceptance of failure at the end is me too.

** I think I'm the kind of person who would not like the tabletop RPG [[https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/invisible-sun-preorder/][Invisible Sun]]. The mechanics don't serve my kind of fun, the setting is so weird that I don't know how to create anything with it, and the story demands an imagination that is utterly beyond the scope of mine.

The game is like Harry Potter meets The Matrix with the aesthetic of a surrealist version of 1920s Paris, but loses me when it turns out to be explicitly anti-rational. It's a pretentious Changeling Fantasy where the “real world” actually runs on mysteries with vague answers and unknowable magic, but does not defy the culture of wealthy white privilege that these ideas are a product of.

However, I freaking love the people who play this game. I want to have that kind of whimsical love of creating mysteries for the sake of being mysteries and imagining life in a weird fantasy world in my life. Seeing that magic in others is enrapturing and I just want to experience the act of weaving that magic with them. The escapism is meaningful to them and that resonates with me.

I don't think I wish I was the kind of person who loved the game since I associate that mentality with my New Age pseudoscience/conspiracy theorist-believing teenage self. Uncovering the magical secrets of reality isn't escapist fun for me, it's a painful reminder of something I used to believe and the real life horror of anti-science cults.

So the distance I get from listening to podcasts like [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3-PonsBj4qPT1FNluLQCj9bIPy-9bHns][A Woman With Hollow Eyes]], especially when they are better at straddling the line between fantasy and reality than I was, is something I never knew I wanted. I want to follow everything that happens in the community of Invisible Sun so I can keep exploring this side of myself in a safe space.
