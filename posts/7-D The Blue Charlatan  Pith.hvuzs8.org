Another excellent chapter by [[/u/madwhitesnake]]

*Synopsis*

All humans possess a Pith, the essence of a mind where consciousness, reason, and emotion reside. Those who study its power can control their surroundings, move from body to body, and alter the very fabric of another's thoughts.

In a dying empire surrounded by enemies, two rejects from their city's magic academy become mercenaries:

Ana, an idealistic girl trapped in a body with a terminal illness.

Wes, an arrogant noble exiled from his family, his name wiped from his memory.

As they fight for their lives and face moral quandaries, they must forge their identities in a world where the human soul is a tool, a canvas, and the deadliest weapon of them all.

Be careful what you wish for. Because wow standing over a girl in bed so you can hassle her over having a friend you hate because of a beef she's clueless about while also admitting that you were spying on her is an ass-kicking offence if I ever saw one.

This is what they call in industry parlance /'Cruising for a bruising'/.

*** Not just that, but he /knows/ all the shit that's going on in her life. He knows about how her body is breaking down (he literally just witnessed her nearly drowning in her own blood), he knows she only has the one friend outside of Queen Sulphur, he knows that it used to be two friends until she helped Kaplen /commit suicide,/ he knows how his own betrayal hurt her, he knows Tasia is basically the only good thing she has going for her right now, and he has the audacity to say this shit to her?

Wes is the worst, most toxic combination of self-loathing and self-centered and I want to slap him in his entitled fucking face.

**** The author must be sick of being compared to/mistaken for Wildbow by now but this is something she's managing to do really well with when it comes to Wes. Something I noticed first in Pact (1st chapter, family argument), and then in Ward and Pale were how the characters I immediately despised seemed... real? Like they weren't stock characters WB had constructed, more like people I could imagine meeting, people I feel like I /could/ have met at some point and left a vague impression on me. Believably evil, not unambiguously evil. Wes is a case where I can understand his entire thought process and where he's coming from and also see why it's so difficult to get him to change, and that's something that's difficult to do.

***** I think this writer does this kind of thing better than Wildbow in a sense. Because Wildbow's dialogue tends to be kinda indirect and roundabout, characters feel like they carefully choose their words even when it doesn't fit what they're trying to say. Here Wes is just coming out and spewing dumb shit like you'd expect an S-Tier dickhead would.

  But the reality is, we score higher on tests of intelligence.  If any of you whiners tried to make it in Paragon classes, you'd crash and burn within a week.

I found this bit interesting, sounds pretty familiar to some IQ related arguments I've heard in real-life politics but, the problem is, projectors probably have higher IQ's not just for socio-economic reasons (though that's undoubtedly a contributor) but Praxis vocations that can literally make them think faster, multi-task, improve pattern matching abilities, and who knows what else (they probably have access to better mental health therapies as well). I've always thought it would be interesting to see how these issues might play out if there was actually a significant, innate/genetic, difference between two human demographics.

Thanks for the chapter.

As a counter argument, I would like to remind you of the fact that Wes exists.

Yeah exactly, when I read Wes's first chapter it reminded me really strongly of my own experience with ADHD before I was diagnosed. I kept thinking, if only there was a Pith-equivalent of ritalin, most of the story wouldn't have unfolded in the way it did.

**** Ya, let me amend that, they probably should have access to better mental health therapies (at the very least, crippling PTSD could be 'cured' with targeted memory wipes). Without even speculating on whisper or praxis vocations we haven't seen yet, I'm kind of surprised some combination of nudging and aversion therapy doesn't exist to combat addiction (targeted memory wipes would likely have some potential here as well, even if it's just to remove the memory of how to counter nudging).

** I'm kind of skeptical that the gang could still be alive if the terrorists have someone who can listen in on their conversations /that/ easily. I think Tunnel Vision is maybe bluffing on some front. Like, maybe she has a power that lets her detect when someone mentions her name, but she doesn't actually know where Ana's home is.

Otherwise, great chapter. People calling Wes out on his shit is always a pleasure.

*** I think it's pretty clear that Tunnel Vision /has/ to have that level of information on Queen Sulphur, considering the stunt she pulled with the payphones just to have this conversation. However, I think you can square this with the fact that Ana and company haven't been murdered in their homes yet by saying this is a recent development.

It seems perfectly plausible that to me that the Pyre Witch, one of the most powerful and feared projectors currently alive, could find Ana pretty easily if she wanted to. However, it seems equally plausible to me that she doesn't have the time or inclination to chase down every two-bit thug and mercenary who inconveniences her underlings in some way. She's probably got bigger fish to fry and leaves problems on the level of "the Blue Charlatan" to the dumb muscle she employs. Unfortunately for Ana, that calculation likely changed once she personally saw the Pyre Witch doing Pyre Witchey things. At that point, she had enough information to be worth Tunnel Vision's personal attention, especially since she was in the area anyway so it wasn't really inconveniencing her to look into it.

And yes, Wes getting called on his shit is so incredibly satisfying. Here's hoping it sticks this time.

*** The obvious implication here is that one of them, wittingly or otherwise, is betraying them to Tunnel Vision.

They could also be bugged.

Heck, one of them may well be Tunnel Vision. Piths can easily swap between bodies.

** It's been kind of funny so far how Wes's riches-to-rags-to-riches plot arc has been working in opposition to his character development. In order to retain his motivation for an Ousting Round Two, he needs retain the feeling that he was wronged and that he deserved his aristocratic position in the first place. But in order to develop into someone we can cheer for, he needs to develop into someone who's moved beyond the ideology of superiority driving him right now. Very nice tension, I feel like we're finally making progress. The author constructed this really nicely.
