** I like this story, even though I haven't read the manga or watched the anime. Great fight scenes, and the story /goes places/.

I must make the Obligatory Sex Warning. So, so much sex, with basically every tag and trigger you can imagine. (Some may consider this a bonus.)

*** Lol. Kind of funny how much of that you can find on FF.net, even though theoretically they have banned smut. I started reading "Winter Comes" the other day, a GoT self-insert in which a protagonist from our world gets isekai'd into the body of the Night King at the moment of his creation by the Children of the Forest. Interesting story, but then it randomly drops on you lots of random explicit sex scenes - and they're all pretty cringe XD.

***** This gets reposted in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] a fair bit. There's a lot of discussion of some things that seem to make it one of the subs guilty pleasures, but can often be summed up as "I like this lots, and a stack of trigger warnings. ". A lot of the discussion beyond that about what's wrong with the story looks like outgroup vs outgroup discussions if you've seen it a few times.

** I have profoundly mixed feelings on this story. On the plus side, it's completed, it hits a lot of my buttons (non naruto MC, timeloop, challenging plot, proactive protagonist), and it is a genuinely pretty good fusion of the settings.

On the other hand, the story (and the narration, too, it's not just unreliable narrator) is skeevy as hell, it is very much not rational, and it devolves into mindless power fantasy for quite frankly too long in between the good bits; I can appreciate some power fantasy, but it really ends up getting in the way of the story. There's also an annoying amount of bashing, but at least some of that /is/ unreliable narrator.

Overall, a decent enough story but not one I've ever been able to get myself to reread.

*** Yup. He also did the /Fimbulwinter/ series.

/Fimbulwinter/ has a lot more power-up munchkinry. It's not /actually/ litRPG but it's written like one. It's also an unabashed red-pill harem fantasy, which I found grating. I still enjoyed it enough to read the whole thing, but I suspect the average [[/r/rational]] reader wouldn't like it.

 

/Perilous Waif/ has some pretty good sci-fi worldbuilding. The premise is that AI only reaches human levels (+ there's some FTL stuff) but the rest of technology progresses at a good pace. So everything is made of 3D-printed nanomaterials and everyone can afford a half-dozen catgirl android slaves, but it's still a relatable pre-singularity society.

The story is essentially /Alita/, so if you liked that manga/movie and you're not bothered by some background sex slaves, I recommend it.

**** Oh don't get me started on Fumbulwinter. It's just an unoriginal Isekai, harem anime. It is the epitome of everything I hate about male fantasies. Men shouldn't be able to just have power given to them. That's not how real life works and it devalues women. When men have these fantasies it strips them of their drive to treat women with respect and become better men as it is satisfied by their imagination. Men start believing these fantasies and treating everyone, especially women, around them exactly like they have power over them. It doesn't help that the video game industry feeds these monsters. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=752&v=HGBB_uSRADc][I wrote a blog post]] about why I hate fumbulwinter because this it what it does it appeals to the male fantasy.

I smiled as I pulled away. "That's what I thought. Hinata, if you actually wanted me to let you go I would, because I love you and I want you to be happy. But unless you change your mind someday our bargain stands. You're mine, and whenever I want to I'm going to carry you off to do terrible... twisted... wicked things to you, and make you love every second of it."

"Oh!" She shuddered delicately, her breasts pressing into mine. "Yes," she breathed. "That's what I want!"

I chuckled. "That's my girl. How can you be such a ruthless killer, and still be such a sub?"

are you... sure? about that?

Personally I find this stuff very tolerable, practically didn't notice it first time, but I think people understate it way more than appropriate.

#+end_quote

Though note that it's only consensual as in "nobody said no". There are a number of occurrences of "sex magic" used as a weapon (where the victim would have refused consent if they had a clear enough head to do so), and a couple of instances of rape by false identity.

(Like [[/u/Putnam3145]], I found this very tolerable. It's all minor events in a kick-ass story of rival ninjas. It's just when checking for trigger warnings that I realise how much there is.)

** Called [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/originality]["the greatest of all Naruto fanfictions"]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky, /Time Braid/ is the story of Sakura, an ordinary genin (novice ninja) who is killed partway through her promotion exam and wakes up in her bed the next morning. Now stuck in a time loop, Sakura must solve the mystery behind her situation and find a way to pass an exam she was barely prepared for, even if she has to die over and over again to do so.

/Time Braid's/ minimalist writing style is fascinating to study from a writer's perspective, and makes the story incredibly fast paced -- /Time Braid/ goes through more plot in four chapters than most book series do in forty. Part of this is that SharperV is writing fanfiction, so he can assume we are familiar with the story of Naruto and show us only the diffs between his novel and way things went in the original anime/manga -- but note that there are many, many fanfic authors who would make us sit through their tedious novelization of stuff we already saw in canon instead.

/Time Braid/ is also notable for [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2xapv9/d_so_im_up_to_ch27_of_mother_of_learning_spoilers/][being the inspiration]] for [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][/Mother of Learning/]] (along with maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][/Chuning Exam Day/]], but it's hard to tell because /Time Braid/ was itself inspired by /Chunin Exam Day/). Zorian is Sakura, Zach is Naruto with Sasuke's backstory, QI is Orochimaru, they're all stuck in a one-month loop that ends with an invasion, etc.

If people typically get their information 2nd or 3rd or 4th hand and every person along the line adds in their conclusions without making it clear that it's just a conclusion, chances are someone says something misleading, which the next person turns into something that's wrong.
