  Can you imagine a story where a man lies in wait to assassinate the five masters of the American Board of Ritual Magic even as they are plotting to kill him, confounds their ritual, bursts out of the trap-door to their wine cellar at the most theatrical possible moment, raises his staff made of a rare and exotic wood that grows only his far-off homeland -- and then dies ignominiously, shot by a security guard before he even can even get a word in edgewise? No? You can't imagine the story ending that way? Neither can Reality. That was Dylan Alvarez's secret. He always tried to be the protagonist of whatever story he was in, and the protagonist never dies.
#+end_quote

For the record, I can /absolutely/ imagine a story like that, because from the security guard's point of view it's an archetypal Call to Adventure where the Naive Newcomer is thrust into a World He Does Not Understand.

Can you imagine a story where a security guard is sitting around on a sleepy night with a vague sense of foreboding about the strange people in grey cloaks, then hears some shots fired and goes to investigate? Him shooting a man who leads a terrorist organization sounds exactly like it's the start of a traditional monomyth adventure (to me, anyway).

******** It was my understanding that "ragtag" refers to the makeup of the group, not the characteristics of the individuals within the group. Almost all D&D parties consist of a ragtag bunch of misfits and most contain someone of lawful good alignment.

A billionaire inventor, a psychic gorilla, a street thug with a cold gun, and an alien artificial intelligence are ragtag because they're so lacking in uniformity. And the Legion of Doom has a lot more people in it that are even less similar to each other in terms of traits and personality (Bizarro, Solomon Grundy, Scarecrow, Toyman, etc.).

Both produced the same couple centimeters of rainfall, even though Amdusias was a Great King of Hell who had been known to occultism for hundreds of years." Does this mean that they are right, or does it mean that there are so many demons in hell it doesn't matter what name you say?

#+end_quote

The point is that whether you say the name of a powerful demon or a totally made-up word, you get the same amount of rainfall.

Which makes it seem as though the theatricality of the invocation matters more than whether the name you invoke actually refers to anything.

***** Did you just unironically use the phrase "through sheer coincidence" in reference to this story?

If we're positing alternative explanations as to why the two invocations produced the same effect, then --- given the Agloe anecdote with which the chapter began --- far more likely is that the invocation of 'Crhvano' in some sense caused the existence of a real demon Crhvano. Though now that I write it out, I'm not actually sure that qualifies as an /alternative/ explanation.

***** Reminds me of Bell's Inequality Experiment.

(quote from the "Simplest proof of Bell's inequality" by Lorenzo Maccone)

#+begin_quote
  If we want to be extremely pedantic in enumerating the hypothesis at the basis of Bell's theorem, we must also request

  1. that our choice of which experiment to perform is independent of the properties of the object to be measured (technically, “freedom of choice” or “no super-determinism”): e.g., if we decided to measure the color of red objects only, we would falsely conclude that all objects are red;

  2. that future outcomes of the experiment do not influence which apparatus settings were previously chosen (whereas clearly the apparatus settings will influence the outcomes): a trivial causality requirement (technically, “measurement independence”).

  These two hypothesis are usually left implicit because science would be impossible without them.
#+end_quote

This line of reasoning makes me doubt that the science is possible in the world of Unsong.
