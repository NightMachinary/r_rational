Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** In case other folks miss Elemental Arena as much as I do, here's an update from the author from the comments on the latest chapter on RoyalRoad. Posted 16 days ago:

#+begin_quote
  Mini update:

  I wanted to let everyone know I have finished editing chapters 1 through 16 for book one and the new versions have been updated. I am currently editing chapter 17.

  I had to take a break for a couple months mainly due to issues with my personal schedule rather than anything book related. But I am back working again as of a couple weeks ago. In fact, taking a break has been helpful since I'm now looking at the material with fresh eyes and able to see the material more objectively.

  As for the first sixteen edited chapters, I have reduced the book count from 670 to 640 pages. Most authors I have talked with say they do a 10% cut during editing, and so far I am close to doing similar. Cutting extraneous words, redundant sentences, pointless musings, etc. really adds up. Additionally, I combined/cut a few scenes that were repetitive. My hope is that this will vastly improve the reading experience, plus it has been a really good learning experience for me as a writer.

  As for plot changes, nothing major has changed and the stats have been left untouched. But a few of the character arcs have been tweaked, most notably in my scaling back of the romantic tension between Nathan and Maya in the early scenes. I have long felt my execution was totally off in that area, and I am a lot more satisfied with things evolving more naturally now. Iliya's name has been changed to Illiana as well. I have received a lot of feedback from readers, and in places where I agreed, I have made some adjustments.

  So for now, I am finishing up the editing for the last nine chapters and then I will switch back to working on book two. Thanks!

If its so obvious that it'll be discovered again very soon by peers, you'll have to coordinate a moratorium, like real human biologists have done on certain forms of research.

If its so obvious and easy to do by laypeople that it'll be all over the internet next week, take up as much credit as you can and emergency buy a prepper bunker in the Rocky Mountains.

****** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA][NERVA]]*

The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) was a nuclear thermal rocket engine development program that ran for roughly two decades. Its principal objective was to "establish a technology base for nuclear rocket engine systems to be utilized in the design and development of propulsion systems for space mission application". NERVA was a joint effort of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and was managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) until the program ended in January 1973. SNPO was led by NASA's Harold Finger and AEC's Milton Klein.

*** I mean, that's not all that unrealistic. Replace plutonium with hydrogen deuterium produced by electrolysis, uranium extracted from a decent amount of soil, and a laser refinement process, and one reasonably large kitchen could probably fit the setup.

(So yes, we're all doomed)

If it helps, any actual explosion would be swiftly detected by essentially every nation on earth by reading the myriad "geological" sensors scattered around the planet to sense just such incidents - so no testing etc possible really.

I would think your character bringing this to the authorities would probably result in not much surprise (once you've gone suitably high up the chain of command), and a mild invitation into the conspiracy of the ugly truth - that it's all a giant matchbox, dreading tech maturing too much while simultaneously hoping for perfect surveillance to save us all. You might be able to tell a pretty good story of the main character being very paranoid of being watched or hunted down, but then realizing there's not really much of anything behind the curtain to stop this stuff - and maybe choosing to try to save the world somehow on his own.

Also, if it helps, nuke-proof architecture appears to be doable, affordable, and probably not even that gaudy - it's just not quite the traditional American Way, so you don't see it too often. They make large buildings with it though already - the AT&T building in NYC I believe (?) - could be misremembering. If attacks ever arose again as a big concern, I reckon you'd see the world springing the few billion to retrofit and shift to new architectures.

** Is anyone else upset/disappointed by how many people give up on things by default? Where people encounter a challenge, find it difficult or fail, then take away from it that they can't do it in the future?

The biggest one's that bother me are "physical" such vacations with walking or stairs and when people are moving houses. They realize that these things have gotten harder for them over time and just decide by default that they need to avoid them in the future. I understand if they think it's not worth the hassle or the time, but these are usually things where a small amount of preparation would make them easy and would improve your life. I can't imagine not being able to walk several flights of stairs, several miles, or move my stuff out of a house and not trying to regain those abilities if it's reasonable. It especially grates on my nerves since there are people older and physically disadvantaged that can do all of these things. Maybe it's because I'm relatively young but if something is difficult but necessary or enjoyable I try to figure out how to make it easier, not how to avoid it entirely. Or especially if I think something would be enjoyable if it wasn't so difficult. Those ones bother me the most, but I also encounter this with people who are "just bad at things" like "computers" even when they have to use them all the time. I've learned it doesn't help to voice this opinion, even with friends and family, since it makes them feel judged and I won't change their minds.

*** I always espouse the 'hacker' ethos towards problem solving that I've found helps with this. A lot of the time people give up because they grasp some amount of the technical breadth an issue has, and the effort needed to acquire the domain knowledge to properly solve the problem. Train yourself to see it as a personal challenge.

From the hacker point of view though, not even within the domain of computer science, the issue is tackled in a (to the individual solving the problem) logical progression of hypothesis, test, fail, repeat until a workable solution is found. It's by no means the best solution, proper solution, or efficient solution, but it does work.

Keep hacking away at the components of a system and eventually an even greater understanding of a given domain is acquired compared to a traditional approach as it's not all wrote memorization and basic troubleshooting to draw on, but a complex understanding of the problem.

This approach does have the disadvantage of making the understanding of a problem very individualistic. With logical shortcuts relevant only the hacker understands, [[https://xkcd.com/1513/][much to the dismay of anyone attempting to work with them.]] Still I prefer it as it grants a greater personal understanding, as well as the feeling of accomplishment with regards to figuring out how something works.

Also, don't apply this learning method to anything involving high tension springs, electricity, or delta-p.

But I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis. Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

- Gases -- State of Matter (ideal gas law, etc.)
- Atmosphere -- Composition; Pressure & Temperature; Layers
- Wind -- Wind Speed (definitions and measurement); Wind Power.
- Weather -- Other aspects of.
- Biology -- Respiration
- Geomorphology -- Aeolian processes and features.

What do you guys think? Any constructive thoughts and feedback, or emotionally-withering criticism?

You and him are in a windowless room; you with a wall behind you and him with a door (the only entrance/exit to the room) behind him. You don't have your phone with you. Your family/roommates/whoever are gone for the day and your neighbors are on vacation, so yelling/screaming is pointless and the intruder also knows this. The intruder has a knife, of the kitchen knife variety, and he does not have good intentions. An altercation is inevitable and unavoidable. For a weapon, you have the option of a knife similar to his or a bat/golf-club. You can only choose one. Which is the rational choice?

*** Bat or golf club over a knife, every time. It has a reach advantage, it has a leverage advantage, and it's more likely to produce a fight-ending injury like a concussion or broken bone, rather than a random laceration, which is medically pressing but not instantly debilitating. By the time knife injuries matter, the fight will have already devolved into a wrestling match for control over the knife, regardless of who started with it. This still applies if you're not trained in martial arts - some sort of long stick is more likely to convert frantic flailing into a fight-ending injury than a knife is.

This was actually a recurring topic back when I studied martial arts. Across a bunch of disparate arts, everyone ranks options something like talking it out, calling for help / running away, martial arts knowledge, a stick, pepper spray, a heavy object, a gun, untrained fists, a knife. There's wiggle room, but the primacy of avoiding a fight and admonishment that knife fights are a bad idea were recurring themes.

If your opponent has a knife already, then I guess having a knife of your own is a good idea.

But if your opponent is unarmed, then most people I've talked to agree that getting a knife for yourself lowers your own chances of survival.
