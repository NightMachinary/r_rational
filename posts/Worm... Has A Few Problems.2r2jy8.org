Firstly, I think /Worm/ is a fantastic work of fiction, a fresh take on superheroes, and all-around praiseworthy. That said, I am not totally certain that it qualifies as either Rationalist or Rational. My general critique will not cover decisions made by individuals or small groups, which could concievably be wrong but for explicable reasons. I instead want to cover the two instances in which all of civilization messed up royally.

*1. THE ENDBRINGERS*

In the comments of [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/extermination-8-2/#comments][Extermination 8.2]], /gwern/ and /greatwyrmgold/ debate the merits of using ICBMs retrofitted with re-entry capsules to move unusually powerful capes from Africa to the sites of Endbringer attacks. It's an interesting argument, based on whether the technique itself is plausible, and whether sacrificing a cape who could engage an Endbringer for one second would be worth it in terms of property damage prevented. You'll have to read it yourselves to understand both sides properly. Unfortunately, the merits of their propositions do not matter in the slightest, because Tinkers could not only make the machinery work to improbable standards of usefulness, but they could do away with the need for capes to participate at all.

Consider Dragon. Her general limits do not include a cap on the number of individual robots controlled, so why not create thousands of Dragons, each optimally suited to fighting /en masse/?

Consider Armsmaster. He invents a weapon capable of physically dismantling Leviathan. (Or molecularly. Whatever.) If neutralizing them that way isn't worth considering as a means of killing them, I don't know what is. So after he decides to be the Big Damn Hero and almost succeeds, +somewhat+ supremely unethically, you'd think that he'd be put to work mass-producing more of those anti-Endbringer things, right? Remember, Taylor used it without him, so he doesn't need to be physically present for their operation (this might have a time limit, but it'd be at least a few minutes long). Sadly, he ends up being put to work on software that is almost worthless in comparison, and then gets badly mutilated by a serial killer while in detainment.

Consider [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/%C2%AD-arc-10-parasite/10-x-bonus-interlude/][the Simurgh]] in an interlude, where Dragon describes her as being 315km above Spain, docile, "beyond the limits of conventonal weapons." Putting aside whether that's actually outside the range of conventional weaponry, the solution here is to /build unconventional weapons, because you are a Tinker and an AI/.

Forgive me if I missed the part where it explained that Endbringers had to be fought by capes specifically for some esoteric reason, or if they deliberately obfuscate any other solutions for their existence. Relying on Scion to solve the problem every single time just seems... stupid. Especially given that the government employs both Tinkers and Thinkers, not that you'd know it...

*2. VILLAINS IN GENERAL*

The Birdcage, an inescapable prison designed for supervillains that cannot be held in any normal Supermax, is the very definition of 'because the plot requires it'. Supervillains in general are apparently tolerated for their usefulness in Endbringer fights, but what about capes like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse 9? I seem to recall some villains being characterized as "so dangerous, you could shoot them in their sleep and call it self-defence." If Marquis (for instance) cannot possibly ever be released, and has a body count, why not execute him? I am against the policy of capital punishment in general, but I'd make an exception for Lung, if he existed.

Speaking of Lung, why is he never just shot by the police? Or the National Guard? Or the Army? He may be immune to small-arms fire even at the beginning of a fight, but why not assassinate him from a block away, while he's asleep, with a bullet calibre suitable for anti-tank weaponry?

I think the problem is that heroes go to the trouble of bringing in criminals alive. This is a good idea in Real Life, but not if your target can kill you by snapping their fingers and making your skull implode. If the sort of highly-trained professionals who evidently do not exist in /Worm/ were to try to kill Shatterbird, or Burnscar, or Bonesaw, or Jack Slash, or Cherish, knowing all the relevant details (and they would, because Wikipedia is a powerful force for good), there would be no contest. The Siberian, Mannequin, Hookwolf, and other sorts of generally resiliant capes would be harder, but without even expending any cognitive effort whatsoever on a solution, I think Armsmaster's Ã¼berweapon would work.

For Crawler and Butcher, you would have to be more creative than I feel like right now. Maybe launch them into space? Get Crawler to adaptively regenerate himself into something that's totally useless (e.g. increase his mass to the point he can no longer move)? Find a volunteer to kill Butcher, who then commits suicide?

Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.

Taylor Hebert complains a lot that Tinkers have an unfair advantage because they have infinite potential, but I am of the opinion that there is no evidence for this. There are five Tinkers in Brockton Bay alone, which accounts for who-even-knows how many worldwide, and the world doesn't look appreciably different for having supernatural technological insight in any way. Bear in mind here that Tinkers can optionally reduce their own effectiveness in exchange for allowing their designs to be understood by the unwashed masses. What I'm trying to get at is that heroes need to leave the villains to men with guns, and use their talents to better humanity. Out of every cape ever mentioned, it's actually harder to find ones whose powers are useless outside of combat than those who have auxiliary potential.

*SO...*

In summary, I don't feel that /Worm/ meets the standard of plausible motivation, nor the standard of optimal use of resources (is that a thing? I think intelligent behaviour is probably a prerequisite for Rational fiction). Please, let me know what you think!

*EDIT:* Both [[/u/CaptainLoggers]], [[/u/thakil]], and [[/u/alexanderwales]] pointed out that /Worm/ is not rational, but still really good. /Yes/. That said, if all of humanity is facing the sort of threat posed by the Endbringers and the Slaughterhouse 9, I shouldn't be able to come up with plausibly better approaches to dealing with them /as I'm reading it/.


** Won't do a lengthy point-by-point, but to throw out a few obvious things...

the "useless" software armsmaster was working on was unchaining dragon, which is what made it possible for dragon to operate multiple suits at once, which you cited before that as a game-breaker.

They don't just leave it to scion; it was said that scion actually didn't even show up for most endbringer fights, because at that point he was mindlessly addressing whatever problems happened to be closest, with no sense of scale or priority.

Your assertion that tinkers can "optionally reduce their own effectiveness in exchange for allowing their designs to be understood by the unwashed masses" doesn't seem to have any basis in canon. They are not prodigies who are able to work from known technology through to super-advanced tech, they are being directly fed top-level understanding without having worked through the underlying science. They are engineers, not scientists, and they work intuitively, not from a solid theoretical backing, which is probably why their tech ends up being fiddly and requires so much maintenance.

I'm not saying your premise is wrong; there are certainly flaws in the conception of the universe of Worm. Some of those flaws are deliberate design choices, however, necessary conceits based on the premise and goals of the story, notably the truce with villains. Others are just plain flaws. I'm just saying that you ought to take more care to avoid flaws in your analysis of other works' flaws.

*** Yeah, I noticed a number of problems as well. For one thing, the S9 did have a kill order on them. Anyone who wanted to could claim a huge reward for the kill on them and walk out without being molested, regardless of their past. Wildbow had a post about this, and even said Bakuda had a kill order on her when she was brought down, although it wasn't mentioned in story.

In regards to the Simurgh, she has telekinesis. Any weapons they launch at her would be pretty easily redirected by her. Plus, she has the ability to see the future. She doesnt need to be anywhere near where the weapons will be, and any weapon powerful enough to really hurt the end bringers would be most likely be targeted by them. Capes are really the only ones strong enough to actually get near her without being thrown out. The rest of the end bringers are out of reach when they are regenerating.

In regards to Lung and the prospect of killing him: you mean one of the handful of capes on the planet who can 1v1 an end bringer for an extended period of time, something Alexandria can't do, then come out alive, and only operates a fairly small time gang in a single city? Kill him? Sure.

I do agree that Worm could use a very large edit to clarify a variety of things, and resolve some inconsistencies, but these criticisms generally were founded on incorrect premises or didn't really think through the problems better than the author.

**** The issue with Lung operating a small time gang was addressed though. He has several problems that prevented him from being bigger.

1. His power takes a long time to charge up. He can take Alexandria in a fight, but only if that fight goes on for 15 minutes. In the first few seconds of a fight, any mid-level hero could probably beat him to a pulp. Especially if they knew who they were up against.

2. He sees things in the small scale. He'd rather vett a few close associates than build an organization that is self sustaining. I can see him having to "clean house" of anyone moderately disloyal pretty often.

3. He has an average intelligence at best. He probably doesn't even realize point #2 about himself.

It's the whole cops and robbers dynamic that is one of the central reasons why villains are allowed to live and the society functions as well as it does. When the true psychopaths come to town, both the cops and robbers band together to face them.

**** I just wanted to point out stuff like, "For someone whose power is Winning, Contessa doesn't really accomplish that," and "Lung is only invincible after a few minutes of fighting, so why not shoot him immediately?" (His use against the Endbringers isn't worth the resk of letting him loose, in my opinion.)

The Simurgh is a bit of a problem, but Leviathan and Behemoth and the others? Not so much. You could even, with optimal use of guys like Vista, Clockblocker, Myrddin, and Eidolon, neutralize them without killing them.

***** Cauldron accomplished a *huge* amount of worldbuilding behind the scenes. That this is not obvious is kinda the point. [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wormverse-ideas-recs-and-fic-discussion-thread-38.309181/page-35#post-15024820][Wildbow's commented on that matter rather directly.]]

Clearly the PRT and perhaps Cauldron disagree on the usefulness of Lung (it is worth mentioning he succeeded in tanking against /Scion/ for a double digit number of seconds). Notably, both parties have Thinkers that can confirm that Lung isn't likely to go on an extended rampage, so it isn't much of a gamble.

There's a recurring theme in Endbringer fights that whenever you figure out a way to beat them they escalate and pull out some new trick. Maybe you manage to levitate Leviathan away from a water source while neutralizing his echo... and then half your defending capes explode into pink mist. Oops, so much for the Manton effect. I think you can imagine even worse outcomes with a little effort.

*** I think that, from Armsmaster's perspective, producing more of the anti-Endbringer weapons should have been the highest priority by far.

If Scion /doesn't/ end most Endbringer fights, what usually happens? Do the heroes drive the Endbringer off? Or do the Endbringers cause the requisite amount of carnage? See, four major cities pwned per year since at least some time in the 1990s, with 1/4 of the defending capes going down as well, doesn't sound very sustainable. There have to have been /some/ advances in Kaiju-fighting since then.

Tinkers can, in fact, produce sensible technology when the situation requires it. The PRT containment foam, for instance. Bakuda comments on the design of the restraining collars in the Canary Interlude, to this effect. I put the links... somewhere else in the thread, I guess.

My analysis of /Worm/ is that it is not Rationalist nor Rational, because of the high number of amazingly stupid things that happen. It is indeed a fantastic work of fiction, I just felt that the characters in it were deconstructed!Superheroes, not rational!Superheroes. Does that work better?

**** armsmaster shared the nanothorn tech with dragon before he even learned she was an AI. Since armsmaster's specialty does /not/ include mass-production or low-maintenance tech, this was by far the most effective way to scale up applications of the technology.

Endbringer fights end one of two ways; sometimes the heroes, primarily eidolon, drive them off. Sometimes they achieve their objectives and just wander off.

And of course it wasn't a sustainable strategy, everyone knew that. It was still the best strategy they had managed to come up with. Trying to take the fight to the endbringers wouldn't change the fact that their attacks were largely ineffective; it would just eliminate the down-time they normally get to recoup between attacks, speeding up humanity's destruction and giving them less time to hopefully come up with a better solution.

Dragon produced the containment foam, and the other tech the prt used, including the collars and the version of armsmaster's tactical combat system being deployed in the mid-late series. Reverse-engineering other tinkers technology was dragon's specialty, and it seemed that in some important ways she actually understood their tech better than they did, or at least was better able to mass-produce it - her main constraint there being the shackles her creator had left her with. So as I said first, the best thing armsmaster could do was give the tech to dragon, and then help unshackle dragon so she could be even more effective at what she was already the best at doing.

***** I wasn't referring to the sustainability of their strategy, but the sustainability of having regular Endbringer attacks. There have been at least 80 cities destroyed, with an accompanying number of capes. The capes in particular don't come by easily enough that you'd think this could go on for over twenty years.

The best think Armsmaster could have done, bar nothing else, was to create more nanothorn weapons. Even helping Dragon could come after making at least one more. Still, I was thinking from the perspective of some government official: aside from Scion, the halberd is the only thing that's ever worked particularly well. So let's get more! Give the plans to Dragon, by all means, and then start manufacturing them! Even a one-time-use nanothorn weapon could be used as artillery against Behemoth.

** I'd like to preface this by saying spoilers for Worm all the way up to the conclusion. Look away all ye who haven't finished it.

Before I address individual points, let me first say that I agree that Worm isn't a "Rationalist" work, nor was it intended as one. It is a deconstructionist Superhero work, with the baggage and tropes that come with it. Having said that, its deconstruction is gritty, makes an attempt at realism and realistic consequences, and the main characters act more rationally than a stereotypical comic book villain (with the exception of the Slaughterhouse 9, which is ironically what makes them so deadly).

An oft repeated mantra of Tinkers is that they can't just hand out their gear or inventions or mass produce them because they require upkeep, be that because the gear is cobbled together by an excited person fueled more by excitement and ingenuity than rational methodical design or because the stuff is at least partially held together by magic or psychic powers or whatever you want to call the hero powers. This isn't a rule, but more of an excuse for why inventors would constantly take the field with their inventions to beat up doods rather than mass produce stuff to advance humanity.

And this leads to a core principle of Worm as a fictional work: it isn't designed to be a rational deconstruction of superhero fiction, or rationality applied perfectly to the genre. The author took a typical "superhero world" and asked "What rules would have to be in place for that behavior to be reasonable? What society and structure would have to spring up to support a typical superhero world? What consequences would that have?"

Tinker equipment can't be mass produced easily and often requires a Tinker in field. Dragon has a massive set of rules and principles constraining her behavior and prohibiting her from participating in self replication past a certain point.

The Endbringers are a difficult issue because there's a few things going on there, all centered around the issue that the heroes aren't supposed to fight the Endbringers except when a city is being attacked. You can make up rules about it, like there's no point in aggravating the Endbringers when they're asleep or Smurgh is controlling people to act that way or there's a shard interaction that makes it all behave that way, and it's all stupid because why would you deal with a problem like that reactively instead of proactively but the answer is because that's the rule that makes the superhero genre work. A massive monster that can't be stopped, only pushed away, and it takes all the heroes and villains together. That's the way the Endbringers were designed, in universe and by the author.

The villains are the same deal. The Birdcage exists for three reasons: 1. Because it's a tangible, believable, possibly worse than death threat that the good guys can use as a deterrent and not feel bad about it. 2. Because there's evidence that it was planned all along as a place to store guys for Cauldron to use in an end of the world scenario, people who would play along if the world was at stake, exactly like they were, and 3. Because the superhero universe says good guys can't kill unless the person is an unredeemable monster and even if the Birdcage isn't that different from death, the universe says that's an okay thing for GOOD GUYS to do.

And why haven't they killed the S9 or other class S threats by the time we, the readers, reach the universe? Because then we wouldn't have those guys to read about, or nobody with the incentive to figure it out has, or because the consequences of messing with Class S threats is worse than leaving them be (Bonesaw bioplagues, Nilbog contingencies, advancing the Endbringer attack timetable).

Ultimately, it isn't rational, it isn't rationalist, and it's not even plausible using in universe rules, but that doesn't make it a bad work or a worthless work. It's just that that universe has a strange, senseless, contradictory set of rules that require the tenants of the "superhero genre" to work.

But that doesn't make it not a useful work to explore creativity or rational thinking, and it certainly doesn't make it a bad piece of fiction. It's just that the universe is written with the constraints of superhero fiction, and that means that sometimes stuff happens for the plot and people go irredeemably mad and everything can be blamed on a telepathic sky bird. That may be unsatisfying and it's certainly not rational or rationalist literature, but it wasn't written intended in that way.

TL;DR: Worm isn't a rational work, it's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that operates with a set of laws and with a set of characters which are inherently irrational in order to create a superhero universe. Having said that it's a great fictional work and a lot of fun, with tons of clever thinking, acting, and rationality in it, it just doesn't fit the bar for "rationalist literature" and that's okay.

*** I like your comment for a variety of reasons, and would like to disagree on some points and expand upon others.

First, I think that Worm should be classified as a rational work, though certainly not rationalist which we both agree on, because generally the characters act according to clear goals and believe able personalities, and very rarely if ever do characters hold the idiot ball when their previous characterization would suggest that they should be intelligent. There are certainly plenty of instances where groups or individuals act irrationally, but this is often explicitly acknowledged by some other group or person.

Panacea has one of the most useful powers of any hero, but doesn't use her power except for healing. Why? Because she simply is not creative and sets hard rules for herself that limit what she can do. This is rather irrational and ineffective, as was acknowledged by Skitter and I think Bonesaw.

Why does humanity not band together to fight the End bringers more effectively? Well, in case you missed half of what skitter says, it was repeatedly drilled into the reader that capes simply do not work as effectively in groups, and have massive issues cooperating on even a moderately large scale. There are only a few thousand or so capes in the world(iirc), and there are nearly as many competing factions. Just in Brockton Bay we have the Undersiders, wards/protectorate, ABB, E88, New Wave, Coil, and probably more that I'm forgetting, as well as any number of rogues like Parian. The only cohesive group with more than a dozen capes are the protectorate and wards, and they aren't exceeding that number by much and have plenty of issues internally.

More about the rational side of things: the characters aren't divided into good or evil, with the main character starting off as a relatable villain who transitions into an absolute monster, and we know just about every step of her way there. Sure, there are heroes and villains, but the heroes are nearly as often as not as bad as the villains, and a few factions firmly say that they are eneither heroes nor villains.

Second, I want to expand on the S-class threat designation.

So Nilbog and the S9 are two threats that have been mentioned here. Nilbog, although designated a class S threat, is relatively stable walled in his town. Yes, if he ever broke out he warrants an immediate show of absolute force, but until that happens he is of little threat. The suggested H-bomb could work, true. But given how durable capes can potentially be, and since not a huge amount is known about Nilbog, there is little reason to strike when there is the chance he could survive and retaliate. He has self replicating monstrosities, and any way to avoid those becoming loose is worth leaving one latent threat content to sleep.

The S9 are another story. Like any class S threat, they are kill on sight. However, it isn't necessarily a good idea to seek them out, because of the Siberian. She, to the PRT's knowledge, is completely invincible, and can make anyone she is touching invincible as well. Bonesaw and Jack are one of the few things keeping her from doing more damage than she currently does. Bonesaw as well is explicitly said to have plagues stored within her body to be released if she dies. Jack keeps them two in line, to follow his rules and only do selective damage. Every other member of the 9 is expendable, and most of them do die. In conclusion, there is little point in going on the offensive towards them until the nature of the Siberian was revealed. Cauldron did not target them, and therefore the PRT as well, because they caused trigger events, which lead to more capes.

****** There are a number of things that you'd do the moment you realized that people were gaining powers from triggering. For /most/ of them, Wildbow realized that this was the case and then declared that they don't work, but here's what I think you'd try, in roughly the order I think you'd try them:

1. Try to induce triggers through medical/chemical means in laboratory conditions.
2. Try to induce triggers through psychological means in laboratory conditions.
3. Try to induce triggers through actual trauma in laboratory conditions using unwilling subjects.
4. Try to induce triggers out in the real world using any of the above methods with agents (or a team) under your control.
5. Allow triggers to happen through non-intervention in terrible events.

Even if I accept the dubious proposition that the Slaughterhouse Nine are creating more useful capes than they're killing, the whole thing is entirely uncontrolled and unobserved. Bonesaw gets triggered /and then immediately gets inducted into the Slaughterhouse Nine/ for a period of what, ten years or so? I can't really put that in the plus column for Cauldron.

Of course, they have Contessa on their side, so it's possible that the answer is just a cop out "this method was chosen because that's what Contessa's power said to do, and it is therefore correct". But I obviously dislike that answer.

I don't agree with this statement at all. No amount of conventional force can kill an Endbringer, that's the whole point. If nanomolecular thorns and nukes can't deal damage to the physics-breaking cores, then no amount of soldiers hunkering down with guns, bombs, or whatever is going to do anything. And in order for there to be a Tinker weapon to kill Endbringers, there would need to be a Tinker capable of building such a weapon, which we see no evidence of in-story. It's easy to say "Contessa should just win," and yet much harder to plan out exactly how she could do this with only the resources she has, not the ones you can make up for her to use. For instance, I would've thought a worldwide network of alert stations to tell Scion when an Endbringer attack was occurring would be a fairly effective weapon, but it would also reduce the amount of parahumans created during Endbringer attacks, which is contrary to Cauldron's purpose.

Osama bin Laden wasn't a prolific serial killer. Also, it's specified in the Alaska thing that you have to be minimum Brute 5 to ignore small-arms fire. In which case I stand by the "More Gun" idea.

The Tinker weapon I was referring to was Armsmaster's nanothorn halberd. Maybe it can't kill Endbringers, but it mutilated Leviathan pretty badly. It seems to me that this effectiveness would prompt the superhero community to request more of them, to at least /test/ whether they're capable of killing Endbringers.

Rule of thumb for conventionally possible solutions to Endbringers is "They tried that. It... didn't go well."

******* The Endbringer's have been around for awhile in story. I find it rather unbelievable that nobody tried the mass-fire approach, especially off the start before the problem was fully understood. As I recall, the first Endbringer to appear was Behemoth. Sending in waves of normals against him would pretty much be like trying to wear out a cliff by blowing on it. So people figure only parahumans can really stand up to him, and anybody without powers strops throwing their lives away. I don't think it says anywhere nobody tried; it's much more likely that everybody who tried is dead (to me, at least).

We don't know to what level Bonesaw upgraded them. I grant you a sniper round to the head would probably do it, but the real problem is finding the shot in the first place. S9 have a history of bugging out and discouraging pursuit, then going to ground and not surfacing for some time. Hell, I imagine that if they were found in an isolated enough region, the nuclear option might be put on the table. But finding them is a real problem, especially given Bonesaw's ability to rework physical features. Best way would be Thinkers, I don't recall if there was a specific reason given for why the S9 weren't tracked that way.

Mutilation is not victory. Damage to the core is all that matters - anything less, and they regenerate. It's stated that they target certain objectives - if you can;t stop them from getting what they want, it doesn't matter that Leviathan has lost the first however many layers of skin. He's still won. Though your right that this would be reader knowledge. As for an in-story reason, they wont work at all against Behemoth, since he's all about the fire. Taking a tinker weapon like that up against the Simurgh is begging to have all of your constituent molecules go their separate ways, since they do know in story she can make use of Tinkertech in her area. Leviathan is the only real option for the nanothorns, and they didn't do that much good against him.

I never said killed. The primary strategy for Endbringer fights was to hold out until Scion shows up to chase them off. Victory is achieved by denying them their objectives, and having Scion show up sooner does that. I would say, with reader knowledge, Scion killing them is a net negative.

H-Bombs are tended to not be dropped on occupied cities. And all of these Tinker items /don't exist in canon/. It seems to me that it can be rational if they don't use items that don't exist.

But how do you learn where they are with enough time to get snipers out and set up before they move on?

****** Contessa's plan for dealing with Scion boils down to "make more capes", which as [[/u/Alexanderwales]] explains elsewhere, she doesn't do it very optimally.

The Tinker weapon I was thinking of is Armsmaster's nanoweapon. It may not be able to destroy the core, but not only do they not know that, it was actually effective.

I didn't suggest dropping an H-bomb on an occupied city.

You learn where they are using Thinkers, Dragon, and the trail of bloody murders they leave in their wake. Also, Crawler seems pretty damn hard to hide.

  Consider Dragon. Her general limits do not include a cap on the number of individual robots controlled, so why not create thousands of Dragons, each optimally suited to fighting en masse?
#+end_quote

Tinkertech is extremely expensive, tricky to make, Dragon is heavily limited by her AI controls on how many robots she can make, Defiant aids her with that.

#+begin_quote
  you'd think that he'd be put to work mass-producing more of those anti-Endbringer things, right?
#+end_quote

Tinker shards are heavily limited, in particular Scion's shards aren't good at mass production. Eden's tinker shards are more suited for mass production. As seen in the serial tinkers always want to focus on new ideas. Plus it's less effective against Behomoth, who has an energy aura that destroys things like tinker weapons, and Simurgh who has telekinesis to destroy things.

#+begin_quote
  Consider the Simurgh[2] in an interlude, where Dragon describes her as being 315km above Spain, docile, "beyond the limits of conventonal weapons." Putting aside whether that's actually outside the range of conventional weaponry, the solution here is to build unconventional weapons, because you are a Tinker and an AI.
#+end_quote

This only works if you have the missile tinker tech line or laser tinker tech line.

#+begin_quote
  Supervillains in general are apparently tolerated for their usefulness in Endbringer fights, but what about capes like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse 9?
#+end_quote

They have kill on sight orders and substantial bounties. You can't put a kill on sight order on everyone though or capes will not comply with them. You need a united force to stop endbringers and the S9.

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of Lung, why is he never just shot by the police? Or the National Guard? Or the Army? He may be immune to small-arms fire even at the beginning of a fight, but why not assassinate him from a block away, while he's asleep, with a bullet calibre suitable for anti-tank weaponry?
#+end_quote

Because in his final form he can stop endbringers and he generally mostly attacks other gangs and capes. He's not a major threat.

#+begin_quote
  If the sort of highly-trained professionals who evidently do not exist in Worm were to try to kill Shatterbird, or Burnscar, or Bonesaw, or Jack Slash, or Cherish, knowing all the relevant details (and they would, because Wikipedia is a powerful force for good), there would be no contest.
#+end_quote

They have durability boosts from Bonesaw and Jack is pretty smart at dealing with threats. That said, they do have a high death rate. If Bonesaw goes all out she can release plagues that mass kill humans which means killing her is a dangerous activity.

#+begin_quote
  For Crawler and Butcher
#+end_quote

Butcher doesn't have a kill order because she mostly attacks other capes, Crawler has the protection of the S9 and will resist any attempts to launch him into space.

#+begin_quote
  Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.
#+end_quote

They got thinkers to check on that, the result was that this would result in mass death of humans due to a bioplague he created. He's not doing anything, better to just ignore him, check on him regularly.

- Not amount of durability will save you from Flechette, but firearms exist that can go through concrete, so until proven otherwise I'll go with the "More Gun" philosophy. Jack's capacity to deal with unexpected threats looks like an informed ability. If Bonesaw has plagues on her person, it's time to bust out the parahumans with force fields. If they're hidden around the world, time to bust out the Thinkers before you kill her.

- Butcher /should/ have a kill order, because turning heroes into successively more powerful villains sounds like the sort of thing you'd want off your plate... Okay, maybe not a "kill" order, but something to that effect. Crawler would have to be dealt with last, along with the Siberian and so forth. It wouldn't be easy, but it would be doable.

- Tinkertech is /totally/ reproducible. Bakuda [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/interlude-6/][says something to that effect here]], and the PRT containment foam is Tinker-made. Aside from that, it doesn't answer the question of why anti-cape/anti-Endbringer weaponry isn't ubiquitous like the containment foam.

It's not an either or thing. Endbringers can survive an unbelievable amount of abuse. You might make some incredibly expensive tinkertech, try to kill them, and fail. People probably have.

I apologize, I worded this badly. But how would Behemoth or Leviathan 'subvert' Armsmaster's weapon, which needs to be maintained by him personally?

Fair point. But you should also be put under arrest for breaking the law, and there should be serious repercussions for killing people at all.

******* I greatly disagree with all of your priors. There are no threats that equal the Slaughterhouse 9 or the Endbringers in scale, so all available Thinkers and resources of that nature should be devoted to those problems. You've made a whole bunch of assumptions about the nature of Tinker powers and the availability of resources. For instance, it doesn't matter if there's only one Flechette, you only need to kill a half-dozen invincible monsters. Dismissing the use of the nanoweapon on the Endbringer core because it "Probably would have failed" is equally stupid from the perspective of the PRT and the Protectorate. Cherish can indeed sense emotions, which is why you send Dragon after her. Or Weld (I can't remember if he actually feels emotions or not.) If killing Jack takes strong Tinkertech, then you /get strong Tinkertech/. It doesn't matter how twisty the assassination plot has to get, because getting it done is the greatest priority.

Where the fuck did you get that from? Butcher's odds of saving 10,000,000 people by intervention are so close to nil that the distinction doesn't matter. Similarly, you stand to lose not only civilians, but also the heroes that eventually kill Butcher, with the added problem of continued escalation. Bayesian reasoning is not useful here.

Is your point that the PRT et al. aren't actually interested in containing villains if they aren't a widespread danger? Because that seems like a policy that wouldn't last long in the real world. If the objective of capture is eventually the Birdcage (after the obligatory three strikes), they are, in fact, working to do as good as killing them, for all the good Birdcage prisoners do against Endbringers.

Nobody knows /how/ invulnerable the Siberian is.

Dinah Alcot is a really good Thinker. But you could probably get results with an acceptable level of accuracy (in the case of locating the source of an Armageddon) from Tattletale or Coil. Just saying that all the other Thinkers are inferior doesn't explain why.

I did, in fact, read Dragon's interlude. While she might desire to be able to make her own choices, nothing there indicates that she would prefer that over killing the Endbringers.

It's not widely known knowledge that Dragon is an AI, Cauldron, the group that knows all, doesn't want to kill the S9. She didn't get a decent bot army till Defiant's modifications as well, after that she did go after the S9.

  If killing Jack takes strong Tinkertech, then you get strong Tinkertech. It doesn't matter how twisty the assassination plot has to get, because getting it done is the greatest priority.
#+end_quote

You were arguing that they should use the army to kill Jack. They can't get strong tinkertech to every soldier due to it not being possible to mass produce it. The average soldier will just have a gun which will be far less effective against them. If you use capes he can outwit them. He is not easy to defeat and will try to counter any plan of yours and if it fails then that's a massive investment of resources lost or subverted.

#+end_quote

Sorry, mixed it up with Lung.

Butcher is a fairly small scale criminal with a not hugely potent power. You're only likely to win against her with a cape which compounds the issue. If she started mass murdering people you might try to do something about her but she's not a high priority. You wanted to make the Endbringers and the S9 the top priority- why do something about a minor criminal?

** No, Worm isn't /really/ rational fiction. That's because it was never intended to be. And you can look at how Worm was constructed to see why it would be really hard for it to qualify.

Worm's world was built backwards. Wildbow had an end result - superheroes in costume, fighting each other on the streets, with almost all of the tropes that you would expect if you had been exposed to superheroes through comic books. Everything else was built with this end result in mind, and if anything contradicted that end result, it needed to get massaged.

So you get the Tinkers, who can make the cool tech, since that's a superhero trope. But there are a ton of problems with that from a worldbuilding standpoint, so instead of pushing the world to its logical conclusion, or scrapping the Tinkers, patches get applied until you might believe that all the stated conditions would lead to the desired end result.

But you can see the rough edges where this patching process wasn't perfect, and Worm has flaws if you're checking it over for logic. That wasn't really the point of Worm though.

*** I agree with you, but Wildbow IMO does a /really good job/ patching over.

Take Star Trek. Ships couldn't accelerate that fast without turning the crew to chunky salsa and tearing apart, so we get the Inertial Dampening Field and the Structural Integrity Field. Do those make sense? No, but it makes us stop asking questions, it's a non-answer that /sounds/ like an answer, so we can continue our suspension of disbelief and enjoy the story.

Unfortunately, Trek fails a lot in providing even that.

Worm does a similar thing. A lot of the issues boil down to:

1. Capes are influenced by their shards. They gravitate to conflict and fighting.

2. They are already all messed up from their trigger events, so not acting particularly rational, and many capes are low-level idiot scumbags that just happen to have powers...

3. Cauldron has an end-game about defeating Scion, and they really have no idea how to do it, since he seems unstoppable (and virtually is). One of their goals is "maximize the number of capes." And since they covertly are running the entire parahuman organization of North America, a lot of the stupid cops-and-robbers stuff like the Birdcage etc. makes sense. In this situation, they just need to have enough plausibility to fool the North American population and not the reader!

4. Escalation... not always a good idea. Nilbog is contained. Lung is a small time guy. If you push, things could get much worse. North Korea once sank a US ship and tortured the crew... we negotiated for the release of the crew and apologized, rather than invade them. Sometimes maintaining the status quo makes sense, even if it sucks.

5. The unwritten rules. Again based on the idea that escalation and fear-of-reprisal keeps people in check... no one wants Total War with parahumans.

6. Tinker tech - again, they want to fight, shard shenanigans, and their tech needs maintenance, and they are messed up people...

Worm wouldn't exist in a world that didn't already have superhero fiction. If you are reading Worm, it's assumed you already know something about Batman and Spider-Man and such.

So the patching over ridiculous superhero conventions just has to look good compared to the mainstream... and it does! The Flash should be able to solve so many problems in the DC universe... and I don't recall getting much in the way of satisfactory reasons why he doesn't...

I had tons of issues with the Wormverse while reading... but the "reasons" why everything is the way it is... they totally worked for me. By which I mean they made me stop digging too deep, they sounded just plausible enough that I could accept them and move on with the story.

Wildbow gave his characters real weaknesses. Mainstream superheroes tend to get awesome powers and then hold the idiot ball and forget to use them. Wildbow gives them real weaknesses, even if they are psychological ones, and explores them. That makes it so much more believable to me that they don't just solve all their problems.

And lastly...

Despair. I mean they are called Endbringers. Conventional weapons don't hurt them. Nuclear weapons, the best we have... doesn't help. All we can rely on is capes, and they are fighting a losing battle. I think humanity knows it is a war of attrition and they will lose. Regular humans feel powerless and have sort of given up... they just rely on the capes to save them. The capes themselves are all screwed up because of triggers and shard stuff. All according to the Entities' plans.

Point number one is actually the biggest thing that irks me - it feels like such a cop out, in part because it weakens the character study aspect of the piece. You have all this wonderful psychological stuff going on, and then you explain away a lot of it with alien brain slugs. It stops being a commentary on how people can't cooperate with each other, and how institutions fail, and how conflicts naturally arise between people with differing viewpoints ... and becomes about the brain slugs. I liked Armsmaster as a character /so much better/ when he was just off-putting, solitary, and egotistical by his nature, instead of being that way (at least in part) because of the brain slug.

** Worm starts off with the premise that people who "break" and suddenly develop shards of superpowers will decide to dress up in costume and either A) fight crime or B) commit crimes (for the most part.)

Thusly, heroes and villains alike treat the Endbringer truce, Cape Disguise and 'Assassination while you sleep' scenarios very delicately. It's a similar philosophy to nuclear proliferation and mutually assured destruction -- I won't do it if you won't do it, because let's be honest -- if we did, the world would end.

Tinkers are broken. The only nerf they have is time and resources (which happen off-screen) so story-wise, creativity is the main-limiting factor. All devices require upkeep by the tinker and the reason why Dragon is so successful has to do with her ability to multitask like mad, given her background. The nanotech-monofilaments that Defiant uses can get jammed with the dust they generate -- he could theoretically mass-produce them, but a lot of PRT people would lose limbs (and the PRT uses non-lethal force for reasons above.)

Worm is a rationalization of the Superhero comics. But it proceeds in a rational way from this premise... although the story gets rushed and a little sloppy and abrupt at times towards the end (although the ending itself is something I find to be very satisfactory.)

** You can excuse quite a lot with "shards be making people crazy!" which resolves a lot of problems here. There's a couple of veiled references to the idea that the Birdcage exists as a resource to be tapped when necessary (also some individuals in it are close to unkillable).

spoilers below!

As logic problems go, you've failed to hit on the one that bugs me the most, which is that Cauldron is bloody terrible at its job. Again and again, the problem that is hammered home are co-ordination problems. Cauldron's one goal is to kill Scion, yet they happily watch as heroes who could do it die. I still don't quite know why they decided to let the Slaughter House 9 wonder around making the world worse, a decision which leads to the world ending much earlier than it needed to.

But urgh, that's the story. It's not a rational fic, and not one that is essentially rooted in plausibility. Wildbow has spoken about how he constructs stories, and as I understand it he basically puts his heroes in almost unwinnable situations and then works out how they can win. But this leads to Taylor surviving multiple times when she really, really shouldn't! Countless times she should actually come out worse and yet at the last minute she manages to turn it around!

That always annoyed me. It's such a narrative cheat -- "my characters are all uncooperative idiots? The shards did it!"

The basic problem was that, as is pointed out in other comments, Wildbow was writing backwards instead of forwards -- attempting to produce a justification of a genre (superhero comics) instead of starting with preconditions and going from there. That's totally cool and can produce great stories, but the genre he was trying to justify cannot be justified. At a high level, people in comics do not act like real people, so you can't write real world stories about them.

*** Agreed, Cauldron annoyed me as well. There's so much munchkin you can do with their powers and resources and knowledge, and they squander it away by doing the stupidest shit ever. They are a giant plot device used to justify the crazy crazy world and society.

From a narrative point of view, I think they were given too much power for them to act the way they are. They should have been nerfed pretty significantly to make the story more believable. Particularly Contessa with her win button is atrocious as a character. To have someone like her in a story begs for the readers to cry "bullshit", however you write the plot. It would be a lot more interesting if they were just a group of regular parahumans with mostly physical powers, with access to more knowledge about how the powers etc work than anyone, trying to manipulate the world into stopping the end of the world scenario, in my opinion.

Some of my previous comments on Worm and general plot holes, in case you need more evidence on lack of rationality in the story.

And why bother trying to destroy EB's when so far they have been able to regenerate all the damage done to them and are definitely not unique biological creatures, and therefore if you destroy one, the enemy can always make more, just bide your time until a Tinker makes an end all superpowers device and then use conventional warfare, or something like that.

** You know I always had an issue with the loss rates cited by Endbringer fights, it was something stupidly large for very little gain. I'm not sure anyone is paying attention to the value of Brockton Bay versus the value of the capes who could die and only then have a net "win".

Seems to me that they would have better chances if they didn't lose 1000s of capes and fought all at once, ignoring all the other things that came about Endbringer attacks (including not using any conventional weapons, where are the supersonic jets?)

Possibly, but I think you'd want sustained attention more than a burst. You nuke a site, you can't really have air traffic in the area. I'd just carpet bomb. Start with incendiaries, then after a couple hours mix high explosives with bunker busters.

I think the problem is that the author wanted, very badly, to tell a story that was mainly capes vs capes. The PRT's non-cape personnel exist to make the story not entirely about capes, to make normal people seem a little less powerless, but still, general and effective solutions that limit the amount of direct cape involvement get in the way of that story.

It would take an exceedingly clever author to come up with powers that were mostly immune to clever use of the laws of physics.

*** I wrote a fanfic of Worm where an original character named Murphy was entirely immune to any harm attempted against him. His power would predict events that might cause him harm, and alter reality as needed to prevent that harm. It only failed him when Scion ran his shard out of power.

The problem with his power was that it was completely out of his control, and seemed to use the least energy possible to guarantee a 100% success rate. The more upset he got, the more reactive the power got, going off at even the slightest provocation if he was extremely upset.

In other words, if you attacked Murphy with the intent to do him harm, anything that could go wrong would go wrong, and save him from the harm you tried to inflict on him.

***** Umm, OK. The story is called 'Arc' It can be found at the link below, after the warning. Murphy is not the main character, but he appears in several scenes.

WARNING: This is the first fiction I wrote since college. I went back through and cleaned it up a few times, but I haven't touched it recently, and I know there are verb tense errors, amongst other things.

That being said, a lot of people seemed to enjoy it, based on the reviews. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9523770/1/Arc]]

*Edit Add* Ouch. I just briefly scanned through it for the first time in many months. It's painful to read. I should rewrite it but I write so much differently now that I'd probably have to devote a whole day to each chapter.
