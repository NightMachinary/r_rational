(Update: Not sure why the title doesn't link to the story, as I submitted it that way and can't see how to edit the link. In any case, here is the link! [[http://eaitm.com]])

New readers: Erica's Adventures in the Multiverse (Book 1. The Turing Test) is a sci-fi novel for young people and adults. Think /A Wrinkle in Time/ meets /Ender's Game/ with AI-related themes. Erica is a 10-year old girl with the power to look into the multiverse to see the outcomes of choices she might make. She is about to become embroiled in a cosmic war in which her choices will determine the future of humanity.

It's been a few months since I posted here. Since then, in addition to writing a bunch of new chapters, I've chopped some earlier chapters into shorter chapters, and combined others, in the hopes of smoothing things out for new readers. Otherwise, the early content hasn't changed much, but some of the comments and chapter link titles don't match the current chapter. My apologies for any confusion this may cause.

I am aware of some major issues already addressed in comments on the blog, and have a plan for addressing them in draft 2. At the moment I am focused on finishing the current draft. Having said that, any and all feedback is welcome and appreciated!! THANK YOU to all the people who have provided feedback and support to this point!!

** The problem, if I may chime in about that, of having MIRI in a children's novel, and yes I am uncomfortable with that also - is that you may plausibly and perhaps accurately be accused of propagandizing to children. Which, well, it's not really /better/ if you file off the serial numbers, but it doesn't look as overtly advertisy. Image matters.

[edit] FURTHERMORE. Author guy! Have you read /Momo/? Because if not, you /really really/ need to read it. It's a critique of consumerism and the warped pressures of city life and Moloch. It's also a children's novel, and I consider it the shining example of how to communicate complex concepts to a child without talking down.

*** Agreed. I will make up a fictional replacement for MIRI in the next draft. And Momo sounds great, looking forward to reading it. Thanks!

*** Chapter 1 was definitely very good; the "That's a road to a dark place" bit got my attention in particular. Unfortunately, the rest of the story doesn't meet the standard the first chapter sets. Things seem to devolve into a confusing mess of random events pretty quickly; whether or not there's a reason for all the weird stuff that's happening, you can't introduce random stuff that quickly without doing serious damage to the coherence of the story.

**** Hi, thanks for the feedback. There is a rationale behind the weird stuff that's happening, and I definitely need to make that more clear to the reader, earlier. In particular, the scene you mention in the spoiler is one to which several readers have mentioned as being problematic. These things are on my radar for the next draft.
