** A few missing variables:\\
How much area do you want to "protect"?\\
If you're just talking about a few cities, you might be able to "ring" them with detectors or something. If you're talking "All of North America", you're going to need a lot more than "a few hundred", I think, although it's not clear to me what (if any) detection range there is.

How fast does the effect move?\\
Let's say it moves at 1 mile per hour - you MIGHT be able to evacuate a small city with enough warning and a good evacuation plan - you can basically walk out of it's path. Anything much faster and detection buys you almost nothing - it's going to move faster than you could possibly evacuate.
