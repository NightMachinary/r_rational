Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** There are three primary forms of quickly moving around the world, each with their own costs and benefits. Portals connect two places. Warp allows fast travel to select nodes. Ley lines are like magical rivers. (This is provisionally part of a diegetic MMO world that takes a bunch of MMO tropes and then constructs a world with them, without any actual game interface involved, but it might get repurposed for some other work.)

** Portals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: portals
   :END:
Once per month, portals open up.

- Each portal is a set of two connecting two static locations.
- Portals stay open for one day.
- Portal opening are unsynced from each other, meaning any given portal has a 1/30 chance of being open on a given day. Because openings are regular, they can be mapped.
- Portals are naturally occurring, and small sites are often built around them.
- Portals are not limited in how much material can go through them, making them handy for caravans or bulk transfer of goods.

** Warp Nodes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: warp-nodes
   :END:
At regular intervals around the world, in a hexagonal and/or circle packing pattern, there are nodes, which are natural teleportation receiving sites.

- Anyone can learn the spell to warp and it costs nothing to cast. Warp will always go to the nearest warp site.
- A person will always warp in safely so long as there's room at the warp site.
- Warp site is approximately 100 feet diameter circle.
- A full warp site will cause the spell to fail.
- Cities are often built around warp sites, if possible. Warp can take up to 100 lbs of extra mass, including clothes, weapons, armor, etc.
- Warp conserves momentum.

** Ley Lines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ley-lines
   :END:
The world is criss-crossed in ley lines, which can be traveled along with special ley craft.

- Ley craft can enter ley lines, and from there, can travel along the ley lines.
- Each ley line has a directionality to it.
- Ley line connections are such that no ley line is ever a dead end, and every ley line can be reached from any point on the network, though some routes are exceedingly long.
- Ley lines are 100 yards wide in diameter. For a ley craft to enter a ley line, it must be entirely within the diameter of a line.
- Ley lines can split and merge, and a craft can take either branch of a split.
- Because of the directionality, it sometimes takes much longer to go from A to B than B to A.
- Ley craft must be careful when exiting the ley line, as they may not come out on solid ground.
- Ley lines are visible/tangible only with special instrumentation. When ensconced inside a ley line via a ley craft, the real world is only dimly visible.
- Ley craft may collide with one another while in the ley lines.
- In designated, civilized areas, there will usually be landing strips for ley craft, places where they can come out of the ley line and then quickly divert off of it, or roll into place and then quickly enter.

--------------

Just like real-world cities are built around resources and transportation, and both historical and modern warfare are heavily dependent upon logistics, these three systems of travel are one of the deciders of geography, commerce, and war. A city which is next to a river, a ley line, a portal, and a warp node will naturally be a place where a city is built, and it will naturally be important because there are a lot of ways of getting to it. Still working out the kinks a little bit, but I think this is a good start.

*** My first thought is that the warp nodes would have the most transformative effect.

- Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible. The only options I can think of are to place prisons in hexes where the warp node is obstructed, or to make the area around the warp node a prison by itself.
- Depending on how quick the warp spell is to cast, this could also have a major effect on combat. If it only takes a second, it seems like the only way to defeat someone in combat would be with a surprise attack, fighting in a hex where the warp node is obstructed, or fighting in the node itself. In fact, perhaps that could lead to hexes where the warp node is naturally obstructed being the equivalent of PVP zones?
- The warp nodes make natural Schelling points, and would almost certainly be settled. For example, hunters and woodsmen would be able to travel further and carry more back if they could effortlessly teleport back home with 100lbs of their harvest at the end of the day.
- This would also reduce travel times by up to half. If you're travelling between adjacent nodes, you only need to cross the border at which point you're closer to your destination and can warp to it directly.
- The warp network seems like it would naturally lead to an entrenched feudal system of fortified warp sites serving as the seat of the local lord, with the hex being a natural set of borders. Perhaps this would encourage a belief in the Divine Right of Kings?

**** The big variables for warp seem to be time to cast, distance between nodes, and cost. I'm still fiddling with those things, but will eventually have to pick some values and be done with it. Distance is especially important, because at a certain point, traveling to another warp hex becomes so onerous that the average person is unlikely to do it. Distance also defines what the natural monopolies on warp nodes will be like, whether they're going to be metropolises or small towns. Warp nodes are /also/ natural points for hospitals (since the spell can act as an ambulance) and natural points for taxation, because you can tax anyone leaving the node.

But yeah, there's a lot to consider.

***** For warp distance, let's look at a few different case examples:

- ~10 ft. spacing: Warp nodes have little impact on the setting. You could use them to get around obstacles sometimes. Their only impact in architecture might be to build kind of curvy houses and city walls that specifically exclude or obstruct warp nodes to create meaningful obstacles. Might have one-way travel arrangements, so you could warp out of a house but not in.

- ~100 ft. spacing: Similar to the above, but now on a large building scale. Might use for power generation with 'elevators' to go down, or for setting up a workshop where you can quickly come back to a large stockpile of tools and supplies. Need to obstruct a handful of warp nodes that might let people warp past your city walls.

- ~1,000 ft. spacing: A three-minute walk. Might be handy for a farm. Also feasible for power generation. Multiple warp points within even a small city, so you'll need to obstruct points near your walls.

- ~10,000 ft. spacing: A 30-minute walk. Might want to start getting selective about where you set up a settlement and then build defenses around the warp node without obstructing it.

- ~100,000 ft. spacing: A five-hour walk. Warp nodes are now a big deal and likely represent provincial capitals. You can spend your entire day hunting and foraging near the city and then just warp back. The settlement is likely to be large enough to be able to provide decent medical care. The warp node will need to be defended and will require fortifications to safely hold it. People will likely use warp nodes both to travel to home or to travel to other settlements on a daily basis.

- ~1,000,000 ft. spacing: One week on foot. Warp nodes likely represent national capitals. People probably do not use them much, as you'd be heavily screened coming out of the node and might need to wait in line for an hour or so. The main usage would likely be to receive emergency medical care or to escape imminent death, although it might also see usage in bringing soldiers back to the capital for redeployment on another front.

- ~10,000,000 ft. spacing: 2.5 months on foot. Almost 2,000 miles. As above, but even less usage is likely. Now you can warp from the wild frontier back to the safety of the imperial capital and then die of dysentery before you ever make it home.

- ~100,000,000 ft. spacing: Basically, there's exactly one node in the world. It's now loosely-tied to the feudal societal structure, but the fringes of the world largely consist of people who may not bother learning the warp spell (or don't even know of it) because it would trap them in a place where nobody speaks their language and nobody accepts their currency. Risk of being enslaved or robbed is too high for it to be worthwhile.

Personally, I'd vote for the ~100,000-foot spacing. That sounds like the most interesting setting to live in.

Good point. I imagine that even 'field' battles might take place in the vicinity of a small town/village built up around a local warp node (economically, they're among the best places to settle since you can go out to gather materials and come back instantly). Of course, if you're an attacker, warping would put you right into the line of fire of the defenders and leave you trapped. With warp nodes, defenders can retreat easily but attackers cannot. This would offer a significant defensive advantage and probably lead to extensive fortification of warp points around the world.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That and perhaps fairly lawless. I imagine that locating the node by triangulating it would be fairly easy. Once it has been found, I imagine that a nearby noble would want to seize control of it and expand their empire. Local groups consisting of bandits, anarchists, libertarians, and various outlaws might try to prevent outsiders from unblocking the node since it would allow for consolidation of power. Once nearby nobles are powerful enough, they'd likely overrun the bandits and unblock the node, but until that point the node would probably be a somewhat lawless PVP zone.

#+begin_quote
  This would also reduce travel times by up to half. If you're travelling between adjacent nodes, you only need to cross the border at which point you're closer to your destination and can warp to it directly.
#+end_quote

Good point. This also creates /a lot/ of value for warp nodes on elevated terrain. For example, you could set up a basic powered sawmill with two carts/wagons and a downhill slope from a warp node. Attach two ropes to a pair of carts, coil one rope on a shaft while leaving the other uncoiled but attached to the shaft (with its cart at the bottom of the slope). Connect your saw to the shaft axle. Climb in the cart at the top of the slope, use your weight to bring it down and spin the saw, then warp back up and hop in the other cart to spin the saw some more.

If you don't have naturally elevated terrain, you could always dig pits and use them as 'elevator' shafts with passengers going down to provide power.

Another point to consider is that there will probably be very clear signs to mark the edge between one warp node and the next, at least if you're traveling along roads or paths. After a few years of trial and error, people would quickly lock down exactly where the transition point occurs.

*** Love this! A couple of questions from my inner munchkin:

1. Can living things be taken along by a Warp caster? If so, do they need to be willing to be warped?
2. Does a Warp caster need to be in direct-ish contact with the objects being warped, or can they designate things nearby but out of reach?
3. Can Warp be cast successfully from within a Ley Line? If so, is "nearest distance" measured in the ordinary three-dimensional way, or does the directed path network influence that measurement? (Would a warp node 1 mile "behind" me and slightly "inland" from the ley line be closer than a warp node 2 miles "downstream" and slightly "inland"?)
4. Is there any spatial overlap between warp nodes, potential portal sites, and ley lines?

**** 1. The big thing that I'm thinking about is babies, because if you can't transport them (or sufficiently small children) then you have all sorts of problems, and warp nodes become things for adults only. That's not terrible, I guess, but warp nodes are meant to be the short/safe/easy/limited option. So the standard is probably that you can pull along a living creature so long as they're under the weight limit, and so long as there's no non-consent (e.g. you don't have to be willing, but you can stop yourself from being brought along if you're actively fighting it).
2. Direct contact is kind of a fuzzy concept. A shirt is in direct contact, but a backpack is usually only in direct contact with the shirt, so what are the limits on the chain? I think physical connection and a tight range limit, e.g. you couldn't warp a ball that was in mid-air in front of you when the spell completed, and you couldn't warp something that was more than two feet away. Plus whole objects only (no breaking stone by only taking part of it), and no objects which extend past two feet from your body (no using ropes to extend range or something).
3. You just can't warp from within a ley line.
4. If portals, warp nodes, and ley lines are randomly distributed, or at least distributed according to their own internal logic, and are all small/rare enough that they /shouldn't/ naturally overlap. That said, unless they're all secretly part of the same phenomena, they shouldn't really interact. I suppose in the rare case that a ley line goes through a portal ... not sure what would happen, if the answer isn't "nothing".

Interesting option for pickpocketing. Just get within two feet of your target's wallet and disappear. If you started off far enough from the warp node and stole a small enough value, the target might not even bother chasing after you.

*** Interesting idea

- if ley craft move quickly, and are light enough to be carried by a single human, then you can use ley craft to quickly move between hexes, teleporting out of the ley line (and hopefully to somewhere near the next line)
- warp nodes are going to be crucial to war, especially if warping is fast and easy

  - The boundaries between warp zones will be crucial: if you are on "your" side, you can retreat easily. The nodes will become obvious command points, except...
  - They will be easily ambushed. The attack surface of the warp node is the entire perimeter of the zone. A suicidal individual with a large bomb could destroy the region around the node with ease.
  - In some sense, this interaction would mean that many "high-security" warp nodes will have structures built around them such that they are permanently blocked unless an unlocking signal is sent. An enemy could have a large number of people teleport constantly, accepting failures for the hope that they might get lucky and surprise their enemy at an inopportune time
  - In response to this kind of attack, armed guards would exhibit some presence at warp nodes. Their may be some kind of jail cell erected around the warp node, with cubes small enough to contain any individual who warps in, but only one such individual. You would have to provide identification to be allowed out of the cell. The geometry and specifics of the warp node would determine the geometry of those cells.
  - If the warp nodes are on the surface of the sphere, then they extend up into the air. This has implications for humans warping in from the air, performing orbital strikes if they put themselves in freefall above a warp node, etc.\\
  - It can likewise be used for safety: anyone in a failing aircraft simply needs to get their ground-speed (and vertical speed) low enough and then warp in. Warp-nodes in non-combat situations would likely be padded for this application. A civilian warp-node would likely have a few "modes" it could be placed in, for commerce versus safety. It would not be hard to move a network of fishing line into place in, say, a second - in order to block key regions quickly, selecting for the "extinguish fires" region of the warp node, which has a pool of water situated directly under it
  - The same ideas would apply (to some extent) to ley lines: securing entry/exit points and the such

Note that he says it's a 100 ft. diameter circle and you can only carry 100 lb. A 100 lb. gunpowder bomb might be able to blow a hole in a wall which is less than 20 ft. thick, but heavily defended warp nodes with immensely thick walls might still resist that kind of blast. And that's even assuming you can make it to the wall. It's entirely possible that they build the wall in a 300 ft. perimeter from the warp node so that they can have plenty of time to shoot potential attackers. There may also be uneven ground or an internal moat to slow you down further.

*** **** Portals
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: portals
     :END:
IMO these are going to have the most cultural impact. There's going to be local-area Farmer's Almanac-equivalents with listings of local known portals, where they go, and when they open. There's probably going to be caravans that wander certain favorable portal-chains, trading in various towns along their path but sticking to a relatively tight schedule. There's going to be /all sorts/ of fairy tales, mostly warning kids not to go into strange portals. When a portal to a large town opens up, there's going to be a bit of a party in local rural communities.

Assuming there's no simple "portus detectus" spell, portal hunting is going to be an incredibly popular sport with everyone from children roaming in the woods to seasoned military professionals in the middle of a war. After all, if you're the only one who knows about a portal you've potentially got a massive economic (or military) advantage over everyone else.

Portals also mean that isolated ecological niches... aren't. The ecology of the world is going to be a lot more uniform, because the most competitive species are inevitably going to wander their way through a portal and spread out into new areas. If portal hunting is hard, this is probably going to be the most common way of finding a portal - I expect the area around a jungle portal in the middle of an evergreen forest would stand out quite a bit.

And all that is ignoring the fact that if portals are uniformly distributed over the surface of the planet, most of them are gonna open up over water.

**** Warp nodes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: warp-nodes
     :END:
Make the spell cost (or refund) the potential energy difference between where you are and where you're going. Otherwise you're gonna be patching out perpetual motion machines foreeever.

Simplest example: Dig a 100 foot well down from a node. Enchant a metal slug with the effect "after falling 90 feet, warp". Drop the slug down a tube wrapped in fine wire. You've now got all the electricity you could ever want. Use the electricity to pump all the air out of the tube. You've now got a RKKV, assuming you can aim it somewhere besides your own feet.

Anyway, city nodes are going to be super heavily guarded - especially if someone figures out how to take the RKKV from the previous paragraph and bind it to another warp node. I imagine that the vast majority of cities will have a 100 foot diameter plug that they shove in to place when they're not expecting anyone (simplest method would be a massive wicker structure, I think - it just needs to fill space).

I think the ecological impacts of this method would be really interesting, too - if the spell is simple enough that any human can learn it, and it costs zero mana, then you can bet your ass that almost every natural creature will have that spell in their back pocket for emergencies (always remember that [[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/security_is_a_t.html][there is considerable overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists]]).

This will make the local warp node something like a watering hole. In a natural environment, all sorts of creatures will be passing through it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if warp nodes out in the unexplored wilderness tend to be home to the biggest badass creature around - all the food it could want, if it's hungry.

This is potentially risky if your plug can get set on fire by a saboteur. However, suppose the defenders mound up dirt around the warp node to create a circular hill around a valley. You could then put a bunch of ceramic obstacles on rollers and let them roll into position in an emergency.

*** Warp sites are like airports, except they have existed since forever and air traffic control is irrelevant.

Airports have tarmac, terminals, gates, runways, hangars, customs, security checkpoints, pickups and dropoffs, baggage claims, parking for long term, parking for short term.

What will warp points have? Receiving areas, customs, security? Walls surrounding them to prevent invasion? Perhaps mechanisms to control how many people can use them at a time? Will there be a special word for the hospital at the warp site, or the fee paid when you use one? (Think 'fare' for flights vs 'toll' for drives). A word for the floor you step on when you warp?

I'd use airports to guide my worldbuilding around warp, and highways to guide my worldbuilding around ley-lines.
