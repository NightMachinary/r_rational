Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Random idea: There is a world where people are exactly the same as to us in every way except for how they dream. In their dreams, they are perfectly lucid with incredible powers of visualization and focus. They can dream about worlds and situations however they like as god-like tyrants, adventurers exploring marvels of nature, scenes with the perfect woman/man, and more. With the best possible dreams and the waking world being the same as ours, how would their society develop?

*** I think you'd get at least a subset of people who treated the waking world as the worse of the two, and who treated their mundane waking life as being, essentially, a distraction, or a necessity that had to be endured. In bad times, this subset would likely be a majority. For those people, drugs that induced sleep would be common, and they would only put the minimum amount of effort into the waking world, enough to let them get from dream to dream.

As a reaction to that, you would have stories, social norms, etc. that frame the dreams as /bad/, or as seductive tools of demons, or as places where you need to not indulge yourself. Because of sociocultural survival of the fittest, I'd expect cultures with a strong "anti-dream" mentality to be the dominant ones; they're the ones that are getting things done in the real world, building up forces, feeding the masses, engaging in education, etc. This might be different if it wasn't from the start of human history, because in the modern era it's possible to get work done while in your hypelucid dreams, but for most of human history, that wasn't the case. The things that needed to be done needed to be done /while awake/, because they were almost all manual labor of one kind or another.

Once people can do productive things with their dreams, i.e. intellectual labor, I think you would see a focus on memorization and visualization, and something like "dream accountability", where you have to report the results of your dream-work to someone. This is a social tool that helps with competition between societies; those where labor takes place an extra eight hours a day would be vastly more productive than in those where it doesn't. I'm not sure exactly what that would look like -- dream confessions to a superior? A measuring of output with standards that can only be reached by working in your dreams? I'm also not sure what the limits of work would be, with training, and how best to capitalize on what's possible within those limits.

I would think a lot of art and culture would be "dream fodder", that is, designed such that you can adapt it into your lucid dreams, rather than being a proper story in its own right, or in /addition/ to being a story in its own right. I'd think that you would get media that were essentially worldbuilding documents, supplying all the instructions necessary for a unique and interesting time in your dreams.

So if you are exploring a cave, then the cave system would only last until the dreamer has passed through it. Once the dreamer has cleared a room without the intention to go back, then it would dissolve away. Basically yes you are limited by brain power, but the brain is pretty efficient and good at giving a convincing illusion of limitless space and unexplored realms in your dreams.

*** Well given that humans enjoy fresh experiences, and you can only dream what you know, every second of people's waking existences could be dedicated to increasing world-wide exposure to new ideas. After being educated, humans could be divided into jobs such as information gatherers, information categorizers, and of course information distributors. Life would become the densest possible flood of maximum marginal surprise. Algorithms could be devised to tailor people's information diets to whatever would have the best chance of exposing people to something they couldn't think up on their own. Pharmaceutical companies would compete to create drugs that would artificially elongate sleep cycles. Work would become increasingly important as the only source of social interaction that would have a chance at competing against the wonders of sleep, since families and friends couldn't match the fantasy and work would at least provide people with resources to support their sleeping selves. Slowly, as automation took over, more and more people would retreat into eternal dream chambers to experience the high forever - perhaps being woken up every week for a few hours of dream-enhancing knowledge boosts.

** Battle-school worldbuilding, pt. 5 ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/][pt. 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xim6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/du8n1im/][pt. 2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z66gn/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dulzjqx/?context=3][pt 3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/80wpad/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/duysdam/][pt 4]], tl;dr: might makes right, inadequate equilibria, metagames, magic arenas, minor magical enhancements to melee combat)

--------------

So you have this battle school, where the elites /all/ send their children for a variety of reasons, and where everyone learns how best to weild a blade and limited magic in combat, along with a fraction of study dedicated to more useful subjects, all because of inadequete equilibria, entrenched institutions, feedback loops, etc. What does that school look like, given the sociocultural forces at work, the school's stated and actual purpose, the founder effects, the traditions that would inevitably arise, etc.?

I think the foundation is, essentially, that this is the place where teenage boys get pounded into the shape that best suits their society, which in part means learning how to fight, and in part means figuring out the easiest of the functional society-shapes that they might be able to fit into. To that end, much of the battle school consists of battles (duh) where these boys can test each other in combat in a controlled and structured environment, and much of the extracirriculars consist of testing each other in combat in less formal arrangements, especially in those which are more tangential to the societal concept of ritualized combat itself.

Battle school lasts for three years, after which you are considered a sufficient enough fighter that you can move through the world on your own. /Before/ battle school there is typically a series of tutors and occasional camps or training with some master or another. /After/ battle school there is usually an apprenticeship of some kind, and since these are elites, it's usually an apprenticeship with someone who is a titan of industry or who serves some important function within the apparatus of the state (it's very common for this to be with their father, but in the case of a second son, sometimes their position will be a lesser one with their father's ally, or with a friend they made in battle school). Three years in part because I like trilogies, and in part because it splits the difference on real-world education durations; at three years, you've probably hit diminishing marginal utility of education.

In the real world, school "houses" are usually a matter of some actual, tangible difference in the enrollees, such as those who are local and those who are from abroad, or those who live on campus and those who go home at the end of the day. It's somewhat tempting to make an urban/rural distinction -- those that live in the enormous capital city against those who are big fish in a small, provincial pond -- but I'm not sure that plays into the themes I want well enough, nor does it seem strictly useful from a "molding societal units" standpoint, especially if that distinction is one that bubbles below the surface rather than is front and center. Instead, I think that it's going to be division by business of the father -- a house for those whose family business is primarily farming, a house for those who do governance, a house for those who do shipping or fishing, etc.

This is good for a number of reasons. First, there's some element of choice, if your father has his fingers in several pies. Second, there's some element of cohesion, because the people that you're in a house with will be the ones that you have to interact with more often, and who you might have the biggest rivalries with. Third, it means that house themes essentially come pre-established, iconography isn't terribly hard, and there's quite a bit of variance in what battles and styles of battle there are, especially the case if I take as canon an idea from last time, which is that different realms of law tend to follow thematic or ironic arena battles, e.g. tridents in a flooded arena for maritime law. So you'd have the Fish House, which specializes in water, because they're mostly the sons of people with business in or around the water, and they study nets, tridents, etc. as their secondary weapons or realms because it ties back into what they'll be expected to have to deal with in their ritualized battles. It gives some nice tensions to any potential story. On top of this, it's easy (and for the actors involved, useful) to have cooperation and conflict within a house, as well as cooperation and conflict with other houses, depending on the circumstances. Furthermore, if the national philosophy is "might makes right", then the houses help to reinforce the distinction of the elites over the non-elite; positions within a house, or entrance into a house, is proof of might, which is proof of right, which is justification for rule.

The initial conception had ~200 students in the class that would be the focus of the narrative, which means something like 10K-20K elites in the society. Divided evenly, those ~200 students would fit into about 40 per house with 5 houses, and 20 per house with 10 houses. Multiplied by three years, that's between 120 and 60 students in each house, which seems fairly reasonable, if a little more than is helpful for narrative purposes.

Naively, we wouldn't expect these houses to be evenly balanced, but if there's some element of choice, then it's pretty easy to create some Goldilocks incentives both for the houses themselves, and for students deciding which house they'd like to be in. Absent any traditions, structures, or incentives, you wouldn't want to be in too large a house, because then it's possible to get lost in the masses and not be able to distinguish yourself. On the opposite side, you wouldn't want to be in a house that's too small, because there wouldn't be enough valuable connections (but this is a bad incentive, because it could lead to house collapse). Here are some potential incentives to roughly stabilize house numbers:

- Each house has their own accommodations and dormitories, all of which were built roughly equal in size, so if you pack into a house that already has too many people, you're left with little room, which not only isn't a good time for you, but might earn the ire of people whose space you've taken a part of.
- Houses have house captains and other official/functional positions, which give powers and/or a stipend, and which stabilize even the smallest house to at least as many roles or functions as there are (captain, undercaptain, treasurer, secretary, trainer?). Five is a significant number, since that's squad size. And even if those positions are taken, people might sign on to a house with the knowledge that they can issue a challenge against someone weak, or take up a position once the third-years graduate.
- There are a number of incentives in place for large families, and while legacy might play some part in selection, there's also incentive to have specialization between brothers, which would allow them to better defend each other, meaning some incentives for brothers to spread out among the houses.
- There are certain mass combat scenarios which have hard caps on participants; additional members can't compete, which gives a disincentive to join a house that's over the limit, and an incentive for under-strength houses to be more aggressive in recruiting.
- Houses are to some extent a proxy for certain areas of the law, and much in the same way that I'd expect five majors leading into five equally lucrative careers to balance themselves by virtue of people attempting to go where the competition isn't, I would expect there to be pressure to go into the greenest field.

Probably also a teacher-advocate for each house, something like a student adviser but for the house as a whole, though I'm not sure what their exact role would equate to, and the idea of teachers putting their thumbs on the scale seems both too derivative of Harry Potter, and unseemly on the face of it given that they're meant to student led/run.

Names for this project mostly taken from Latin, but I'm probably going to reskin in the near future because I don't know Latin, don't want to learn Latin, and don't want to piss people off my misusing Latin. Probably spin something up using Vulgar and making sure that a few things like negation and diminutive suffixes translate without much effort.

- *Trames*\\
  Identity: Government, other functions of the common good\\
  Signature Battle: Team battles

- *Praedium*\\
  Identity: Things that are grown, farms, livestock\\
  Signature Battle: Mud and muck

- *Specus*\\
  Identity: Things that are taken from the ground, mines\\
  Signature Battle: Claustrophobic tunnels

- *Flumen*\\
  Identity: Waterways, oceans, fishing\\
  Signature Battle: Flooded arenas

- *Mercator*\\
  Identity: Merchants, buyers and sellers\\
  Signature Battle: Bidding battles

- *Sudor*\\
  Identity: Skilled labor\\
  Signature Battle: Fortification and/or extended planning time

I might add in more later, but these seem to cover basic sectors of the economy, especially for a 17th century equivalent. Notably missing is construction (wrapped into Sudor at the moment), engineering, education, research, refining, and renting, but the categories are broad enough that I think you can fit square pegs into round holes in a believable way.

(For an example of the system in process, a boy whose father is primarily in the business of shipping would be able to pledge to Flumen or Mercator. If both, they might negotiate between themselves for who would get him. If space is tight, he would have to plead his case, and possibly battle for a spot in the house.)

**** I'm not sure that I have the gender politics of the setting fully worked out yet.

/Currently/, I have it at about an 80/20 gender split in favor of boys. Equal rights at this point in the society basically means "women can participate on equal footing in contests and in institutions which inherently favor men". In the case of trial-by-combat, the average woman has a disadvantage against the average man, mostly because of issues of height, reach, and muscle mass, not to mention the issue of pregnancy. Entrance of girls into the battle school is, to some extent, a political move on a few levels, none of which are all that great for the girls, or in the sense of /actual/ equality:

- Girls are there more to build political alliances than to learn how to fight
- Girls are there more to find or advertise for a marriage than to learn how to fight
- Girls are there because even with the characteristically large families, some of the families have only girls, or only one boy, necessitating one of them to pick up the slack as far as trial-by-combat goes
- Girls enter into battle school if they're toward the end of a few bell curves (the best of the best)

That being the case, I'd think that a lot of girls would take a year at battle school and then wash out, simply because it's not expected that they stay in, and because their interests can be served with only a single year there. I kind of like this from a setting perspective, since it underlines a lot of the themes and issues that I want underlined, namely the power of entrenched institutions and customs to perpetuate a system that only the people in power are really happy with (and maybe not even then).

But on the other hand, there's the question of "if this is what the boys are doing, what are the girls doing?" If they /don't/ go to battle school, as a general rule, where do they go to get hammered into the society-shape they're expected to be in? Having children aside, and the running of a household being something that's largely taken care of by the people you hire, what role do women play? Which I've got a few ideas for, but am still trying to hammer out, since there's both division of labor and practical arrangements to work out (architecture, engineering, arts, science, medicine, management, planning, religion, etc.) and burdens to be placed.

****** I feel kind of torn about it.

On the one hand, I do prefer to tear out all the troublesome elements that I'm not really interested in exploring in a world; it would feel weird to have an incidental genocide going on in the background of a romance if it's not touched on or explained very much, or in any way central to the plot. In that way a lot of things get shuffled to the side, or justified in some way as not being a problem in /this/ world.

But on the other hand, it can feel like white-washing history, in a "wasn't medieval England great?" kind of way. It's not even just about /history/, it's about /people/ and how they relate to one another, which forms the basis of the sexual and racial inequality that's so incredibly prevalent through the course of human history. I'm of the opinion that human history happened the way it did for reasons, and those reasons are half down to stupid brain biology, and half down to structural forces at work. Ignoring those or justifying them away seems ... wrong, somehow, like it's shying away from what it means to be human, because it feels better to do that. (I still do it, because it's not always a bear that I want to wrestle with, but I do sometimes think that I'm short-changing some particular element of how worlds actually work.)

All that said, /this/ particular project is meant to be /about/ the entrenched systems and structural forces, and in part is about how a movement can fail by addressing the wrong things, or how people miss the forest for the trees when crusading, and shying away from issues of gender inequality in a society that revolves around a male-coded and male-advantaged activity like armed combat feels doubly wrong. (Which is not to say that I think it's going to be a novel that's about gender equality, just one that takes place in a society which thinks it's equal but is manifestly not to anyone paying attention, in a way that hopefully reinforces the more direct themes of rich/poor and how power structures perpetuate themselves.)

** For a while, I've had an idea in my head of a civilization suddenly granted scientific and technological knowledge far beyond their current level of development, basically the Primitive Technology channel on a planetary scale. My initial conception was that of a textbook sent back in time as part of a stable time loop, but it could also be from an outside source.

Say that a planet has a sacred text, that was mysteriously discovered soon after they'd developed a robust enough writing system. The book contains things like diagrammed instructions on metallurgy, basic and advanced chemistry and physics, et cetera, and basically walks them through how to become a powerful civilization without all the clumsy false starts inherent in the scientific method.

How much more quickly could such a civilization develop, if the primary bottleneck were infrastructure and not discovering the core principles and how to apply them? A caveman clearly isn't going to build a nuke in his cave, but if he knew /how/ to build one, how many years of building things to help build stronger things, to in turn build even stronger things, would the tribe need before they're colonizing space?

*** It's partly a matter of infrastructure, and partly a matter of training. If you've ever followed a very clear and precise set of instructions and bungled it because you didn't have any idea what you were actually doing ... yeah, that kind of thing would be a problem, no matter how idiot-proof the text was. You'd still need divisions of labor and specializations.

Honestly, the biggest hurdle is probably food for a very long time. How many people can a single farmer feed? In medieval times, the answer was "three or four", but the number gets lower and lower as you backward in time, in part because of technology, but also, in part, because of the limited diversity of crops and inefficiency of said crops in delivering calories. The staple crops as they now exist are the products of millennia of selective breeding, which our hypothetical tribe wouldn't have, regardless of what the book said on the matter, not without a lot of time and effort spent growing crops and selectively breeding them. Same goes for domesticating animals.

And the other big bottleneck, which is only partially infrastructure, is the matter of urban concentrations and the logistics and politics of getting food and materials to them. But I'm not sure how much that's within the scope of the book -- people know how to do all this stuff, but they don't necessarily have a reason to, not if the primary beneficiary is going to be the king who's taxing everyone to within an inch of their lives.

(My rough guess, depending on what crops, animals, and materials are available, is that it would be doable in a few hundred years, less if there was absolute dedication to the task, more if there were development traps or other unforeseen consequences. Overtaxation by a tyrant king who has the means to prevent anyone from advancing (though they have the knowledge) and the incentive to do so is one example, but another, less grim one is that effective contraception is developed which limits the size of a society and thus, the resource chains that it can support).
