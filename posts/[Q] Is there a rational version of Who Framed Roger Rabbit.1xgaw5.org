Spoilers about the movie, obviously.

--------------

I watched it for the first time last night, and there were a lot of things that I found interesting. There were things that were only possible when they would be funny, portable holes, and nearly immortal beings. There was spontaneous matter generation, spontaneous generation of sentient life, and more.

It seems like a world ready for rationalist manipulation, yet I haven't found any yet.


** The world runs off of the rule of funny. Be the right kind of straight man for science themed toons and solve the problem of human mortality/world hunger/cheap space travel in a gag.

In other words, transcend to god hood with a spit take.

** I strongly suspect that anything relating to the Toons would make a rationalist start drinking and never stop.

The simple fact that not knowing you should fall lets you fly would do it for me.

**** The big problem here is that any system which relies on actively monitoring mindstates and sometimes only doing things when they're funny is going to be /much/ harder to manipulate.

** The toon force is widely regarded as one of the most powerful forces in fiction and here we have an entire world/town that is made out of it. Any rationalist would ascend to godhood within months or give up on rationality entirely.

** One of my favourite films of all time, so I'd eat up a good intellectually-rigorous take. Bonus points if white face/red nose partnerships (aka the typical comedy duo, straight man and goof-off) are worked in as some form of exploit or optimisation.

** Isn't it? The main character is a detective, trying his best to figure things out. Does he act manifestly stupid or ignore things that he really should have paid attention to?
