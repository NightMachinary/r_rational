Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** 26 September is Stanislav Petrov Day.

Lesser known, and less-celebrated, is 27 October, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov Day.

This has got me thinking: Could we create a full [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calendar_of_saints][calendar of feast days]] in honor of people who, in some sense of the word, "saved the world," before having to water down the meaning of "saved the world"?

** I've been a bit annoyed at fantasy / sci fi species VERY frequently having human posture and walking manner. After having read some human evolution books one thing becomes quite clear, humans walk very strangely.

​

Pretty much no other animal walks like us or has a posture like ours ever. It's a pretty unique movement method suited for persistence hunting, but it's worst for pretty much everything else compared to other more common locomotion methods, it's slower, less controllable, more prone to falls and other kinds of accidents etc.

​

Given that, few if any sentients should move or walk as modern humans do, unless they are related to us. If you want to make a bipedal sentient look at birds and dinosaurs that's the normal bipedal body type not ours.

​

It feels incredibly lazy and cliche to see +95% of sentient species in fiction being portrayed as humans with masks / make up. On TV or movies where there's budget limitations and special effect costs it's at least understandable but in written word and comics there are no valid excuses. We can do better..

*** I sorta disagree, but it's hard to explain.

The nature of the development of high intelligence through evolution means any species which does it must come from a background where progressive tiny improvements in intelligence were always more beneficial than having a slightly more massive brain was detrimental. You can't have an environment where a high-intelligence niche opens up suddenly and something rapidly evolves to fill it because having a giant, well-networked brain is too complicated to develop quickly. Furthermore, brains are so expensive that evolution does not attempt to maximize their size unless each increment succeeds.

In practical terms, this means you need some kind of recursively changing environment where becoming smarter means the next generation will also benefit from being smarter. This means you either need some highly unlikely series of adjacent different environments for a species to develop into, or one environment which changes with increasing intelligence.

On Earth, this environment has always been social. In a social setting with other members of your species, being slightly smarter is nearly always an advantage, as you'll be able to make better plans than anyone else. But this is a runaway process. Once it starts, it becomes self-perpetuating, as the only factor spurring the rate of intelligence improvement is the intelligence of the species itself, and the only limiting factor is food. Which becomes less and less limiting as you get smarter. Which removes the primary evolutionary downside to large brains entirely.

On an evolutionary scale, this can happen pretty fast. It took tens of millions of years for land-dwelling mammals to become streamlined whales, hundreds of millions for the earliest arthropods to settle into the general shapes we're familiar with today. Gross bodily shifts, streamlined and perfected for new environments, are really slow. But the earliest evidence we have of human-like behavior among apes was only a couple million years ago.

Our bodies haven't had the time to rearrange themselves to be ideal at what we do yet. Perhaps the most salient example of this is not our awkward, dangerous locomotion, but the birth canal. Our brains literally cannot grow any larger now, and the limit is the width of the hole in the female pelvis. The positive feedback loop which developed human intelligence worked faster than basic things like optimizing reproduction and walking.

The last bit here is that our ability to walk upright may have catalyzed this positive feedback loop. Communal persistence hunters benefit from higher intelligence, which was apparently enough to start the runaway process. You have to have compelling reasons to stick together and rudimentary planning capabilities to hunt like that, and those are also what you need to start playing social dominance games where intelligence has an outsized effect.

Taken all together: it is reasonable to assume that the evolutionary process which produces high intelligence requires specific conditions. However, once those conditions happen, the actual development of intelligence can and will outpace the physical improvements which seem "obvious" to the naïve observer. We went from literal dumb animals, to tool use, to modern humans, all in around five million years, and if we don't wipe ourselves out it is reasonable to think we're going to begin colonizing the rest of the galaxy in the next evolutionary eyeblink. This "stupidly designed" body is nonetheless likely good enough to be the one human immortals remember with fondness.

Which means we can reasonably speculate that all evolved alien species will also have some obvious design flaws in their evolved physical bodies. Maybe it won't be stupidly designed backs and pelvises which limit brain size, but it will be /something./ The evolution of intelligence outpaced the evolution of the bodies best able to wield it in every case on Earth, and it is reasonable to assume that will also happen elsewhere.

***** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool%20use%20by%20animals][Tool use by animals]]*

Tool use by animals is a phenomenon in which an animal uses any kind of tool in order to achieve a goal such as acquiring food and water, grooming, defense, recreation or construction. Originally thought to be a skill possessed only by humans, some tool use requires a sophisticated level of cognition. There is considerable discussion about the definition of what constitutes a tool and therefore which behaviours can be considered true examples of tool use. A wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, fish, cephalopods, and insects, are considered to use tools.

** I want to talk about a topic I find endlessly fascinating: single quotes versus double quotes. To begin with, here's how I operate.

If I am directly quoting a phrase that both relays the words and intentions of a given speaker, I'll use double quotes. For example, the universal declaration of human rights begins with "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."

If I instead point out a specific word or phrase, or a snippet from a larger quote devoid of it's context, I'll use single quotes. For example, to point out that the beginning of the UDHR starts with the word 'whereas.'

If I want to have a multiparagraph-quotation, I'll start each pharagraph with an opening double quote, but only include a single closing double quote at the end of the quotation.

"This is the first paragraph.

"This is the second.

"This is the final one," she said.

"'And of course, I follow the standard English convention of alternating between single and double quotes when I have nested quotations,' she said," he said.

How do you all use quotation marks?

*** Everything you've said regarding double quotation marks is the standard correct method, to my knowledge.

For single quotation marks, I tend to use them when /not/ directly quoting something. For instance, I use them when paraphrasing what a person or group has been known to say (example in the last sentence of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gkaryj/d_friday_open_thread/fqrgefv/][this comment]]). I also use them as a sort-of caveat for words that embody philosophical concepts with a very subjective, and sometimes contradictory, meaning (i.e. 'good' or 'evil').

*** Please, never use that approach to multiparagraph-quotation. I trip over it every time I see it, and I swear I'm not trying to be pedantic on purpose. It just takes me right out of the story.

It doesn't help either that a lot of online writers simply forget to end some paragraphs with a quote, either. And then when they do it on purpose, they assume that they don't have to specify that the person from the first paragraph is still talking. Argh!

The end result is something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Steve smiled. "Hey, how are you?

  "I'm great," said Anna. "Actually, let me tell you about my day. So first of all, I went to the supermarket.

  "That's a lot of fun, going to the supermarket, right? Yeah, I think so too. But then, something crazy happened!"
#+end_quote

There is *no* reason for this. Okay, I get that you might want to avoid walls of text, but if you really don't want to combine the two paragraphs into one, just end it with a double quotation as normal and add an extra dialogue tag for the next one. Or better yet, insert a short reaction from the guy she's talking to in between the two paragraphs. Surely that would be a better way to break up the text.

It's simply like many other aspects of the English language - like using the correct spelling of homophones, or the correct placement of apostrophes in the possessive form of words that end in 's'; any person will be tripped up by it until they learn the standard.

'It's annoying to people who find the standard confusing' is a really low bar to base your behavior on when the entirety of the English language is full of other rules like that.

If you write a My Little Pony fanfiction and you don't end a line of dialogue with an end quote, your average reader is going to assume that you simply *forgot*.

I don't care how good you think your MLP fanfiction is, it's simply not reasonable to expect your reader to go "Aha, unlike the last seventeen times I have seen this error, I can only assume that this particular author is doing it on purpose as part of an elaborate scheme to achieve nothing of use whatsoever."

In this, paradoxically, they are perhaps closer to the real-life experience of the aspiring but not often successful rationalist than many of the ideal spherical-HPMOR-in-a-vacuum style works commonly discussed here :)
