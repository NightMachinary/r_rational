Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.


** I'm really struggling with dialogue at the moment. I'm suffering a bit from the problem of trying to write characters who are smarter than you are, only with social competence instead of more abstract intelligence.

Anyone have any good tips / references on writing good dialogue?

*** The thing that helps me is to put the camera inside the person's head. Focus on why they are saying it, not what they are saying. What is their goal, are they feeling empathetic / manipulative, etc.

*** I actually like writing dialogues most! My approach for them is to have the conversation in my head multiple times before I ever start writing. I tend to just try to get into my characters' heads, and then to see where the conversation goes. Every repetition, the characters might react just a little differently, which sends the conversation in completely different directions. So after going over the dialogue ten times or so (typically while going out for a walk, doing dishes or cleaning the house), I have usually found the reactions that lead to the things I wanted said to get said.

Oh, and a completely unrelated second point: pay attention to character voice. It's very easy to fall into the pitfall of making all the characters talk like you talk. /coughs guiltily/

*** Dialogue is probably the hardest writing skill to teach. I'm not an expert (though I do like my dialogue more than most other parts of my writing), so take this with a grain of salt.

If you're trying to write a serious dialogue (this technique is overkill for a few lines, though it might be good to do a quick run-through), break it down like eaglejarl suggested.

For each participant, ask yourself a few questions:

1. What do they want to get out of this conversation (e.g. information, catharsis, manipulation, persuasion, bonding)?
2. What is their emotional state (e.g. calm, angry, sad, joyful)?
3. What is the context of the conversation (e.g. in public, in private, after a traumatic experience, before a known challenge)?
4. If the group is united by a common thread, what is that thread (e.g. classmates, friends, family, colleagues, strangers on a train)?
5. How do they relate to the other participants individually (e.g. like them, love them, irritated by them, unfamiliar with them)?
6. What is the character's background (personality, intelligence, charisma, upbringing, social status, profession, education, experience)? You don't need to explicitly list all this every time, just keep it in mind.
7. What is the character's voice? This one is complicated, because people often have trouble with giving characters distinct voices (I sure do).

You can use this information to narrow down the direction of the conversation. It can also help you find points of conflict like asymmetric relationships and opposed motivations.

Actually writing the dialogue is both easier and harder. Easier because there are thousands of books, TV shows, and movies out there with well-written genre- and mood-appropriate dialogue. Harder because it's not easy to translate everything you've read and heard into your own story.

Tips:

1. Intersperse the dialogue with actions. Actions can help set the scene and moderate the dialogue's pacing. If an action is significant, put it in. If the dialogue needs a stronger break than just a full stop, put an action in.

#+begin_quote
  "You, John Doe, are a selfish, cruel husk of a man---" She slapped him hard enough to set his ears ringing. "---And I will never love you."
#+end_quote

Conversely, you don't want to interrupt a line of dialogue that needs to be in one go:

#+begin_quote
#+end_quote

Try to choose the actions so that they provide insight into the character performing them. Refer to your answers to the questions above.

2. The length and tone of a line of dialogue affects the mood of the scene. If A questions B repeatedly (especially if not waiting for a decent response) it feels like an interrogation. If A and B trade short, angry lines it feels like a shouting match. If A has long, rambling lines and B only has short responses, it feels like a lecture.

You can use this to your advantage to get a particular effect, or you can vary the length and tone to create a more conversational style.

3. Characters that aren't talking should be responding somehow. You don't need to actually write how they're responding (dialogue would get very clunky if every participant needed a "response shot"), but you should keep it in mind and mention the most important things.

Their response could be anything; an action, an emotion, a thought, readying a response, distractedly looking around.

4. A character not speaking when they could is another type of line. You may want to have them pointedly do something that isn't speaking to get the idea across.

#+begin_quote
  "It's well after midnight, your clothes are filthy, and I can smell alcohol on your breath," said Sarah's mother, sneering. "You've been out with that disgusting boy again, haven't you?"

  Sarah looked at her mother's dowdy clothing and perfunctory makeup. Why did she care what this tired old woman thought? They were nothing alike. Sarah wondered if her mother had ever been young, or if she had been born a frump.

  "Well?" Sarah's mother put her hands on her hips. "What do you have to say for yourself, young lady?"

  Sarah considered responding, then shook her head. She pushed past her mother and climbed the stairs, angry exclamations following her.

  There'd be hell to pay in the morning, but she smiled as she locked her door. She fell into bed without undressing. In her dreams, her mother's shouting and banging on the door was the squawking of seagulls. Sarah soared above, aquiline and untouchable.
#+end_quote

5. You can also have characters interrupt (or not interrupt) another line of dialogue. Again, this decision should reflect the characters involved.

Generally I'd use interruptions sparingly, because they feel disproportionately numerous (so do most techniques really). A person in real life might interrupt every second sentence, but if you do that in a story it'll feel like it's constant. One or two interruptions a conversation will make a character feel like they interrupt regularly.

** Thanks to this thread last week I've been able to put my finger on why I don't like the first chapter of my story (the two lovers-to-be meet in a very random, coincidental seeming way). I was also talking with a friend / beta reader who said that the story started out kind of boring but then got very good when the vampire stuff started getting revealed and he said he liked the worldbuilding. So those two things coming to a head in the first week result in me realising that we need more vampire PoV, since vampires are /weird/ (also, reading Crystal Society made me realise that seeing inhuman PoVs where they are being exploitative can work if done well, so I will not shy away from it). I haven't written up a proper first chapter yet, but I've written a first part of the first chapter.

Here's the old one: [[http://pastebin.com/72WudD2c]] (will be chopped up and used for parts)

Here's the new one: [[http://pastebin.com/UmYrMSgv]] (kind of want to start the story with the last line in that passage, in a "truth universally accepted" lets-have-a-good-first-sentence sort of way)

Observations from re-writing include that the act of writing all last month has kind of improved the quality of my writing, as I like the quality of the second attempt at an initial chapter better than the first.

(Also I'm back into calling it supernatural romance rather than vampire yaoi. Probably the genre it best fits in. I should read at least the first Twilight novel to see how the amount of action/etc compares. Definitely have more romance and less action than say /Hunger Games/ though that's not saying much.)

Finally, I spent like 4 hours yesterday reading through the whole thing from start to finish and editing it, mostly to see how the continuity thread goes through. (For example I decided at some point that one of the characters would buy an encyclopaedia, but needed to find the first mention of that. Also, one character lies and says he's a naval officer, but with the new first chapter that may no longer happen, so I went through and flagged all of those). That took /so long/ and was really fun in some places to re-read what I wrote, but the passages I'd edited thoroughly only a few days earlier were a bit boring to read through again. I think next time I do that I'll have to take a "detox" from the story and then approach it with fresher eyes.

It's at 30k words now and based on all the stuff I've sketched to go in, I think it's going to end up at 35k-40k. It will be the first volume of three - it's actually a prologue to the stuff I'd /actually/ wanted to write! - but it's gotten a life on its own and has been fun and satisfying to write for its own sake.

No specific questions beyond, "is my new first chapter better?" and "does anyone have advice on how to do big editing marathons?" and "does anyone have any advice or thoughts or anecodotes they want to contribute".

** Two questions:

1. Is it possible to write characters that are smarter than you? And by smarter I mean in a qualitative sense, not just that they can think the same thoughts as you at a much faster rate.

2. How would you demonstrate a character becoming noticeably smarter?

I've had two conundrums lately. One is trying to write the motives and thoughts for a human-friendly AGI. The other is that I'm interested in LITRPG, and many of them have an 'intelligence' stat, but it seems underpowered. It rarely ever translates to IQ, and if it does it seems to stop having benefits above the author's IQ.
