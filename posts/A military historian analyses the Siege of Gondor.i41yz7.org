** This analysis immediately melts for me because it completely fails to take into account the fact that Gondor and Mordor have been fighting over Osgiliath for decades and the latter has more or less total control of their side of the river. The orcs probably already figured out the whole logistics thing by then, and the distance between Osgiliath and Minas Tirith is, like, a work commute.

He's acting like the entire army is just going out straight from Minas Morgul instead of the guys who see coming from there just being reinforcements to make the final attack. Which requires just taking what you see at the movie completely at face value and not making inferences of any kind.

Also the logistics thing is kinda dampened by the fact that, well, they're /orcs/. You don't necessarily /need/ to keep them supplied. The big more elite ones need to be fed. But for the rest he can just march them hungry, and throw them at the nearest source of food. E.G. Minas Tirith. Where there's a whip there's a way after all.

Also while it's more of a joke, this image subtitle at the very end annoys me.

Uh, because they're hiding? Because we already saw in the movies that the fighting in Osgiliath is basically urban guerilla warfare at that point? That's literally what rangers are for.

*** All blog posts of that author I read (Gondor , Helm's Deep, Case for Humanity) are quite weak. Average amateur military history, not even advanced amateurs which you find at dedicated forums. Surprisingly [[https://foreignpolicy.com/author/bret-devereaux/][his articles at FP]] and quite insightful and [[https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/parent/3r074v31f/file_sets/5d86p0623][his PhD]] is interesting and informative. I guess he is well versed in Roman History but not so good at everything else.

PS from his PhD his specialization is Roman weapon and armor mostly. Logistics and mobility not so much

** Right of the bat hes so wrong, its like he didnt even watch the movie.

Boromir litteraly said Gondor has been fightning orc invasion for years, and Faramir was literaly shown the reinforcements from other parts of the world.

That means what when we see orcs marching from black gate, we actually only see elites. They number in thousands, but majority of the army is already deployed and providing infrastructure.

And while i agree that the army marches on its stomach, we have been shown the Mordor as a literal wasteland. I dont think orcs need much food, and they probably survive on canibalisam and replenish numbers from magic.

Surely you've not seen /all/ of Mordor.

In the books, after Sam speculates that they must be getting their food from /somewhere,/ the omniscient third-person narration says:

"Neither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark sad waters of Lake Nurnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves."

So there you have it: a large fertile agricultural area in southern Mordor, plus an extensive transportation network.

*** What's the evidence that orcs are magical? Everything I remember about them suggests to me that they are as magical as the average human.

Canibalism is an interesting suggestion. The average human is about 80 kg and eats about 2kg a day. Assuming a similar mass to food ratio for orcs they would need to eat 2,5% of their army each day to survive surviving on canibalism alone. After 11 days the army would then be at 3/4 of it's original size.

****** Spells in the sense of a typical tabletop RPG don't appear very frequently in LotR. Those who use spells (such as Gandalf) are in possession of one of the Rings of Power.

It's possible that there are some examples in works such as The Silmarillion. Even then, the magic is either in an artifact, or else is indistinguishable from incredible skill and talent.

******** Yes, Gandalf (aka. Olorin) was a Maia, and participated directly in the creation of Arda both in the metaphysical singing-before-time and the direct construction of the world.

The concrete powers of the Rings of Power are terribly under-specified, but it seems likely that Narya at least helped him to wield his own innate powers ("imbued with the Flame Imperishable", natch) more openly or effectively.

******** Both Gandalf and Sauron were Maiar - so this is plausible for both.

Galadriel trapped the light of a star in a vial, and had some ability with prophecy. Elrond caused the waters of his river to rise and sweep away the Nazg√ªl.

*** Orcs have been sending raiding forces. They don't live in Ithilien (partly because of faramir's raiding forces, who were also attacking a column marching into Mordor, not one staying on the road).

*** Well...orcs have been out from Mordor for years fighting Gondor and we see massive reinfocements arriving from Faramir POV. So his discussion how Sauron marched 200k orcs from the Black Gate at once is wrong.

We see orcs running non stop for days, and surviving by eating each other. So his idea that supplying them would be next to impossible is wrong. They eat humans and each other and can survive long periods without food and still be active.

His idea that without roads orcs would be ineffective is also wrong, since we see them running for days on non roads when carrying hobbits and running from Aragorn. On top of that conflict has been going for years so the roads were probably already built.

Towers being prebuilt is mostly cinematographic and not a logistical issue.

An idea that Sauron wants to shut down Gondor as "administrative center" is laughable. He is afraid of ring bearers and one ring. That's the only reason he is attacking Gondor en masse. He does not give a crap about regular humans at all. He wants to draw out heroes before they are ready.

To be fair, those are Uruks. Taller, stronger, and more resistant to sunlight. Regular Mordor Orcs supposedly are individually weaker than that.

Books/lore say there's a part of Mordor that is actually farmland. It's not all just a fuming toxic wasteland. I think you also get to see it in the Shadow of Mordor game, the second part of it, if I don't remember wrong. Orcs are basically just selectively bred elves, they may be ugly, stupid and angry as fuck but they still need to eat.
