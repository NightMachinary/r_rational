I'm writing a time travel fic whose cast includes an older Harry Potter and a Tom Riddle who hasn't killed Myrtle yet.

Harry has shared his pensieve memories of Tom Riddle in an attempt to show Tom that his current plans aren't going to work. Besides the fact that some teenage kids were able to find and dispose of his horcruxes, it seems that producing too many horcruxes can make you prone to poor decision-making.

But none of that matters unless Harry can provide a better alternative. So Harry proposes a vow with the following points:

- Tom Riddle cannot kill anyone without Harry's approval.

  - In fact, Tom Riddle cannot take any actions at all with the intention of causing a person's death. He can't cast the curse himself, he can't tell someone else to do it, he can't even try to talk someone into suicide.
  - Harry has to set "help Tom find a means to immortality which doesn't involve killing people" as his number one priority.
  - If Harry has reason to think that his death is imminent, then he has to give permission to Tom to kill him. With this clause, Tom gets at least one horcrux, so he's no worse off than if he didn't take the Vow (again, the pensieve memories suggest that multiple horcruxes may not be worth what they cost)

For this story, I'm assuming that Tom's desire to live forever is greater than his desire to kill people as he pleases. Still, what loopholes or other problems do you see, which Tom might exploit?

*** Hm. That's possible.

I'll have to sneak back into Harry's head and see if that's a thing that he would do.

Right now he's pretty stringently against letting anybody die for any reason at all (which is why he took the risk of making this offer, because he doesn't want to kill /anyone/) but it's plausible that he might see one of the above as being okay. I'll have to think about it.

***** Ahaha.

Yeah.

Even better: Somebody from downstream (Lysander Scamander) told him that in the mid-21st century, the Statute comes crashing down. There's a bad, /bad/ war.

Right now, everyone's in 1904. Lysander's idea, having /lived through the war/, is to break the Statute /now/ because he thinks that both that and the war are inevitable, so let's have it happen when the muggles don't have nukes and even worse things, and magic is also a /little/ less fantastically dangerous (a few less spells, &c).

Harry, on the other hand, wants to try to find some way to just protect the Statute forever. "Let's just, like, not make the mistakes that were made in the original timeline, right?"

Harry is just too tired of people dying. He's going to have to learn, though, that sometimes the best you can do is minimize the death toll.

******** I found a loophole.

Is Harry actually strong enough to overpower this Tom Riddle? An actually sane one? Because if he isn't, Tom's response is /Avada Kedavra/. Or perhaps just Stupify, followed by mindrape to get all the future information out, followed by /Avada Kedavra/.

Because really, as stated, he has pretty much all of the information a Canon Harry is useful for. Canon Harry is an idiot who only wins because of plot, and because Voldemort was insane.

Also, the defining factor is that Tom cannot take an act with the /intention/ to cause a death. That's an easy one to get around. His actions are intended to create a Horcrux, not to cause a death. The Death is incidental, but not the intention of the action.

If that doesn't work, /Confund/ yourself first so that you are literally incapable of intending to cause death.

3 is useless as well for Tom, since it only works in situations where Harry does not die instantly or otherwise too fast to cancel the vow.

2 is useless because aside from future knowledge (which can be gotten through Legilimency) Harry is not any help on that score.

Tom Riddle would not take this deal without some actual benefit. Unless he is being forced to at wandpoint, with death being the other choice.

And if Harry /could/ kill him, he probably /should/ anyway regardless. The chance of semi-redeeming Riddle is not worth the risk of all of the deaths he causes. This is Killing Hitler Time Travel issue.

** I really don't see what incentive Tom has to accept this vow. Harry already gave him all relevant knowledge of the future, and he can adjust his plans accordingly. Harry's own memories show that he is a terrible student, so his help isn't worth enough to throw away entire promising fields of research.

If Harry is hiding more future knowledge as a bargaining chip, no worries, that's what Legilimency is for. If Tom isn't a Legilimens yet, a surprise /expelliarmus/ and silencing charm will make it easy to have the basilisk petrify Harry until Tom learns.

He can always accept the vow later, if it turns out to be a good idea. But I can't think of why it would.

(Too bad Hermione's not here. Though, Hermione may not have gone with this plan in the first place, so...)

At this point, Tom knows very little about Harry's qualifications except that Harry was an accomplished auror before this time kerfuffle, and that Harry killed Tom's future self /as a teenager/.

That said, this is not Harry's first questionable decision. I'm pretty "let's not kill people, especially just for things they /might/ do" myself, but even so I'd have a hard time justifying what Harry's done.

And Harry isn't going to tell the world at large, because the one thing that everyone has managed to agree on is that they need to hold the cards close to their collective chest until they figure out how this time junk happened in the first place.

Of course, you probably wouldn't want a society of immortals who are all willing to torture people for immortality even if they hadn't actually tortured anyone. So it might be good for Tom, but Harry wouldn't like it.

It'd be fun if Tom came up with that line of research and Harry only found out about it somewhere down the line.

Unless I'm missing something, this is not true. In a world with insta-death spells like Avada Kedavra, it's very easy to go from thinking that you're perfectly healthy and then dying, which means that Tom cannot make a Horcrux. Tom is then left unable to kill anyone, a severe limitation on his abilities, and lacks Harry's help finding immortality.

Tom being unable to kill doesn't even just prevent him doing evil, it also limits his ability to effectively defend himself. And, depending on how the vow is interpreted, it may prevent him doing things like take a position of power or of responsibility in a hospital, where you are required to make decisions which will lead to deaths in order to reduce total deaths.

Besides, Harry clearly doesn't intend to die for a while. What if Tom is killed in the meantime? Securing his immortality seems an important priority, and waiting for Harry to near death is a massive risk. Alternately, Tom's Horcrux may be destroyed and he'll need a replacement.

Is Tom being given an incentive to make this vow beyond Harry's help? Because this seems a massive curtailing of his abilities for little benefit otherwise

Harry has not spelled this all out, but both of them know it already. Tom should probably take that under consideration as well.

I wonder how the conversation might go if Tom tried to argue some of those points.

Trying to confront him, otoh, is far riskier: he's about a century into Harry's future, so he's not only had a very long time to learn things, but has been able to learn spells that hadn't even been conceived of in Tom's era.

I don't think Harry's realized what Lysander represents, but Tom's a little more paranoid (it helps, too, that Harry knew Lysander's mother, Luna, and it's easy to forget how little that might mean)

"If Harry fails to make Tom immortal by (arbitrary time-limit), or by the time they mutually estimate a greater than 1/3 probability that Harry will die soon then Tom gets to use him to make a horcrux."

Otherwise the chance of Harry dying unexpectedly without a chance for horcruxing is too great for this to be in Tom's interests.

*** Harry is not yet the old and wise lorekeeper. That'd be Lysander Scamander, from further down the timeline, who may also frown on what Harry's done here.

Perhaps instead of the mutual estimate, Tom simply has full permission to kill Harry whenever he thinks that it's necessary, unless he has acquired some other means of immortality. It's a little more weighted in Tom's favor, but there's still an incentive to not kill Harry until it's absolutely necessary.

Otherwise (as Tom would reason it out), you run the risk of the two of them being in a situation where they can't communicate.

** I don't know if you're looking for canon-thumpy comments, but I don't think that Item 3 would actually work.

What evidence we have on the subject (elaboration available upon request), as well as thematic consistency, suggests that it's not the /act of killing/ that allows the horcrux to be created but the /magnitude of evil/ that a murder is: evil acts damage the soul, and murder most foul is the only act evil enough to tear it so that a piece can be bound to an object. The upshot of this is would be that if the act of killing is not sufficiently evil (e.g., self-defense, mercy killing, accident), then the horcrux wouldn't take.

This means that if Harry consents to be killed and will die soon anyway, is that evil enough to count? Considering that that's almost exactly what Snape did to Dumbledore, I don't think so.

Harry messed up by already admitting that he outright doesn't want to kill Tom and that it would be difficult for him to do so. It would have been much better for him to play at having a different reason, and then threaten to kill Tom if no Vow were made.
