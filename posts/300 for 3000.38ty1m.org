** I guess you can use the money to promote the sub so it'll get even more subscribers, but I am not sure how productive that'll be.

Personalty, if I were you I'd probably come up with a premise and run a competition on who can write the best story from it, as it'll both encourage rationalist writers, and the community would get a nice story or two to read.

Edit:Possible premise that might also promote the sub some if the winner ends up really good - a story that involves [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is some way.

***** I would run it like a bunch of the other contests in and around reddit. [[/r/fantasywriters]] has [[http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/38f312/congratulations_to_utheclumsyninja_winner_of_the/][one they do every month]], which is well-run. [[/r/worldbuilding]] used to have one, but I think the weekly one has fallen by the wayside. If you run it on reddit, I would suggest the following:

1. Have a "this is what to write" thread, followed by a "submission" thread some time later (two weeks is my recommendation). I would recommend a loose prompt and some sort of guideline about length; you don't want minimum effort posts. If your "length" guideline is long enough, entrants can link to Google Docs.
2. Get a mod to put the thread into contest mode if you want to determine a winner by upvotes ([[/r/worldbuilding]] used to have two prizes: one given based on "best" sorting at the end of the contest period, and one given based on judge's choice).

I would keep the prizes fairly small; the prize is there mostly to incentivize people and increase participation, and it doesn't need to be that large in order to do that. Most reddit competitions only have special flair, community recognition, and on occasion reddit gold, and that seems like enough for most people. At a certain price point you're not actually adding that much to participation/quality because of diminishing returns.

If this sounds like work, it is, but you can probably find someone to run things for you. (I did a small challenge [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/353kr3/challengeprompt_you_find_an_oracle_that_will/][last month]] that I consider moderately successful, and was sort of thinking about how to do this as a more structured thing; that takes away from my writing time though, and to do it like I want would almost require mod powers (for flair, contest mode, and stickied posts).)

** Well, I'll be starting a Kickstarter soon....

In seriousness, I think the "give it as prize money in a story contest" is the best plan. A couple refinements I would add:

- It should be used to incentivize new authors. Myself, alexanderwales, DaystarEld, and all the other regular posters should be disqualified.
- Have multiple prizes; don't make it winner take all or trying becomes less appealing.
- The stories should be submitted anonymously so prior rep doesn't factor in.

Not sure I agree -- just flip through the top 4 or 5 pages of the sub and ask anyone with more than 3 entries to contribute if they want but please be okay with not being eligible for a prize.

If that still seems too harsh, then at least have a separate prize category for first time authors.

You say that, but you recommended excluding DaystarEld, who has many submissions but (as far as I can tell) the relevant ones are different chapters of the same work. Should we really exclude someone (and as a prime example at that) because they have written one well-accepted work here?

Furthermore, looking at the submissions would tell you very little in most cases, as the majority of users are submitting links to others' stuff in here.

*Edit:* Please, [[/u/alexanderwales]] and [[/u/DaystarEld]] if this happens, don't be discouraged to post. I /want/ to see your submissions as well as the others'.

Please note: I'm currently earning my /living/ with my writing, and I'm suggesting I should be out of the running for a monetary prize. I and the other experienced authors are going to keep writing regardless of whether we win a prize; we've already demonstrated that we have the bug.

The question here is whether your focus is long-term or short-term. Personally, my goal is long-term; I want to incentivize more new authors to start writing so that the community will have a larger pool of people producing for us. People who have been hesitating to post their story are more likely to do so if there's a prize, and even more likely if they know they aren't competing against more experienced authors. Authors who write a well-received story -- prizewinning or not -- are likely to get the bug and keep writing, making things better for the community as a whole.

All that said, we can resolve the entire problem by just doing what I said above: have a separate category for newbies. That gets everyone what they want.

This is a big thing right here. As it stands, if the Regulars are allowed to submit then I can guarantee you that they're going to win. That won't keep me from submitting, mind you, but I'm not going to have any illusions about winning. And for some people, being able to believe that there's a chance is necessary to give the motivation to submit.

The most likely scenario for me is that I would participate and then disqualify myself as a winner (depending on what the rules were and whether I thought I could do the challenge justice). I mostly agree that the purpose of a competition is participation and variety, which you're less likely to get if amateurs think that they're competing against professionals (leaving aside that calling myself a professional is woefully egotistical). If someone wanted me to write a story, they could commission one.

******* Agreed. [[/u/eaglejarl]] has the right idea in wanting to encourage newer writers: anonymized submissions as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] suggested should be done regardless, but I'm probably going to take myself out of the running either way unless the prompt lights a fire in my head, both a) to give others a better chance at getting recognized and b) because it would cut into time spent writing other stuff.

I've had people ask me to start a Patreon or work from commissions, and while that's something I'm considering, I'd rather the funds from subreddit-wide contests like this encourage others to try their hand.

The thing is, the winner should not be identified with upvotes. The votes for story should be comments, and only commenters who left at least one comment in this sub before should be counted, to protect us from second accounts.

Perhaps have several prizes, to incentise lots of submissions.

For the best new author also promise five- ten dollars per reasonable length submission for 5 submissions for continuing their story.

This encourages lots of one offs, is fun, cost effective, and encourages long running stories for us.

*** That would certainly reward people who are already contributing, but I see no reason why it should increase growth, except possibly if it generates publicity as "that one sub that retroactively rewards you," or if people post more in the hopes of being rewarded if someone else does retroactive rewards again later.

I think in the post you linked to, it's talking more about solving real-world problems, which usually takes money. Here we're talking about drawing people in and increasing visibility. You can pay for visibility, as has been suggested with paying for Reddit ads. People are drawn in / write stories generally not for monetary rewards (we haven't got enough money to reward everyone enough to make it worthwhile), but instead because they are interested and find it fun. So what we want to do is not to fund established authors, but find the people who have never heard of this sub but would find it interesting if they knew about it, and give them a little extra push to come over. Another secondary goal I see discussed here in this thread is to convince the current people here who for whatever reason do not participate much to participate more.

** IF there is interest in making this a little more complex:

Can we think of a way to use this to encourage writers, encourage rational writing, AND to make this subreddit a bit better known?

Maybe arrange some sort of alternate use of Kickstarter?

Here's what I'm thinking:

1) Accept some entries. 2) The person who came up with the idea chooses five (or whatever.) 3) For FINAL judging, Kickstarter the contest by entering each individual story as a Kickstarter entry. (If Kickstarter requires a prize, offer a copy of the story in E-mail from the author or something.) 4) The funds raised from the Kickstarter all go to charity. 5) Whichever story garners the greatest total for charity wins.

The prize money goes to writers, but the voting is done with money donated to a charity.

If there's a better site for this sort of thing than Kickstarter, then sure, use that.
