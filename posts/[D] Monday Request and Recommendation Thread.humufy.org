** Based on a recommendation few weeks ago, I read /The Phoenix Project/. It's a book about IT practices and how they should integrate with the rest of an organization. The book is written in the context of a failing company that is basically falling apart and the new IT manager has to keep things together. Overall, I think I have to give it an 8/10 recommendation

Things I liked:

- The problems faced by the company, for the most part, seemed realistic. The sense of panic was real because the authors obviously faced many of these issues in their own careers, and were able to depict that despair on paper. It made the book feel a lot more grounded than a lot of other business books tend to be.
- The book describes a pretty good list of what IT should focus on in order to be effective. In particular, it's focus on constraints was particularly good
- The focus on IT being essential for an organization to enact its goals was good. It's an effective argument to convince higher ups to care about IT and make sure that it is present for important decisions
- I found their ideas on the role of security to be interesting. They make the point that security should be considered in the context of the things an organization does, and in context of the companies values and that security shouldn't be applied as a never-ending sequence of patches. Ultimately, I don't know enough about security to analyze this part of their argument, but I thought it was an interesting argument nonetheless.

Things I thought could be improved upon:

- The only big critique of this book that I have is that it treats values as something that an organization has by default. The book doesn't really consider the possibility that the organization might not know what its own values are, or that certain people in an organization might lie unashamedly about what their values are. For example, my university has been trying, for several years, to figure out what its name change policies should be its systems and how it should change the system to implement those policies. The problem is that several people at the university don't want it to happen and have been stonewalling despite their claims of inclusivity. In this case, IT has gotten caught in between the fight of other people, and it's not really clear what IT should do in this scenario, or even if it should. This isn't the biggest of critiques, but I think that someone who is in IT should keep this in mind when they read this book.

Putting aside the moral element, why is the solution not to go ahead with it on the grounds that everyone is /claiming/ that's what they want? For the purposes of staying out of office politics, isn't the fig leaf of "we just believe them when they say this" enough?

**** There's a few factors at play. I'll do my best to list them out, but I'm not sure I'll be 100% accurate about them.

To start with, this decision is about preferred names changes, not when a person gets their name legally changed. As far as I know, there are already policies for when a person gets their name legally changed, and there aren't any major problems with it.

Another thing to keep in mind is that, at least at my university, this policy is about trans people, since they're the ones most affected. Most trans people transition socially before they get a legal name change for several different reasons. Partially because getting your name legally changed can be a fucking hassle, depending on the state. There are other groups that would be positively impacted by this decision like: (1) International students who use a different name in the US because their names don't spell or pronounce easily in English, and (2) people who go by a nickname on a day to day basis. However, the group that has spearheaded this initiative the most are trans people since they have the most to lose on a day to day basis if this policy is not implemented.

And then there's the way the systems are arranged. Sadly, I lack some details here, but I'll do my best. As far as I know, the university has one central database where they store most of the student's information. The name listed in this database needs to be the legal version and they don't have a way to put a person's preferred name there. Add to that the fact that different systems the university uses will draw and supplement that information with their own. For example, the Counseling and Testing center draws on the database for some basic information and then they add on stuff of their own. Some of these subsystems allow for name changes. For example, students can new email accounts and ID cards with their names on them. The issue is that these changes are not synchronized with the other subsystems and the central database. One of the key areas this is a problem is with our classroom management tool Blackboard. It draws names directly from the central database and is often a required tool for class. Some classes will require to make a discussion post, and this post will be tagged with your name. This creates the situation where either (1) the person never tells anyone their preferred name or (2) leaves other students wondering why their preferred and legal names are different. Situation (2) often results in students being outed which, while not only deeply uncomfortable, creates a safety risk since any random bigot in the class could not choose to target them. This problem could also happen elsewhere if the subsystems don't talk to each other; I wouldn't know since my preferred name is my legal name.

And so we have a situation here where the primary beneficiaries are ones whose existence is controversial, whose experiences are ones that are usually not readily understood by the administrators, a complicated system for storing information, and legal requirements that the university has to satisfy. This has led to a stalemate where administrators have said that diversity is a priority, and yet they haven't taken enough steps yet. A few years ago the student body decided that they wanted this policy in place. At the time, the university said that it was a priority for them. And yet, for some reason, last year they went back to square one and decided that they needed to debate if preferred name policies are something that need to exist at all.

To clarify, I don't want to say that the actions of the people at my university are necessarily malicious. At least so far, we've had innocuous reasons for them dragging their feet. For example, when the student card issuing office decided to make a policy to let students put their preferred names on their IDs, the legal department objected claiming that they didn't want to print IDs that could be interpreted as legal identification but had a name that was not the student's legal one. Which is a little confusing because (1) Nobody ever assumed student IDs were legal documents, (2) this process had gone on for a while with no problems before legal complained about it. Am I to assume someone in legal did so with bad intentions? Probably not. But it's hard not to be paranoid nonetheless.

In the end, my guess as to why the university is dragging it's heels about preferred names is that it's a combination of several motivations: (1) It's hard and I don't want to do the work; (2) It's expensive and I don't want to spend the money; (3) It could be a legal problem and I don't want to handle it; (4) I don't understand the problem; and (5) trans people are icky. The thing that sucks is that the people in the university who are responsible for this issue haven't been completely honest about why they've been dragging their heels.

***** My expectation would be that conditional on having a legitimate reason for the policy, discussing that reason would be potentially penalized with social or legal consequences. I think it's rare for issues like this to be settled by honest discussion mainly because honest discussion is heavily disincentivized.

**** To put it another way from what AcceptableBook said, it's very easy to stonewall something while /saying/ you want it to go ahead. "Oh, before we implement this, we need to figure out XYZ." "Well, I definitely think this is a priority, but I need to talk to Mike from Accounting and Jane from Legal and Jack from HR, to make sure this is feasible." "I'm glad we cleared those roadblocks, but someone raised a concern about XYZ. We'll need to get that sorted before we can proceed."

Each objection is fine on it's own; it's only in aggregate that you can see that they're (maybe) stonewalling you.

*** RE: Security

I often tell managers -- "Security is a cost you impose on yourself to impose a (hopefully) much bigger cost on your enemies." Relentlessly pound the word *cost*. And make sure that you put time -- "OK, doing X security feature will mean each developer does one less hour of work a week. Are you OK with that?"

Security is (often) necessary, but a) its not a panacea and b) its not free.

** English translations of [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/lord-of-the-mysteries_11022733006234505][/Lord of the Mysteries/]] have just begun on the final volume of this excellent rational-adjacent work. It has also been reviewed [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fyo4sf/review_lord_of_the_mysteries_a_chinese_online/][here]] by fellow [[/r/rational]] posters.

Chapters after the paywall are available [[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/2759458.html][here]].

The premise of the series is about a regular person being transmigrated into the body of a suicide victim living in alternate Victorian England with Cthulhu mythos, SCP-like superpowers derived from supernatural creatures and Hermetic rituals. There's strange anachronistic technology and common phrases from Earth in the new world due to a previous transmigrator hundreds of years ago who shamelessly plagiarised everything. There's also plenty of cultural references in the plot to Bloodborne, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sherlock Holmes and The Count of Monte Cristo etc. but they're done with style.

The most stand-out quality of the work is the excellent research and effort by the author in setting up the background and worldbuilding. I've found no obvious plot holes and no inconsistencies in the setting after multiple readings. There's foreshadowing in Chapter 1 that is only fully revealed 1000s of chapters later. All the "mysteries" clicks into place at the end of each volume, especially the ending of Volume 1 which I highly recommend personally experiencing. It's where I became from being interested to totally hooked.

Please note: the plot starts off slow before Klein becomes a Nighthawk and the translator's choice of words from Chinese->English are somewhat inelegant. I hope the excellent plot, characterisation and background by the writer shines through to keep you engaged, though.

**** I don't agree at all that it is disappointing, even if it is short. The author said in his notes that he refused to sacrifice the intelligence of his antagonists, meaning they wouldn't conveniently wait for the MC to complete all his preparations before attacking. So once the end game begun and the first domino fell, it finished quickly with minimal padding. To me, it addressed all the major mysteries remaining in the plot that is not obviously setting up for the sequel, so it is not extremely rushed. I can elaborate further on this if you want.

The final arc to me is the culmination of the MC's subtle character development as well as the central theme of the webnovel. Spoilers: Klein's personality revolves around paranoid levels of preparation and careful “cowardice” but also death-seeking recklessness when it comes down to the wire, which is once again on display here. His recklessness is so extreme it stands him apart from the other powerhouses of his pathway group (Kotar, Zaratul, Botis, Zoroast, Amon), who are all similarly paranoid “cowards” but nowhere near as Foolish. The Fool tarot card shows the character running headlong towards the edge of a cliff while a dog barks at him, and this is basically what Klein is.

The bittersweet theme of humanity's (Klein) triumph over the supernatural (Amon) by valuing some things more important than their own continued existence is a fitting conclusion to everything that happened in eight volumes of plot, from humanity testing random potion ingredients on themselves before the perfection of proper formulas and rituals risking madness and death, to Captain sacrificing himself for everyone else in Tingen, to a mortal mother's concern for her daughters over her own life. Klein defeats Amon despite Amon's thousands of years of experience as an almost unkillable Angel is due to the fact Klein is willing to bet his own life to see his life goals fulfilled, and Amon's only goal is the preservation of his own life.

It is a good ending, and although in the back of my mind I wanted the novel to last longer I also understood why it ended there.

** After reading the linked here 'I became a [Biologist] in a fantasy world!', I became fascinated by the unapologetically high bar for knowledge within the field required to really follow the nature of the world and story. Does anyone know of any other stories where external knowledge is written into the fabric of the text? I don't just mean bringing in real world philosophies or aesthetics, I mean actual proper knowledge of the sorts of problems that people in the real world spend large amounts of time trying to understand. Not that I'm against explanations, but I'm interested to see what people can do when they don't spend time explaining things.

I guess I'd only really consider myself capable of reading them within the fields of math and biology, so I'd be more appreciative of those, but I'd be interested to see if anyone has any examples in other fields to.

My spending on books was easily 10x what it had been previously (from an admittedly very low level). Then, when they started increasing the amount of self-published stuff, their recommendations went to crap. I don't trust anything they recommend anymore and as a result, I buy far far fewer books than I used to (pretty much sticking to only authors I already know and like, I don't buy anything new on Kindle unless I have some other, non-kindle recommendation that I trust).

*** /Hikaru no Go/. Protagonist stumbles on the ghost which haunted (according to the story) the famous player Shusaku, Fujiwara-no-Sai, whose only desire is to keep playing Go until he perfects the Hand of God. Great characters, addictive, inspiring sports-ish manga, with the Death Note artist (different writer). A great tragedy in a way.

/Astro Boy/. After the death of his son, Dr. Tenma builds a robot child to replace him...Tezuka is a perceptive writer, and this turned out to be more interesting and intelligent than I thought it would be.

/Parasyte/. Chilling classic. Brain invading organisms take over humans and feed on humans. One of them fails and ends up attached to the protagonist's arm. The dynamic of the compassionate protagonist and the cold-blooded survivalist parasite works pretty well.

/Toward the Terra/. Jomy is living in a dystopia he didn't realize he was in and escapes brainwashing with the help of the Mu Soldier Blue, only to discover that he himself is such a telepathic Mu. Meanwhile, the AI running said dystopia has selected the man for the job of wiping them out. Fairly complex characterization of the villain is probably the high-point of the series. Also Blue is awesome. Shoujo-styled art is another plus.

/Area 88/. Mercenary pilot story. A mature exploration of war and killing, though a bit soppy at times.

/Berserk/. Dark fantasy, brutal, but also deeply touching. Deals mainly (I think) in themes of trauma and wished-for reconciliation that may never come. Fair warning, the first few chapters are not so fun, and it gets exceedingly dull (in my opinion) after the brilliant Golden Age arc. However said arc is possibly the best thing that ever came out of manga.

I highly recommend the /Yu-Gi-Oh/ manga if you've never had any exposure to the series or if you've only seen the altered english anime.

*** Beck is phenomenal if you love music and the experience of going to a show. It's got so many references, both hidden and overt, to rock and pop music from the 60s to early 2000s. It's about a kid who finds out he can sing and joins a band and all the struggles along the way. Great fun.

Monster is a slow burn thriller about a Japanese neurosurgeon in Germany that slowly becomes ensnared in a plot to catch a serial killer former patient of his. The art is so good and Naoki Urasaws is probably my favorite mangaka of all time. In that same way, 20th Century Boys and Pluto are so unbelievably top-notch.

Holyland is a coming of age story where a milquetoast teenager escapes into the world of street fighting. There's no shonen action sequences here, it's a brawl through and through. I haven't read it in years so I can't presently vouch for it, but I remember enjoying the portrayal of depression.

*** The Tawny Man trilogy by Robin Hobb, which is a followup to the Farseer triloy, has a relatively major theme of the main character being older and grappling with the various life changes that entails (among many other things, it's not /the/ main thing, but it's definitely prominent).

I can't give a full throated endorsement since the series definitely has some issues (it's not bad, just far from perfect), but it's the thing I've read that comes the closest to what you are looking for. I originally read the Tawny Man trilogy without having read any of the other books in the series or in the universe, so it can be done, but there is a lot of background that will make more sense if you read them in order. Which will also give you images of the main characters at different points/ages in their lives since all three are separated by somewhat large time gaps.

**** Reading Tawny Man first is definitely not optimal, in my opinion. The best way to read the trilogies is to read the first one, then either read the side stories in release order or wait at least a year to read Tawny Man, to get that feeling of the passage of time that makes the books what they are.

But really, the whole thing is a major time and emotional investment, and I can't promise that it's worth it. It's definitely not a perfect series of books. The real draw is the introspection that makes emotional ties to the characters very easy to form.

*** Otomeisekai, the genre, is basically full of the manga/manwha equivalent of harlequin romance novels. You're not going to find the next great work of fiction among its titles. It's trope-y bodice-ripping female wish-fulfillment. That's pretty much the entire genre.

What do you consider "actually good" within the genre? What series have you read that you like? that you disliked? And what did you like/dislike about them? Are there tropes you enjoy or tropes you hate?

Being the creator of the sub, I've read the vast majority of titles that are listed in our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/wiki/series][wiki]], so I might be able to suggest something if I know what you consider "low quality" versus "high quality" while keeping in mind you're standing in front of the harlequin romance section at the bookstore wondering why you can't seem to find quality literature (aka temper your expectations a bit).

**** I'm not the person you're responding to, but I would be interested in recommendations that fit the description of the focus of this subreddit, what people call "Rational Fiction".

From the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  - Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  - Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  - Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  - Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  - Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  Presence of these particular features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  Adjacent tropes: Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence doesn't make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

  - Fair-Play Whodunnit: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

  - Absence of Deus Ex Machina: established story rules are never broken.

  - Deconstruction: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

  - Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

Edison Rex is fairly Lex Luthor like figure and his success in killing his hated foe leaves him with no one to blame and the realisation that someone will need to do his job, with that in mind he decides to be a hero, the rest of the comic is about him realising that there's more to becoming a hero than a single decision and becoming more honest with himself about his own actions. It's been on hiatus for a while and shows no signs of changing but it completed the main charicter arc so that's okish. Possibly not rational overall, considering it's a marvel/dc parodyverse there's only so much a good author can do.

The main charicter is not rational but prides himself on his rationality and I think a quality exploration of this is something that fits will on this sub.

Hi I'm looking for "realistic" Pokemon content with a focus on finding and catching rare Pokemon as well as training and evolving them. I love the world of Pokemon Origin of Species but would be more interested in finding/capturing/training Pokemon. Much of the content in that series is focused on teaching rational ideas or delving into Red's Physic powers, which, while I enjoy, takes away from the story/progression of the Pokemon. I enjoyed "Game of Champions." I couldn't get too far into "The Sun Soul" as it seemed less thought out/structured and the characters completely unbelievable in their response to the major event that happens at the beginning.

Dresden Files is quite good, just skip the first two in the series and start with the third, you can come back to them once you're hooked. People pretty universally agree the series starts properly around book 3.5. Urban fantasy but kind of a standout.

For something short and fun, try the first five Amber books by Roger Zelazny. (You might enjoy books 6-10 but they're pretty much gary stu fanfiction written by the author.) The rare amnesia plot done well, and the conceit is just cool.

***** Brandon Sanderson's cosmere works are enormous, currently just over 3M words total with another 500k inbound by the end of the year. Both finished and regularly updated, in that he has a few self-contained stories completed (Mistborn Era 1, Elantris, Warbreaker, various novellas), a few others in progress (Mistborn Era 2, Stormlight first half), and many more to come (Mistborn 3 and 4, Elantris continuation, Stormlight second half, Dragonsteel).

Stormlight is the "capstone" epic fantasy series, on the scale of LOTR or Wheel of Time. Mistborn comes in shorter books & arcs, and is my personal favorite; it also has the amazing quality of shifting genres between arcs--the first era is your standard medieval fantasy; the second is steampunk-Western; the third will supposedly be cyberpunk.

*** If you're looking for 'uplifting' urban fantasy, there's two books by C. Chancy that were quite enjoyable. Book one is 'A Net of Dawn and Bones' and book two is 'Seeds of Blood'.

To quote the author regarding book one: This book was written because I couldn't find anything like it on the shelves. ...No, seriously. After the umpteenth time picking up yet another urban fantasy that looked promising but on closer skimming had the Designated Protagonist choosing the Sexier Evil, I kind of snapped. Part of the fun of any story is putting yourself in the character's shoes. But these shoes I not only didn't want to slip into, I wanted to set them on fire. Where were the good guys? The honest cops? The ordinary people choosing to do the Right Thing, no matter how hard it was? Where was the belief that there is a Right Thing; that there is Good, and Evil, and you pick the side you're going to fight for, even if the heavens fall? In short - where were the heroes? I assure you, if I were in on ground zero of a vampire versus werewolf blood war, my thoughts would not be centered on, omigod the two main supernatural guys are so darkly yummy in their hellspawn black leather. They would be, stake, silver - where are they and how fast can I reload? So here they are: an honest cop, a half-demon, and an ancient heretic who just might be a saint. Out to kick butt, save lives, and hopefully save souls. Welcome to Intrepid, North Carolina. I'm hoping to stay awhile.

*** Sunshine by Robin Mckinley is a likely candidate for the origin of the whole genre, and is also better than basically.. all of it.

For atypical examples of the genre, look to Stross, and this pretty interesting collaboration set during the inter-war period [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0749S93V5?ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt]]

**** Urban Fantasy predates Sunshine (it's from 2003!), but I agree that it's basically better than all the other candidates. I've been looking for a book in the genre that matches it since I destroyed my second copy in the bath.

*** I would strongly recommended Max Gladstone's /Craft Sequence/ here. It's not just urban fantasy, but a very thoughtful take on urbanism and modernity through the lense of fantasy.

It's a setting where magic has been systematized in a way that much resembles modern corporations and finance, examining how such vast and complicated systems can run into the human element. The first book is about two teams of necromancer-lawyers competing over who gets to resurrect a dead God, with a murder mystery about how and why he died in the first place. They're all pretty good and strongly recommended.

Yeah I have read the first one. Did not like it because Gods were too fragile. Too dependent on bureaucracy and followers. It is not fun toppling and beating something so weak.

***** Might be worth continuing onwards. Each book is semi-independant, so that particular issue doesn't necessarily factor in the following books.

As for the gods, it's not that they're fragile, per se, but that it's a not so subtle allegory for leveraged debt. It's not that gods /have/ to put themselves at risk, but it's so very tempting because the benefits can be considerable when things are going well. Considerable enough that they risk being outcompeted it they don't partake (the gods having been soundly defeated by modern practicioners a generation or so previously). A real life example might be something like Toys R Us, who went bankrupt in large part because they were restructured with a lot of debt during a takeover.

But again, if that's not your thing it doesn't really factor so much in the later books I've read.

*** You've probably heard of Dresden Files in that genre, but I think Alex Verus is a better read than Dresden. Alex is sort of similar to Dresden except without the annoying backwards view of women. The world itself is darker. Alex's power is to see the possibilities in the very short term future, which makes for really interesting fights. The series really picks up after the first couple of books, and delves deep into politics and personal power later on.

**** I have very much the opposite take. I feel like I lost a bit of interest each Verus book, and put it down after either book 7 or 8. Dresden Files generally gets better and better as it goes on, with minor hiccups. I will agree that Dresden is more of a chauvinist than is oftentimes comfortable.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30483/polyrhythm-time----a-bards-tail][Polyrhythm Time -- A Bard's Tail]] is an interesting deconstruction of competence porn. (Despite the word tail in the title, it's not a furry fetish type story. He has a tail, but it's utilitarian.) The MC makes wildly suboptimal choices for surviving in another world because he's obsessed with drumming, but makes up for it by having a better than normal capacity for practice. This reminded me of a nonfiction book [[https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS][Peak]] I had recently read (and highly recommend), which is about how expertise forms.
