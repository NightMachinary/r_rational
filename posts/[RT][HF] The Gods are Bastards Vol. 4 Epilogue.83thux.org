** I feel like this quote from the Vol 4 epilogue is of interest to this sub, (from one of the players monologuing to a minion):

“In the bardic epics, fairy tales, even the modern chapbooks and comics, enemies never talk to each other---at least, not openly. And now I find myself greatly threatened because so many of my opponents have simply had conversations, like adults. Foolish of me, unforgivably foolish.”

*** While the story does enjoy subverting some standard narrative tropes I found this quote a) too on the nose and b) not consistent behaviour with the character quoted who is a ‘behind the scenes master planner/schemer' who has somehow elevated himself to a position of great power without realising that people in his world do not function like narrative cliches.

It feels like, in order to highlight how most characters in the story are not holding the idiot ball that the author has a character act as if people /do/ hold the idiot ball, then be surprised when they in fact do not, which really is just its own form of the idiot ball.

#+end_quote

I can hazard some guesses. FWIW I'm a big fan of the series, but I also know that some parts of it rub people the wrong way.

- The plot isn't purely rational. In fact, the biggest complaint I've heard about the story is that every character has plot armor. It's like the anti-Game of Thrones... if you have a favorite character, odds are they'll survive no matter what. After 13 books, the number of characters who have actually died can probably be counted on one hand... and none of them were "main" characters. Heck, or even secondary characters. This was actually addressed as a plot point in a recent book, where [[#s][Spoiler]]. But the result is that the stakes never feel that high because the characters aren't in actual mortal peril. They survive purely because the plot requires it.

- Parallel to that last point, the cast is HUGE after 13 books and no deaths. With eight primary characters in the freshman class (plus Tellwyrn herself), that's already a big cast. Then you get Darling, his apprentices, and then his group. And then the gods. And then Justinian's villain group AND his underlings. And all of the Unseen University students and staff. And then Basra's group. And then Trissiny's spin-off group. And then all the other families/friends/various oddballs. It makes for great world-building, but it also makes the story /very/ long and somewhat rambling (DD Webb has acknowledged this in his comments, and plans to streamline his future books more). It also makes it tough to take a break and come back later, because you likely won't remember who some characters were when they were mentioned several books ago and not since.

- Outside of the non-rational plot and the length, the main complaint I've seen is about artistic choice. Namely, the author seems A) Very progressive in his social views, and B) Very much like an otaku. Neither of these bug me much; heck, I like having a diverse cast of characters and find the tension between Avenist and Shaathist philosophies super interesting; but I've read people complain that it feels like "an agenda" is being pushed at them. The otaku part is more a personal complaint from the the last few books as more of the Old Gods' pasts were revealed and Siif was brought into play. But having characters suddenly break into Japanese, or discuss how the Old Gods loved Cowboy Bebop and World of Warcraft, just kinda breaks the immersion. I like the references, but cringe a bit too.

It's still a really good series. But when I've seen it recommended here before, there are usually people who complain about the things I wrote above.

**** My single biggest problem with this story is how what we are informed of the characters by the narrative is completely at odds with how the actual characters act. That is, we are told by the story Trissiny is rash and hot-headed but good at fighting... but then she never is in the actual story.

I'm just going to quote from a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/d-d-webbs-the-gods-are-bastards.535450/][Spacebattles Thread on the story]] rather than rewriting this specific criticism's examples myself. This contains *a bunch of spoilers for the story*:

#+begin_quote
  The biggest problem with the story is that what we're told is completely at odds with what we're shown, for basically every character in every scene.

  Tellwyrn is talked up as being super powerful, unstoppable, and someone you can't reason with. Someone who might kill you as soon as look at you, and who could totally get away with it even if she did. She's a natural disaster, a Z-20, etc. etc. etc.

  But despite all that talk? She never once actually does anything meaningful to the plot with that power. She can manifestly teleport people to alternate planes of reality, orbit, or anywhere in between. Instead, she gets taunted at by the various in-story villains, and just... puts up with it. For no discernible reason.

  At one point in section 12 she even comments how she can't kill one of the villains because, oh no, she'd get in trouble with the empire. The same empire that- in previous chapters- was repeatedly said to have a policy of 'let her do anything she wants, because we can't stop her'.

  Similarly, Trissiny is supposedly an awesome warrior, champion of the goddess of war, etc. etc. and is constantly being harped at about flying off the handle and using force instead of reason. Except, she doesn't do that. She has a very real tendency to lose plot-relevant fights. She has (very nearly) never killed any sentient foes, possibly excepting the centaurs in the very first portion of the story- but that was done off-screen.

  She has caused a mook to die by being clever at them- but that was in turn, used to set up a scene where she tries it on one of the actual villains, and the trick doesn't work. In short, Trissiny is shown to be caring, second-guesses herself frequently, and is extremely loathe to engage in fights which she seldom wins if her winning those fights would inconvenience the villains of the piece.

  But despite that, everyone on the story is constantly lambasting her for being too quick to use violence and brute force. The Trissiny-centric chapter 11 is cringingly bad as far as that goes, as neither her attempts to be clever nor her attempts to fight pan out, resulting in her being shown up as entirely useless at everything forever.

  Teal is a bard. A bard that never plays music, tells stories, nor generally engages in bardic activities on screen. She did, twice, in the dungeon crawl. Doing so got her smashed with a rock, the first time. It worked the second time she did it. She's never done so again on screen. Great bard, she is. But, uh, they say she's really into that stuff, honest. She's in the music program!

  Poor Gabe Arquin's already been discussed.

  #+begin_quote
    I think the most blatant of this is probably Gabriel's characterization - the text keeps on insisting he is supposedly smart or book-smart or intelligent or something, but that characteristic is completely at odds with both his actions and words and most of the time everyone else spends time teaching him basic stuff he should probably know already, and he never seems to be the guy coming up with intelligent insights into anything important.
  #+end_quote

  His buddy Toby is just, ugh. He's one militant sonofabitch for someone who supposedly serves a god of peace. All he tends to do is just be judgemental at people. The way Trissiny is supposedly being? Toby's actually doing that, but is almost never called out on it- and when he is, he doesn't do anything different.

  Juniper, oh god. She had some character development! Juniper, supposedly the Only Sane Dryad, or anyway the only dryad that's been out in the world to learn more, to grow, to see others as people? Yeah, no. By the time we get to segment 12, there's at least five others. Considering there were supposedly like no more than double digit dryads in all of the world, in the beginning of the story? It really devalues Juniper as a character, and makes you go "but author, y u lie to us?"

  And, of course, the drow priestess darling Shaeine. I think I misspelled that. Anyway. She's talked up early on as having a really different culture. It comes up a few times, in the very early work. But then after some point it just... stops. And she's just this normal kid. She winds up being the shield bot slash heal-dispenser. For one of the supposedly smarter characters, who is more cleric than diplomat, she doesn't really seem to do much of anything related to her goddess. She explicitly calls for judgement once, because Juniper asked her to do so, and... that's it.

  Blah.

  And, of course, the constant drubbing about how brute force takes second place to cleverness. Except, brute force works pretty darn well for the guys that use it, on the rare occasions they do so, and 'cleverness' seems to be summed up by the bad guys having a copy of the script. Pretty much any time the protagonists attempt to sneak around and plan for things, it doesn't work out in their favor.

  And I guess the biggest telling-different-than-showing is, of course, the revelations previously mentioned, because dude, just... don't. Anne McCaffery you are not, and it didn't work very well for her when she did it either.

***** I can try and elaborate later if you wish, but the main thing I want to mention is that this is at least partly a coming of age/school series. What we were told about the characters at first was meant to change. Especially in the case of Trissiny and Shaeine, what you see as a mismatch between what were told of the characters and how they actually act, I see as character development.

Trissiny for example /was/ quite reckless and hot headed. From attacking Gabriel for being half demon, to attempting to stand against a hellgate alone and solo a demonic version of a dragon. Perhaps more than recklessness in combat, her largest problem has been recklessness in thought and words (remember the arc in what was essentially the drow ghetto?)

As for Tellwyrn, her careless use of power is /exactly/ what caused the whole issue with the rouge Hand that was central to this most recent book. Which she was rightfully chewed out by the Empress for. She's also done a number of really badass thing's on screen.

Shaeine /DID/ act quite alien at first, and that has fallen gradually by the wayside. However that's her entire reason to be at Last Rock. She was raised to be a diplomat and then immersed herself in another culture to learn their ways. I'd be far more concerned about the story if she was still acting alien.

Someone mentioned Ruda, but she has indeed demonstrated her leadership ability and competence multiple times. Off the top of my head the first example I can think of is her performance in Sarasio.

I could defend Toby too, he very much serves as the team mom and helps provide emotional support to his classmates. He also played a much bigger role this arc than in the past. I will, however, agree that he and Teal are the weakest of the main cast.

***** This is spot on and doesn't even mention Ruda who we're told only seems like a loud mouthed idiot on the surface except she does nothing to actually disabuse us of this notion. Perhaps that's why Frost has been my favourite of the group; she's not an especially complex character but she behaves consistently and in line with what we're told in story.

I do believe the author has the writing chops to pull off the character subversion and growth that he was attempting but he's forever adding additional extraneous characters and trying to reign in this unwieldy sprawling plot at the same time.

****** Agreed. Well, Ruda does have /some/ moments of strategy, like in that bar fight where she set it up so that no one was killed and they all ended up listening to her. But this most recent book was very much "Hot-headed Ruda rushes in and yells a lot." For a book mostly about her home, I actually ended more annoyed at her rather than less. Usually when individual characters get more attention it goes the other way!

Fross is just the best. Although I keep expecting some dark twist, where she realizes how much smarter and more powerful she is than almost everyone else, and turns out to become the next Tellwyrn or something. Then I remind myself that that's not how Webb writes characters, and I should stop looking for sinister overtones lurking everywhere, haha.

**** About the plot armor... honestly I've never felt it, because I felt like violence and possibility of death were never the concern of the story itself. In most the arcs, especially early on, the cast encounter increasingly complex problems that simply can't be solved by just bashing someone, where the main source of tension is whether they mess up the delicate political balance of myriad factions.

And well... by the standards of the world, the main cast is pretty overpowered.

Darling has [[#s][spoiler]]. Justinian apparently has [[#s][spoiler]]. And most of the other cast that we encounter are protected in some form by their own strength or the strength of the institution backing them.

Also helping the case is an antagonist who [[#s][spoiler]] .

About the agenda, well, I feel that's dependent on the reader how they want to take it. Personally, I disagree with his views, but I don't feel like his political views have seeped into the story, at least not yet (please tell me if I missed something in this regard).

***** I agree with most everything you say; I'm just pointing out that it frustrates some readers. Webb has stated that he doesn't like grimdark settings or killing off favorite characters. In many ways TGAB is like the anti-Worm. I can at least vouch that if you've read Worm and feel like you need a palate cleanser, TGAB is an /excellent/ choice to turn your mood around. And yes, the main cast is overpowered; however, they also frequently get lucky or deus ex machina'ed out of trouble. In context a lot of this makes sense; several of them have literal gods watching out for them; but as I said, it just takes a lot of the tension out of things. You /know/ they won't get too hurt or killed.

I'm not too sure of Webb's political views (besides him being anti-Trump), but I meant more of his social views. Through his characters and the way the culture and cults are discussed, he is pretty clearly pro-homosexual relationships, pro-trans people, pro-feminism, anti-patriarchy, and anti-traditionalism. I think all of that is fine, and I think he's been doing well at showing times when it's /not/ ok (Basra's "relationship" with her subordinate is obviously cast negatively, and Shaathism's positive features are praised with Brother Ingvar), but I remember early on people were asking if there were any exclusive heterosexual romances because the homosexual or polyamorous ones seemed to take center stage. It was something that never bugged me, but it seemed to irk some other people.

****** As someone who doesn't share his views, it seems to me like he is blatantly pushing his agenda. It's what drove me away about a year ago (around arc 11 or 12), but I've recently started reading again. Anyway, a couple of points to illustrate my frustrations with the way he (is he confirmed as a he?) inserts his views into his book:

- woman good, man bad: Most of the main cast is women. Now that's not inherently a problem, but it ties into the following. At first, the only male protagonists are Gabe (socially awkward nerd dude), Toby (Gay pacifist) and Darling (Chaotic neutral at best in his alignment). What I'm trying to say is that there is a distinct lack of a positive traditionally masculine character among his protagonists. Darling comes closest, but even then he's more of a behind the scenes kind of guy, a thief and morally gray at best. The Tirasian king, once you get a bit deeper into the book, is the closest to a traditionally masculine character.

- matriarchy good, patriarchy bad: the abstraction of the above. The societies in TGAB are very left-leaning as a whole, a reflection of the author's views and perhaps of the views of the people who created the world (The Elder Gods). The military cult (Avenists) is all female (and that's somehow okay) and feminist - call me sexist but that makes no sense to me, especially when considering the fact that men are more suited to combat than women.\\
  I may be particular in this regard, but it really makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief. Even so, I can accept that humans in Tiraas aren't the same as humans on Earth (really ironic when you find out Tiraas was created by a bunch of people from Earth), but it would make sense to have a male equivalent of the Avenists right? Wrong. The closest thing to that would be the cult of Shaath which is a gross caricature of traditionalists and portrayed very negatively even disregarding that.\\
  Not to mention the fact that there exists a whole species of humanoids that organizes itself in a Matriarchal order, but no real masculine equivalent - again, I find it hard to suspend my disbelief.

- demonization of male sexuality: a lot of men are grabby, rapey bastards, are described as "ugh" by the women. This is demonstrated quite literally by Jeremiah Shook and Alan Vandro, who are again, caricatures of the traditionalist view on the norms of male-female relationships. At least a female equivalent is present in Basra Syrinx, although she seems less reviled than her male counterparts. And even still, Basra seems to be lesbian and acts in a very "toxicly masculine" way towards objects of her sexual interest, so I'm not sure that she is a clear parallel to the male rapists.

******* I definitely see your points, but I'd note that most of them are countered even by your own post.

1. "Woman good, man bad" you countered by pointing out that the Emperor is a positive masculine character (as is Darling, more or less). We get plenty of other positive male characters over time too, though they aren't "main" characters. Ruda's dad, Quentin Vex, Schwartz (who is definitely more of the socially awkward nerd than Gabriel, IMO), Professors Rafe and Yornharlt, Longshot McGraw, and my personal favorite, Joseph P. Jenkins. Just because the "main" nine characters are skewed female doesn't mean that men are universally portrayed as bad or that "good" men don't exist. Plenty do.
2. "Matriarchy good, patriarchy bad" you point out is due to the world building. And even then there are obvious counters to it. We have side stories about how the matriarchy of the Drow is stifling to males born into it, for example. Shaathism is definitely shown to be bad, but also is revealed to be a corrupted version of its original cult - and characters like Brother Ingvar are shown to be positive examples in spite of the cult's issues. And a central concern running across books is how the Avenist cult structure promotes abusers like Basra. In addition, despite it being a militant order, there's a lot of discussion about how it is NOT a modern fighting force on par with other global powers; most of its reputation being based on its past victories. So again, it might be simple to declare that matriarchy is good and patriarchy is bad, but the actual details show it to be much more complex than that.
3. "Demonization of male sexuality" happens in the examples you gave, but as you point out - Basra is a counter to that. And I'd argue that she's absolutely reviled by both the characters in the story and the readers. Shook is bad too, but Vandro is shown as being more nuanced. But another counter example would be the dryads; Juniper's origin story has her raping and then cannibalizing her first human lover. And Gabe himself has to fend off advances by Vidius's cult leader, who wants him not for himself but because he's taboo - much younger, a demonblood, and the first Hand of Vidius. Like the last two points, it's easy to make blanket claims, but they are not actually accurate.

So while I do agree with the examples you've provided, I think you're disregarding counter examples. The story is so big that it has a bit of everything in it. You could argue it's not representative of our culture, and I'd agree. But even if it started as more black and white, as the story's progressed all three of those examples are increasingly grey.

******** You raise some valid points, but i think you misunderstood me on some of my reasonings. My first point us trying to illustrate that there is a big lack of positive traditionally masculine characters. Think Rambo, Conan the Barbarian etc. These are exaggerations, but i hope you're understanding my point. All the characters you listed are positively portrayed men, sure, but only Ruda's dad and maybe Vex are traditionally masculine, manly men. Not all men need to be traditionally masculine, but to have none be that way signifies an agenda to me. Joe Jenkins whole shtick is being an (autistic) femnist ally, so I wouldnt call him traditionally masculine either.

On matriarchy and world building - sure the setting is matriarchal due to worldbuilding, but the world was built by author, it's not self emergent. The setting offers as much of an insight into the auhors views as the way he writes his characters.

On Ingvar - Brother Ingvar is a TransMan, biologically female. Do you see where I'm getting at? The only positively portrayed Shaathist is one that breaks the mold - he is not traditionally masculine, because he is trans.

On the demonization of male sexuality Basra.\\
What I was trying to show, was that sure Basra is also vilified, but she is very masculine in demeanor and sexuality. She is portrayed as a sociopath, a predominantly male trait and is very masculine in her sexual pursuit of other women. As much as she is demonized, she is demonized for her masculine behavior.

EDIT: The points I didnt address, I believe are valid and I cant object to them.

**** Can you please expand on your third point, or perhaps link to some of peoples' complaints. I'm not quite sure what agenda people think is being pushed by the story. In particular, what do you mean by "very progressive"? I don't think any of the characters or factions are any where near as "progressive" as, for example, The Culture from Iain Banks' books.

It's fairly common in science fiction and fantasy to describe an alien world and explore the societal consequences of how it differs from our own, even if that isn't the main focus of the story. TGaB does this in more ways than I can easily count, but I don't think I would call it "pushing an agenda".

In my opinion, the main principle that should be respected is the self-consistency of the universe. This serves for the societal aspects of the story (is it plausible that everything functions as described, and are the changes taking place realistic consequences thereof?) as well as the backstory (is it plausible, given the rest of the story, that the elder gods were a bunch of nerds who, for example, had their guards fight mock-lightsaber battles with one another and decided to make their own elves?).

Also, apropos the plot armour, I forget the details but I believe it was heavily implied that Araneid will be fucking around with time in the future, and many of the characters will be needed to be present for some events that Araneid is manipulating.

There are certainly valid stylistic criticisms against the plot armour and very-nearly-immersion-breaking watching of star wars films in underground elder god bases, but these sorts of things do not, I think, compromise the work's self-consistency.

I disagree with his complaints, but the response was more highly rated than the original recommendation, which to me seems to imply that he's not alone in his opinions. In addition, I regularly read the comments after new chapters are released. I seem to recall some amount of criticism of some of the themes there, although I can't think of anything specific recently.

*** Been reading it since it was dropped in a monthly recommendation thread here I dunno how long ago, but it feels like years. I've puzzled over whether it belongs here as well, and I think it just comes down to it not really being a rational or rationalist story.

There's two real levels to the story, so far as I can suss out - pretty standard boilerplate, almost JRPG-like fantasy.

[[#s][Complete with]]

On the next level up, it's an attempt to treat with the fact that we, in a modern, industrial or post-industrial context are still enamored with the values and ideals of pre-Enlightenment, agricultural, feudalistic societies. It attempts to showcase how and why those values break down in the face of a modern, interconnected society.

However, it also attempts to reconstruct that society in the same breath as it deconstructs it - it offers something of an alternative set of values in the guise of Tellwyrn imparting those values to the student class - hence the complaints that an agenda is being pushed. Because it is. However, D.D. Webb's particular choice of values for an industrialized or post-industrial society aren't necessarily everyone's, which is the first hit against its ability to popular traction.

That might not alone be enough to stop it from climbing the charts - HPMOR certainly didn't shy away from pushing a transhumanist agenda as part of its presentation, but the second major hit is the pacing, and the ratio between the story acting on its first level as boilerplate fantasy vs. its second level as societal analysis.

TGaB spends so, so, so much time on the first level, filling chapter after chapter with fantasy adventure that I could find by pulling a random book of the shelf at Barnes & Noble with the author's name in big shiny letters on the cover, and spends less than 10% of its time actually engaging with the societal issues that might make it interesting on a rationalist level. As it stands, TGaB has been running for three and a half years, making pretty regular updates the whole time, [[#s][and]] If Webb expects to actually spark or have a discussion on values they're presenting and their merit, it'd be pretty useful to actually have laid them out at some point.

Instead, I get the impression that TGaB's thesis which I think I can best summarize as "we should be focused on network effects, system level consequences and incentives, and our role within institutions" will continue to be doled out by Tellwyrn or whomever else gets to be the author mouthpiece of the book, and we'll get a triumphant win at the end of the series when society is reconstructed all for the better to prepare for the coming industrial revolution and every pre-existing institution will have reshaped itself to better integrate. More "The Next Generation", less "Battlestar Galactica".

Still gonna read it until the end, 'cause it's entertaining, but it certainly doesn't feel like much more than an entire world constructed to showcase how great things are when people wise up and start behaving like Webb's ideal version of themselves. [[#s][See]]

**** Not the OP, but I'll chime in. As a quick synopsis, the story roughly follows a group of students attending a University for adventurers in a world setting that combines fantasy and western themes (and later sci-fi). Each member of the group has their own reason for attending the university, run by a 3000 year-old elven archmage, but primarily they are there to learn how to survive and thrive in a world where traditional adventurers and heroes are being phased out by a technological revolution and bureaucratic expansion.

The best part of the series is the world-building, and the second best is the character development. Witty banter probably comes in third.

The series so far is 13 volumes long and has a HUGE cast of characters. It has a bit of something for everyone, but also does a good job of explaining (slowly) why the world works as it does and /how/ it works as it does. There are fairly consistent rules about the different types of magic, what they can do, who can use them, and how they interact. The gods are discrete figures but /also/ abstract concepts, and their interaction with mortals is almost as fascinating as how their individual cults affect the world and culture. Recently the plot has been discussing how the world came to be, and where the gods (and Old Gods) came from, which is cool too.

The characters are great as well; you get a wide, diverse cast, and each of them have their own backstories, problems, and abilities. Webb (the author) does a good job of not only making each character unique, but also showing the connections between them all. And while the cast is HUGE by now, most characters really are connected by just a degree or two of separation. That said, some characters get more development time than others, and at the beginning a lot of their dialogue feels interchangeable. After a few books, they start to get their own "voices," if you will. But with such a large cast, it's not uncommon to meet a new character and then not see them for a few books... which may make you forget who they were. It's hard to binge-read 13 volumes, but the last time I did so I realized a LOT more connections than I did the first time reading as chapters were released.

Finally, the banter is great. The synergy between the main characters means they are full of witty byplay. It's not quite as badass as, say, APGTE, but it is still really entertaining.

Now, there are complaints about the series too (see my other post here). But the series is definitely a fun read.

**** The world building is great, there are some fantastic setting ideas.\\
The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that every character frequently sounds like the writer.

*** Most of the time I see people mention this series they often mention that they feel like it's been in a rut for a while now and it doesn't feel like the author is enjoying it anymore. Maybe that?
