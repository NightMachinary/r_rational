** Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

IMO Hirou AND the Lord of Dark (and Dolf and anyone else, if willing) should've teamed up to fight for democracy. Hirou should not have killed or condoned the kills he has made but the kills he has made and other injustices in that world don't condone the creation of another despot (whether it's Hirou himself, Dolf or the lord of Dark), even if said despot at this point in time doesn't seem too bad. Refusing to stop the ritual would in no way make up for the deaths that happened, it would just be another evil on that pile.

Or at the very minimum, Hirou should've halted the ritual until he was a good enough mage to understand what exactly it was doing. If this was the only time the ritual could've been done then IMO it's VERY not worth the risk of making a god to continue it and should've been stopped anyways.

*** I wonder about the validity of that adage.

Perhaps power continues to corrupt any mortal physical being that has needs and desires, but once you break through the limit to /absolute/ power where all your possible needs could be met with no effort and you still have infinite capacity, you can actually be truly selfless

**** You might be right but that's also exactly what the most evil person who ever existed can very well say to get you to let them torture everyone.

The risk is nowhere near worth it when there's any other possible way to achieve anything that is at least nearly effective and it seemed like there was. There was nothing in the story about the balance somehow actively fighting and overwhelmingly suppressing democracy.

Further, even if there is magic in that universe that explicitly precludes power corrupting people, that still doesn't mean that a guy who is good at magic rituals is good at governing. He could just kill everyone via sheer ineptitude even if he legitimately tries to be good.

***** Vhazhar touched the Sword of Good, so he's currently good. I don't think everyone is corruptible by power - I think it's possible to rule over the universe with absolute power safely, as long as one takes it step by step.

About accidentally killing everyone - when he has absolute power, he can just choose for them to stay alive, and they will. Absolute power presumably means imposing your wishes on reality directly, rather than having to figure out how to apply that absolute power, otherwise, the Dark Lord would still be defeatable afterwards, even though they all seem to act like the spell was final.

Well... maybe good people are allowed to have moral flaws of certain kind (as long as they're correctible by the right kind of interaction by their environment).

So maybe Hirou got an upgrade from "good but flawed, and wielding the Sword to a fraction of its capacity" to "fixing flaws in some of his key beliefs (in a way that allowed him to be a catalyst to a significant good) and wielding the Sword fully."

"The most evil person who ever existed" wouldn't pass the Sword's test.

*** Citation needed. We can see in our world people with absolute power, and they are indeed corrupted.

However, the causal relationship is not established. It is true, you can in a lab reduce empathy in test subjects by giving them money. You can observe people in the world with money exibit a lack of empathy. So a trend is noted.

However, the factors causing that have not been established. In our world anyone who can achive great wealth will have to be absolutely corrupted. The system selects for it.

However we can see plenty of examples of people who gain power and use it justly. They are just usually killed by the bad actors who want to maintain their position so the dataset is small.

I think the kind of person who has a fully developed ethical and moral intelgence would be able to handle it well. Further, even if they make a mistake, failing short of the mark would for sure make a better system than the one that grew by historical accident and primitive struggle.

**** I prefer this quote, from Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon B Johnson:

#+begin_quote
  But although the cliche says that power always corrupts, what is seldom said ... is that power always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade others to give him power, concealment is necessary. ... But as a man obtains more power, camouflage becomes less necessary.

It's likely a mix of both, but it's certainly less absolute to give both statements.

Objection - we do not.

I do not know of any single person who has ever had the power to (say) turn off the Sun, which is still in itself far short of absolute power. At best, we have people who have the ability to command vast institutions of other people; powerful, but far from absolute.

******* anything could be. However power is like time. We aren't talking about a cultivation manwha. In the real world power isn't real. it is like time. It a concept we use to understand the relationship of sates.

I could just pick up and eat an apple so I am more powerful than an apple. Elon Musk could buy the company I work for and fire me. He also has enough money that he could probably murder me and get away with it. He is more powerful. Both our powers are socially provisioned though. If society just agreed not to take elon's money. then it would be all useless and he would be less powerful. In either case, power isn't real. It is our way of describing the social distance between us, there is no intrinsic quality to which it relates. So there is no referent to which a third factor could correlate.

******** That's true of /social/ power. It's potentially expansive, but vulnerable to outright denial like that. However, there are other types of power. For example, if someone purchases a firearm, then he gains the power to leave bullet-shaped holes in things; and even if society agrees to refuse to take his bullets, he can still leave bullet-shaped holes in people's feet.

Alternatively, if you were to learn some form of martial arts, then you could probably beat me up, regardless of my opinions on the matter; because that is another form of power that does not rely upon others to be effective.

********* Not quite so. I own a gun. That is. I inherited my gandfathers old gun that I dont own any bullets for and just sits as a decoration. Dunno if it even works to be honest. However because ai need bulleta we are back to the issue where the difference bwtween you and me is social power and you bought bullets.

Similar with kung fu. If I go thr gym and train for years to become a ultimate fighters that is because people took the time to teach me. In that case gaining power often increases moral education as you have to learn to trust and rely on people and treat them well.

I think fundamentally changing the time scale doesn't fundamentally change the nature of it.

You ever see the old conan movie? They talk about the riddle of steel. That a sword is only as good as the swordsman can let it be.

If we are dealing with a universe where power is real. And wisdom does let you unlock the secrets of the universe it is a different situation.

********** Gun power does depend on bullet power, yes, and social power does make it easier to obtain the bullets. But it's still possible to obtain bullets in other ways, including theft.

And yes, social power does help to obtain other sorts of power (like kung fu). But again - it's not the only way to get there. You can probably find a book on the subject online, and learn from that - it won't be /as/ good as a personal tutor, but it'll be better than someone who does not know it at all.

***** I guess the point is to not blindly rely on the conspiracy theories of a reclusive group who pass their knowledge only by word of mouth? Perhaps if Hirou killed Vhazhar then Dolf would take over the spell and end it somehow, maybe use it to achieve that "balance" that he so clearly desires. It's not very clear how things were meant to turn out.

The mechanics of the spellwork didn't seem so important in light of the character's revelation of how he was easily letting himself be a tool used to trample over others. At least the Lord of Dark was forthright about his intentions for Evilland and the Bad Races. Hirou's observation that people that world don't tend to lie so much as omit information lets us have some measure of confidence in Vhazhar's words.
