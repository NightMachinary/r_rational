** Good illustration of a utility function gone very logically wrong, I like this story a lot.

Meanwhile [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/][Shamus Young's blog]] is also a good read (even if it's not especially "rational" in the ratfic sense) for anyone interested in video games, layman-accessible explanations of programming concepts, or a webcomic formed by captioning the LOtR movies to turn them into a D&D campaign.

He's a generally good/entertaining writer, I would subscribe to his newsletter were I not already subscribed more conveniently by RSS.

** This is a very good story, and one of the ones that got me into web fiction. At one point, I'm going to find the time to read it again.
