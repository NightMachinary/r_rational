** Oh damn, I was not expecting an Ivah POV.

Very interesting, so after acquiring winter and having the luxury of survival in order to think, Ivah has finally come face to face with what exactly she's gotten into. We also finally have a bit of knowledge on how the Miezan occupation happened. I remember that immediately after breaking the chains, the first dread empress was murdered by the Lady of Wolof at the time, basically returning Praesi culture back to the status quo instead of learning from 2 centuries of slavery. And that ripple extends up to modern day Praes, taken up to eleven.

I'm guessing the Drow conquest is sort of a test run, and since we now know Malicia has made herself very costly to kill, Cat will eventually have to chip away at her power.

*** I think Ivah is male?

Drow society is basically Praesi society taken to its logical conclusion; Akua is right to have learned from it.

***** The Meat class aren't considered Drows and don't have genders. I remember Ivah being referred to as "he" rather than "it" or "she" after he became Lord, but that may have been a typo.

****** That was likely also a typo, as Ivah has stated that the Mighty also don't have genders, which is why "Priestess of Night" is a cattle-term, as Sve Noc is Mighty.

**** I rather like Akua's new take on "Iron sharpens iron". Amadeus dislikes the saying because it implies constant internal strife leading to defeat.

Akua dismisses the saying because the greatest sin in her culture is not trying your best. Sharpening iron is accepting the base material's limits as your ceiling.

I see the implications of our Losara Queen's campaign are finally starting to sink in for Ivah. I like the way zis perspective shifts when ze realizes just how outmatched zis entire civilization is.
