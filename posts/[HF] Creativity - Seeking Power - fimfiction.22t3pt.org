** Only a few chapters released so far but the author seems to be releasing rapidly. AU but not drastic changes: it seems like the order of several familiar events has been juggled (e.g. Cadence and Shining Armour are married /before/ Luna's return) but other than these timeline changes the world feels pretty familiar. Context is provided well with a brief selection of scenes from Twilight's early years. Several interesting new characters. Pretty well written so far, I look forward to more chapters.

Edit: Update after more chapters. Still fantastic! Thouroughly enjoying this. Somehow still /feels/ like MLP despite the tone being changed a lot, and some characters a fair bit too. If it stays this good it might take the top spot for my favourite fimfiction from "Days of Wasp and Spider."

*** So... judging by the title... did someone basically read /Luminosity/ and decide to write "rational ponies"?

**** Seems roughly that way so far. I'll cautiously say that so far I like it better than Luminosity, which felt a bit like 'painting by numbers' to me. I think it was a lack of world-building and characterisation, causing me to feel more like I was observing something complex being assembled, or reading an instruction manual for taking over the world, than enjoying a story.

** I'm going to have to actually start watching this show if people keep outputting such good fanfiction of it.

*** >actually watching the show

The problem with MLP is that 50% of the episodes are just kinda shovelware crap for kids, and 50% are wonderful adorable fun-fun time for all good and sane people, and /nobody agrees on where to draw the line./

**** Ya your more likely to find a logical mechanism behind the pinkie sense then you are to get any two bronies to agree on which episodes are worth watching.

***** Pinkie Sense makes perfect sense. She's an eldritch abomination who can manipulate and sense probability at her whims; deal with it.

**** I sort of tried watching the first two episodes and had to give up. It's cute, but it doesn't hold my interest.

***** That's perfectly fair. The fan community produces just a tremendous amount of content. Thanks to sturgeons law...
