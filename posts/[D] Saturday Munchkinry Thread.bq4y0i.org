Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Posit that gravity is transmitted by particles called gravitons. Rather than being affected by the pull of gravity, you can absorb gravitons and hold them in an internal reservoir of a limited size. Gravitons that you hold in this reservoir have no external effects. You can easily float and fly by absorbing the majority of gravitons hitting your body. You can reduce your weight by a fraction or completely. It's up to you.

The other side of this power is what happens as the reservoir fills. When it's full, you can't absorb any more. At any time, you can release the gravitons from your reservoir, but it's an all-or-nothing thing. You can only dump all the gravitons in your reservoir.

When you dump gravitons, you choose a solid object that you are touching and pump gravitons into it. The gravitons diffuse through the object, and after a short pause are emitted uniformly from the object. In essence, you can increase an object's apparent mass. The gravitons are emitted from the surface of the object; the object is not affected by its apparent increase in mass. Everything else in the vicinity is.

--------------

I'm trying to avoid HPMOR-style conceptual hacking that would allow Partial Infusion, but I don't know how to work around that definition.

I'm also not sure how fast graviton absorption scales, or what the practical effects of this infusion would be. I haven't done the math.

*** You could easily extend your reserves by carrying a bag of marbles or something. Just flush your gravitons into a marble and throw it away.

Also, can you "shield" an item from gravity? If you hold a ball in your hand, and start absorbing gravitons, does the ball float because you're blocking gravitons from reaching it?

Another fun thing to try would be repeatedly dumping gravitons into the same item, faster than it can emit them. This would get you an arbitrarily large gravitational field, which you can then aim by selectively absorbing gravitons on one side.

You can probably resolve the "what's an object?" question by making it based on the density of what you're pushing stuff into. Gravitons diffuse more easily through dense stuff, so you can treat two bricks stuck together with mortar as "an object", but if you simply tie two bricks together with string you'd have trouble charging them both, and trying to charge up individual air molecules is right out.

This is brilliant, and there'll also be a few one-ton marbles.

``` 1000kg / (1 cm diameter sphere) = 1000kg / 0.523599 cubic centimeters = 1909.86 kilograms per cubic centimeter =

≈ (9×10^{-10} to 2×10^{-8)} × neutron star density ( 8×10^{13} to 2×10^{15} g/cm^{3} ) ≈ (0.2 to 190.9) × density of a white dwarf ( 10000 to 1×10^{7} g/cm^{3} ) ≈ 1×10^{8} × mean density inside the Schwarzschild radius of a supermassive black hole (≈ 20 kg/m^{3} ) ```

which is going to punch straight through most surfaces if dropped from any appreciable height, and probably deafen most people in the vicinity.

  And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny 'tink' noise coming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowest floor, say.

  Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop herself.

  The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, "Since you asked it, Amelia," and went off yet again.

Hadn't considered this; I'm going to say that the absorption field can be extended to things you're carrying, but no more than your full weight. Clothes and bags worn on your person count against that weight.

The power is not directional; it's just a percentage how many gravitons you absorb.

This is poorly worded on my part; what I'm aiming for here is that the object's apparent mass increases but the object is not affected by the increase in its own mass.

Perhaps "the gravitons are emitted at the surface, with the same dispersal pattern as if the object was emitting those gravitons from its own mass." as an improved wording? It's not supposed to be a graser or gravy gun.

**** I'd say the increase in the object's apparent mass would be proportional to the amount of gravitons dumped into the object. If you absorb all gravitons hitting you for 1 second, and you mass 100 kg, you'd impart 100 kilogram-seconds of gravitons into the object, and its apparent mass would increase by that much. Absorb for 10 seconds, and you'd impart 1000 kilogram-seconds of gravitons.

Speaking Doylistically, there's several options for how the imparted gravitons are diffused:

- at the rate at which they were acquired, so that absorbing 100 kg worth of gravitons for 10 seconds results in a 100kg apparent-mass increase for 10 seconds
- in one second, so that those 1000 kg-seconds of gravitons result in 1000kg apparent-mass increase for 1 second
- instantaneously, so that for the briefest of moments everything in sight is drawn towards this object, which outmasses the Sun
- over a duration of the power-user's control, letting 1000kg-seconds be diffused for a thousand seconds or for a microsecond.

For a power, I think the better option would be for the user to choose.

The reservoir does come with a sense of fullness, like a normal human bladder does.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This, I'm not sure of. Again speaking Doylistically, the limit on flight time would be the bounds of what amount of kilogram-seconds would not be Earth-shatteringly overpowered to dump into an object. I'm aiming for something on the order of "terrifying, but not an existential threat", at least for this arc of the character.

***** Hmmm. Okay, here's some thoughts, then.

Assume that the graviton-bladder allows for at least a thousand kilogram-seconds of gravitons (and the person is 100kg) for simplicity of calculation. Then he can fly for ten seconds before he has to release all of those gravitons again.

This is plenty.

First of all, he's not doing Superman flight. No matter how fancy he gets with taking gravitons from only one direction, the only body in his vicinity capable of attracting him with significant force is the planet Earth - which means he can only use his power to accelerate one way, and that way is /down/. In order to move laterally, he needs to either push off against something or have some sort of propulsion mechanism (like a battery-operated desk fan). He can make truly /astounding/ jumps (in terms of distance, not speed), but he's not going to be racing against cars anytime soon. (Well, he can try to race, but he won't win unless traffic conditions are truly terrible).

So. What else can he do? Firstly, he can easily make a long jump that lasts more then ten seconds - he just needs a handful of rice or confetti or something similar, dropping a piece every time his graviton bladder gets full.

Running out of confetti will be trouble, though. He might need to start kicking off his shoes.

And he can smash through basically anything. Imagine that he takes a coin and flings at at his target; but the moment before he releases the coin, he dumps a full 100kg of mass for ten seconds into it. That coin will strike with a full 100kg of mass (plus its own, comparatively negligible weight) but with a contact area that is /tiny/; meaning that in terms of pressure per square millimetre, well, that coin would probably embed itself into a steel door. And not just coins - anything with a small striking area (darts, credit cards, pencils) can be turned into a Deadly Missile of Doom... and ten seconds later, he can be ready to go again.

****** I like where you're going with the thrown projectiles, but they'd have the same problem that the M16 was meant to solve. A 1000-kg marble traveling at 100km/h impacting over a square centimeter in 1/10 of a second exerts 278000 kg/cm, which punches straight through the target. It has no stopping power, only hole-making power.

*** - Clone - grow a dormant clone of yourself that will receive your soul and resurrect you if you die. Clone can be of any desired age. Takes 120 days to mature the clone, but seems worth it to me, if only on utilitarian grounds so humanity doesn't lose the wish power.

- Awaken, Find Familiar, Find Steed - a permanent and demonstrably magical, if not particularly powerful, pet.

- Finger of Death - kill someone (no save possible for a baseline human) and turn them into a zombie permanently under your control. If used on someone powerful (and evil, ideally) could probably be used for shenanigans. Plus you gain a (creepy) magical pet for demonstrating your powers are real, as above.

- Modify Memory - a more flexible (and ethical) way to permanently subvert some powerful individual. Has a chance of failure, however (WIS saving throw and you need to pick a persuasive memory.)

- Plane shift, teleport - visit other dimensions or planets/galaxies. Not the lowest-hanging fruit, but at a later stage worth doing for the information on what's out there. No way back (Gate is lvl 9), so you'll need to pack enough for a year or spend a clone.

- Simulacrum - create a near-perfect, magically loyal copy of yourself (they might even inherit the wish power!) or someone that you've kidnapped. (Or an ally, I guess.) Takes twelve hours and the target needs to be in your company the whole time.

- Magic Jar - become a vase with the power to possess people. Lasts indefinitely, until the vase is broken or you willingly possess your old (comatose) body.

- Planar Ally - summon a very powerful angel. It's not magically loyal to you, but /theoretically/ this shouldn't matter since it'll be inherently Good. In practice, should probably test this one somewhere safe, like the Andromeda galaxy.

- Major Image - cast at 6th level, you gain the permanent ability to create a single illusion. (Max size 20' cube, range 120', you can reshape the illusion at will.)

- Summoning spells generally last for an hour as long as you can maintain concentration. (easy in DnD, especially outside combat.) Within that hour, you can get some loyal, blatantly magical, fairly powerful spellcaster monsters. More bang for your buck in terms of number of spells.

  - Conjure Woodland Beings: Summon a number of creatures, of your choice, for an hour. They're magically friendly and most of the options are spellcasters. Cast at level 8 you get 3x as many summons as default (especially useful for Sea Hags, who need to be a trio to be able to cast.)
  - Summon Greater Demon: This /would/ be the best option, but unfortunately it's from Xanathar's Guide To Everything, which might not be canon. Not only would it risk losing the power, you really don't want a DM-guided "evil genie" take on this spell in particular.
  - Conjure Celestial - summon a friendly Coatl for an hour. (Although beware, RAW the DM might choose to give you a useless Pegasus instead.) The Coatl is INT 18, so it can give good advice. It can also change shape at will, and can cast the following as a lvl 14 Cleric:

#+begin_quote
  At will: Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts

  3/day each: bless, Create Food and Water, Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Poison, Sanctuary, Shield

  1/day each: dream, Greater Restoration, Scrying
#+end_quote

Edit: Am I reading this right?

#+begin_quote
  The stress of casting this spell to produce *any effect other than duplicating another spell* weakens you [...] your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
#+end_quote

This seems to make the "standard" uses, like producing money and healing people, terrible choices. I guess the DM isn't encouraged to rules-lawyer you on them, but honestly this seems worse than being monkey's paw-ed.

**** Starting with perma-spells is an excellent idea. I think Clone is a great choice for Year 1, and I might go with Simulacrum for Year 2. I'll rule that your double does inherit the Wish, but as it cannot regain spell slots it only has one to use. Still, basically a free extra body, since you get another Wish this year only (use it for Awaken, the most powerful of the Familiar-type spells).

Year 3 is Planar Ally, with the task of "help me attain my CEV." I don't think I'd be quite as worried as you about potential disaster there, since as written the entity can at worst refuse the order and vanish. You might want to save this one until you can offer the angel something really tasty as payment, perhaps the promise of letting it dictate a Wish once the task is complete and post-scarcity negentropic utopia is achieved?

I'll also rule that any of the "standard" non-spell uses can be produced without the enormous downsides, since most or all of those things can be reproduced by spells anyway. Call them beefed-up Fabricate/Heal/Greater Restoration/etc. Under this ruling, granting yourself and nine friends resistance to at least b/p/s damage seems like a solid use of 3 years, preferably before you do anything that draws /too/ much attention.

Does this mean miracle healing for real life? As in, you can go and find 20 terminally ill patients with incurable diseases, and wish for all of them to be completely healthy again?

If so, this is probably the fastest way to make money (since the other wish is limited to 25000 gp, whatever that translates to in terms of actual money). Advertise your miracle healing abilities, and the rich will pay you incalculable amounts of money to heal them.

On the other hand, this might be extremely exploitable, depending on how the value of an object is determined. What is the value of a friendly AGI? Its code almost certainly can fit within 300 feet of pure computer memory. It seems likely to be ridiculously expensive, but what if you sabotage it somehow in a way that only you can fix? Make it so that the code is encrypted and only you have the key, so to anyone else, this code is completely useless and has no value. Would you be able to wish it into existence then?

**** I am not certain, but I believe that in order to wish for an item you have to specify the items characteristics, not its results. So you could wish for "a copy of this key in my hand", because you have a key in your hand that is uniquely specified by your wish, but a wish for "a key that will open the next door that I try to use it on" would likely fail unless the wish spell somehow invokes divination magic to see into the future. It can make a key with any particular shape you want, but you have to actually choose a shape.

Which means you can copy things and probably mix and match properties together, but won't be able to invent things with it. If you had a friendly AGI then you could wish for a copy of it. If you had instructions for a friendly AGI then you could wish for a machine that follows those instructions. But if you don't know how to make a friendly AGI then you don't know how to wish for one, as the words "friendly AGI" are not a primitive object that the wish spell knows how to make.
