** *tl;dr:*\\
- /Premise:/ Most adventurers get quests from questgivers, because questgivers are guaranteed to provide good rewards, while killing random monsters in the countryside is not.\\
- /Problem:/ Not all questgivers are honest with adventurers who approach them. Some questgivers are being paid by third parties to send adventurers to their dooms.\\
- /Solution:/ Set up a Bard College to gather ratings for questgivers, via surveys. An adventuring bard can use [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Sending][a quick Sending spell]] to request the ratings of a questgiver, and use those ratings to decide whether or not his party should accept a quest from that person.

*** Great, except you used dandwiki. Friends don't let friends use dandwiki, home of badly labeled houserules with no clear warning and no quality control. Use d20srd instead. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/message.htm]] [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/sending.htm]]

Message is a little low range though. However, there are some great long distance communications options, and ways to make cell phones in 3.5e D&D. My favorite is the spell Whispering Sand in the book Sandstorm. I especially like using it on Shapesand, also in Sandstorm, to make an Omnitool.

**** dand wiki isn't incorrect about sending, though. It's just that OP either misinterpreted spell levels as caster levels, or OP decided it would be cool if Sending was a lower level Bard spell.

** A small problem with this: /Sending/ is a 4th level /spell/ for Clerics and 5th for arcane casters, meaning you actually have to be PC level 7 or 9 to be able to do those Spells--which counts as mid-level. Additionally, /Sending/ cannot be learned by Bards.

Otherwise, seems like a great idea. One might even homebrew Sending to be a lower-level Bard spell to support it.
