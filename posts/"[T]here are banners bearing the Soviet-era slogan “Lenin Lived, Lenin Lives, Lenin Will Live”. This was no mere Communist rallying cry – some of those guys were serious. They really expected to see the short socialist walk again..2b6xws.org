** I'm with ZankerH. Did you mean to post this somewhere else? So Russia has a history of transhumanism. Nothing new there, or particularly applicable to this subreddit. Article was interesting nonetheless. Good luck reversing entropy. :p Though reconstruction is likely to be the next best path for ressurection.

*** I dunno, I had found it interesting that the Soviets had a transhumanist side to them. If it's just that wrongly classified for this subreddit, deleted.
