** Rather than weighing in on the recent discussions on writing smart characters, I'll just point to the first part of this chapter as an example of how I do it. One of things I think is key, when you are presenting a startling new discovery, is 'Why hasn't anyone noticed or figured this out before?' I drew on some of the history surrounding the development of Special and General Relativity here.

** Sweet, new chapter!

I like how the physics work felt believable, and the end is an interesting setup for the next chapter without feeling like a "tune in next week".

I was a little fuzzy on the rules of Journeyman's teleportation, but I get it enough. And I loved the part about the einherjar attitude towards being bodyguards. Great characterization.

*** Journeyman is a little fuzzy on the rules of Journeyman's teleportation 8-). One of the reasons he is so paranoid is that he is acutely aware of how much he, and magicians in general, rely on heuristics (this worked before in these circumstances, so it will probably work that way again) rather than rigorous theory. He is much more of a magical engineer than a magical scientist. He is trying to change that, but experimentation is dangerous.
