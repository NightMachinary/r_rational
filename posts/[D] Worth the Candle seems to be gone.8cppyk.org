I get a generic "Sorry, you don't have permission to access the page you were trying to reach." whenever I try to access Worth the Candle.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126]]

Anyone know what's going on? [[/u/alexanderwales]] ?


** Edit: The story appears to have been restored.

--------------

Not to worry (much), just bureaucratic stuff that's mostly my fault. Here's the e-mail I got 11 days ago, which was auto-filed to a folder that I don't check.

#+begin_quote
  The AO3 Policy & Abuse committee has received a complaint regarding your work "Worth the Candle", stating that it violates the AO3 “no commerce” rule.

  Section IV.B. of our Terms of Service states that “promotion of commercial products or activities is not allowed”. Additionally, our ToS FAQ explains: “We want the Archive to remain a non-commercial space. That means that it isn't the right place for offering merchandise, even fan-related merchandise. Linking to your personal page (not, for example, an Amazon author page) is fine, even if the personal page includes some items for sale, but the Archive is not advertising space."

  Linking to a personal website or blog/social network where you are taking donations, posting commissions or mentioning published works is permitted, but advertising it directly on the Archive is not, nor is using language which one might interpret as requesting financial contributions. For example, you can say something to the effect of “check out my Tumblr if you want to know more about me and my writing” and include the link to the site, but you cannot specifically state anything about donations, commissions or sales on the Archive.

  As such, we require you to edit out all the offending content from your account within 7 days. This includes anything that might be in any other works and in your profile. If you fail to delete the offending material by the date given, we'll hide this work and any other violating works so they are only visible to you. If the works are not edited within a week of being hidden, an Archive administrator will delete this work and any other violating works.

  When you created your account, you agreed to comply with our Terms of Service, including our “no commerce” policy. A formal warning has now been placed on your account; failure to comply with the terms of this letter, or further violations of the ToS, may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account. You may consult our Terms of Service FAQ for more information regarding warnings and suspensions: archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#content_faq.
#+end_quote

I didn't actually read the ToS, and I'm not really involved with the Ao3 community, so my first warning of this was the story being hidden by the admins. I've removed links to Patreon from the story (in the summary, and in the most recent chapter), and responded to the e-mail that had languished in the folder; we'll see what kind of turnaround time there is.

I'll choose to believe that the anonymous report was from a Good Samaritan who wanted to ensure that Ao3 is able to achieve its objectives, rather than just someone who hated the story (or me personally) and was being vindictive.

(Worst case scenario, I'll have to change hosting to my own website, which would be an utter pain in the ass that would eat up writing time.)

In the meantime, if you'd still like to read the story, this will have to do for now:

[[http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.html][HTML]]\\
[[http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.pdf][PDF]]\\
[[http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.epub][EPUB]]\\
[[http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.mobi][MOBI]]

These will not stay current, and will probably be taken down once the story is back up.

I really enjoyed your Metropolitan Man and Last Christmas, and finding out you wrote Worth the Candle is really funny to me, it's like finding out that CS Lewis was a pseudonym of Tolkien for example instead of a different guy.

Is linking a Patreon really that bad? I wonder what you can even do about it. Can you say, "support me at my website," which has a link to you Patreon?

Definitely annoying, but I see why they don't commercial stuff on there. It could ruin their whole deal.

**** You can just say "visit my website" with a link, and then the website has a link to Patreon. I think that this case /isn't/ bad, since it's Patreon for an original work, and there's debatably not a problem with intermixing of fan and commercial works ... but it's easier to have a blanket policy that everyone follows, rather than trying to judge on a case-by-case basis that inevitably results in bias, perception of bias, and blowback.

I'm fine not having a link, or just having a link to my website (since they explicitly allow that), and would have just done that if I'd known that I was supposed to. I /like/ AO3, and the Organization for Transformative Works, and would only move the story if I was forced to.

(As far as monetization goes ...

Well, a little more than two years ago, I quit my job as a software engineer to be a stay-at-home dad to our son, who had just been born. It was something that my wife and I talked about a fair amount before we did it, and a decision that we made with the understanding that we'd be going from DINKs (Double-income, no kids) to living off just her salary. For the most part, we've made this work without it hurting too much, mostly because we were already living fairly frugally.

I try not to think about the intersection of money and writing all that much, because I worry about giving myself anxiety, but there's going to be a point, a few years from now, when my son starts going to school and I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to do as far as rejoining the workforce goes. I'd /really/ like to write full time, if I could justify it, but it's not clear whether I'll actually be able to justify it -- and that's what I think about, when I think about not linking to Patreon anymore.)

Apologies for the long and somewhat tangential response, I think I'm just in a talkative/contemplative mood.

***** I still say you should offer higher Patreon tiers. It doesn't even have to be really useful stuff, my server's patreon offers discord roles, user ads and custom channels and it still gains more income than WTC's with 25% of your patrons, which is a shame.

I definitely think you could swing at least $1000 a month with your current userbase if there wasn't only a $1/month tier. Someone a while ago gave you a better gameplan, something like a really low tier, another tier that you're hoping the average user aims for, and an expensive tier to make the average tier look cheap.

It just feels like a shame to me that the top royalroadl writers can live off their work and you can't.

IMO, the DM character doesn't exhibit even as much power as is implied by all the speculation of our protagonists. Much better to have the DM write himself out of the story than leave him hovering in the background.

*** I didn't mind the ROB so much as that one part where (all of this is paraphrased) Joon says, "I wish to not have a harem," and the DM replies, "Well, you can always mind-rape your companions and remove their attraction to you. And, since I've given you that idea on how to accomplish it, I'll count that as a wish granted."

And, you know, I could even let that slide, except there is /no push-back/ from Joon on that. At all. He just moves on to his next question.

I almost stopped reading at that point. It horrified me. It disturbed me. And yes, in the very next chapter, Joon pledged not to make any soul modifications without the person's consent, which alleviated some of that horror. But still, that one paragraph colours my perception of the entire story, and not in a positive way.

...And, having written all of that, I went back and read that paragraph, thinking that I might have oversold it, but no. It's actually worse than I remembered.

***** Short answer is: by not pushing back against "I've told you how to do it; I'll count that as your wish having been granted," Joon's accepting the answer given as a plausible solution to the problem. I can't speak to what the character considered because the story doesn't speak to what the character considered. But Joon accepted that the wish had been granted, which says something, and not something good.

****** It seems like one of the key issues for you is the fact that Joon is not explicitly reacting to the DM's suggestion. I think you would have to read that scene in a vacuum without the context of the story to come to your conclusion and based on your responses that does seem like what you're doing.

Has Joon been characterised in any way as the sort of character who would consider ‘mind-raping' ethical or moral? Joon has repeatedly shown to care about whether his companions have free will via the loyalty mechanic, has worried about their continued existence when he is absent and has worried that their mental make up was inorganically designed by the DM. He has shown himself unwilling to glance at amaryllis' naked form through the soul link and has been unwilling to peer at his companions personality through the soul link unless it is of the utmost necessity. He also has numerous explicit negative reactions to the way Fallatehr uses soul magic to mind rape his companions. If you take all of this context yet come to the conclusion that a non reaction is evidence enough to heavily discount all of the above, well, we weigh evidence differently then. I think it's important if you have a particularly strong negative reaction to a story that doesn't seem to have been experienced by other readers (some readers had issues with the ROB scene but they appear to be more regarding the overarching plot or a lack of munchkining) to consider the possibility that you are reading something into the story that wasn't intended.

******* I'm not trying to say it was intended.

I've read a lot of fiction and fan fiction, and one mistake that I see often is that people write dialogue as if they're just transcribing what each person says, and leave out the important part, which is how a character reacts to what is being said. I don't care that Alice is telling Bob that Carol is having an affair with Dave, I want to see how Bob /reacts/ to that information.

Now, normally, in WtC, the author has been decent about writing that kind of thing, but in this particular case, there was something that /absolutely needed/ to be reacted to. And the lack of a reaction to an idea that noxious, when the character /has/ reacted to lesser offences (compare, in the next chapter, how he reacts to the existence of embryo-souls), conveys its own message by its absence.

Again, I'm not saying that message is there intentionally. It's probably that same mistake I see over and over again, in presuming that /what is said/ is more important than the /reaction/ to what is said. When I read that paragraph, I fully expected Joon, based on the character that he was shown to be, to jump down the DM's throat for even suggesting such a thing, for even suggesting that Joon would /do/ such a thing. And then, when it cost him a wish, I again expected /some/ sort of protest.

Trust me, if it had seemed /in/-character for Joon to be okay with that sort of thing, I would have stopped reading a long time sooner. The lack of reaction sent a message that I was so thoroughly not okay with, and caused me to re-evaluate the character.

Even unintended, the message is there, conveyed by the absence of a reaction to a truly foul suggestion. And, even unintended, that message is going to colour how I think about the rest of the story.

******** Am I right in saying that a) you agree Joon is not okay with or the sort of person to endorse mind rape, b) AW was not trying to put forward the message that mind rape is okay, c) you felt the scene unintentionally puts that idea forward, due to a writing mistake, and yet, d) this is going to effect your perception of the entirety of the rest of the story?

Even though I don't agree with c) I can understand your point. d) is hard for me to wrap my head around. Is the timeline in your head for the story that Joon is a reasonably moral and ethical character that had an in universe moment whereby he was for the space of a conversation okay with mind rape before going back to being a character with reasonable morals and ethics? Reading stories whereby you understand the authors intention but think they failed to translate it well and then forever after read the story with that mistranslation warping your perception of the story just seems...like a good way to not enjoy reading honestly.

****** My read is that DM tells Junpier that editing companions via administrative access to prevent harem possibility is not that different from soul magic mind-rape. Since Juniper was reckless enough to ask that sort of thing and wish is technically granted, he is penalized with one wish.

Later Juniper explained why he did not attempt optimizing the wishes.

**** I guess I'm not sure how he'd push back on it. Sure, he could say that it's wrong or immoral or unethical, and that'd be true. Joon recognizes that. What exactly would pushing back solve? He gets an alternative answer to the throwaway wish to not have a harem? Either way, he loses the wish. Any other answer probably wouldn't be much better than That. It's a wish granted. A waste of a wish, sure, but Joon dug that hole for himself. He's not going to forcibly remove their attraction because he doesn't need to since he's not going to try and build a harem.

Where? Where does the story say that he recognizes that? Really, just having that recognition in the story would put my mind at ease. As it stands, there is absolutely no reaction /whatsoever/ from Joon to that suggestion, even internally.

#+begin_quote
  What exactly would pushing back solve?
#+end_quote

The DM stated that the wish had been granted based on Joon having been given a way to accomplish his desire himself. He could push for that wish back, since the solution given is something the DM knows he'd never actually do.

Even if he can't get the wish back, he could use the wish as worded to push for his /future/ companions (if there's seven, that's still two he hasn't met) to be heterosexual men, so that he's neither attracted to, nor /attractive/ to, them. A party of three men, four women, and a dwarf could hardly be said to be a "harem" (and it provides the women in the party who aren't Finn a chance to express romantic interest in someone other than Joon).

And even if the DM refuses to budge at all, at least then there's /some/ sort of reaction to that horrific idea.

There are other instances where Joon expresses horror at the idea of mind-raping people. But judging people by a lack of reaction doesn't tell us that he's a horrible person, but rather that you yourself are very sensitive to morality. Trying to put myself in that situation, I wouldn't have had a reaction either, because 1) editing values and mind-rape through soul magic isn't exactly news, 2) I would be trying to analyze every word the DM says because he just revealed a hint™ and 3) it's not like someone else making a suggestion to commit a heinous act means I have to do it or even react to it. I think Joon clearly has a code of ethics (e.g. thinking about how it's wrong to kill the tuung guards and vaguely following through), but he's not particularly zealous in following it because he's also a bit of a utilitarian neutral (e.g. committing to the plan and killing all the named tuung vanguard on the ship).

You raised up something fun though! It's interesting how the first-person voice has an effect on what we notice and what bothers us. It highlights any dissonance between how Joon reacts and how we would react, especially if you get engaged in reading. God knows I get this itch whenever Joon acts in a way that feels foreign to my own envisioned response.

About the harem, the latent homosexual feelings for Arthur theory was thrown around, so as long as the new male companions like Joon romantically, the harem potential is there.

Since I had some free days this week I binged read back up to the current chapter and must say that the story has continued to be excellent and I love the direction it is going. I love binge reading to get caught up when I get behind since it is so satisfying to have 35 chapters to read all at once. :)

This story continues to be my number 1 recommendation to readers in the litRPG subreddit for good reasons. :)
