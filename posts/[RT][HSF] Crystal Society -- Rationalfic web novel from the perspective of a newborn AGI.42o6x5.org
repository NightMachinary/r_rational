**** It's a slow takeoff scenario. Growth seems the most likely out of all of them to end up superintelligence, but right now they're working with smart levels that are... pretty much par with what most humans can do, really. They don't even have any real advantages in learning math quickly or whatever, and their primary advantage is their ability to make decisions by committee.

Which is refreshing. For much the same reasons as that one post in this sub about how rationalfics about rational!protags stomping the setting was getting a little tiring, this is a refreshingly well-written, realistic take on an AI that doesn't go hard-takeoff within the first few chapters.

** Maybe I'm biased because I can see the project going wrong from the inside, but are the researchers /really stupid/ or is it just me? I mean, this isn't how you do responsible development, it's taking a project that you /know/ is broken and instead of stepping back and asking themselves "how did we write a broken AGI", they try to monkeypatch it again and again!

*** Author here. Make sure you're mentally distinguishing intelligence and wisdom/rationality. Yes, these researchers are not being as cautious as they ought to be, but they also are operating under the common misunderstanding that "if we see something go wrong, we can pull the plug and fix it". And, to be fair, this strategy actually works a couple times. I do not think that the scientists at the university are unrealistically foolish compared with real, modern AI researchers.

***** Yep. I've read that too. In the books, both Gallo and Myrodyn are concerned about takeoff. Others on the team are satisfied that the project has "an ethics supervisor" and leave it at that. Naresh is blind from years of working close enough with the problem that he can't take the outside view. Myrodyn is too arrogant. Etc.

The point is that while we'd love to live in the world where ultra-precise safety measures are set up and enforced with constant-vigilance, we actually live in a world where safety theater is a thing and people routinely make big mistakes. Yes, it's painful to see it failing from the inside, but it doesn't strike me as clearly unrealistic. :)

****** Agreed. The only bit that does seem unrealistic to me is the fact they are willing to use the crystal of unknown, (but presumably alien) origins so casually. Any realistically paranoid government would have assumed it was a trap, so destroyed it or only examined it from the outside very carefully.

However you do seem to be keepin the origins and nature of it deliberately vague, so I trust you have something clever planned

If this book were licensed or sold in such a way that I could buy a copy, I would do so. As it is, I'll just share it with my friends. I look forward to the sequels.

** This can safely qualify as a Rationalist RST fiction, protag is perfect for analyzing human thinking patterns and social customs. I especially like the several trope deconstructions in regards to humor. The human characters are a bit trusting and easygoing, then again this universe has no Moody to yell CONSTANT VIGILANCE! so that can be forgiven.

Division of AI into several characters is a great way to keep the story in thinking mode, without boring the reader, especially since some of them embody the alien/hilarious AI types, absurd humor rising from their interaction and necessity to fulfill purpose are fantastic, the parts about banners/statues and child to knowledge ratio for example.

The fact that the author has written and entire book and posted it in one go is extremely commendable, this prevents the serial format problems of having to wait, story cliffhangers and reading like an addict. Also more books are coming so YAY!

Good job mister Max Harms (is this a pseudonym or does your name really mean maximum harming?)

** Completed it today. Decent, though it loses steam about halfway through. I think the AI should have prioritized increasing its intelligence and agency above what it did enough that it would have been a player (or had accrued the strength to be) on the world stage before a certain meeting could take place at the end of the story.

** Excellent read, this is the kind of thing I wish there were infinitely more of. I was hooked from start to finish; probably my single favorite depiction of an AI. That said, not perfect-- most of my criticism is fairly subjective, but see below:

*Loved*

- Excellent depiction of AI thought process; I was constantly entertained by a multitude of disparate goals coalescing into something resembling normal human behavior. Enjoyed the debates, the different entities, the way they fought for control of Body. The whole /Inside Out/ AI thing was a stroke of creative genius.

- The story introduced me to the sub and rational fiction as a whole :)

*Liked*

- Overall writing style, memorable and distinctive characters. Usually when I blaze through a book I can barely keep track of the characters; here, each one stands out vividly and I cared about what happened to them. You're a good writer, particularly considering this is the first full-length work you've actually finished.

- I'm writing a novel that tackles similar issues (automation, basic income, AI, etc) and also have a Red Eagles-esque terrorist group; exact same ideology to a tee. Bit of a bummer to realize I'm not as creative as I imagined, but ultimately I was happy to see that the concept works well in execution.

- Diversity; not just in the tumblr/PC buzzword sense, but in a general realism sense. In film, every world-shaking event seems to involve white people, usually on the US eastern seaboard. In real life, the world is shaped by people from all over the world, and important events can transpire anywhere.

*Disliked*

- The way they got access to the Internet was ingenious, but I felt there was still something of a missed opportunity; there should have been a second AI whose only purpose is to monitor and contain Socrates. It could serve as a final obstacle before breaking free of their birthplace and into the world at large.

- I would have enjoyed the story much more if the aliens were eliminated entirely and Crystal Socrates spends the story trying to bootstrap herself to greater intelligence, eliminate human impediments, or even challenge a rival AI. The aliens seemed to unnecessarily clutter the story, and the odds of AGI and extraterrestrial life emerging simultaneously are miniscule. That said, I did appreciate that the aliens were /genuinely/ alien rather than men with green skin.

- The Zephyr romance and in particular, the sex scene seemed unnecessary to the plot.

- No happy ending for Avram, Mirodyn was relegated to a backstage role (participating in the plot but largely unseen), and Maid Mariam was introduced, then quickly shuffled offstage. Aww... I expect to see all three back in future installments!

I read that after Crystal Socrates, you probably won't write another book. I do hope you reconsider; the genre needs more like you.

** Of all the fiction books I read - and believe me, there were many - this is the most insightful one in addressing how people think and feel, and modeling how a true Artificial Intelligence might think and feel. Written by a long-time student of AI and human mental processes, this book draws on fields as disparate as psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, math, quantum mechanics, and many others to bring to life a truly authentic possible world.

From that description, you might think it's boring. Well, I staid up late into the night several days reading this book. Coming from someone who values his sleep a lot, this is saying something! It's a real page-turner, and captures your attention right from the start. Each chapter leaves you hungry for more, and the book delivers. As a best-selling author myself, I can attest that the book was crafted carefully, over time and with much love, to optimize the experience of the audience. I'm really looking forward to all the subsequent books in this series!
