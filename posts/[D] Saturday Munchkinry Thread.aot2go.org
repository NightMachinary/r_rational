Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are granted a moderate wish that can grant you anything that is reasonably within current human capability, but not anything beyond that.

So for instance, you could wish to be as rich as the richest person, or have the maximum life expectancy humans have ever achieved, or be as strong as the strongest human ever or be elected president of a country, or build a majestic palace, etc.

But you cannot wish for things outside of human capability, such as becoming god, or building an FAI, or gaining knowledge no other human possesses, or getting more wishes, or traveling backwards in time, or building a galactic empire, etc.

What do you do with your moderate wish?

This was mine, although investing in asteroid mining looks like it could be a good side-gig to keep the money rolling in. Artificial meat, massive algae plants to make gas and pump it underground, buying ships to scuttle or change them over to cleaner energy, aggressively advertising mini-splits, propaganda to make food match the area its grown in (i.e. increase barley consumption in India), could all use a couple billion. Also straight up buying car companies and forcing them to electrify wouldn't hurt.

I imagine this varies from individual to individual. Personally, I'd be okay with most positive modifications, as long as they don't touch my mind. Mental modifications I would consider on a case by case basis because many seem quite likely to cause death of personality. For instance, if the empathy mod works by making my thought patterns more similar to other humans, I would very much resent receiving it.

I'm saying the simple way to complete the wish (aside from making this world vanish, and another appear in its place which meets the conditions) is

1. All humans die. (As opposed to all humans are modified.) Some genies might stop here - every living human does possess the maximum in X - there aren't any which don't that are still alive. (Or just most humans die - those which don't possess the maximum.)
2. The genetic profiles and the infrastructure (the cloning vats) are designed and implemented.
3. Mass production begins.
4. etc.*

"Resent" might not be the wrong word here, but I would definitely prefer to have not been born. There have been nice moments in my life, but there have also been a number of moments where I have genuinely and actively wanted to die, and those moments are going to keep happening, so even though I'm feeling okay /right now/, I would still prefer to be dead because, Outside View time, I know that my current circumstances are not going to last.

My outlook would be different if I thought that eventually I'd get to a point where things were mostly good and the bad stuff wasn't so bad, but all that I can reasonably look forward to is alternating between good moments and moments that make me want to kill myself until I develop dementia.

Yes, because that is like having multiple wishes, since the second iteration takes effect after the first.

Wishes along the lines of "I want people to believe me" work to some extent by making the things you say seem like they come from the most believable person ever. Which would get you plenty of believers, but wouldn't let you convince literally everyone. Nor would it let you convince plenty of people about something obviously wrong, so if you said "1+1 = 3", not many people would believe that.

** You can copy your mind in total (including memories, values, qualia and this ability) into any number of humans within a kilometre of yourself.

Physical coordination and unique knowledge or skills held by those humans is not overwritten - knowledge is retained to the degree that the human brain is able to store it, with older memories being dumped first in the overwriting process.

Instances of your qualia and values will be lost if two bodies containing it come within 100m of another, including the original body. In clones, this results in the original body's mind taking over again, along with your memories and this ability. Any lost knowledge does not return. In the original body, this results in brain death.

What communication methods would be useful in identifying and coordinating yourselves to avoid being overwritten and maximise your values? How else could this ability be used to maximum utility?

What I would use it for though is to make clones and transfer my memories into it and then killing myself to live forever at the cost of a baby every 80 year. It is still problematic but at least the baby doesn't lose any memories and when it's cloned there nobody is feeling attached to it changing.

If I ended up deciding it anyway I would make sure that all copies I'd make would keep a GPS on them at all time, have one of them create a program that tracked positions and gave alerts if people came close. I would also figure out how to keep or grow brains and keep backups of each of my copies' mental states in case something did happen. You could probably do some voting hacks and vote clones of yourself into various political positions. Actually, scratch that, if you believe that you yourself are superior to other people just take over the world by making everyone into you.

If I were fighting against someone like that I would send a missile in and always stay 1km away from said person. I would find out if that person have any trauma/phobia and exploit that all clones would have the same triggers. I would kidnap a clone and have psychologists make detailed profile. If things were bad enough I would resort to torture since each clone have all sensitive information of the original. Now I know the passwords/secrets/safehouses/patterns of the original and can probably defeat him with those.

*** If the original me was amoral enough to kill people by overwriting their minds with my own, the obvious next step would be my clones being amoral enough to kill the original me to save themselves. After all, the more clones the original me creates, the more likely two of them will come within 100m of each other and immediately lose their minds to their original bodies'. Best to kill the original me immediately to remove that problem.

QED let's never use this ability ever, regardless of your moral alignment.

As for fighting against this ability, that's easy enough: just make people group up. In cities, plenty of people will come within 100m of you every day, and even if you never leave your house your neighbours will probably come within 100m of you. This makes it really hard for the adversary to use this ability, because any two people in range of the ability that are within 100m of each other immediately regain their minds. And if anyone is within 100m of the adversary? Instant brain death.

So take two steps: First, move around in groups so you can quickly regain your minds if they are overwritten. Make protocols to ensure that members of your anti-adversary force come within 100m of each other member very often, to ensure there can't be too many clones of the adversary hidden among your own forces.

Second, get camouflage and stealth. The best way to kill the adversary is to secretly be within 100m when the ability is used. Build underground tunnels, pretend to be a corpse, hide within piles of trash, etc. One careless use of this ability while a member is within 100m and you win.

**** Everyone possesses the clone ability so if your original made clones then so would your clone. Your logic doesn't work since it would mean your clone would kill itself.

Both the clone and the original have the same value proposition, what on earth is changing between creating the clone that would make the original suddenly want to kill the clone?

Also one careless use removes one clone/original , that's hardly winning. Presumably by the time you started grouping people they have a few million clones scattered across the globe.

**** The principle of your solution is quite sound though.

Every human being needs to be within 100m of every other human being at all times to ensure only a single clone exists.

If you do just daily passes then they can just jump minds.

So first group the entire world into 100m squares, spread them all out so they are over 1km apart.

Then you bring groups together. If two people snap out of it then you're good. If neither group has anyone snap out then you're in trouble. You can't tell if there's only one or if there's none.

You also can't take the groups apart because the moment they're out of 100m range they can just take over another one.

OK. Randomly bring groups together and apart. Make sure they walk 1km away multiple times (out of the range).

Bring multiple groups together and apart randomly.

Eventually you win. Or they had an odd number of clones and you don't win.

But if they never use this ability you can't find them so...

*** I'm confused by your third paragraph.

When a clone walks within 100m of me I die and take over their body?

When a clone walks within 100m of another clone what happens?

Anyway my thought is to divide the world into quadrants and get a clone in every one. A 100m circle each with a 100m gap for safety. Eventually get gps tags on everyone so we'rel even safer.

I would obviously take over significant figures. Though full control is limited by proximity, but I'd eventually set up digital democracy so I could get full control.

**** Sorry for the unclear writing.

You overwrite Bob. There isn't enough space in his head so the first 23 years of his memories are lost. The rest of the brain is filled with your memories. Bob's are deleted as you write new memories to the brain.

Oops you got too close to another of your selves. Bob's mind returns and takes control of his body. He can't remember his first 23 years but has all the other memories that are in his brain, ie: yours and whatever was left of his. He also has your ability.

If the original you gets close to a clone, it has no other mind to take over after its is deleted. The body immediately shuts down and dies.

****** The final paragraph could be more clear, this is true. The original mine is restored, suggesting that the personality and values of the original mind were retained and may be different to your own.

The most recent memory chronologically of Bob's mind that they would remember as theirs, and therefore the one that would be the last to be deleted, would be of having their mind taken over. They as such may consider revenge against you

If all their memories were contrary to their values and personality, they could change over time, sure. However, people can have irrational beliefs, biases and can display cognitive dissonance and hypocrisy without other minds supernaturally filling their brains with new memories

******** They have.. all of your memories plus whatever memories of theirs were left over plus their original values and personality plus (a copy of) your power. I think what's most important here is the values and personality because in the short term, ie: potentially before taking stock and reconsidering their values based on their memories, there's someone out there who knows everything that your clone knew and has a superpower to fight you if they wanted.

--------------

The setting is the closest to Earth in the early 1900s (the decade).

You are an immortal being capable of three kinds of magic:

1. Creating white flames with any reasonable for a flame temperature (1.000-3.000 °C) within your field of vision. It requires energy; see below for details.

2. Shapeshifting without the energy cost, but shifting into and maintaining anything other than your default forms will require intense concentration; the transformation takes around half an hour. Said default forms are a middle-aged human female and a large (at least fifteen meters at the withers) white dragon. The dragons are not native to the setting. You start as a human female.

3. Summoning a sniper rifle (again, not native to the setting) for a neglegible amount of energy. The rifle fires magical bullets with an also neglegible cost in energy. The rifle dissapears after two hours and twenty-seven minutes and has to be resummoned. The bullets dissapear seconds after the hit.

Your enegy reserve has two limits: after reaching the first one you temporarily become mortal, while after reaching the second you are unable to use magic at all; you can produce around 100 km^{2} of flames in an instant before hitting the first limit, then around 15 km^{2} before hitting the second one. As for the bullets, you can fire well over a million before hitting the first limit. Your energy reserve takes around 24 hours to restore after being depleted completely.

The problem: you have around two months to neutralize (but *not* kill) a leader of a small magical cult. Members of the cult use very basic spells which can be safely ignored, but the leader can, by slightly concentrating, produce a water-like substance from any part of her body which can instantly heal wounds and undo damage to the surroundings. You are not sure how large is her energy reserve, but it allows her to /at least/ grow back all the limbs five times in a row.

If the leader dies, you instantly lose. Nobody would kill her on purpose, though, and she definitely won't commit suicide to make you lose. After two months you /might/ lose instantly at any moment, but you are not sure when exactly.

You don't care about casualties and collateral damage.

(Elaboration on the "neutralize" part: the leader must become unable to produce the magical substance.)

*** As I see it, there are two tasks at hand: capturing the leader and neutralizing her.

For the capture, given that neither the underlings nor the leader herself can damage us and our dragon form should be capable of carrying her away into our base, the main problem is finding her. Neither of the three abilities is useful here, unless we can maintain conversation while shapeshifted, so we'll stick to old-fashioned bribery, stalking cult members and other methods. We already know her gender and ability, though, so whatever helped us find that out will most probably enable us to find her position. Then, we transform into a dragon, fly to that location and carry her to our base.

Depending on what counts as 'damage', imprisoning her by immobilization should be trivial.

Unfortunately, the neutralization is a much more difficult task and will require further knowledge on the nature of the ability. If it's bound to an organ in her body or some higher entity that granted the power, then it's an issue of finding the source and eliminating it; if we just need her to run out of energy once, forcing her to heal people or they die should do the trick.

As for avoiding detection by authorities, none of the abilities help us there, so we'll just set up the base in a secret location and transform back from dragon form somewhere far away from it; also, unless someone takes a photograph or the leader is under police surveillance, nobody will believe that a dragon appeared and carried her off somewhere.

It exists and is impossible to eliminate. I was thinking about somehow creating the environment that prevents her from using the ability, but, say, constantly evaporating it can very likely kill her due to heat. So that continues to be a problem.
