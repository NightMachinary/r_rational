The LW survey got me thinking, and one of the things I'm ho-humm about with LW is that I always want to start discussing the sequence I just read, but there's no-one to do it with...

Would people be up for a periodic read-and-yak on the Sequences? Something roughly bi-weekly, but flexible depending on discussion level?

*** Same here, I'd definitely read a weekly post from the sequence and comment on it.

** [[/r/VoluntaristLWbookclub]] used to be kind of like that, but everyone lost attention pretty quick. We should probably remove it from the sidebar.

** Neat! Ok, sounds like there's interest in a weekly something. I can try to make that happen. The next question would be....

What usually keeps your interest? What usually loses it?

The goal here, for me at least, isn't to have a good discussion, it's to /get through the sequences/. Discussion help with that. To that end, here's an idea:

OP should be a summary, then: a thing I don't understand and would like someone to explain, a thing I do understand and think I can explain, what you have to look forward to next week.

** Have fun!

I've found that with most philosophical or worldview texts, it's hard to get a lot out of a re-read unless you spend a good amount of time digesting in addition to reading. Make sure you give yourself a good amount of time to discuss and analyze the text to get the most out of this.

The first time I read Marx and Engels, I got a lot out of the experience. The second time I read their essays, most of my gains came from reading the essay, then sitting and thinking about it or writing my own analysis and reactions down. The actual read-through was very valuable, but only useful because it let me take a second, more in-depth and critical look at the work.

Make sure to draw lessons from other non-fiction rereads (like the GEB one on this sub) and other rereads of Yudkowsky's essays on other subs so that you get the best out of it.

** Might we want parts of Rationality: From AI to Zombies instead? I don't know the differences, but I'm under the impression that some articles in that are rewritten and better + other things not in the sequences. On the other hand, it misses things like Metaethics. Also, the sequences are easier because they're web articles, not chapters of an eBook, and thus has a lower starting cost.

I'm all for a daily thing, though. My readings of the sequences are very scattered.
