No, this isn't a new chapter a week earlier than expected. Sorry...

I wanted to discuss what plot points haven't yet been resolved in the book-often when a new chapter comes out it becomes apparent that an innocuous phrase 20 months ago was actually foreshadowing and everyone is like "Of course! How didn't we catch that?". Starting a centralised discussion about this stuff seems like a smart idea.

So, here is what I remember:

- Familiar bonds were mentioned, but Zorian still has no familiar

- Grey hunter was never killed

- Grey hunter eggs were never stolen and nothing was done with them(Silverlake/familiar bond/something else)

- Potion that gives soulsight was not discovered/made/used

- Zorian didn't contact the healer-empath

- Zorian didn't sign an apprenticeship contract with any battlemage

- Time research facility wasn't assaulted yet

- Zorian's brother never made an appearance(the powerful one)

- 3-eyed white wolf hasn't been killed yet

- Zorian still doesn't use firearms(except for that one time he shot RR), even though they were mentioned a bunch of times as a good anti-mage weapon and he even bought a rifle that one time

- Aranea treasury still hasn't been opened

- It was mentioned that Zorian doesn't wake up at the exact start of the time loop, and nothing came of it.

- Obvious stuff that will probably be adressed in the next update:Xvim, memory packet, Mansion and soul vacuum thingy, etc.

Thoughts?

Well, as of chapter 56, Zorian is learning about dimensionalism from Xvim. And they need to reach another continent. A working Bakora gate might do wonders for long-distance travel. Or he might just have to study the invaders' gate and see if it's possible to duplicate it.

** Without re-read I'm going to mention these as well:

- Mysterious girl that was in Zach's group with Neolu in restart zero was never mentioned. She may or may be not important... because Zach is a bit of man-whore. But then, restart 0, important.

- Bully expelled from Zorian's class is never mentioned again. He was from a Noble house and holds a grudge against academy. May be or may be not important.

- Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.

Of those you mentioned: Damien is an obvious Chekhov's gun. Important. (Or the biggest. Distraction. EVER!). Grey hunter and Siverlake obviously important, doable now, as Zorian has a golem army. Maybe Silverlake will help with soul well thingy.

Winter wolf Alpha could lead to winter shifter tribe side quest: shifters don't like winter wolves.

And I need a re-read to confirm that Zorian checked each and every of his 19 classmates.

****** Not that your necessarily wrong, but I'd point out that an intermediate period did exist where we had "muzzle loading" aka "cap and ball" percussion lock revolvers. The earliest Colt revolvers were all of this type and they saw extensive use in the US Civil War. So the existence of revolvers doesn't necessarily have to imply cartridges. That said I do seem to recall the description being cartridge based? I dunno is been a while since I've read that part.

******* Good point. Another thing to note is that we had cartriges for half a century before we had anything like assault rifles. The first lever actions were in the 1860s and saw some early use in the civil war. Then there were gatling guns that had to be towed around like cannon, the tommy gun was invented after WWI in 1928, but it wasn't until WWII with the StG44 and that we really saw full auto assault rifles.

I was kind of imagining The Mother Of Learning to be (stuck?) around 1870-something for mundane military tech, but it's also totally plausible that with magic around they might not follow the exact same order-of-inventions either.

*** To be honest we don't know for certain whether Zach does have such an enormous well of mana, only that Zach can cast magic missiles, flame throwers, etc many times without tiring himself.

His ability to repeatedly cast those spells without running dry can be explained by practicing with them so much that they're incredibly mana efficient by now. Zach has spent a ton of time fighting against the invaders and thus has had a lot of practice with those spells.

The same thing is happening with Zorian. He's become so proficient with magic missile that he can [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/46/Mother-of-Learning]["cast around 35 of them in quick succession"]].

We also know, at least according to Taiven, that the larger your reserves the less proficient you are with your shaping skills. We could assume that Zach is a freak of nature but it would make more sense if he was just an expert at casting magic missile that it barely consumes any mana for him.

Sort of explains why Taiven was adamant that no one could cost 200+ magic missiles without losing their ability to shape magic, when Zorian mentioned it in one of the earlier chapters. Apparently no one practices magic missile enough to be able to do such a thing while Zach has had all the time in the world to do so.

**** I don't think that Zach's magic missile mastery in chapter 8 is better than Zorian's in chapter 49 since there is no mention of his missiles being nearly invisible (like Zorian can make them). So assuming that by now Zorian is at half his max mana capacity, that would mean that he can cast magic missiles at half the cost he used to. If Zach has the same level of mastery, has twice the natural mana reserves of Zorian and has reached his max mana capacity he should be at about 160 missiles. Quite a bit short of 232, so I think there has to be more going on with his mana reserves.

The fact that two loopers have been mentioned as having higher than expected mana reserves (and the third is unknown) is really suspicious to me. Maybe the time loop also resets whatever eventually halts natural mana growth, or Zach has some special bloodline/and Zorian inherited a minor version of that.

Also, Taiven mentions that natural mana capacity growth does not interfere with control.

***** I think 232 is around the ballpark that you would expect Zach to be able to cast. Kyron's booklet mentioned that most people's maximum is 4 times the amount they started with. Unfortunately we don't know how much more efficient Zorian's magic missile is compared to when he started(since it would be a product of his skill and natural mana growth) but if we assume it's 4 times as efficient then normal people would be able to cast 16 times as many magic missiles than they could initially.

For Zach to accomplish 232 and if we assume the above is correct then Zach would have to start with the ability to cast 14 magic missiles in one sitting. If he was truly gifted and could cast 20-30 magic missiles then he wouldn't need as much proficiency as Zorian to achieve the same result.

The only problem I see with this explanation is that Taiven, who is apparently skilled in combat magic, is shocked at the suggestion that someone could cast 200 of them. Either no one in the entire kingdom has thought to practice magic missile as much as Zorian has(which I find unlikely since someone in the military would have wondered what the limit of magic missile in the hands of an average soldier would be or even a random person's curiosity) or Zorian has an unprecendented amount of control over his mana which I find just as unlikely.

After all if the average person's magic missile magnitude is ~40 (after maturing) then someone who has practiced with it as much as Zorian would be capable of throwing at least 100 of them, and I wouldn't be surprised if 160 was possible with someone who bothered to practice it just as much as Kyron did. After all Kyron's missile was good enough to be invisible implying that he wasn't wasting any mana to turn it visible instead.

****** We can estimate how much more efficient Zorian got at magic missiles: Zorian has been in the loop for a couple of years now, so I assumed that by now he had managed to double his mana capacity (I think I recall him have a capacity of 12 in one of the earlier chapters before he started grinding magic missile, up from 8). So since he can cast 35 magic missiles now, that means he would be casting at about half cost. So if Zach is similarly efficient and has hit his 4 times max mana capacity, that means his starting reserves were (232/2)/4=29. Which seems implausibly high (interpreting 8-12 is usually mana capacity to mean that average is 10 and sigma is 2 would mean that Zach is at 9-10 sigma)

***** I've been wondering for a while whether mana growth might be linked to physical growth, if we assume that physical maturity happens around the early 20's might that be when mana reserve growth stops? If that's the case then Zach and Zorian are both simply growing for much longer.

Especially Zach who's been aged 15 for well over a decade and has presumably been using lots of mana on a frequent basis (something that's mentioned as increasing mana growth) the growth would probably be both quick and continuing indefinitely so long as they stay in the loop and stay young.

My suspicion is that Silverlake figured out that Zorian is a time traveller (via casting some sort of powerful divination magic on him when she realized that he knew where her house was). Kael mentioned that there may be alternative ways to gain soul sight, and Silverlake is probably one of the best candidates in the story so far for knowing one of these (along with the lich and the mayor, neither seems hugely likely to talk).

Some things that point towards Silverlake knowing about the loop: She comments on how long it took Zorian to finds her ingredients (She was expecting him to find them very quickly since she expected him to have done the task before), she was paying attention to whether he possessed skills she would not expect him to have (traditional potion making as opposed to alchemy), and her having an immediate answer to the question of how to convince her the he is a time traveller.

As to why she wants him to get Grey hunter eggs: I suspect its an ingredient in the alternative soul sight potion. The fact that it would require Grey hunter eggs would explain why Kael wouldn't know about this method (since it is so hopelessly impractical that hardly anyone bothers teaching it).

Unless she is a looper, she knows Zorian milks her for knowledge and then never shows at her doorstep again, at least while the loop exists.

Silverlake doesn't need to be an altruist to help Zorian. I think Zorian spent several days searching for Silverlake's house. In that time Silverlake could have potentially found out a lot about the invasion/other stuff that is going on and decided that helping Zorian is in her best interest.

******* She has to /hint/ why she needs them. As of now, Zorian has Silverlake at the very bottom of his priority list: he (and the reader) knows nothing about what would be his reward for this quest, the quest is tiresome and he has much better, clearer options.

******** I was mildly surprised that Zorian never went back to Silverlake after that and tried to flush her out and then tell her about the grey hunter egg quest (which she "jokingly" suggested). It seems like it'd be worth a try. Similarly, bringing Kael with him as she knows him.

If he really isn't capable of finding her yet, I wonder if this loose thread will remain until/if he gets some sort of soul sight to detect her demesne- just a wild guess.

**** This is a world were divination magic is a thing. I assume she used some on Zorian and it gave a sufficiently strange result that it warranted a more thorough investigation. (Maybe she used the contact spell that spiders used to track that person with watch/wardbreaker and saw that Zorian was in contact with Kael. So she decided to check if Kael was OK, and then learnt that Kael had never met Zorian)

But I agree that he's incredibly ascetic to the point where it struck me as well; I guess a low sex drive plus body resetting every month plus being under pressure makes it plausible.

**** I don't think Kiana is very significant; he just thinks she's physically attractive, it goes no further than that.

Bear in mind that mage training involves disciplining one's mind, and Zorian has been doing a lot of training. And he's naturally a loner. So he may not have as much difficulty being single as one might assume.

Maybe because a) she turned him down, which still stings b) he'd consider it unethical to exploit the time loop to find out all about her for romantic reasons c) he has other priorities when he's actually in Cyoria.

** I was just doing a bit of a skim reread, and looked closely at the familiar bonds part. I am wondering if maybe the link between Zach and Zorian is much like the familiar bond, and that is what the foreshadowing is about.... Seems to be a lot of implicit and explicit mention of the similarities which makes me think that all the talk about familiars never had anything to do with Zorian getting a familiar and rather was just about him BEING a familiar (basically).
