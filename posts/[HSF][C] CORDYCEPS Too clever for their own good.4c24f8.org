** This is sort of amazing as a story, and just really a good read. Many horror elements. Bills itself as irrationalfic, for extremely obvious reasons if you read it. Writing quality is astounding. Story is amazing, thought provoking.

Found this while reading Nostalgebraist's tumblr, originally posted by tumblr user somnilogical. Edit for clarity: The author of this story is Benedict_SC, I just was mentioning the chain of users I found out about the story from.

**** Sorry if my post above was unclear. I found out about the existence of this fic because Nostalgebraist responded (positively) to a post on Tumblr about it. The origin of the post Nostalgebraist was responding to, which was just asking that people read the fic, was written by somnilogical. The writer of the story is indeed Benedict_SC.

** A very enjoyable read. Dramatic irony [[#s][doesn't get much better than]]

I think my favorite thing about this work is the complexity of each character's theory of mind, and the realistic failures to properly model one aspect or another. [[#s][e.g.]]

** I can't quite tell if this fic is rational or not... On one hand, both characters do actually take the time to think, something I see a lot in rational fics. And, when the perspective shifts, each character is shown to not only have distinctive personalities, but also distinctive minds (they think differently, and this is explored quite well), something I also see quite often in good rational fics. But I don't know enough about rationality to actually know if the characters (the main characters or the doctors) were acting rationally, or if they just thought they were...

*** I didn't really think of it on that level, actually- it was kind of in the back of my mind, but since the scenario was contrived to make it such that acquiring useful knowledge and reaching correct conclusions is a /bad/ thing, I'm not sure it would have helped if they'd used specific rationality techniques (hence the "Irrationalfic" tag.)

(I did write the two main characters to be /smart/, and some of that's going to be informed by my having read the Sequences, but I didn't actively work to double-check their logic and make sure they were really behaving optimally.)

** If you use a strict enough definition, it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant. Generally, my first thought when I hear the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is to recognize that the phrase is a trope. My second thought is to imagine a cartoon Dumbo. My third thought is to imagine an online photograph of an elephant. My fourth thought is, "it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant". If the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is interpreted to mean "don't think of any particular elephant", I have it very easy, since I don't actually know any elephants, and so I am perfectly safe from memetic infection. Naturally, this is the interpretation I favor.
