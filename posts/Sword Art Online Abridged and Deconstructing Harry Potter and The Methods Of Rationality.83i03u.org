Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality can perhaps be considered the first piece of Rational fan-fiction to gain mass popularity. Rational fiction is a variant of the traditional mary sue type fan-fic where instead of the setting moulding itself to fit the character and ensure his/her success, the character gains increased intelligence and scientific knowledge allowing them to predict and even counteract the course of the plot. HPMOR as its traditionally shortens is both incredibly popular and divisive with critics pointing to its bloat, ridiculous time-frame and alien behaviour as flaws while proponents arguing for its world building and expression

Sword Art Online Abridged or SAO:A as its commonly shortened is as you would expect a parody of the original Sword Art Online, An anime that can be accurately summed up as “Good Premise, Horrible Execution”. The premise is that a diabolical game developed has trapped 10,000 people inside a VR Demo(He claims to have forgotten his reason for doing so in the ending). SAO:A is attempts to salvage this premise using a mixture of explaining WTF is going on, editing out the filler and giving its main character real personality albeit one of “of the most unbearable assshole I have ever met” in the words of the first character interacting with him.

Outside of existing in the general sphere of “Nerd”(A category I would argue has long outlived its usefulness as should be discarded but that's an argument for another time)

Media, they might seem to have nothing do with each other but look deeper we can find some interesting parallels. A common thread found in criticism of HUMOR is that the Main character Harry(His Last name has been lengthened in the fanfic to the point that I'm just going to refer to him on a first name basis) is an egotistical narcissistic douche who uses his limited scientific knowledge to fuel an unjustified superiority complex and is never called out on his bullshit. SAO:A on the other hand explicitly gives its main characters the listed qualities and has its central arc be about the root causes of such an attitude and his corresponding shift away from them.

The trajectory of both this character over are eerily similar and parallels can be drawn, both are nerdy teenage social outcasts that posses extreme talent which they use to fuel a superiority complex. They both possess a misanthropic attitude towards others showing great resentment towards those that they perceive to be less intelligent than them him and they seek out friendships with other character possessing similar superiority complexes no matter their morality with one of Kirito few initial friends being Tiffany a scammer who exploits the nativity of new players to scam them of their money while Harry's first wizarding ally is an aristocratic pre-teen who makes rape threats against those who defame him.

Anime is an inherently explorative medium meaning that it forces us to see a character through the lenses of somebody else while Literature is a descriptive medium forcing us to view a situation through somebody's eyes. HPMOR is shown through the eyes of Harry and being a philosophical thesis mixed into a novel has its character behave in nonsensical ways to push the author's pet ideology(Nothing wrong with adding philosophy to media, hell most classical literature is classical because of that fact but it does get in the way of sensible story telling). “Machiavellian Schemers” like Dumbledore and Voldemort under a paper-thin disguise entangle “him in their web of lies”, SAO:A, however, has to give us the reason behind our character becoming involved in the events that unfold often mocking the stranger aspects of the original as shown by the original quote. We see Kirito being clearly manipulated by others rather than having to infer it from isolated events hidden among a dozen chapters of bloat. The shift in this perspective is key reason that SAO:A can be viewed as a deconstruction of the rational genre as it shows us just how the character archetypes would fare outside their purpose built worlds.

Secondary characters are also parallel and deconstructed, Asuna who shift into the main character towards the end of SAO:A is a more functional sociopath who hides her inner personality with an outwardly friendly charm. She is initially presented like Hermione Granger in HPMOR as a genius who lacks knowledge of how things really work, Hermione lacks knowledge of the real world as is overly book smart while Asuna poses natural instinct for the game. Their arcs progress in a similar pattern as both characters are infuriated with the main character who comes to realize their brilliance and worthiness. Harry comes to see Hermione as representative of hope and optimism given her uncompromising stand as he is manipulated by Voldemort with a wig. Asuna takes a similar place in Kiriots life through manipulation deconstructing the idea of an intelligent female love interest for our protagonist to charm using his intellect

Aincrad and Hogwarts are urban fantasy settings ie setting with fantastical elements located in a world very similar to our own. Hogwarts in HPMOR is a secret society HQ masquerading as a school filled with cunning intrigue between Dumbledore and Voldemort wearing a nanometer-thin disguise and primary conflicts arise from there game of cat and mouse as they attempt to convert students to their own cause. Aincrad is a buggy game world created by a sleep-deprived maniac who think the government is run by “Flubar, King of the Mole People” who traps 10,000 people in the game to avoid getting bad reviews due to his game being a bug-ridden mess. The idea that conflict springs out of pure stupidity and hubris of a singular individual is quite antithetical to the central theme of HPMOR which is that “Great People” must move society forwards by whatever means possible so that they may bring upon techno-rapture to end all suffering

In summary, Sword Art Online Abridged may have set out to parody and fix Sword art online but in the processes most likely without even intending it, Something Witty Entertainment has managed to create the perfect deconstruction of so-called Rational Fiction by exposing how the characters act outside the confines of a world tailored towards their every quirk. This essay might seem like the fever dream of somebody who is sick and tired of writing essays about “A Doll's House” and overanalyzing every single plot element but I hope you at least see the outline of my argument here.

I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][we read two different fanfics]]. Harry's mistakes are constantly pointed out by the narrative and other characters, and (imperfectly) struggling with his arrogance is a major part of his character arc that has real consequences.

The parallels to HPMOR outlined here don't really match up with my experience of the story, to be honest, and I think they're tenuous at best. That said SAO:A is a fantastic Abridged series that does a great job of deconstructing the original by making it more clever and the characters more nuanced (much the same way HPMOR does) and I encourage everyone who hasn't seen it to check it out, even if you never watched the original SAO show.

Be extremely grateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in restricted form!

  "But you have given me well-meant advice," said Severus Snape, "and so I will give you true advice in return." His voice was almost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly horizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by a million tons of tension pulling at either end. "You almost died today, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone unless you know exactly what you are both talking about."

  "Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"

  "Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, "Malfoy."

  He should've remembered that promise to Hermione before going to Azkaban.

  Why had he decided to do that, again?

  /My working hypothesis is that you're stupid,/ said Hufflepuff.

  /That is not a useful fault analysis/, thought Harry.

  /If you want a little more detail, said Hufflepuff, the Defense Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!' and you were like 'Okay!'/

  The frustration was building up inside her again. "It's my life!" Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to her objections.

one moment that DOES do this I think is when Harry and Hermione are experimenting trying to create glowing bats, and Harry's overconfidence blindsides him. More humbling moments like this might help.

Each word in that sentence is a link to a different HPMoR chapter, in which Harry called out on his attitude by (respectively) the Sorting Hat, Neville Longbottom, Professor McGonagall, Professor Quirrell, Professor Snape/Lesath Lestrange/Neville Longbottom (yes, this is a three-for-one), Hermione, /himself/, himself /again/, Mad-Eye Moody, and himself one more time--and that's only the links I could get to fit inside of a single sentence. (Incidentally, Dumbledore is actually one of the characters who criticizes Harry the /least/.)

Seriously, can we stop doing this thing where people show up to criticize HPMoR while making it pretty clear that /they did not at all pay attention while reading the story/? This case is extra embarrassing because of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][the handy compilation of failures Harry suffered in the story]] that was linked /in the very comment you replied to/, but which you apparently felt was beneath you to click on.

***** I last read the story fully about a year ago and only skimmed over it before writing my essay given its length I'm sure that's forgivable. Objectively yes Harry does suffer from failure in the story the problem is the way those failures are treated.

It's never treated as an actual character failing but rather a villain that must be overcome most explicitly with the "dark side" plot device which is one of the laziest attempts at adding depth to a character I've ever come across. Harry is always able to either refute or overcome the criticism through the weakness of those condemnations. McGonagall engages in the incredibly weak line of attack about how he doesn't need to worry about something that could be trivially refuted. Professor Quirrell calls him out as looking insincere, fake and being insufficiently manipulative while only Hermione calls him our on his superiority complex which only brings him low a single time and results in no shift of his attiude

The only people in the story that know about Harry's Dark Side are Quirrel, Hermione, and Dumbledore, and there are plenty of people who criticize him for things completely unrelated to it, and times he criticizes himself for things unrelated to it, as I and others have now demonstrated.

#+begin_quote
  and results in no shift of his attitude
#+end_quote

You are literally complaining about the character having a flaw that's treated as his overall major arc for growth. And it /does/ shift, in small ways throughout the story, but most importantly and completely at the end of the story, which is where it should:

#+begin_quote
  "You know," Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at Harry, "I had a conversation like this with Professor Quirrell, once, about being a hero. He was taking the other side, of course. But apart from that, this is feeling like when he argued with me, somehow."

  Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own decisions was hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the wrong ones, but it still had to be done.
#+end_quote

Learning not to be manipulative, even in a situation where he knows more than Hermione does and has goals for her that she can't be made aware of, is a shift in his attitude that directly results from the experiences he had throughout the story.

In this community we value people being able to admit their mistakes and learn from them. I would like to gently suggest to you that you take a moment to reflect on whether you actually know what you're talking about when you continue to make arguments that I and others can disprove in minutes by citing the source material.

You don't have to like HPMOR. Not everyone in this sub does, believe it or not. But your criticisms of it are showing that you have not read it as closely as someone should when they attempt to analyze a piece of fiction beyond the generic level.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Okay, let's back up a little bit: what does it mean, in your view, for something to be treated as an "actual character failing"?

Suppose you mean that Harry never fails in a way that causes /later shifts in his character/. This is demonstrably false: for example, after being called out by Professor Snape on his tendency to make judgments without being given all the information (chapter 27), Harry /does in fact start requesting information more often/ (which is demonstrated very obviously in chapters 37, 86, and 108, among others).

But maybe that's not what you mean? Perhaps instead what you mean by "actual character failing" is that Harry never fails in a way that leads to /plot-relevant consequences/. If this is what you mean, then it is /also/ false: breaking Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban led to enormously far-reaching consequences, and pretty much set the course for the entire second half of the story.

There's this thing people often do when their position is untenable, where they deliberately use vague descriptions in an effort to make their positions as difficult to attack as possible. They reject any attempts to pin down their definitions, because a definition made concrete is a definition that can be falsified. And I'm being blunt here, but it seems to me that this is exactly what you are doing. So, before we go any further on this, could we please settle on a set of common definitions?

******* I think his general point is probably that the /story/ itself never seems to condemn it, namely, it perpetually sounds like the narrator fundamentally sides with Harry, forgiving his mistakes as minor, understandable failings, even when they're catastrophically wrong (like breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban, which frankly I felt stretched a bit my suspension of disbelief in how easily Harry agreed). Which it sort of does, but then again, it's pretty reasonable, and it's not like Harry doesn't suffer consequences or learn from those mistakes, as you said. It's one of the reasons why I found that "Significant Digits" is somewhat complementary to HPMOR - it shows "the other side", gives us more of other people's points of view, around Harry, and in general makes more compelling arguments for alternative ways of thinking and acting than his alone.

****** despite the downvote brigade here, and also inspite of the fact that I love HPMOR (enough to have a tattoo of it!) - I understand and agree with your underlying point.

Harry's failings are largely attributed to his inexperience, his lack of self control, or not being smart or machiavellian enough to WIN. Often, his "dark side" is more successful and gets what it wants, with few negative consequences.

Your concern, I think, is that harry's sense of superiority and exceptionalism is not ultimately challegend or punished. He IS better than everyone else, he is smarter and more successful, and in the end he wins because of, not in spite of, these traits.

Fundamentally, reactions to this fall into two camps: people who identify with that sense of superiority, and people who are put off by it.

you will find a lot of the former in this sub, and on reddit in general. This sub is ALL ABOUT feeling superior because of things like being more intelligent and rational than others. and attacking harry's superiority and ego is akin to attacking the reader's superiority and ego; hence to negative responses.

It's not as binary as you portray it - Learning to Lose, for instance, is a good example of harry's temper being called out, and there are other places his compassion is appealed to.

But it could be considered a moral blind spot of the work that, at the end of the day, it is the superior intelligence and rationality of an individual that matters.

and this isn't even in keeping with the way real science works. Science is about collaboration and building on the work of others, not single handedly discovering the inner nature of dementors in a flash of insight without any evidence, reason, or experimentation.

HPMOR would be improved by increasing emphasis on empathy, collaboration, and the hard work of improving ourselves and the world -- which, come to think of it, Significant Digits did a fair bit of.

In general, this whole thing feels like a huge reach to compare two extremely different works.

Also, maybe you misunderstand what a superiority complex is? I don't think Harry has one in HPMOR. Perhaps you mean to say that he is supercilious, it's not quite the same thing.

Maybe Kirito does in SOA:A, or maybe he's just a deranged parody of a character who pivots personallity scene by scene for comedic effect. That's basically why a comparison of SOA:A to anything is invalid, its just like, a joke, man.

** The main problem here is, of course, that rational fiction isn't "a variant of the traditional mary sue type fan-fic..." et cetera. There isn't a single agreed-upon definition, but I favour [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6gd97l/meta_the_definition_of_rt/dippn6n/][this one]]. In short, rational fiction is fiction featuring characters who rigorously pursue their goals --- as opposed to most "normal" fiction, in which intelligence, motives, and character personalities could all be overridden in favour of whatever plot the author wants to enforce or whatever theme they want to explore.

As such, SAO:A isn't a deconstruction of rational fiction, neither it is a deconstruction of ratinal/ist/ fiction (it would be something closer to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/Cordyceps/]], except not really). It is arguably an example of rational fiction. Is it a deconstruction of rationalist fix-fics? I... don't think so either, SAO:A!Kirito isn't really a rationalist or a fixer.

If you define "a rationalist" as "an egotistical narcissistic douche who uses his limited scientific knowledge to fuel an unjustified superiority complex", then sure you're right, but, well, it doesn't /really/ have anything to do with rational fiction as we define it or even HPMoR.

I would say there's a thin line that is basically one of suspension of disbelief, because since people in real life /aren't/ 100% rational, stupid or counterproductive decisions in a story can be justified, even when they're convenient for the plot, as somewhat realistic, but only if they don't push it too far. For example something that I feel could well fall under the name of rational fiction is Fullmetal Alchemist: no one's some bastion of rationality like Rational!Harry is, even Edward Elric, for all his cleverness, is stubborn, hot headed and impulsive, but overall it's all always consistent with established traits, and the plot and the actions of the characters click together like a puzzle, leaving a very satisfying picture of something that feels believable and makes sense within its own rules, without renouncing being emotional or having strong themes.

Harry isn't perfectly rational -- actually, far from it. A perfectly rational character would recognize the value of social skills and that even pretending to submit is a useful tool.

Harry is an imperfect copy of Voldemort into a younger body, paired with a lot of Muggle science education. He's borderline sociopathic and definitely disassociative -- enough so to partition his sociopathy into a separate "dark side" that he uses as a tool but tries to keep locked away. As such, it's hardly surprising that he's arrogant and unpleasant.

So what I meant was mostly that no character in FMA is a champion of rationality, even Ed, despite being a scientist and all, won't go around lecturing people about it, he's far less cold and more human than Harry and isn't too bothered by it. Still, I felt the story qualifies well as rational due to how finely it is crafted with regards to worldbuilding and attention to coherence.

  I've got my English Exams coming up[,] and[,] after getting sick of reading through a "A Doll's House" for the 100th time, I decided to instead write an essay about some novel piece of fiction as practice. I'm wondering [whether] you guys also see the connection between SAO:A and how rational[-]fic characters would function outside their setting[s.]

** As it has been said already, the idea that the story never calls out Harry on his flaws is bullshit and a belief that always seems to persist no matter how many direct quotes are used to refute it. Harry has a distinct character arc from start to finish, a lot of the final arc is Harry wondering how the fuck he could've be so blind and stupid this whole time, and the final chapter has even more of that when Harry has to be magically prevented from making a mistake that probably would've ended the world because he didn't want to think about the reasons he couldn't save as many lives as possible. Almost the entire story is from Harry's perspective, and he obviously does not have a clear view on his personality flaws, is quite good at rationalizing afterwards, and is more controlled by his biases than he thinks.

Both of these are stories I really like and have gone through several times, and only a few parts of this post ring true to me. They possess more structural/characterization differences than your central premise can really handle before it starts to break apart. I had a lot more written about the specifics of this, but in summary, several of the connections are thin, or in some cases just wrong, and a fair bit of its persuasiveness is dependent on whether the reader also has the same deeply uncharitable view of both Methods and rational fiction as a whole. Also, tread carefully when using the lens of "deconstruction", it is a word that has a tendency to get whipped out whenever any story deviates from standard genre story beats.

I wish Yud would do a sort of post-mortem or sequel from another POV as a true rational/explicitly pedagogical story.

  (He claims to have forgotten his reason for doing so in the ending)

No he doesn't. He states quite clearly that he wanted the world he imagined to be real so that he forced people to act like it was.

I suspect this is one of those random fandom memes that people come up with and spread around so much that the original gets buried. Picking this as the final potshot of the abridged series was always a downer for me (the original webnovel introduces characters based on fantasy archetyps, Asuna is literally introduced as being like an elf, there is no shortage of worthy material but in the end they went with a line that translates poorly and that just means "I no longer feel as driven").
