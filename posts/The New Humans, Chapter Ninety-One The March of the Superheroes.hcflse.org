I don't know how many folks here have managed to work all the way through /The New Humans/ backlog, but I'm excited to share the last chapter of /This Hollow Season/, our third volume. Turned out more topical than I expected, /mostly/ by accident.

Me and my editor William Rave are both eager for any input or critque on this chapter and the rest of the third volume, and we look forward to beginning work on the fourth and last volume: /The Utopians/.

But first, an intermission... it's us-speak for "interlude".


** Great story, looking forward to Myriad ruling a city.

** Hey, reaching out for a bit of advice here. Does anyone know of some genuinely amazing natural landscapes or features on Earth, they would be experiencing daylight during nighttime on the East Australian coast. Also, has to be broadly safe for a baseline human child. As in, they wouldn't die instantly. Swimmable water would be nice, too.

*** Pretty much any spot in North or South America could work. There's enough coastline you could claim a private beach, just use a world clock to check times and use estimate for sunset depending on season. If you want something like a hidden gem, you could use somewhere like Hamilton Pool, Dripping Springs, Texas where it is a cave lake/pond with its own little “beach”
