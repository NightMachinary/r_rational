*** Maybe he accidentally wrote his wife out of existence instead of Thamiel?

If that's it, talk about poor aim.

****** All names are the name of god, and it was once believed that the mortal name killed the user if they were unholy and the story is fractal. The parallels between robin and ana are ever so slightly there, and arron litterally says he wants to be the comet king which ana responded that, that's a bad idea; tck seems to have died of a broken heart or disappeared, not form his war with hell and robin is very much not around.

****** Clearly the goal is to get someone who loves Thamiel the most to speak it, which would require someone very unusual. They'd need to be both especially virtuous, extending love to everyone, and especially wicked, to be able to love Thamiel.

Bush's “HELLLPPP...HELL...” was hinting at this, since helping hell really is the key to it all.
