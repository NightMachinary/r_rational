Obviously I don't want art that is rationalist. But I've recently acquired an item that is in clear need of something to be painted on it. Being generally uncreative, I wouldn't mind some links to art that has rationalist/transhumanist/computery themes.

When in doubt, I'll probably just try and get something dresden codak-ey.


** in strong female protagonist (a webcomic), lisa's lab is full of transhumanist-themed artwork. examples [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-55/][here]], [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-56-2/][here]], [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-59-2/][here]], and [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-61-2/][here]]

and dresden codak-y sounds good, hob especially is beautiful.

I already get accused of being a satanist every few years. Although I'm not sure those people would get the reference...

** Beware of transhumanist art that has it's roots in groups from the 90s... for some reason I've noticed there is a massive bias of 'OMG WE HAVE ANY ART AT ALL?! IT MUST BE GOOD' and it really is not.

like on the actual scales of evaluating art and aesthetic it's mediocre and occasionally clever at best (Orion's arm I am glaring judgmentally at you)
