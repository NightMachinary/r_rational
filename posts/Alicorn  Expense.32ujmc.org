** I'd have gone with someone suicidal or at least horribly mentally ill. They deserve a life as much as anyone, but theirs isn't any good. And since the immortal isn't going to get the mental problems, it doesn't matter.

If you're going to steal a car and give it a new paint job, you might as well steal the one that has terrible paint.

** I think he could've argued a little more in his own favor. He didn't even try to suggest her taking a coma patient. Also, for all that I can't understand it, not everyone who's suicidal is necessarily mentally ill (granted, the vast majority is, but still...), so it shouldn't be impossible to find someone willing to sell their life away.

*** u/Roxolan:
#+begin_quote
  taking a coma patient.
#+end_quote

We don't know everything about the mind transfer; it's possible that a coma patient would stay in a coma.

(It's also possible, depending on whether the superpower came with a user manual, that she doesn't know and doesn't want to take that chance.)

Also consider that all coma patients are monitored (else they would be dead). /Someone/ is going to notice that the body is missing, or that the patient had a literally miraculous recovery.

Suicidals should work though.
