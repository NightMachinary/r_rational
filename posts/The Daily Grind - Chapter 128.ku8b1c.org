** A bit too deus ex machina for me. Makes it seem like the purpose of the chapter was just to de-clutter the list of characters and tie up loose ends.

*** I agree with the 'deus ex machina' diagnosis, and I'm not sure it was necessary or good. There really didn't seem to be a reason for the way the situation resolved itself, other than the narrative benefit of completely ending Status Quo as an entity in the story.

Anyway...

The mechanics behind an infomorph killing an organization are a bit odd. There are at a minimum two mechanisms and a justification needed for Secret doing what Secret did:

1. Mechanism of target identification: I'm going to borrow the term P-Space from Worth the Candle, defined as a conceptual plane where raw concepts are located. Status Quo exists as a concept that points to and is referenced by its members. Therefore the concept of Status Quo is a mechanism by which its members can be targeted by an infomorphic entity, under the assumption that infomorphs can interact with / exist in P-Space.

2. Mechanism of death: A mind wipe, including the memory / ability to breathe. Patients suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease can die from this, so sure.

3. Justification for Secret's ability to utilize these mechanisms: This is where it gets weird. We can either assume Secret's ability to interact with P-secret (the concept of secrets in a metaphysical sense) allows it to interact with P-secret-'Status Quo' (Status Quo being /secret/ organization provides leverage). Or we can assume that infomorphs in general have the ability to interact with P-space unfettered and simply lack the motivation to do so outside of their nature. For example, under this second assumption, the Debt infomorph from earlier in the series would technically be able to perform Secret's same feat, despite no clear P-debt mechanism existing, simply by powering up in some fashion and choosing to infoeat Status Quo + members.

I like the idea of infomorphs, but not the physical manifestation aspects or the whole super saiyan thing Secret did in this chapter to power up and kill a bunch of people. Seems excessive and difficult to justify.
