** Ah, title drop huh.

The sudden shift in scene from the librarian telling Nic to follow her and then into the cafeteria was bit weird, I feel like a mention of her showing Nic the book would be better before one of those scene break marks and then the cafeteria scene. Would probably require minor changes for the bed scene, probably just having Nic mention the paper with his notes from the book

This confused me too. I had to go back and read it again to check if I had unconsciously skipped a paragraph. I think it would flow better if there was something there to bridge the gap, however minor.

Really liking the story so far.

** Beautiful closing paragraph. Things were shaky for a couple of chapters there, but I'm really liking where this is going.
