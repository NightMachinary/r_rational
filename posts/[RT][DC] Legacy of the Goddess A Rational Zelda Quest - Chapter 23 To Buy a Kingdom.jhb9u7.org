This chapter was retroactively inserted between Chapter 22.2 and the previous Chapter 23.

As mentioned previously we have moved back to SV. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.72138/page-6#post-17755738][Come join us in the SV thread for discussion!]]


** Note: There's also a new [[https://discord.gg/7TeHZUU][discord]] shared with MFD (and possibly other future projects). Most of the discourse tends to happen there, incidentally.

** Is there a way to read the old version of the first chapters/mechanics? And/or the discussion that lead to changing the system?
