I keep checking [[/r/rational]] and it's so quiet without the tri(++) updates on one of my favorite stories. It's going to be a long month.

** Could anyone give me a motivational kick to finish Book 1?

I liked the start and Catherine's introduction (can-do orphans who find their own agency in the world is a recipe for success), but the petty Squire spats and tacky Dread sovereign quotes starting every chapter really grinded my interest down before the nail in the coffin, Catherine's stilted entry into her company and war game. Bookmarked ever since and collecting dust, but PGTE is pretty popular here so maybe someone can extol its forthcoming virtues if I just soldier on?

*** I don't think you share the author's sense of humor, some of the parts you've mentioned were the highlights of the books. The war game was one of my favorite parts in the series.

I don't think you'll find some revelation down the road that justifies slogging through if you don't already enjoy the hook.

*** Copying from another comment:

Book 1 is definitely the weakest entry in my opinion. The stakes basically go down after the Summerholm thing transitions to the war college. Book 2 is significantly better, [totally free of wargames for example] so I'd recommend at least that much, although if you don't like it either that's probably a good time to quit, since 3 and what we have of 4 are comparable to that.

Basically the end of Book 1 is probably the weakest stretch of the whole thing, so if you liked the beginning I do think you'll enjoy where it starts to pick up, in Book 2.

*** I like it for the worldbuilding, mostly. Also, the protagonist going from fuck-up to fuck-up yet getting the better deal at the end is like watching a 30 car pileup with miraculously no injuries. The banter is also pretty funny sometimes, reminds me of Hollywood action flicks.

The epigraphs are hit or miss, but there's some gems in there.

*** I thought 2 was really good, definitely better than 1. 1 seemed like it ticked a bunch of YA boxes just to tick them. On the other hand I also burned out about halfway through 3 and lost all motivation; I thought there was a pretty clear decline in EE's writing when they were forced to move to triweekly updates. I caught myself skimming through chapters paragraphs at a time enough that I just asked myself, "why am I reading this at all?"

If you are slogging through book 1 I'd say try to give it a finish. It ends on a high note as far as I can remember. However, if you don't even like the funny little epigraphs then it probably just isn't for you. They're the essence of the story in a microcosm.

*** I thoroughly enjoy it, highlight of the stories I read that are updated on a schedule (rather than 'when it's ready'). That said, what I like might not be what you do. If you're not enjoying a story, you don't have to read it just because other people think it's good.

**** I'm not saying I have to read it or that I read anything because others think it's good. But if it's popular here on [[/r/rational]], then I expect some enthusiastic reader can make a good case for why PGTE is more than the superficial flaws that bothered me in Book 1.

***** Didn't hate the wargame, but didn't love her reaction when she experiences some of the fallout of her (quite cold) decision to let the lone swordsman go. It's a bit raw at that point, but in retrospect, reading more, she's a bit more tolerable after she settles into her pattern of making dubious compromises for the greater good. She is, after all, a villain...she just needs a little more time to ungrow.

In short, I dropped the fic around where you're reading, but apparently for other reasons, but now find it quite palatable, especially as the story expands, the stable of (unstable) characters develops, and Foundling settles into her persona a little more. If, after great characters like Apprentice and Archer are introduced, you still find it's not for you, then so be it.

****** you should probably fix your spoiler tag (remove the spaces at either end)

although that does sound pretty dope. I put down PGTE for much the same reason as the OP but maybe I can chug through knowing a scene like that is ahead... hm

*** When rereading the fic, the war college lept out at me as the weakest section. I dont think it was as bad reading it "in real time", but it is definitely lacking when reading the section as a block.

*** I think other have provided good answers, but as for a motivational kick, the best characters in the story arrive in Book 2. We start character arcs of many side characters in Book 2. And the top notch banter gets better in each book. Book one is setup for characters and plot, and only really pays off in (short term) plot.

If you liked the scene where Cat meets Heiress, there are lots more political intrigue scenes to enjoy. If you liked the scene where Robber names things, there's LOTS more of that to enjoy.

If you think you can learn to love the practical pettiness that is Cat, you can learn to love the story.

*** I started twice, and stopped, and the third time was the charm for me. Early on, it seemed too, I dunno...generic. It took a bit to grow an attachment to the characters involved, and for it to feel archetypal, rather than generic. Once I got past that, I was hooked.

I think it's common for authors to improve as they continue writing, so you end up with a fair number that have a rough patch at the start. The quotes don't stop, mind you, so if they're a real mood killer for you, that might not help...but over time, the story does become more fulfilling.

** I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but I'm almost glad he took a break. I've been reading PGtE religiously for the last couple /months/ and every time I finish a chunk, he goes on to publish /another/ chunk! I want to comment on the badassery but I can't post on the update threads!
