Seems appropriate based on the last book.

edit: Goddamnit.


** Insane headcanon/lunatic ship: Cait proposes to Cordelia sucessfully and everyone is shocked into the crusade becoming unfucked. PoV is just the Seer watching it in all tenses simultaneously and giggling like a loon and giving the Bard the bird.

Not stupid prediction: interlude from one of the white knight's surviving team or Papenheim.

**** Hakram is Cat's true bro to such a degree he got a name out of it.

On the other hand, cordelia and cat are both extremely eligible bachelorettes willing to make personal sacrifice to benefit their people, are getting hassled about marriage, like biting their thumb at those sort of people, and are already basically conducting a secret correspondence of deeply personal matters.

** What I think EE will give us? Black chapter. FTW.

What I actually want? Le Warlock running into Le Dead King on his way out of hell. Yep, totally worth an interlude.
