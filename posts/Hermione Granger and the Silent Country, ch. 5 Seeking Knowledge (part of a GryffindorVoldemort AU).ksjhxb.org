The latest chapter, "Seeking Knowledge," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/69917787][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** No questions answered, many more raised.

Unanswered questions:

- What is studied in Dark Arts?

- What does punishment at Hogwarts entail?

- What is happening to the vanished muggle children?

- Why was Hermione invited to the tournament?

Probably some others.

New questions:

- What are the Death Eaters actually up to now, besides enforcing the revolution?

- What value does a different admittedly terrible potions master have to Riddle?

- How does the Basilisk play chess? (My guess is it really is the Basilisk playing, with Riddle just translating and acting as a go-between)

#+end_quote

Might be that it's less about the Potions professor position and more about giving Lucius a role where he's appropriately contained/rewarded. IIRC, McGonagall says his actions were what let the Death Eaters win.

**** I'm going to take the criticism from Lucius's teenage son (and obvs bias best friend) with a grain of salt. Overbearing and unusually driven whilst trying and failing to create the same drive in his students is still more effort than too many teachers I've had.

I mean he helps the students who are struggling, he caters his approach to each student's abilities, he even (if misguidely in approach) tries to involve the parents in their kids education. That's not terrible, especially when the canon potions master is literally Neville's Boggart fear because he is so vile.

Saying he is frightfully mismatched with the younger levels and those not interested at all in potions would be reasonable though.

** It's interesting to see all of the different friendships from canon. Malfoy being friends with Tonks isn't something I would have called, even without the hostility between Andromeda and the rest of the Black family for being a "blood traitor." Neville, either.

Speaking of Neville, it's nice to see him thriving in Potions class when he isn't bullied into terror.

I need that as a poster for my wall.

Very nice turn of phrase.

#+begin_quote
  *Rules of the Hogwarts Library*
#+end_quote

All very sensible, although it's missing any description of punishment for violations (although the penalty for breaking the "damage" rule should, of course, be "slow and painful death")

#+begin_quote
  Ten books was a normal, reasonable amount to borrow, wasn't it?
#+end_quote

Absolutely, Hermione!

#+begin_quote
  /Unity is Strength/
#+end_quote

...Reminds me of Lewis Prothero:

#+begin_quote
  Strength through Unity\\
  Unity through Faith\\
  Good guys win, bad guys lose\\
  And, as always, England prevails.
#+end_quote

Although perhaps "Magic" should replace "Faith."

I can totally see Lucius Malfoy as a complete by-the-book, well-organized, perfectionist potions master, contrasted with Snape's snide, "throw you into the water to see if you can swim" style.

#+begin_quote
  I'm never going to stay in those caves forever, but I'm always going to go back.
#+end_quote

An interesting metaphor.

#+begin_quote
  neither Hermione nor Bathilda Bagshot could quite figure out the logistics that made this possible. The bloody thing didn't even have hands. How was it supposed to write letters?
#+end_quote

Quick Quotes Quill, with an additional charm to translate from Parseltongue to English? It doesn't seem as complicated as they're making it.

#+begin_quote
  We just watch the portraits talk to each other.
#+end_quote

That mostly sounds awkward, treating private conversation as a spectator sport.

#+begin_quote
  F, U, Þ, A, R, and K are the first six runes of Futhark
#+end_quote

Huh. TIL. I've heard of Futhark before, but didn't know why it was called that.

Do people know it can speak? As opposed to listening to commands

Also if it was that easy to translate languages especially parseltongue you'd expect some use somewhere

Still it also doesn't seem insanely complicated to figure out a number of solutions

**** Right. Another option could be a chessboard with a protean charm (like the Dumbledore's Army galleons) to transmit the moves. I don't think that's bidirectional, but that would just mean you'd need two of them.

Or use a mirror like the one Sirius gave to Harry; just make sure the one on the Basilisk side is pointed right at the board to prevent petrification.

Wizarding Britain is not lacking ways to communicate things.

***** The basilisk is (reportedly) playing correspondence chess: Riddle comes out of the Chamber of Secrets with a letter (in his own handwriting), which he claims to have been dictated by the basilisk. He owls this to whoever is (supposed to be) playing the basilisk, then eventually receives a letter back and (says that he) delivers it to the basilisk.

Some people think this is ludicrous and that Riddle is just fucking with everyone, because the idea of Riddle sitting idly by and taking dictation for a giant chess-playing snake with killer eyeballs is just bonkers.

I definitely have to rewrite this passage to make some aspects of it clearer, lol.

****** Yes, absolutely, it's immediately obvious that any solution that actually accomplishes the goal of "allow a basilisk to play chess" is going to be ludicrous in some way, and a waste of some sort of resource that they really could put to better use (in this case, Riddle's time).

I just don't see how that is in any way unusual for the Wizarding world at large. Leaving aside a whole category of absurdities that constitutes the sport of Quidditch, this is a place which is able to create entire hidden neighborhoods and train platforms behind walls that Muggles can't find their way through without help, and yet chooses to have people flush themselves down a toilet to enter the Ministry of Magic. Where the proposed solution to having a werewolf attend school was to build an indestructible shack in the nearby village, run a secret passage to that shack from the school grounds, and plant a pugilist tree to guard the entrance to the secret passage. Where the appropriate response to an undelivered letter is to send increasing numbers of that letter in ways that increasingly threaten the Statute of Secrecy, rather than just sending a liaison after the first one fails to arrive. Where the school song for Hogwarts has lyrics but no melody, so everyone just sings the words to any melody they choose.

A snake playing chess just seems like an odd thing to find unbelievable; I don't get how anyone would distinguish it from the generic background absurdity of the setting.

******* Eh, half-baked thinking here, but all those examples are wizards doing things. Wizards in magical Britain already have enough discrimination and dismissal against magical races and such weaved into their thinking. People finding out a basilisk is just as intelligent as they are, judging by its chess abilities, when most folks would have thought of it as as smart as a snake beforehand is going to spin some heads.

****** I think the people who think this is bonkers are stupid. There are /plenty/ of excellent reasons to cultivate a good relationship with an 800 year old murder snake with at least human intelligence and death laser eyes, particularly when you're the only one who can talk to her.

Amazing fic, so good in so many ways. The magic is analysed and consistent, same for the people, same for the world-building.

Really a great find!

** I wonder how notable it is that "Volume XLIX of /The Collected Correspondence and Commentaries of Nicolas Flamel/" was checked out for the summer, considering the plot of the first Harry Potter book. Is Riddle still trying to track down the stone?

Also, maybe the basilisk is using the giant chessboard to play. I know canonically it was made by McGonagall, but I wouldn't put it past a bit of canon convergence resulting in Riddle making one for it and also making it respond to Parseltongue. Alternatively if it's really good at chess (or at visualization) it could be memorizing the positions, or using its own time control and responding quickly when Riddle comes to visit to make it a fair fight with children. The world is magical, and it's an intensely magical creature, the question of how the basilisk can be playing without hands is maybe the most perplexing thing they could ask.
