** "After Dark" was an ME3 fan fiction begun last year as a NaNoWriMo project; in the end submitted to fanfiction.net. As such it was a novel-length derivative work, dealing with the aftermath of the only ending where the protagonist had a future.

It was deposted after a year and a day (there was another author's fanfic sharing the same title) and reposted as eight separate novellas. The story as a whole was retitled "Gone with the Sun".

Endeavours to rationalize the fantastic, even where that is in the game (eg. the dream sequences), and follows the hard science fiction rule of ONE impossibility being allowed (FTL).

** It's a bit heavy on the WWII history but very entertaining,[edit] in a military porn way [/edit] and with a more competent ending. Is the author a USNA Grad by any chance, or just a naval history buff, and maybe a nuke?
