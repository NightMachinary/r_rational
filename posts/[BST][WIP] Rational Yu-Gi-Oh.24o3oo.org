My ultimate goal in writing this is to make someone try to explain to someone else "Hey, there's this James Bond/Yugioh crossover fanfiction called License to Duel BUT WAIT it's actually good!" and not be able to convince anyone.

+I will keep the spoilers mild. I'll just say slightly more than will be revealed by the end of the first "act".+ Just redacted pretty much all of it so there can be more reader puzzles.

I've watched a lot of Yugioh, and believe it or not, there's a good story in there somewhere. I'm going to make a more or less minimal set of changes to make Yugioh into a good story.

Mostly it's going to be Bond thrown into the Yugioh world rather than the other way around. To be completely honest, the main reason he's in the story is because I like the title so much, but the story is at an early enough stage that I'm sure I can find a compelling reason for him to be there and good stuff for him to do.

[REDACTED]

Cons: I have no idea how the actual card game works except from what I've seen and I kind of like that.

Any feedback/munchkinism/plot holes you can tell me are very welcome.

***** It was originally going to be a comedy/spoof, but I decided to make it more serious and try to make it actually good, which would be even funnier than any joke I could make inside the story.

Besides, if you've seen as much "so bad it's good" as I have, you can tell when someone's trying to force it and it just isn't as good.

How the card game works: The first thing you should know it that it doesn't. The game doesn't work.

You know how they printed it as a physical card game? The show breaks the rules at least once per episode, usually more. Cards have More Powers As the Plot Demands, and Yami/Yugi has the canon superpower that his deck is always stacked exactly how he needs it to be (That's what "the heart of the cards" is. No, seriously, that's /exactly/ what it is.), so his /deck/ also has More Powers As the Plot Demands. Later seasons (once they stopped following Yugi) mostly started following rules, but even those are essentially made up as they go along.

*** I've seen all of original, all of GX, and half of 5Ds. I meant that I don't know how Yugioh works. Duel Monsters works mostly by bullshitting. I kind of like the fact that everything I know about the game I learned just from watching the show so I basically know nothing.

**** If you're serious about this, I recommend learning how the real game works and using it in your fic instead of the bullshit strategies they use in the show. Learn concepts like [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_advantage][card advantage]], [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_advantage][hand advantage]], [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Nomi][nomi monsters]], removal, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1c3tko/all_returning_duelists_a_catch_up_synopsis/][metagame]], etc... and familiarize yourself with [[http://www.pojo.com/Yu-Gi-Oh/COTD/index.shtml][notable cards]] and basic deck types ([[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Beatdown_Deck][beatdown]], [[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Burn_Deck][burn]], etc...). There's a lot of rationality concepts you can portray, as well (decision making under uncertainty, muchnkinism, empiricism, etc...).

***** I guess I'll have to. There are two main problems. First, I don't want to have to throw in a filler arc just to introduce the basic strategies with weak pushover characters, and I don't want the existing characters to be weak, but I can't just start with the super advanced stuff. Second, after the first arc it mostly stops making sense to have the card game at all. If Pegasus's Duel Monsters is based on Shadow Game Duel Monsters then it might make sense, but there would have to be some sort of explanation of why the latter even exists as a game with rules and turns and "cards".

I'll also have to carefully record my own thoughts and beginner mistakes as I go so I don't make the characters too right too fast. It's hard to simulate realistic reasoning when you know the answer. It's too easy to just make them say "Oh, obviously P /= NP because [proof].".

Maybe write a separate prequel in which Bond learns how to duel in preparation for this assignment? That way, readers who already know the game (or don't care to learn about it) can just read the main story; everyone else can read the prequel for an intro.

******* I think I'll start a bit before the story starts in the anime and do a few duels with Yugi's classmates. It would break the mood to show Bond not being incredibly competent at everything he does.

**** Oh, the card game doesn't work much better than the show. There's a three-copy limit on cards, except for Exodia pieces and some other things pretty much at random, which are limited to one each. All monster cards have a star rating (1-9, I think? They may have added higher star ratings recently), and to summon high-star monsters you have to sacrifice other monsters from play; sometimes specific ones (fusion monsters require two specific ones in play and also a spell card, though I think there are a couple choices for the spell card, ritual monsters require a ritual spell card and usually some specific cards in play), non-special high-star monsters just require generic monsters sacrificed. There is rarely any reason to play any monster with fewer than 5 stars, because monsters with more stars are usually strictly better than lower-star monsters and 5 is the highest you get before you start needing to sacrifice guys.

Spells have no balancing factor whatsoever, last I checked (most of this info is a couple years out of date, but according to a friend who doesn't play but follows the game for laughs, the basics haven't changed). Power creep is blatant and no attempts to avoid it have even been attempted (though Blue Eyes White Dragon still has the highest attack power of ordinary monsters, IIRC. That doesn't make it good, but it is the biggest.)

Oh, and how cards interact is done ad-hoc and probably depends on the whims of whoever is in charge where you're playing.

As you may have guessed from the kinds of things I took issue with, I'm a Magic player, though I did briefly play Yu-Gi-Oh years ago. It offends my sense of game aesthetics. (I'm also a game designer, so this sense is more highly developed than is normal, possibly more than is healthy.)

***** Interesting. I knew about the 3 card limit. There are massively overpowered cards in the game. The most overpowered one I know of is Ishizu's Crush Virus which swaps both players' decks with their removed from play pile or something like that.

Worst-case scenario I can just rewrite the entire game from scratch. I'm sure that won't be at all too difficult and won't make me burn out.

****** If you do rewrite it, I suggest making it work roughly like [[http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/][Hearthstone]], only with more zeros added after every number and no class restrictions. Hearthstone isn't great design, but it's a solid framework. And since Hearthstone is free to play (and not particularly exploitative, either), you can play enough of it to get a sense of what that means without spending money.

Also, it's pretty similar in some important respects; you only play effects on your own turn, with some triggered Secrets which act exactly like Trap Cards, you attack specific monsters rather than an attack/block structure, and there are significant limitations on how much you can have on the field at once.

******* I will look into that. It might be not-too-impossible to merge them.

Fuck that. I had forgotten how much I hate blizzard. They locked my account for daring to attempt to play the map editor with my proxy on and I can't unlock it because apparently they're too good to send a confirmation email to your email address to reset the password and they won't even accept the registration key for SC2 that I have from my physical copy. This from the company that made a game that took me literally eleven hours to update the last time I successfully played.

Maybe I'll just reteach myself MTG and +combine+ polymerize with that.

** I intend to make it structurally both a Yugioh arc and a Bond movie. It will fulfill the tropes of both in a satisfying way. There will be a Bond James Bond, there will be a shaken not stirred, there will be a chase scene, there will be a Bond girl or two, there will be ridiculous feats and gadgets, there will be spy stuff, saying the title, a big villain speech, friendship, card games, mysterious ancient egyptian stuff, and more.

[REDACTED]

I intend to start the story with Yugi tagging along with his grandfather on an excavation, somehow getting separated, finding the puzzle, and Yami sort of trying to kill him to test whether he is worthy of claiming the Puzzle. Yami doesn't tell Yugi the puzzle gives invincibility, so it's more of a test of courage.

*** My only question is: who's the protagonist, Yugi or Bond? Who gets more focus? And if it's a mix of both, is it Yugi and Bond together, or what? I can't see Bond as much of a father figure for... anyone, actually.

**** They're going to working independently for the first arc without much interaction. In the second arc, Bond will be doing investigation stuff and helping with the civil war while Yugi primarily deals with fighting the shadow realm monsters. I certainly don't see Bond as a father figure. I'm thinking they'll be mostly ally-ish.

It'll be more focused on Yugi. Bond is a dead end in terms of character development. He has to stay archetypal in order to still be Bond. Honestly it would be a lot easier to just get rid of Bond and have it just be Yugioh, but, then I couldn't justify calling it "License to Duel" and I love the title as is. Maybe if I just sit down one weekend and marathon 6-7 Bond movies some more ideas of how to use him will come to me.
