** I try to read this in relatively large chunks, as that makes the pacing seem much more reasonable (for me at least). The last chapter I read, they were trying to break the dungeon core, I think? Can anyone who is current advise on whether or not this would be a good place to read up to? The chapter name seems promising.

*** 136 dropped on Patreon and seems to be more or less the start of another arc, so yeah 2 months

*** Yes, I would recommend this chapter. If you want to get a bigger chunk I would say next good point would be in (patreon spoiler) about 2 months

*** It's hard to answer without spoilers. Personally, if I were following the strategy, I'd have thought 127 a better break point. I definitely believe other people will disagree though.

*** No, I don't think so. Though better than any other recent chapters.

*** Late but I would say either 128 or 135 are good "stopping points".
