It was a story about a girl, who seemed fairly rational. Her dead father was a rationalist and left her some books. A boy tries to ask her out, and she promptly asks if "he wants to fuck her". Not because she's offering, but because she segue's into talking about how that's the main drive behind his request, even if he doesn't know/admit it.

She descends into bad life choices and drug use, however, but what's compelling is she seems rational, to her self, as she progresses. I believe it ends with her being pretty coked up, but still believing she's making a rational decisions.

It wasn't very long, and it was presented in a series of journal-like entries. Anyone got any idea what story this was?
