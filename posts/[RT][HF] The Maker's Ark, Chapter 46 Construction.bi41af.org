** Back to the main serial after a long bout of rewrite/re-edit-itis. The description of Doc's helmet is a bit of bonus horror for readers familiar with control theory, and can be safely read as techno-babble by everyone else. Since it's been so long since the last regular chapter, I included a link in the intro to the last chapter on Earth (Chapter 43), for those who want to refresh their memories. Enjoy!

*** I have starting material for least three short stories, a probable novella, and a couple of sub-plot seeds for the next book just in the material I ended up cutting from this chapter because, although cool, it did not advance the plot enough. But you will probably eventually get to see some of Learning's interactions with the Primly Certain (one of the ships still in Earth orbit) and a bit about the Grs'thnk philosophy for warship AIs (They really, really want to avoid anything that might want to become a Berserker or deathbot.)

** 100% minor typo, but it looks like one of the hazard alert notice IDs is missing a value:

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
      Subsystem hazard alert notice 008153867929:  Action–defer.
      Subsystem maintenance alert notice 0081538627930:  Action–defer.
  #+end_example
#+end_quote

The first has one less digit than all of the others, looks like it should be 00815386*2*7929 rather than 008153867929

*** You are correct! Well spotted, I will fix that (Flicker's alert notice system is working fine, the typo was all my fault) Edit: Should be fixed now.

** I like the story but a lot of the mental state babble goes over my head and it seems there are hundreds of issues that are need to be addressed which tends to sap the tension of the scenes as they way they are treated seems very alien,everyone is an expert. talking about things is good but having some i feel like i need to have a diagram to understand what the issue with some characters would b nice to have some show of whats the problem. Also Flicker's harem seems to keep growing despite the fact she has many problems with here current relationships seems like a coping mechanism. I feel like the stories getting very anime.with the current plot-line of the alien relief it seems the rest of earth has very little say in things as they are a more advanced race who know better and there ideas need to be implemented n earth .it all seems like the fears of mutants and supers controlling the world as a ruling class are starting to be realised. I relay like the story but it seems like things could easily get out of hand
