** Weren't the release dates changed to Tuesday and Thursday?

Is this a day late, or am I messed up with my days?

Anyway. This was the some of the exposition dump I've been expecting since the incredibly long time skip. The next couple chapters will probably be some more exposition dump.

*** Practically speaking Friday now (unless you're awake late). Threw me off as well, was refreshing on Thursday feeling sad.
