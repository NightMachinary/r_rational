So, the original trigger to go after Fel Seed was the U.S.A military uniform found in the Glassy Fields, Juniper theorizing that since he hadn't found any sign of Long Stairs in Aerb despite it being one of their DnD group's major campaigns (+ some other narrative related evidence they later got from Perisev) that the Long Stairs were the dimensional portal that came after Fel Seed. And that it would lead to Uther and possibly Earth.

Now, one thing I didn't fully understand while reading the story as it was released, was the hurry that Juniper seemed to be in to go at Fel Seed. In chapter 221, there are some justifications given, like the fact that he wanted to try while they still had Gold Magic, and that Fel Seed cheats, so any amount of preparation that they do would be moot (which did turn out to be true).

But in the very next chapter, he lost Gold Magic, yet they still kept to the original plan of just blindly rushing Fel Seed, despite not exactly having any extreme impending threats within the next few months. The following dialogue is the only one I found that even contemplates the hurry they are in -

“'I know,' I said. 'But that's where Uther is, and if we're going to bring this thing to a close, we have to go there sooner or later. If we don't, I'm worried about the kinds of threats we'll see.'” (ch.227)

Now, I find this decision to be weird because of two aspects of the story -

1. Juniper considers the DM to be an asshole but still somewhat competent. And competent DMs would not hesitate to slap down an underprepared party, especially if they took on the final boss when there was content left uncovered, and if the party was not at endgame level.

2. The group were trying to go past the supposed last boss of the entire world. Narratively there was no way they would be allowed to just "bypass" the final boss that the DM set up for them, so it's weird to me that "going past the last boss" was even a core part of the plan.

Another unresolved question so far, was how far Amaryllis' idea of "narrative" applied in the real world. Until now, the DM had worked behind the scenes for the most part, with justifications for major events that the characters run into having placed into the world beforehand.

But as of chapter 236, Fel Seed was resolved via DM fiat, and DM confirms that it was the only way to defeat Fel Seed. This opens a whole can of worms which had already been partially opened in Chapter 215, which is the fact that no one knows what objective reality looks like, and how much the "narrative" theory of Amaryllis applies to Aerb.

Very Crucial Question to ask after the recent chapter : Would the strategy of Mome Rath bone + cloning of Vorpal Blade + Toad Locus assistance(?) have worked in the previous run if they had prepared all of it + maybe more?

If this was Yes (which is very likely to not be the case) then the hurry they were in seems to be pointless. As, if they had waited and prepared more, they could have very likely killed him without Juniper having to go through hell.

The Actual Answer is of course : No. Fel Seed cheats, so no matter what happened or how much they prepared for the first run, they would not have been able to beat him. And this + DM's words confirm that Aerb runs on Narrativium as well. If that was the case, then the first attempt at Fel Seed without a prayer to the DM (as discussed in ch. 228, Fel Seed has no weaknesses) or sufficient preparedness was extremely ill-advised, which is a rare departure from the party's previous ventures.

This answer of course, also breaks the world and the reader's investment in it quite a bit. This is a battle that requires direct DM involvement to resolve (even if Juniper prayed to him before the first run and the answer was "No", that would still be the DM railroading them towards his preferred outcome). The ambiguous actions and "slight nudges" that the DM has taken so far are in the past, and with this resolution the DM is now firmly set up as an Omnipotent entity who directly controls all of Aerb and possibly all of Earth as well.

DM's will trumps everything else, Juniper will only go along the paths that the DM prefers, and perhaps it always has been that way.

--------------

This of course, very clearly implies that the DM is actually the Author Himself, and the point of the entire story is an elongated DnD session + therapy for Juniper (whoever he is) to get over his past issues. /s


** IIRC the reasoning behind the rush to the end was based on two things. First, they were hitting diminishing returns on power ups. Juniper had all the magics available to him capped, level ups weren't going to get his caps high enough to get to any boons, and they had entads coming out their ears. Yeah, there's always more sidequests to do, but the party wasn't going to win or lose based on a few points in STR.

Second and more importantly, another year or two spent on grinding would have consequences. Exclusions and entad losses which could leave them at a net power loss, but also a year or two of crises thrown at them. Things were going to be bad for the world at large. People would die. Probably not party members, but civilians. Cities.

At the end of the day, they knew they would either win or lose by the whim of the DM. The DM said lose. Can't out-grind a dick DM, so might as well lose quick and try to pick up the pieces afterwards.

As an aside, my personal read is that the plan they used wouldn't have worked the first time. The bit that some people are reading as toad assistance where Fel Seed can't dodge like he thinks he should isn't weird locus magic, it's Fel trying to activate his cheaty powers and them not working because the DM has turned them off.

Even so, they did have to put significant effort in preparing to face Fel Seed. If they had not done that, the DM might have slapped them down /really/ hard (as in TPK, including Bethel) and then it really would have been game over.

**** Not the previous poster, but no, Juniper requesting a fair fight would not have worked. The DM almost explicitly said as much in hell. Recall the DM asked Juniper if, in the Earth!FelSeed encounter Juniper would have shown mercy to his players, and Juniper answered that Juniper wouldn't have shown mercy due to his emotional state at the time.

The only way to beat Fel Seed on Earth would be for Juniper-as-DM to resolve his emotional issues; there was nothing in-game that could beat Earth!FelSeed. Earth!FelSeed could only be beaten on the meta-level by Juniper himself fixing his own emotional trauma. (More on this later.)

In my opinion, that's why the DM "revealed" that he hates Juniper, in order to draw a parallel between Juniper's relationship with his players and the DM's relationship with Juniper. We're past the point at which in-game combat matters, and into the part where the characters' relationships with themselves and each other matter. The transition is shown by them beating the Final Combat, the combat so difficult it cannot be beaten by combat. It's then reinforced by the fact that they have (two!) Vorpal Blade(s), a sword so powerful it trivializes all combat encounters.

In my opinion Aerb is [[http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html][The Egg]], a place created with Juniper's consent for him to resolve his emotional trauma.

  “No,” I said. “Or ... maybe. Between things with Fel Seed, the Dungeon Master, the hells, and before that, Invriezen, and the locus, I've been thinking about gods a lot. About how I would do things in an ethical way. I'm thinking of opt-in danger, like there is in video games, some amount of risk and pain for people who want it that way. So maybe, if we both opted into that, then I, as a benevolent god, would have contrived circumstances so that both of us would have been stuck together in such a way that we both had a chance to learn and grow.”
#+end_quote

If the DM really hated Joon, he wouldn't have purged his memory of whatever Fel Seed did to him. It kind of points towards this whole story being one of those opt-in situations. Thus, the conversation at the beginning of the story ("Rule Zero") is that consent.

If that was the case, then would that not be railroading by the DM at that point? Either towards Juniper's own death, or a TPK. Which implies that this was always going to be the intended end for Juniper, and that any character actions, entads, preparations, levelups etc. until that point did not matter in-story. It firmly casts in stone that the DM is controlling whatever happens to Juniper to get him to this (his preferred) ending. No agency.

Also, the hell arc was a very short time, and Juniper obviously hasn't changed much from Hellfall until his escape. If the FS encounter is supposed to be the DM showing a mirror to Juniper, nothing really changed between the first and second encounters.

Yes. That's how the Fel Seed incident went in the real world too. The DM's behavior is a manifestation of Juniper's time as a DM. Every quirk, belief, and idea he had got thrown in, plus a few more. Played as he would have played them. Fel Seed was the conclusion of Juniper's DM career, and what destroyed his group back on Earth. It's only fitting it destroys him as well. The removal of the game interface symbolizes that this isn't a game anymore. Punches won't be pulled, or artificially enhanced anymore. Full verisimilitude.

They could have figured out his intent and opt out; they could have embarrassed or bullied him such that it didn't feel like a cathartic power fantasy; they might have been able to take his mind off of things by exposing him to positive emotions. Just abandon the conceit that you're in the DM's world and have to follow his rules.

Which is kind of hard when you're actually a person in the DM's world and the DM can just tune you out or throw arbitrary distractions at you, and when you don't know the DM's motivations.

** Re: your conclusion about Narrative:

One thing to keep in mind is that while Fel Seed cheats, that's /his/ gimmick. Others don't cheat means other encounters weren't at the DM's whim. We always knew the DM had the /power/ to railroad everything, the application of that power in the case of Fel Seed isn't necessarily evidence of a will to use it in other contexts.

I don't fully understand the implications of Joon's loss of the interface, but one thing it signals, I think, is that the campaign is over. If the willing suspension of disbelief per Aerb's simulationism is over too, well, that may be entirely the point.

Not that if I had absolute editorial powers right now, I wouldn't want to use them to request changes (a longer Hells arc, leaving Juniper in a fix while we shoot back up to Amaryllis, more detail and coolness factor out of Joon's new magics pre-Fel Seed attempt#1, overall more time spent inside Joon's head wondering at things), but the story hasn't ended yet, we have no idea how the elements that we have in front of us will combine together to create payoffs or achieve the thing which AW has almost certainly had in mind since he started writing this.

Personally, I don't think so. The entire point of Fel Seed was to mimic Earth!Juniper's Fel Seed, which was designed as unbeatable within context of the session, because June felt like being an asshole. And then the point is, if June had gotten a chance to do things differently, he would've given the party the ability to win. This would somewhat involve retconning Fel Seed' OP-ness but it's not really a typical ret con in context of story; it's just June "redeeming" himself and being nicer to the players because June's growth as a person is kind of the point of a lot of this, from my perspective.

Fel Seed's defeat condition was, and always has been, "die to me first and earn your victory on the second run". I don't think the second run could've just had the party walk up and hit him with a pool noodle because then that would also ruin the point of the session. But I do think the scales were heavily tipped in the party's favor narratively on Try #2 and that they probably could've chosen 1 out of any 10,000 solutions that required them trying hard honestly and they would've gotten the dub.

***** So in the context of the story, the DM was railroading Juniper towards dying or having a TPK when fighting against Fel Seed?

On a story level that completely removes player agency though. That implies that whatever they did previously, no matter what level they got, no matter what entads they got, they were still going to get beaten the first time around.

And if this was obvious in text (chapter 228 does heavily imply it), then why did the party hurry to Long Stairs in Round 1 without any solid plan other than "let's wing it and hope DM is in a good mood" (a huge departure compared to previous fights)? Why not create a strategy around dying, why not attempt to Schloss a way out of the hells beforehand, why not base your entire strategy around dying to Fel Seed after a "fair fight" and coming back for a second round?

****** Because Juniper didn't know the DM was railroading him towards death (if that is in fact what happened). In fact, during the walk up to Fel Seed's palace we see Juniper thinking and hoping that they'd pull a win somehow, that the DM's lesson was going to be “hey, here's what that session should have been like!” or that if they didn't try to fight Fel Seed, they somehow could avoid it entirely (this was mostly wishful thinking). Now, until the DM reveal exactly his designs, we can only speculate, but I don't think it removes player agency if there's one particular plot beat that the DM absolutely wants to happen, no matter what, how the player will react to it still matters.

****** I'm not saying the party necessarily knew this; I'm saying hindsight and the Dice guy convo makes it clear that this was the win condition. We've seen several instances where Aerb exactly mirrored June's life and instances where it departed heavily. The party did seem to suspect it was unlikely they'd be able to just breeze by but they tried to as it was the best solution they could find and, when that failed, they used every trick they had basically in an attempt to win and it was only luck (read: author fiat) that kept it from being a team kill because actually ending the story wasn't the point of Fel Seed, in addition to the locus acting as the crucial element that led to the party being able to escape.

Whether it removes player agency is a matter of some debate. Personally, I don't think it does. Narrative is a clear and present force; some challenges the system will just not let you win. Arthur most certainly failed in his attempt to live a quiet theatre boy life due to the DM railroading him. But that doesn't mean he didn't have his own will and actions, which was the whole reason his theatre boy plot line ever even started. Sometimes life will change something completely beyond your grasp; I don't think this inherently means your agency is gone though I suppose it can be argued that it is diminished

** I think this is undercut by the fact that the DM isn't competent in the sense that he's built the world as a place for the players/characters to have fun, learn, grow, etc. He's built it for his own amusement/edification, and Arthur and Joon were basically NPCs from his point of view. It's why he was so upset and frustrated when Arthur wasn't taking up the Call to Adventure that the DM was offering. If he had wanted Aerb to be just a fun campaign for Arthur, he would have simply rolled with Arthur wanting to play a bard/theater troupe story and gone with it. Forcing him to become an action hero was because that's what the /DM/ wanted, and he gets some gratification from the fact that his MC is a real, thinking person dancing in the palm of his hand.

This is why, IMO, he hates Juniper. Juniper flatly refuses to play the game and follow the Narrative as if he were a character in the story at any level. From basically the start, Joon has been playing Aerb as a pseudo-DM/game designer rather than a player, dissecting the systems thinking about why the DM set up the world and how he would do it differently. The DM hates this because he wants people to play /his/ game, and Joon just keeps saying, "Yeah, but your game is stupid".

They decided to rush at Fel Seed since by that point they realized they weren't playing the game against Aerb, they were playing against the DM, with Joon increasingly annoyed at being forced into playing by the DM's rules and Mary increasingly worried that this would lead to a direct confrontation with the DM that they'd inevitably lose.

The confrontation with Fel Seed essentially became that confrontation, with Joon trying to see if he could just force his way past the DM's systems and the DM asserting that he has absolute power, but that he no longer has any interest in playing with Joon or trying to force him into Narrative like he did with Arthur since Joon would just bitch and complain about it the whole time. So, the DM smacks Joon down, declares the campaign over, and walks away, hence Joon losing the UI layer and becoming essentially no longer being the main character of the story - just a super-powered dude bumbling around Aerb at his leisure.

Same here. To me, it seems more like the DM is.. an older, alternative-timeline Joon who never learned to fully like himself.

When he says he wanted to see Joon suffer, at least a bit, and hated him.. that's like depression talking.

**** Eh, I think he says "I hate you more than I care about you" or something to that effect, which to me implies that he views Joon as having a negative effect on other things he cares about more than Joon. If he is in some way a projection of Joon-as-DM, then Joon's need to exercise control and influence over campaigns and maintain DnD sessions as his essential safe-space in a life he didn't much enjoy otherwise could be manifesting in the DM as a value system totally wrapped up in Aerb or other created worlds.

Joon is an existential threat to that norm, or like a bobcat that's stuck in your garage. You probably don't care about the bobcat itself in any meaningful way, but you might hate it because of the damage you think it's likely to do to the things that you do care about in your garage.

**** Yeah, I think there are two possibilities regarding the DM now:

1. He's genuinely over-and-done with Joon and is essentially just letting him play in sandbox mode, without setting explicit quests or targets, and is just gonna sit back and let Joon do whatever with Aerb before rolling up his next world or whatever

2. He's double-faking Joon, pretending he's no longer involved/interested just so Joon stops trying to play "against" him and does something interesting with Aerb rather than trying to constantly circumvent the Narrative.

If I understood the timelines correctly, the DM and Joon's conversation takes place after the 3-year timeskip, when the DM can be reasonably sure that Mary will rescue him from Hell, so his attitude in that conversation of "this is the end of the line and I'm not gonna be paying attention to you anymore" doesn't make much sense unless he's either deceiving Joon or just so genuinely frustrated at the way Joon approaches Aerb that he's walking away, not buffing Fel Seed cause he doesn't care to try and teach Joon anything, and just gonna let the chips fall where they may.

** Separately, I do feel some dissatisfaction with Joon's rush to Fel Seed, and feel that it would be less of an issue if there weren't remaining quests/level-up opportunities left hanging. Maybe Joon being in that state of just being done playing the Aerb campaign is really important and this couldn't be removed. But unless so, perhaps with the Void Beast lurching toward Aerb and seemingly nothing below FS in difficulty left in front of them, the decision to go there instead of allowing their hesitancy to be punished would make more sense. We /did/ get Joon clearing out a bunch of low hanging fruit with Gold, and part of that, I guess, lead to the discovery that Long Stairs connects to Earth, which interrupted clearing out quests with gold and, I suppose, you could argue was the DM hinting for them to take the path they did.

*** It's also partially because the outcome of the first fight seems to be DM railroaded. Like no matter what the party did before then, June or the party would've still died. It's even lampshaded in ch. 238, and I feel the party (being intelligent characters) knew this on some level.

If that was the case, I just can't seem to understand why they didn't plan for failure or death. The p-space analysis could've been done while June was still alive, and they could've set up the Hell-escape before going for the fight.

I don't think you can plan around that.

Important, also, is to remember it didn't take 3 years to come up with and enact the plan for death - they waited 3 years looking for Joon before taking actions that would get Rune excluded.

As far as planning for failure goes, they would have gained nothing from doing so, not that we even know Mary didn't have one of her clones working on it in the background.

** Something I haven't seen brought up is that if I was a DM and my players' characters got obsessed with narrative when I hadn't intended that, I'd be pretty annoyed. It's immersion breaking, after all.

Now, it's hard to say whether or not it was intended by the DM - I believe the two things that set the party down that path was Juniper recognizing tropes and the discovery that Uther also believed in narrative. They might have been allowed to find out about Uther's belief in narrative, or railroaded into it. I don't think the DM would railroad Juniper's thoughts. But what I wonder is, did the party make the narrative elements stronger by obsessing about them? As in, the DM sees that they've figured out they're in a narrative and won't let it go, so now he has to create a whole narrative about narrative, except he makes it brutal because he doesn't like that he had to do this. I guess this could apply to both Uther and Juniper.

I don't know if this makes sense, I'd have to reread most of the story to get a better idea. Along these lines, I think the Dice Guy and the actual DM/entity controlling the world might be different.

  “'I know,' I said. 'But that's where Uther is, and if we're going to bring this thing to a close, we have to go there sooner or later. If we don't, I'm worried about the kinds of threats we'll see.'” (ch.227)
#+end_quote

This is why they're in a hurry. "The DM will destroy the world if we don't do X" is a very powerful reason to do X.

In-game this comment is actually the culmination of a many conversations where they discuss how applicable narrative theory is to Aerb, and it's the one where they decide the narrative is the driving force and that they need to play along. It's not, "we decide on a whim," it's "we argue about it for a million words and finally come to a conclusion."

Out-of-game, the author has posted elsewhere about the difficulty in balancing the narrative tension between the joys of wrapping-up and the risks of getting bogged in boring grindy power leveling. (Some of this conversation happens in-story as well.)

​

#+begin_quote
  Now, I find this decision to be weird because of two aspects of the story -

  Juniper considers the DM to be an asshole but still somewhat competent. And competent DMs would not hesitate to slap down an underprepared party, especially if they took on the final boss when there was content left uncovered, and if the party was not at endgame level.
#+end_quote

The characters explicitly state that they're (1) at the point of diminishing returns on quest completion, (2) reaching the limits of potential increase in power, both personal and entad, and (3) already the most powerful entities on the planet other than Fel Seed.

They grind out half a dozen world bosses in one chapter. They are 95% as prepared as they can be: they've literally maxxed-out Joon's character sheet, there are no more new magics to get. Getting the last 5% would be boring to the DM, and more importantly boring to us readers, so the author needs to generate an excuse to rush things. (The player/Joon/DM vs reader/author parallels are an intentional part of the story.) Personally I think Alexander is right -- I don't want more completionist wrap-up, I want to see where the story is going.

The rush is also to generate a feeling of time pressure, to make things feel dangerous and important.

​

#+begin_quote

  1. The group were trying to go past the supposed last boss of the entire world. Narratively there was no way they would be allowed to just "bypass" the final boss that the DM set up for them, so it's weird to me that "going past the last boss" was even a core part of the plan.
#+end_quote

Except that's what happened. The whole point of the Fel Seed fight is that Fel Seed can't be beaten by any in-game actions of the characters. Fel Seed can only be beaten at the meta-level by changing the relationship of the characters with the DM, and the DM's relationship with himself. The Aerb!FS fight is the parallel for the Earth!FS fight; it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people.

There's no in-game power that would let the Earth!Players beat Earth!FS, or Aerb!Characters beat Aerb!FS. The only thing that causes either Fel Seed to be beaten is Joon's development as a person.

That only "tells" the viewer though. After Juniper acquired Gold Magic there haven't been any proportional threats other than the Dragon Fights, and after that there hasn't been further escalation (other than the call of the Gold). Raven also implies that the Dragons won't get involved further after Perisev's death. And after the Gold Magic loss, there hasn't been any immediate threat in front of them.

Remember that in-story it took 3 years for things to get worse and even then, the worst parts were due to Valencia's open approach to hell and Amaryllis detonating a rune-bomb and excluding rune magic (both due to the party's direct action).

Heavily implies that the pacing of the adventure was for the most part within the party's control.

Mome Rath's bone and Onion's sword were the key aspects of defeating Fel Seed during this run, both of which they didn't have in the previous fight, which somewhat undercuts this.

Yes. The DM explicitly stated that they were guaranteed to fail the first time around. While the DM isn't 100% reliable as a narrator, I think this is true because the point of Aerb!FS is it mirrors Earth!FS, and Earth!FS was not beatable in-game.

I do think the characters understood that Fel Seed was unbeatable. It's shown in how Joon talks about Fel Seed breaking the rules due to "bullshit" and similar.

/Everything/ isn't resolved through DM fiat. You're viewing this as too black and white. In normal D&D, the DM /can/ resolve everything by fiat, but usually they /don't/. There's dice, and collaboration, and interplay.

You might as well ask "what's the point of D&D when the DM can resolve everything by DM fiat?" It's the same question, but more clearly confused. The answer is, of course, people play D&D because the players and DM enjoy the experience, even though the DM /could/ resolve everything by fiat.

That issue of consent is central to D&D, and it's central to Aerb. Joon has already been shown to have consented to play in Aerb. I think in the end it'll be shown that Joon consented to all this (including railroading via Fel Seed) because it'll be a growth experience for him.

That does seem to be where we're heading huh... that this was all just a "dream" or a simulated "experience" for Juniper to undergo some character development. Maybe it was real, as far as he was concerned, but from an objective view, probably one of the two.

And if that is the case, more than anything, the identity of the DM becomes central to the story, as he is the one who has set the whole thing up and selected Juniper and Arthur as "players" of this "game".

Just from what I've read of the story so far and the comments interpreting it, there are a few ways this can go -

- DM is the Author himself.

If yes, this will have been just one elaborate DnD session that the Author has set up for the "players". "Who is Juniper then?", and other questions would be opened up, but that level of surrealism is difficult to imagine from this side of the screen. Has an equal chance of explaining the whole thing neatly or crashing and burning under it's own meta-weight.

- DM is future Juniper.

Time travel shenanigans abound here, and without a satisfactory explanation, would probably be a crash and burn timeline.

- DM is Arthur?

Would be very weird. Maybe he became DM after going through Long Stairs and inherited the previous DM's memories? Very low possibility of this timeline.

- DM is someone Juniper knows (Craig, or Colin, or anyone of their party members).

This is probably the most likely outcome I can think of at this point. This would explain why the DM "hates" him and wants him to change. Would open up questions about how some random dude in Bumblefuck, Kansas became a God, but I guess that wouldn't really need to be explained in too much detail (an adventure for another time I suppose). And this would also tie in the plot to the characters of the story rather than some omniscient entity doing it all for fun and games.

You understand that Narrative Theory has essentially been proven at this point? The DM appeared, said, "you couldn't win because I hate you," then sent Joon to hell. That's proof positive that Narrative Theory is correct.

Saying "if you're thinking narratively, then you can expect escalation" in Aerb is like saying, "if you believe in gravity, then you can expect things to fall when you drop them." Thinking narratively is the only valid method of interpreting the facts at hand. If you fail to think narratively, you will be confused because you're missing a major driver of how the story unfolds.

There are a handful of named world-level threats waiting in the wings: The Void Beast, the Other Side, infernal unification, and more. It's pretty trivial for the party to receive notice that the Other Side is banging on the wall holding them out. To say nothing of arbitrary problems like "random mad scientist causes rune magic exclusion."

But again, you're looking at this backwards, even if they were running out of threats, which they aren't. In a world without a DM, running out of threats means time to relax. In a world with a DM and a Narrative, running out of threats means it's time to face the world boss. Most important of all, running out of threats in a story means its time to face the world boss, because reading about characters getting another +1 skill up is boring. Facing Fel Seed is the only thing the characters could do from any analysis that takes into account that there are two ongoing narratives driving the plot.

Though the rest of the party did get out, it was a very close thing, they should have been prepared (though maybe only the locus could trump fel seed in getting them out). At the very least, they should have already thought of a way to ensure joon goes to hell instead of oblivion, already had a basic list of avenues to pursue to rescue him, and maybe even try to go for more levels so that, if not to help against fel seed, help the party via twinned souls + symbiosis (most likely avenue is using joon + grak to finish the 13 horrors quest (though I don't remember if fel seed is included on that. if it is, then that's kinda moot, though clearing EZ'S still gets XP).

No they aren't exactly 'items' but the magic is in general as creative as wtc if not more.

Criticizing creativity is not what I'm doing though, have you seen HxH? Do you know what it's combat is like after characters learn nen? If you do, you know it's on a completely different level..

***** I am familiar with all of those and yes, I think Worth the Candle is superior to all of them. Hunter x Hunter ( except for the Ant Arc) is extremely good but I think Worth the Candle is better in basically every metric that matters to me.

****** I would reeeeallly have loved to get a few chapters focused on the in-depth exploration of ink magic. The possibilities just seem endless, more than just a glorified stat stick of a particular i-Level.

But I guess it's quite hard to write a story with the mc as a worm-esque tinker rather than a 5e artificer because said tinker can always prep time their way out of any puzzle.

** Well yeah, the story is explicitly a way for awales to work through some shit.

The way the characters discuss thing echoes rational fiction, but in a lot of ways that really isn't an appropriate label for the story.

*** For the record, AW has written that he now basically sees Joon as an entirely distinct character, not a self-insert, or in the author's own words:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://alexanderwales.com/substantial-differences/][I've been writing the story long enough now that I don't really think of Juniper as being myself any more. Part of that is because through the course of the story, he's changed, but it's also because all of the various changes add up to someone that has substantial enough differences that it's easier not to think of him as a clone. I don't really dip into old letters, notes, e-mails, docs, or anything like that anymore, though I did quite a bit at the beginning so that I could get him as accurate as I could. I will probably never write another self-insert, unless he's much older than I am, more reflective of who I am now. But I'm glad that I'm writing this one.]]

****** They were looking for the Vorpal Sword, but couldn't find it. They had to plan without it first time round.

Planning based on the reality of the situation and the minimal information they had around Fel Seed is not OOC.

The information they did have suggested they would have to deal with a series of escalating apocaylpses if they did nothing.

******* As the text shows, most of the dangers were due to the party themselves. Specifically the infernal issue is due to Valencia and the Runic exclusion is due to Amaryllis. Void beast moving a little bit was probably the only thing that the DM nudged, and even after 3 years, it hasn't affected the world yet.

And in that time they were able to set up Onion's sword and Mome Rath's bones. Both of which they could've set up in the first run itself after a few months/years, if they had prepared.
