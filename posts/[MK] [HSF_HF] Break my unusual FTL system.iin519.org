So I'm writing a fantasy/scifi/magitech thing where the main character does all sort of muchkinry, and it has a bit of a different FTL system than usual space fiction. The magic system is quite limited but helps around a few engineering obstacles.

Super effective impulse engines exist that exploit a spell to give Newton's 3rd the middle finger and create impulse without needing reaction mass, and they can provide multiple G's for years. However, people inside a spaceship with this drive still experience the acceleration, which limits how fast crewed ships can accelerate. Inertial dampeners exist, but they kinda mess up the entire concept of temperature so they're not used on anything that has complicated biochemistry in it.

Warp drives (Alcubierre style) aren't a thing, while there is space warping stuff it can't project a warp field in front of a ship because the "projectors" have to surround the altered region of spacetime.

The only FTL method is creating stable wormholes by using the space warping magic to create an artificial rotating black hole which immediately collapses into Hawking radiation but acts like a holepunch to alter the topology of spacetime which normal space warping can't do, then applying more complicated space warping to keep the wormhole from instantly collapsing and seperating the two ends. Wormhole creation always creates two ends in the same location of spacetime, so you can't quickly open a wormhole to hop to another planet like in Stargate. If the equipment at one end of a wormhole is damaged, the entire thing collapses and is gone.

What is done is carrying one end of a wormhole to a new location at below light speed, then using it to hop back and forth at FTL. Basically there's an entire network of stable wormhole connections, and most exit points are connected to multiple other nodes to create a network where you can go from any point to any other point through multiple wormholes.

Now, here's how initial connections to other star systems are set up: A wormhole is generated, one end stays at an existing node in the network, the other one is put on a fully autonomous relativistic cruiser which is basically an oversized impulse drive capable of sustained 10+ G's and a massive shield and nothing more. The relativistic cruiser spends half the journey accelerating towards the destination, another half slowing down, with most of the trip so ridiculously close to light speed that the CMB itself is shifted to deadly gamma rays, and a any piece of cosmic dust has the impact energy of a nuke which is why the shield is needed.

For an observer stationary to the starting point or destination, the cruiser takes just a little longer than a light signal to arrive, tens of millions of years. But for a moving observer on the cruiser, time dilation reduces the trip time to a few years. From an earth stationary observer looking through the wormhole, the trip also only takes a few years because anyone looking through a wormhole sees time passing normally no matter how fast the ends are traveling compared to each other.

So a cruiser might be sent off to Andromeda, and a few years later people can hop through the wormhole to a point in spacetime at Andromeda but shifted millions of years into the future as seen by earth. Doesn't really matter, Andromeda a million years in the future is just as interesting to explore and you can always hop back through the wormhole to present day earth. Unless the wormhole collapses, in which case there's no way back apart from hoping that earth millions of years in the past reacted by sending another cruiser. Sending a cruiser back to earth would result in arriving a few million years after you left, same as light speed round trip time.

This system allows limited FTL (between existing nodes in the network, but it cannot be expanded outside of its light cone) and even time travel, by returning a wormhole end to the origin point after time dilating it a bunch. Time travel wormholes only have a fixed amount of time that they can go back by, and can't go back to before the setup process was completed, and doesn't split the timeline so closed timelike curves like HPMoR's time turners except for the potential of millions of years of delta-t.

Obviously access to time travel wormholes is strictly regulated by the authorities and not handed out to schoolkids, and nobody else can easily make time travel wormholes because it'd require setting up a black hole factory.

More common impulse drive ships that can use the wormholes but are acceleration limited otherwise are less regulated, but after someone tried to hit earth with an asteroid at .5%c they're also pretty restricted.

Politically, there's the Sol government that runs the wormhole network and there's a bunch of significantly less powerful local governments of various systems scattered across the local group of galaxies. Economically the magitech solves some shortages but most resources are mined traditionally in various asteroid belts and planets, energy comes from fusion and Dyson swarms that use wormholes to transmit concentrated energy, fabrication is done mostly automated. Most people work on intellectual property due to a ban on advanced AI. Civil wars and terrorism occasionally happens, most notable example that guy who tried to asteroid kill earth, but there's no large war because everyone needs Sol's network, and it's literally impossible for another system to build a usable network with another center point because the temporal differences would be way off.

So what kind of shenanigans could a wealthy but common, rational thinking munchkin come up with in my world? I think I left a few too many exploits in the way things work.


** So you can open a wormhole and send a cruiser to Andromeda, and the cruiser will arrive 2 million years later. People from earth can travel through this wormhole, arriving 2 million light years away and 2 million years in the future, and then back, arriving in the place and time they departed from.

So what you do is when you arrive in Andromeda in 2 million years, you open up a second wormhole near the exit of the first, with the other end in a cruiser bound for the Milky Way. When that cruiser arrives back at Earth, it's now t+4M years. You send someone through the Earth->Andromeda+2MY, then through the Andromeda->Earth+4MY wormhole, and have them collect data from the future then return back to present day Earth.

Congratulations, you're writing a time travel story.

Edit: which on rereading I see you're aware of. Still, there are lots of time travel shenanigans you could pull here. Which ones will work depends on the exact time travel model you're using.

*** The time travel aspect is kinda what politically keeps Sol in power. You can't send a wormhole connection backwards in time, only forwards and let someone come back through. This means that if a connection was built from A to B, B is further in the future than A and cannot construct a connection back to present-A, only far future-A which would cause all kinds of chaos. Since the original network was built from Sol and the other systems are scattered around the edge of Sol's light cone, other systems cannot make networks that connect all present day systems because they're outside their light cones. If for example someone in Andromeda tried to make their own network, the vast majority of their connections would end up at other systems millions of years in the future compared to the connections from Sol.

Consider having a thousand ideas that might work but will each take decades to accomplish your goals. Start trying the first one, and send an observer to the future to report back whether it worked. If so, great. If not, switch to strategy 2 and repeat.

***** True. Although there's certainly a risk to letting someone return from the far future, they could be bringing back something dangerous self-replicating such as a supervirus or a copy of am artificial superintelligence, thus causing it to exist in the first place. That's why I imagined all connections to the far future to be used extremely cautiously, largely limiting the things that can be done.

Time travel wormholes with just a few minutes offset would be pretty widely used though, mostly to solve complicated computational problems. Computers don't get scared when the message they get from their future self is "don't mess with time".

Would a government which controlled access to the technology - or the individual politicians in power - be able to resist the siren song of knowing exactly how any decision they made would pan out, and thus being able to choose the option that works out the best for them?

Would there even be able to be lotteries, gambling, or anything resembling a stock market any more, if information from minutes or days ahead was available? Would billionaires and megacompanies who could wangle access to future information (by means fair or foul) always outperform and outmaneuver their less successful rivals?

******* True, the days offset range is probably the one with the most immediate gain. Access would probably be tightly controlled, and give a major advantage to those who run the system (and those who can get access that they shouldn't have). Not unlike HPMoR's time turners, except without the arbitrary 6 hour limit and a lot less portable. They'd probably have to limit the amount of information going back, since they can't change anything that they already know will happen unless they lie to their own past selves afterwards, which would completely invalidate the point. There might also be activists demanding further reduction in causality-breaking, free-will-limiting information, their success depending on how strongly democratic values are adhered to. I'm still in the process of working out how exactly the geopolitics (or spacetimepolitics?) would look like.

******** Why would they limit information? Future knowledge doesn't cast a binding spell upon you once you hear it (...unless is /does/ because your world has magic). The binding was already there, because physics is deterministic.

As you have HPMOR time travel, given that they are communicating information, nothing that happens will prevent that communication. This means that either the person talking can't stop the circumstances that led to them talking, or they don't want to.

This isn't "serious advantage" territory. This is P=NP=1. The organization with time travel does one of two things:

1. Explodes immediately. This should be unlikely, because whatever gets sent back has to be something that causes you to want to send the exact same thing back even knowing it explodes you.
2. Has perfect days for the rest of forever. They never so much as stub a toe, not even to stumble over pirate treasure, because they would just tell their past selves "hey, there is pirate treasure here, watch your feet". These people aren't powerful, they are Contessa without blind spots.

   1. This organization could technically be beaten by altering their goals. At 8:00 AM Jan 1st they hear from Jan 2nd, "Go to the abandoned warehouse at noon for excellent cake!" Instead, they are mind-controlled, and 8:00 AM on Jan 2nd they tell Jan 1st to go the warehouse.

Basically, the way to ensure this stays in serious advantage territory and not godhood territory, Just invent a physics or magic reason why every A-B B-A pair explodes if more than a certain number of bits are sent backwards. I'm thinking something like 32 bits a day, allowing for tension heightening but still cryptic messages like "HELP" to be sent back.

Sharply limited data and sharply limited time allows for interesting things. For one, information from further ahead can come back by simply ferrying it backwards, one day at a time. And could be subverted along the chain.

Of course, people who compose extremely careful questions to their future selves (or to future information-brokers) could still get use out of it. For example, not asking "do the activists get mysteriously murdered and when?", but things like "is there ever a time when a majority of the most vocal activists are together in the same room?"

******* They'd have to get their hands on a wormhole. Not exactly an easy process to create one.

And they'd have to deliver it to a point in the future of reachable spacetime, which means that if Sol finds out they have more than enough time to send an interceptor to shoot it down. Remember that Sol is at the bottom of the cone-shaped spacetime map of the network, they can reach any point they want with a relativistic ship.

Then they'd have to prevent the future civilization that they want to observe from destroying the spy.

Finally they'd have to figure out how to make sure that the information they get is trustworthy. Any information from 100 years in the future is risky, especially when it's terabytes of data, because those could turn out to be the source code to the superintelligent AI that runs the future and sent itself back to create itself.

My idea was a society which has time travel to and from the far future, but treats it extremely cautiously and if anyone created an unlicensed wormhole that might allow someone from the future to invade and Sol finds out, half their nuclear arsenal would arrive within the same hour.

** The problem you face is that any method of FTL physical travel is synonymous with time travel. Moreover, it's hard to see how the reference frames would actually even be mathematically consistent for your proposed wormhole delivering courier that only takes a few years from earth reference. It certainly seems that it privileges the earth reference frame, but there's no clear physical reason that should be the case, unless that's just somehow part of the 'magic'? It does not seem to follow from a simple application of reaction-less inertia. Depending how this actually works, time travel might be the least of your problems.

I would suggest that your worm hole view of the courier should probably show a time dilated perspective. I suspect anything else would not offer consistent reference frames under Lorentz transforms.

I know this in theory but don't understand intuitively. Could you expand? Let's say we have means to jump instantly between Earth and Mars. We are on Earth at the point in time E(0), we can observe Mars as it was at M(-3m). We jump to Mars and arrive at M(0), observing Earth at E(-3m). If we instantly jump back, we arrive at E(0), if we fly back at the speed of light, we arrive at E(+3m). I don't see how can we travel in time using this setup. What am I missing here?

For example you might know the twin "paradoxon", where the astronaut twin ends up being younger than the one that stays on earth. With end points of a wormhole instead of twins, this results in a wormhole where one end is further in the future than the other, allowing time travel

If the slope of your line is 0 you are stationary

If the slope of your line is 1 you are moving at the speed of light.

Imagine the line being striped in the graph to show the difference between your reference frame time and x-time.

Another way to picture it is that your reference frame "velocity" through "spacetime" is constant, and the faster you move through the "space" dimension the slower you move through the "time" dimension.

A third way to think about it is: from the perspective of the photon, time is not passing for us, only for it. There is only "forward" and "back" and it is all happening in a single moment, we are all still. But from the perspective of us the photon is moving.

*** From earth observing the spacecraft directly, it indeed takes a long time. From earth looking through the wormhole it only takes a few years. The idea is that both ends of a wormhole experience time at the same rate when looking through it, so when one end experiences time dilation the ends aren't connecting the same points in time any more.

And yes this results in time travel, people having the possibility to end up millions of years in the future, and things from the far future potentially making it back, which is why all wormholes with high time offset are very strictly regulated. The actual wormholes are actually tiny (nanometer size, only photos fit through) but space warping expands them large enough for ships to go through, but only when active so without both sides consenting and activating the expansion the connection is closed to anything large. Obviously nobody lets anything from the far future travel back without a lot of checks, can't be too careful.

***** Basically Sol, the system that's the furthest in the past of the entire network, is the one whose government is in control of the entire network and all the access codes required to open a connection to let things through. Since they're the furthest in the past, they can send relativistic ships to any point in their future light cone and enforce what they want. If someone sends a wormhole somewhere that Sol doesn't approve of, they can intercept the relativistic ship with a solid tungsten rod impacting at 99.9999%c. Other systems cannot do that because they're further in the future, so their light cones can't reach present-Sol, only future-Sol which is obviously more technologically advanced, so Sol has a spacetime-geopolitical advantage and remains in control.

** To the best of my (not exhaustive) knowledge about relativity and wormholes, you're mostly right about how they behave at relativistic speeds. They basically 'link' reference frames, so if you accelerate one end to high fractional c and look through the other, it will appear to be travelling faster than light. That 2 million lightyear trip could take a subjective 2 years, 10 minutes, or 2 seconds as seen by Earth if you have enough acceleration.

But the catching point is the time travel. If you take that wormhole that is 2 million years + 2 seconds in the 'future' and slowly move it 3 light-seconds back towards Earth, you get time travel; grab a lasergun on Earth and fire a shot towards the Andromeda end and you'll see the (rather dim) flash through the wormhole a second before you fire.

Or you /would/, if the wormhole didn't violently explode the very instant it moved more than 2 light-seconds backwards. You see, if you /did/ give it a negative time differential and fire a (impossibly accurate) laser through, aiming to loop, the laser would make the journey in negative time, reaching it's origin before it fired. And then there's two lasers instantly. And then four. And then eight. And so on.

Thankfully, the universe does not get a wave of infinite mass-energy expanding at the speed of light. Rather, the wormhole just collapses. But it collapses /instantly/ as soon as this becomes possible; virtual particles are a omnipresent bitch, and will instantly do this as soon as there is /any/ space-time path with negative length, regardless of how many wormholes are involved or how complex the path is. You don't get a endless source of energy that is stable so long as you avoid a infinitely looping path.

I'm not sure if stable time loops are a option, though. You have authorial fiat of course, so do as you will, just keep in mind that non-looping time travel is a bad thing; the most charitable interpretation is infinite free energy and replication, the least is a light-speed wave of universen't.

*** Wouldn't your laser experiment where the laser jumps goes in a loop but arrives a second before it started just result in whoever is setting up the wormholes getting a laser in the face because the laser jumped back as far as it could? In order for infinite energy to occur, you'd have to keep firing the laser indefinitely. In reality it's a finite energy laser pulse that just ends up hitting its target before it gets fired.

Small disclaimer: I know a little of special but almost none of general relativity, so my idea of time travel is pretty much HPMoR's time turner but it sends things continuously back instead of being activated once. Which as far as I know is actually almost exactly how JK Rowling's time turner works in PoA, and matches the theory of closed timelike curves as possible worldlines.

Edit: Laser experiment in detail. For the sake of simplicity, our wormholes are 1ls apart and have a Δt of -2 seconds. The laser is at the OUT hole and aimed at IN and is set to fire 1 minute pulses. If you switch the laser on at t=0, it will reach IN at t=1s and emerge OUT at t=-1s, giving a total displacement per loop of -1s.

Now let's start with the moment our loop is assembled, long before the laser is fired.

t=0: 1 beam 1 exits OUT and misses IN as it's being assembled, hits wall. 1 beam total.

t=1: beam 2 exits out aimed at IN. 2 beams total.

t=2: beam 2 reaches IN and travels to t=0. Beam 3 exits OUT aimed at IN. 3 beams total.

t=59: beam 59 reaches IN and travels to t=57. Beam 60 exits OUT. 60 beams total.

t=60: beam 60 reaches IN. Beam 1 switches direction, no longer aimed at wall, now also aimed at IN. 60 beams total.

At this point we had 60s of beam 1 hitting the wall and ending, and we have 60 1ls long beams between the wormholes which are really just one continuous 60s beam.

t=x+0: we switch on the laser. At the same time one beam coming out of OUT ends. 60 beams total.

t=x+1: beams out of OUT reduces to 58. 59 beams emitted total, but the 60th is still on the way.

t=x+2: OUT 57, laser 1, 58 beams emitted total, 59th still on the way. Beams hitting IN reduces to 59, matching what happened to OUT at t=x+0.

t=x+59: the last beam from OUT ends. Only the beam from the laser is still emitted, beam 2 still on the way.

t=x+60: laser shuts off. Last beam on the way.

t=x+61: end of last laser beam reaches IN, matching what happened to OUT at t=x+59. All beams have traveled into the past.

At this point the laser is off after having fired for 60s, we've had a 60s pulse hit the wall back at t=0, and in between there were always 60ls worth of total laser beams in existence. Never did we have to deal with infinities.

**** Possibly; in practice it would be difficult to do this with a laser gun, though you could maybe get something similar with a transparent lasing medium with no casing? Not sure.

A better example might be: imagine that, as you're moving the wormhole, there just happens to be a single photon travelling to Andromeda that will thread the needle and loop infinitely. The loop is infinite, so that single photon tries to become a wave of "oh no" and the wormhole breaks instead of the universe.

A simpler arrangement might be to imagine 2 wormholes with a teeny negative time differental, 5 feet apart. Much easier to arrange a inconvenient photon than aiming a laser perfectly over lightyears.

And virtual particles are sort of everywhere at /some/ level of probability (sorta, i'm not as good with QM), so that inconvenient photon is always there all the time. Because the process multiplies to infinity, even the tiniest amplitude of that happening will still result in infinite energy.

****** Right, sorry, forgot to refresh the page.

After thinking it through, I think that wormholes might be stable if they have a positive or a negative, and maybe /exactly/ zero time differential, but things break at the limits. Just like how you can have a particle travel /only/ slower than light, or /only/ faster than light (as far as relativistic kinetic energy goes, at least), or /only/ at the speed of light.

Consider another scenario: You have two wormholes 1 light minute apart, with a positive time differential of 1 second. So if you stand between them and fire straight at the far/IN end, the laser comes from the close/OUT end behind you and hits you in the back after one second. The wormholes were made a fairly long time ago.

Lets also say you have a carefully engineered laser gun which is perfectly transparent and accurate, and you're actually sitting off to the side so the laser has nothing to hit. The laser fires a arbitrarily short pulse such that you don't have to worry about the length of the beam at all.

Finally, you're in something sort of like a cloud chamber, where each laser pulse causes secondary emission of light so you can see it as it travels, but the beam is never diminished. Also, your eyes are really good and you can think quickly enough to track these as they move.

Scenario 1: Space-time distance of +1 second

T=0, you squeeze the trigger, and watch as the pulse flies off into the distance towards the far/OUT hole. You turn on the safety and step away from the laser; it won't fire again.

T=0.999, you can see the beam about half of a light second away. It's 'actually' .999 light-seconds away, but the light emitted from that point will take about a second more to come back. The light from the half-way point is visible /now/, though.

T=1, another beam emerges from the close/OUT hole a bit behind you. At this moment exactly, it's passed through the laser and looks exactly the same as a fired beam. Mostly. You didn't see it come from the hole until it reached you and the laser, because the visible indicator from the cloud chamber travels just as fast as the beam. So you don't so much see the beam travel, as just a instant-quick glimpse of a trail of light leading back through the close/OUT hole, all the way back to the gun, where you can see yourself holding the trigger of the laser as you were a second ago.

T=2, the 'first' beam, that you've been tracking, now appears to be 1 light-second away. The 'second' is apparently half a light second away. A 'third' emerges from the hole, trail and all.

T=30, you've seen thirty beams flash by, and there are 31 visible in flight. The foremost beam still only appears to be 15 light-seconds out, only a quarter of the way to the far hole. The closest has just passed through the transparent laser gun.

T=60, you can see 61 beams. Yes, 61 somehow. You were only expecting 60 at most, but the front beam is only half way to the far/IN end and you can clearly count another 60, including the one that just passed you.

T=120, the front beam has finally reached the far/IN hole. You watch, and while a flash does pass you, you suspect it isn't the same beam. You can see yourself through the far/IN hole, and you're still holding the laser's trigger, with a beam visibly emerging from the muzzle.

T=121, another beam passes you, and through the far/IN hole you can see yourself standing away from the laser, reacting to the first beam. If you really squint, you can see through the /next/ far/IN hole where you're drinking a cup of coffee before you began. Somehow, you suspect that this line of beams is going to appear to go on forever.

T=122, just before the next flash of a line comes you stick your hand in front of the transparent laser and stop the beam as it passes through. You half-expect another beam to hit you after a second, but it seems like it stopped at just that one pulse.

T=240+, you've waited and watched. All of the rest of the beams have gone through the far/IN hole one by one, up until the very last one, where you see yourself stick your hand out to stop it. And then the rest of the beams go on, though the next far/IN hole visible though the first, where you see this repeat, so on and so forth until you can't see clearly anymore.

******* Scenario 2: Reducing space-time distance

T=-, you repeat the experiment and let the beams travel until they've visibly reached the far/IN hole.

T=0, you press a button, and you start moving forward. The platform that everything is mounted on, including the close/OUT hole, is very slowly moving forward.

T=N, the space-time distance is now 0.5 seconds. You've watched as the beams have increased in frequency, and now they flash by every half-second and only appear to be a quarter light-second apart as they travel. You can see 240 of them total, not counting the one you see just passing through the far/IN hole. Speaking of, what you see in the distance towards the far/IN hole seems to be ever so slightly fast-forward. This isn't really noticeable with the beams, but you can see yourself through the far/IN hole and you're tapping your foot ever so slightly faster, and now you're half a second out of sync. Same the other way; looking through the close/OUT hole, you see whatever you were doing half a second ago.

T=1.999N, things are starting to get concerning. The flashes are coming by almost constantly, and the series of beams in the distance looks rather more like a continuous line. Looking through the close/OUT hole, there is barely any delay between your actions and the you that you see in the distance.

T=2.001N, you aren't quite sure what happened. Well, that's not quite true. Something exploded, that's pretty clear. Otherwise though, it's a bit of a blur. The way you've been thinking about it, a beam 'leaving' the barrel of the gun (ignoring that it's just passing through, not being fired) is the 'trigger' for a flash and a beam after a delay; one second at first, coming down to almost nothing. Of course, it's really the same beam, you saw that in the first experiment, it just arrives after a small delay despite the fact that you can see it flying into the distance. Repeatedly, for that matter.

So what you /think/ happened is... well you aren't quite sure what happened at T=2N. But after that, a pulse was 'triggered' a teensy bit of time in the past; almost no time at all, really. And then, because it was in the past, it would be in /front/ of the last beam, so that beam... immediately? Already had? It passed, and 'triggered' another another beam, slightly in the past, just a bit in front of it, 'pushing' the stack back. If it just stopped there, and you flung your hand out to catch the beams, you'd be hit by /three/ of them. There was 'actually' more than one beam now, or at least more than one beam you could interact with.

But it didn't 'stop' there, it wouldn't. Why would it, this whole thing technically occurred in /negative/ time, however that works. So there was another beam behind that, and another behind that, and another behind that... all spaced by the space-time distance. How small was that negative distance, how close to zero? Was it really infinite, or was it just equal to the planck time?

Either way, you suddenly had a rather worrying amount of energy. If you had been at, say, -1 second space-time distance, it wouldn't have been so bad. If you think about it, looking through the close/OUT hole is sort of like looking into the past. And the pulses literally would have propagated along that line, all the way back to whenever these holes were installed, years or light-years in the past. And with a entire meter between them, that would be fine, but mere planck lengths apart...

Maybe it's a good thing that the holes exploded. You don't want to find out what happens when more mass-energy than exists in the entire universe suddenly appears in one spot.

** A lot hinges on SolGov performing its role seamlessly. Perhaps a slight exception to the advanced-AI ban is the only thing allowing them to maintain supremacy vs acausal threats.

This reminds me a lot of Singularity Sky already though. Not that that's a bad thing. Always thought it was a shame the author forwent the third novel because he couldn't resolve the paradoxes.

** Out of curiosity, is there anything preventing a wormhole endpoint through a wormhole? I would have thought that the very first thing that would have been sent through a long-distance wormhole, once it was established, would be a couple dozen more endpoints which replicate the just-established tunnel, so that if something happened to the original there would be plenty of backups.

Admittedly, this wouldn't really break anything except the potential to have "O noes we are stranded" plots. And even then, you could technically have them if the first set of endpoints at a location were ALL destroyed or otherwise rendered unable to be used.

Another question - you're talking about endpoints which, when in operation, might go between stars, planets, planet-to-moon, and so forth, as well as between local systems and interstellar spaceships in flight. Presumably, this means that endpoints do not have to remain fixed in space (if that's even possible given the way spacetime can warp) with respect to each other. What happens when you have two connected endpoints on two ships of equal mass which are traveling away from each other at 0.5c, and you start passing mass from one ship to the other through the hole? What do observers on each ship see? What do external observers see?

*** Whether you can send a wormhole through a wormhole? I have no idea if that'd be feasible according to GR, but I'll allow it for the sake of easier logistics. And when you look through a wormhole, you see what's on the other side as if they were standing still relative to you, you don't notice any time dilation or length contraction (even though they still occur, which makes time offset wormholes possible in the first place).

I don't understand enough physics to think through the implications of this but it seems like there would be a lot more uses for this spell than just fast spaceship engines

Are the space-warping spells needed to create a stable wormhole common knowledge? Do you need to be a "powerful" magician in order to perform them, or do they just require learning the technique? Are there expensive inputs?

Why is AI banned?

What form of government is the Sol government?

One exploit would be duplicating oneself into an army via a time-travel loop.

** A private black hole factory would be relatively easy to set up once you have a few wormholes to work with. Find an unclaimed gravity well, set the wormholes in alignment with it, add a bunch of turbines in between and funnel some water through the wormhole.

Once you've got the first black hole, create a time travel hole to collect energy for the second, precommit to sending enough matter-energy back that you will definitely have a black hole no matter what, and you've got a self sustaining loop. Or a bunch of cosmic debt, but since you're creating black holes for fun and profit it shouldn't take too long to get ROI and get some robots to do the harvesting.

Btw, SoI doesn't sound like a government, they sound like a monopoly. Basically the same thing except a monopoly doesn't have to follow anyone's rules besides their own.

Edit: By the way, I'm wondering if a few second time loop could be used to reverse entropy. It seems like there should be a way but I don't have the math handy.

** This video is a twenty year time lapse of stars orbiting the black hole at the centre of the galaxy: [[https://youtu.be/TF8THY5spmo]]

It takes just five years, from our perspective, for one of those stars to traverse billions of kilometres around a half-loop of the black hole. If that were true, though, the forces involved would rip the stars apart.

There are three factors affecting the divergence of frame of reference: distance, relative velocity, and the presence of a big mass like the black hole. (In relativity, the latter two are the same thing, and are implied by the first).

You cannot force Sol and some distant star to share a frame of reference for more than a split second. Having two wormholes far apart, and expecting them to share the same frame of reference, is violating causality.
