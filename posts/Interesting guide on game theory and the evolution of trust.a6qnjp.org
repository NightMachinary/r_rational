** i wonder how this can be extended to non-binary interactions. like, multiple possible options that lead to different levels of reward for both people.

*** You can go even further, and allow each person to have infinitely many options. This is called a continuous game. This kind of thing is very important in the field of Industrial Organization, which studies the interactions between powerful firms.

*** One way is to extend the decisions that are already available. Replace "cheat"/defect and "cooperate" with a number in the set [0, 2] or between those two numbers. This number represents how much you give, and also determines how much you keep. If you "give" 2, they receive 2, and you keep 0. If you "give" 0, they receive 0, but you gain 1. Both player's score is a function *f*, of *a* and *b*, what player 1 and 2 play, which returns *x* and *y*, which is what player 1 and 2 receive, respectively. This gives people the option to give 1 point to the other player, and keep 1/2 for themselves.

f(a, b) = x, y = a/2+b, b/2+a.

You could also add a "quit" option, which ends play. This affects what phenomena can be modeled using the game because it's harder for countries to just move to have different neighbors, than to declare war or negotiate peace, but it might make it resemble interactions between people more - people can usually leave a conversation.

** I send this to everyone who wants to know me better. This, along with papers like "War, Space, and the Evolution of Old World Complex Societies" are how I view the world's interactions. Mixed with some Slatestarcodex stuff, a lot of things begin to make sense.

*** [[/u/Marthinwurer]]: I send links to my friends of things that I'm interested in, which happen to be educational but also interactive and entertaining.

**** I show affection by sending people links to stuff that I think /they'd/ be interested in. So if they're a math person and I find a good math thing, sent. If they're a meme person and I find an extraordinary meme, sent. If they're a cybersecurity person and I find a decent cybersecurity blog, sent. You get the idea - I may not be enthusiastic about music theory or geography or photography, but I have friends who are.

In reciprocation, I've had stuff sent to me that other people thought I'd be interested in. But in order for that to happen, they first need to know what kind of stuff I'm interested in. This comes up in conversations naturally sometimes, but at other times I just bring it up abruptly to spontaneously start or change the subject of a discussion when it's getting a little dull. For example, I might share a quote from something I recently read, along with a reference in case it piqued their interest enough to warrant a deeper look:

#+begin_quote
  One reason people may share stories, news, and information is because they contain useful information. Coupons or articles about good restaurants help people save money and eat better. Consumers may share such practically useful content for altruistic reasons (e.g., to help others) or for self enhancement purposes (e.g., to appear knowledgeable, see Wojnicki and Godes 2008). Practically useful content also has social exchange value (Homans 1958), and people may share it to generate reciprocity (Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl 1998).

**** If he'd written it like that, I'd have agreed with ya 100%. But he didn't and it reads like a humble brag with the subtlety of an elephant sneaking on a tightrope.

Hopefully he puts some more points into charisma like you did for the next time ;)

**** This seems unnecessarily aggressive. I can see scenarios where what [[/u/Marthinwurer]] said is a totally reasonable thing to do. Obviously, telling somebody "before you can be my friend you need to read this" is being a dick. But if, eg, somebody expresses interest in how you think and your life philosophy, and wants to learn more about you, it seems perfectly reasonable to give an actual answer? I can definitely think of friends where I'd be interested in this kind of thing from them (and at least 2 who've done something vaguely like that, in a way that felt perfectly socially appropriate)

*** Not to be a jerk, but how many people did you send these links to; and among them, how many got back to you?

Personally, I find it awkward to break a conversation with "read this 20min article and get back to me", and I don't think it's ever lead to me having more interesting conversations with someone afterwards.

I think people just aren't interested in long articles they didn't find themselves.
