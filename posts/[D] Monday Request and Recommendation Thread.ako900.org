Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** The creator of /CORDYCEPS/ recently released a new Nanowrimo story by the name of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw][Dave Scum]]. He's [[https://itsbenedict.tumblr.com/post/182357227759/man-i-feel-kind-of-bad-about-how-nanowrimo-went][expressed disappointment]] over how it turned out, but personally I thought it was excellent barring the ending.

Highly recommended to those interested in reading about a funny man exploiting time travel mechanics in increasingly clever ways in order to save the world.

** So I recently realized that I'm very drawn to stories that play with being very meta-aware. It's hard to define, but it basically boils down to characters who are aware that their lives have tendency to follow literary/narrative rules over normal/every-day reality. But it's not being [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savvy]], rather it's a step beyond it. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness][Medium Savvy]] is close, but it goes too far since I don't want stories where the characters are literally aware of being in a book.

It's hard to clearly explain what stories have to do to have this quality, but I have list of recommendations that I hope help fill in the inference gap.

[[https://korridor.rip/][Game By God: Sludge Reformation]] - a murder mystery game show with 16 contestants who are well aware of the tropes of their genre.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] - where heroic fantasy tropes are actual laws of the world instead of mundane physics and a young girl seeks out to be on top in an evil empire which is crumbling due to Good and Evil being out of balance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] - a guy gets thrown into a world of fantasy that was recreated from his DnD sessions. Really plays with the idea of being a character in your own story.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] - a girl wakes up with Gamer powers with the classic abilities to level up and increase stats. It has the twist that she's an eroge gamer rather than the classic RPG gamer and she actually takes the time to question and investigate why she has these powers instead of taking them for granted unlike the protagonists of other gamer stories.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Thursday-Next-Novel-Book/dp/B00WKNLISI][A Thursday Next Novel]] - a seven book series where people know they are characters in a story and act as if they are living real lives with the ability to move from story to story. Thursday Next is a Special Operative in literary detection who needs to rescue kidnapped literary characters.

The following three are all kinda of similar where they are Korean-translated stories where the protagonist are reading a story and then became a character in the story, but they don't do enough with the concept (except Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint). I'm still including the other two since they at least flirt a little with what I'm trying to convey.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra][The Novel's Extra]] - Author is sucked into his own unfinished story of a modern heroic fantasy world to fight monsters and humans.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/trash-of-the-counts-family][Trash of the Count's Family]] - Reader is sucked into the story of a medieval Asian high fantasy world to survive a coming war and he only read the first five volumes.

[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]] - Reader is living through a game-like apocalypse where he read the entire series, but there were numerous unanswered questions about the original story. It's the only one out of the three that has the main character actually take the time to question and wonder about why he is in a story.

Can anyone recommend similar works with themes of meta-awareness?

Omniscient Reader doesn't have as good of a translator, but the plot and setting is really /novel/ in a lot of ways and I found it made up for the not as good translation.

** "Kaguya wants to be confessed to" is one of the best romcom I've read in years.

I wouldn't consider it particularly rational, but it has some of the best plot consistencies I've seen and better lore than some sci-fi/fantasy works. You can go much deeper than you would expect for a romcom.

The manga is at chapter 135, and the post for it is the highest rated chapter discussion on [[/r/manga][r/manga]], while the anime is one of the most popular airing anime of the season (on reddit at least).

Give it a try. Many people (including myself) say that the first 10/15 chapters or the first 2 episodes are rougher than the rest. I myself didn't start falling in love with the work until chapter 20, after which it slowly became the highlight of my week.

** Has anybody here found any rational or rational-adjacent cosmic horror? I recently finished some bloodborne fanfiction and they are really fun, but their cosmic horror aspects are often pretty lacking. A lot of them don't include horror elements and the ones that do merely borrow the aesthetic. Sigh.

An important part of cosmic horror in my opinion is cultivating a sense of mystery. You can't just say “ohh look at these tentacles, mankind wasn't supposed to know about these tentacles, they'll make you go maaaaaaad!” You're just borrowing the aesthetic. You have show the reader that these things are mysterious and horrific rather than just saying so or using standard ‘eldritch horror' signals.

Lovecraft did a decent job of this in some of his stories and, surprisingly, HPMOR did as well, although it was not the focus of the story and barely received any screentime as result.

EDIT: I think a rational approach to cosmic horror would work well because you couldn't just blithely accept that the horror elements are inherently mysterious, and as a result you have to do the legwork that lazy attempts at cosmic horror avoid. ie the quintessential rational protagonist when approaching some "eldritch god" might investigate it, with various hypotheses that explain it along the way. Each of these are disproven which helps convince the reader that this might be inherently mysterious after all.

** I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost /designed/ to mainly have all those qualities, /sigh/. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate.

Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.

Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-/Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure/.

There isn't really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body. Slow updates.

**** Presumably, he hasn't found anything noteworthy or just wants even /more/ recommendations. I've seen another thread at SV, too.

If my eyes see correctly, there are some new recs inside the post, so it seems to get updated with fresh stuff. Since it acts as a recommendation as well as a request, I kinda like this approach.

** What would you recommend that updates very regularly (e.g. weekly or more often)?

​

The only things I have this category are webcomics - I was reading With this Ring and found the daily update schedule added quite a nice element to my day, but I was getting a bit tired of it and decided the recent forum move (and to a lesser extent the events leading to it) was a good prompt to stop. I'm wondering if there's anything good to replace it with.

*** Can you be clear on what you want? Just asking for something that updates frequently is too vague, because there's a lot out there that updates regularly.

Web serials like [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]] are updating with multiple chapters per week.

There's fanfiction authors who update their stories on a weekly basis like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]] who writes amazing RWBY stories.

There's wuxia stories on [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/][wuxiaworld.com]] and [[https://webnovel.com][webnovel.com]] (although this site charges for the latest chapters, be warned) that update on a daily basis.

Your request is too broad. Can you specify what you are interested in that I can recommend something that is updating frequently?

I'll add the webcomic [[https://m.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/sword-interval/list?title_no=486][Sword Interval]] as a recommendation for a weekly update with rational characters.

Both are portal fantasy 'uplift' stories, where the MC tries to introduce modern tech to a backwards people. World of Prime is pretty good, but has a rough 1/3 or so of the first book.

Destiny's Crucible drags on a bit too long, and I found the ending a bit unsatisfying, but it's decent enough.

*** These are the three main web serials i read too, having slowly dropped over time all the other serials recommended in this sub. The two best pieces of online fiction that i've read recently that are comparable in quality were actually Harry Potter fanfic:

Hermoine Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation

Applied Cultural Anthropology, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus

The former is rational/ist and the latter is at at the least rational adjacent. Both are currently incomplete and may remain that way for some time though. Also, if you haven't read through the backlog of Alexander Wales, the author of Worth The Candle, you should. Metropolitan Man and The Dark Wizard of Donkerk are especially great.

**** Is it necessary to have read the Harry Potter books to fully appreciate Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation? I mean, I watched all the movies, but I know that the books normally have much bigger deal of details.\\
Also, I will surely take a look at the other works of the author of Worth the Candle, I never knew he had written something else, thank you for the recommendations.
