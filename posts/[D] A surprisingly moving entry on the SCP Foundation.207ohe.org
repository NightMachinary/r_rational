Doesn't qualify as rationalist, but I found this to be a moving piece of writing personally, and expect that people here might like it.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1612][SCP-1612]]

I was wondering whether this is appropriate here, and if not, where else I could post and find writing like this.


** As someone who has been lurking the wiki since the days of the Fisher, I find it funny that I got a bit of frisson reading the /comments/. I really like it when the community comes together to make a surprisingly good entry better without any clashing egos or ridiculousness.

***** Compared to other SCPs, these ones are kind of sweet. Candle flame flowers to symbolise humanity, perfect observatories, two container ships in love. Also, defending people from eldritch horrors.

** If you look up Mount Kazbek as well, you'll see it is associated with the Georgian version of Prometheus, who was chained there for having stolen fire from the Gods.
