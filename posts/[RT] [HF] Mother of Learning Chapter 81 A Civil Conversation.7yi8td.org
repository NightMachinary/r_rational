*** Magnitude tells you how much mana mage had when he was born/young, but the mana reserves grow with time and thats why Zach went from 50 to 250ish (reserves can grow anywhere from 3x to 5x, if I remember correctly) . So with the crown QI has 10x more mana than Zach.

But that's just what they say today based on 'normal' people. Zorian also said that in his case this didn't work, because he worked really hard on his shaping skills (=lowering the mana cost of spells).

So in case of 1000 years old lich we can expect him to have like 5x-7x mana growth just by practicing while also having some additional bonus from extreme shaping skills.

***** Magnitude just measures your mana reserves. Shaping skill allows you to go farther with that Mana, but it doesn't give you additional Mana capacity. Measuring Zorian's growth is hard only because he spent a lot of time getting better at the simple spell they use to measure Mana capacity, but his actual reserve haven't been changed by that. He can go a lot farther with that same Mana than a pre-loop Zorian would, but we have no reason to suspect that Zorian's Mana reserves have grown to abnormal levels, nor that there are easy methods of doing so.

In the extreme case you manage to have shaping skills so good every single spell costs you half as much mana as for other people, you effectively doubled your mana reserves and regeneration. Yes, we don't know what the exact limit of this is, but if we estimate something like ~20-40 % cheaper spells due to good shaping, that would mean ~1.25-1.666 bigger reserves and mana regeneration.

#+end_quote

You are correct with this, but while Zorian managed to master that one simple spell, he also practiced whole bunch of different shaping skills - if we estimate that he's currently in top 10 % mages considering dimensionalism skills, that would mean that he's able to cast any dimensionalism spell cheaper than 90 % of mages ...

At this moment the only spell he mastered is the magic missile, his second most trained spell is probably teleportation. He hasn't trained all the other spells he knows that hard - he trained them by getting very impressive shaping skills in different magic fields.

btw would magic missile be even cheaper if he learned it like a shaping exercise - without the use of his hands? There still is some difference between reflexive spells and unstructured magic (source [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/basics-of-magic-spellcasting/]] ).

**** I feel suspicious of QI's admission though. Like why would you just tell your enemies you have 10x more mana? ZZ told him the truth of how the orb stores a functionally infinite amount of memories, so I have a suspicion that the crown also holds a functionally infinite amount of mana and QI just said 10x so they would underestimate him. He's probably been storing and building up mana for the past thousand years or for however long he's had the crown.

Several reasons:

- He agreed to exchange information so that he could learn more about the orb.
- The crown is not an Achilles heel; he's still exceptionally capable and has abnormally large mana reserves without it.
- It's useful to be able to say, "I clearly have the power to do anything to you I want, but I haven't done it, therefore you can relax and actually talk to me without looking over your shoulder the whole time."

*** I think they're quite confident in reaching Blantyrre now without help - they know how to 'easily' steal and operate the airship (now without damaging the core = at full speed); once they get there and find a Bakora gate, they don't need the airship anymore (they already have Bakora gate at Ziggurath and in Koth).

Btw I don't think QI fully knows how to operate Bakora gates - he doesn't use the one under Cyoria. I think he just realized what does the icosahedron do (from studying his own blessing) and how to apply it to self-made gates.

I can't find at the moment how exactly does the mana cost scale with the distance of teleport, but I suspect it's more than lineary (because 'mages chain teleports when going bigger distances' [ch. 65] and 'costs increase exposively with the volume being teleported [ch. 69])

Or over here 'people chain teleports all the time instead of simply teleporting to the destination outright' [ [[http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Word_of_Domagoj]] ].

So even if we estimate QI's mana reserves to be 16x bigger than Zach's (both same base, both divine blessing, QI +10xbase from crown, let's guess QI +6xbase from practicing shaping and having bigger reserves by using magic for 20 times as long as Zach) and we guess (for the sake of this argument) that mana cost increases quadratically with distance, that means that QI can teleport 4 times further than Zach (4^{2} = 16).

That doesn't really get him to Blantyrre (that should be far away). Although one of the biggest problem with teleporting is that you have to divine where you want to teleport - which is way easier if you've already been there. Maybe QI has some additional bonuses in this area :-D

btw would QI pass ALL of the shaping exercises that Xvim would think of? (I specifically remember him being awed at Xvim deflecting one of his attacks with his hand :-D )

Even with some huge range increases, there's no teleporting to Blantyrre. The maps show the island chains from Eldemar to Koth, and there if Zach can't skip most of those islands, then there is no way for anyone to teleport across the much larger distance to Blantyrre.

Alanic knew about fire magic and soul magic (Zorian studied both at once)

Xvim knew about shaping (with Xvim's methods it took Zorian years to exhaust all of it)

In both cases once Zorian mastered it, they became suspicious.

QI knows about:

- soul magic
- all kinds of combat magic, which can be studied independently
- a lot of history stuff that could be helpful
- dimensionalism magic
- divine artifacts / blessings / gods intel
- I do bet he has to have some really cool shaping exercises

I don't think they have time to cover most of those. At chapter 55, they had about 4 years left (52 restarts), and a lot of time has passed since then.

But yes, he is a goldmine of info. That's likely in large part why red robe helped him with the invasion. He may not even be on his side, but giving him enough info to steamroll Cyoria would grant him quite a bit of favor...

Especially as Red Robe is a soul magic specialist. I'm curious if he's going to be buffed to be able to counter Zorian and Zach, as he really wasn't strong enough to fight Zach last time they fought, which was around when he left the loop.

I'm hoping not. It's better to use him as a wrench in their plans, given they have Quatach, his army, the cultists, Sudomir, and the primordial to deal with after the loop.

** So in chapter 62, we find out that Zach started as magnitude 25 and appeared to have it doubled without affecting his mana reserves. In chapter 8, he says he maxed out at magnitude 232. In this chapter, Quatach-Ichl basically said he followed the same path...so if he's being truthful about the crown's powers, he could have a magnitude of 2000+.

2000+. He's basically like a demi-god among men at this point. It makes me wonder how much magic he has at his disposal that's simply too mana-exhaustive to be practical for others to cast. He probably could cast the much vaunted "dragon magic" at this point.

It does make me wonder if its a potential weakness though. In chapter 26, Zach is able to knock the crown off Qual's head. Does that mean Qual lost access to his stored mana? He still would be magnitude 200+ ofc, but Zach has already shown to become exhausted during a battle, even with his doubled reserves.

I also wonder if the crown would work if Qual absorbed it into his body like he did with the dagger. I'm skeptical though, since if there would possible, it would be silly to risk leaving it on his head so that it could be knocked off like in Chapter 26.

*** One thing to note is that the crown works as a battery.

For a trained mage it takes around 30 minutes to replenish their mana reserves from 0 to 100 % [ [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/]] ].

So if we say that QI's mana reserves without the crown are the same as Zach's, that means that their mana replenishes at the same rate.

With the crown: QI needs ~5 hours to fill it, then he has 10 times more mana than Zach, but same replenishment rate.

So Zach + Zorian + Alanic + Xvim using some mana-efficient defense while keeping QI trapped (anti-teleport + soul trap field) can still theoretically force QI to go out of mana.

Even though some people suggest this after current chapter, we still haven't seen QI use any offensive spell so overpowered that Xvim/Alanic would have no defense against it. Might be still hidden up his sleeve, though.

he's never particularly needed to before though. In all the past fighs we've seen in him during teh invasion he was fighting against pretty standard mundane enemies he could defeat easily.

****** Okay, so this is a bit of a stretch, I admit, but I think an even bigger stretch is that, as Zorian suspects, he got a functional copy of the marker broken in /just/ the right way to get around its copy protection entirely by accident. It sounds as likely as when you flipped two random bits in a binary and got around copy protection in a game without meaning to, which I believe would be vanishingly unlikely.

I envision the following scenario:

1. Everything is as it appears, Zach brags, the lich responds thinking exactly what he is saying, and then starts the soul melding process.
2. While he's doing that, he notices a weird marker. He examines it, finds lots of copy protection, intricate work not commonly seen. Then he remembers an old tale about the sovereign gate and time loops, remembers that the loop is supposed to start during planet alignment, which is exactly now, and puts the pieces together. "That would explain what the guy was saying even better. Can I get around this protection?" he wonders, and alters whatever he's doing to try to replicate the marker in Zorian whithout triggering the copy protection mechanisms. Being the best necromancer around, he succeeds. Zorian seems not harmed significantly.
3. Then he decides to copy the marker into himself. But first he needs to make sure that if he does something wrong, he will have another chance. So he tries to modify Zach to become his loyal servant / stamps some notes into his soul and adds a mental compulsion to visit him next time he wakes up / does something else invasive to Zach's soul that trips the anti-tampering protection that triggers a new loop.

Now, I'm not entirely convinced by this theory (this giant coincidence is the basis of the whole story and might be excused as selection bias -- we wouldn't even have a story if it hadn't happened), but it is narratively compelling as well -- seems like a neat twist. Though this latest chapter did lower my evaluation of the probability of this theory a lot.

If the marker is copied such that copies of it completely cover the surface of the Controller's soul, the only way it could fail is if the entire soul were completely obliterated at once, which is impossible because souls can't be destroyed by soul magic---only altered.

** There's still something about 'mana cores' we don't know about.

-the Pearl of Aranhal 'boasts an experimental power core'

-Silverlake's home is in area with weak ambient mana - too weak for her heavy wards + maintaining medium sized pocket dimension

-Silverlake claims that 'the whole orb is potentially achievable through familiar mortal magic. Yes, even the power source thing.'

The airship could potentially have crystallized mana engine - just more advanced than trains. Silverlake's home could run on souls - whatever. But I don't think either of the two mentioned things powers the orb. So what is the secret?

So to summarize what we know about increasing your available mana:

1) Using souls of others -to power magic items (Z&Z won't use) - either killed people or already 'prepared' souls (from soul-eating plants, or stealing from necromancers (from Sudomirs wards...)).

2) Engines running on crystallized mana (too risky for combat, very easy for enemies to detonate once they know what they're dealing with).

3) Some unknown power source (definitely used in orb, maybe in Silverlake's cottage?).

^ all those should give you unattuned mana - only for magic items (=items with preset spells)

4) Divine blessing - enhancing your soul (icosahedron+soul magic around your soul which stabilizes it). Enhances both maximum mana and mana regeneration (by the same factor).

5) Your own mana battery (which is recharged when you don't use mana and the stored mana is kept attuned). Enhances maximum mana, but doesn't change mana regeneration.

^ these two should give you mana to use as you please.

The interesting thing about the crown is that the mana remains attained to the mage.

*** It's possible that the mana could be being drawn somehow from deep within the dungeon. If there was a way to get past the way the deep dungeon interferes with teleportation/dimensionalism spells (perhaps with a stabilization frame like the Bakora gates or the Ibaasan's gates) then the high ambient mana could easily be siphoned though a dimensional gate to power a pocket dimension, warding scheme or airship.

There would be a risk of some magical creature coming along and destroying whatever used to stabilize the gate (if anything is needed) on the dungeon side, but that can be mitigated by having multiple gates for backup. The other risk would be the creature using the gate to attack you, but that could be reduced by making the gate very small - just big enough to suck mana through, but not big enough for anything to enter - or having other defenses against magical creatures.

Even the angels are basically drawing upon certain blessings and mechanisms left to to them by the gods rather than being innately capable of it themselves.

No new tier magic. Maybe one can learn something from it, but no way to influence it. It is very unlikely that bakora gates are created with divine magic so don't think it will influence it a lot.

I also think that 2x multiplier is for massive mana pool people like QI or Zach and 2x rate is a massive simplification so it is easier to understand for people how this blessing works. All it does it stabilizes the mana. Chances are it would give larger boost for smaller mana pools (lets say 5x, more) since the smaller pools are easier to stabilize.

From what we know, their current magnitudes (in terms of magic missiles) are:

- QI: ~250
- Zach: ~232 (can he cast invisible ones now?)
- Zorian: ~35 (also before he could cast invisible ones)

If QI says that the crown makes his reserves 10 times larger, that would mean the capacity of the crown would be ~2250 magic missiles (in terms of people who can cast missiles effectively).

Fully trained mage in area with sufficient ambient mana can fully restore their mana in 30 minutes. So Zach or QI wearing crown can fully restore in 5 hours, while Zorian would need about 40 hours.

**** think of it like material science, in which each sort of distinct magical energy is a material used to build something. mana is used to build common spells, and is also burnt to power them. sometimes physical materials are used (in spell formula) to support and stabilize things made of mana. primordials seems to be made of something distinct as well, as primordial essence is used to create some effects which the story suggests are not possibly with normal magic alone. souls are made of something different. It is only detectable using soul sight, and it clearly has different properties from mana - it doesn't seem to be usable to make any sort of spells, it can nourish spirits and magical creatures who consume it, it can produce mana, and it can be made functionally indestructible (this is assuming only one magical material is used to make souls, which might not be the case). divine power seems to be another distinct sort of building material. the frame around QI's soul is made from it, which means that it can apparently be made into something which can stabilize soul material. its other important quality is that it cannot be detected even through typical use of soul sight. this is the important quality which potentially reveals the mechanism for many things in this world which weren't yet explained: the perfect ability of divine artifacts to resist any sort of magical analysis, the perfect concealment of the bakora gate spirits. there may be more, but those come to mind mainly because they are both perfect concealment effects. it seems to me that an excellent reason for why these things cannot be detected is if they are created entirely from this divine power material. I am not suggesting that any mortals would be able to do much with divine power, but that the bakora gate ritual might be the key to developing an interface to detect and interact with existing divine constructs.

also, bakora gates require some obscure means of contacting the gate spirit which is unknown to modern magic as well as a convenient means of mentally communicating with the spirit to receive and transmit the gate code. that is quite a high bar of personal ability and one which humans don't meet. plus they are extremely widespread, meaning that whoever built them probably was not a small, elite group but instead a population. if they weren't made by and for gods, I am not entirely sure what sort of horrifyingly powerful entities they were made for.

***** You are looking at the wrong material science. For me the best analogue for mana would be science related to electrical networks (EN). Not sure if you had any exposure.

Souls are... well, mana sources. So in EN think of them as of generators/energy sources. Mana shaping or magic formulas are the pathways to limit the flow. A schema in EN. you think what you need to do and you start designing schema. At least I'd think author had some inspiration for electrical networks. Unstructured magic/mana shaping exercises allow you create such schemas on the fly. Some time ago (like 25-30 years), the domestic appliances like TVs came with their own EN schemas attached. If something was broken and you were knowledgeable enough, you could fix the item.

Mind magic - the best analogue would be networking/pcs. You find the node you are interested in, check the ports, perform some remote flaw exploiting technics and you are intruded on someone elses PC (mind) and you either steal stuff or just mess everything up (mind bomb). There are different OSes (aranea / whatever), so the approach for different species is a bit different.

For soul magic I cannot come up with exact analogue, but it's something like electromagnetism. The changes in electromagnetic field phases/whatever can generate electricity. You can see electromagnetic fields. The soul well is the huge electromagnet which tries to pulls various random electromagnetic entities (souls). If you can see magnetic fields, it is much easier to avoid impact.

Now the divine magic is something totally different. It's like metal making industry, where gods can build a factory and do some heavy metal working (like building metal pots, spoons, knives, whatever). The general public (or even the lesser forms) can put some use to it, can maybe break the stuff, but have no way to the metal furnaces to create something from metal. Angels that left are able to create something like blessing because it's like form created by gods, and they have access to furnace, so they can fill it with hot metal and know how to cool it, can produce something.

While someone can get some aspirations (like try to create knife from stone or whatever), the science for this is way beyond and there's no way to replicate the whole industry until you ascend from ant/critter to the god level and then you may start fiddling with industrial stuff.

Can you understand hardness of diamond without microscope, without knowledge of atomic structure, etc. I guess the similar limits apply understanding divine magic.

As for contacting gate spirits, the easily understood material networking technique is "port knock". If you want to connect to something on port you need D, first you need to contact port a, wait a second, contact port b, wait two second contact port c. Only if you follow the correct prior sequence, connection to port d will be accepted. No need for divine magic.

****** I admit that I am familiar with electromagnetism and fundamental electronics only, any deeper disciplines in that branch of science/engineering are not within my purview. the main problem with looking at mana like electricity at all is that electricity always needs a medium. mana can be used to construct things all on its own. that's what spells are. that comparison would hold water if, in this world, mages needed some sort of physical object to cast magic - a staff or wand or similar item. spells, however, stand on their own. mana is not electricity-like, it is much more like a building material that can also be consumed for energy.

looking at divine works as if they were steel is a perfect analogy for what I was trying to convey, if steel were also impossible to perceive normally. I've made small batches of crucible steel, so I am familiar with what a pain it is. you can understand the hardness of a diamond (or steel for that matter) by simply inspecting it. you cannot understand why it is so hard without a deeper understanding and better tools (tools which, in this case rest in the hands of the gods alone).

perhaps you misunderstood my statement. I do not think that Zorian will at any point be capable of "casting divine magic" or anything like that. that doesn't seem like it is a thing at all. I am suggesting that, through this lead, they may gain the ability to detect and scrutinize existing divine works, which will put them head and shoulders above anyone else in terms of making use of them.

regarding gate spirits, the problem is that with networking, things are arranged into neat little routes, with no real analogue for free space. if there is no connection between two points, you can never move between them. this allows many schemes in which it is very easy to occlude things. this pattern does not hold for the reality of the MoL world. generally, when you have power in some field, you can detect that thing. at the very least you can detect the existence of a thing. the ability to hide the existence of something is generally not all-encompassing. invisibility spells work imperfectly and work through optical trickery - there are no illusions that 'make the area look empty' directly. methods of reducing the detectability of a magic item are still limited to reducing its profile, not hiding it entirely. hiding from soul perception also seems to reduce visibility rather than hiding entirely (as red robe was still able to find Zorian eventually), and pocket dimensions can also be detected by those who know enough about them, despite their normally hidden state. telepaths using 'normal' skills can reduce or inflate their telepathic signature, but not disappear entirely. 'going dark' and mind blank seem to be the only other examples of any sort of perfect effect, and there seem to be some dire drawbacks and oddly specific techniques to make use of them. I would be shocked if something deeper was not at work with that. so given all that - knowing that a spirit exists, knowing how to detect spirits/souls, how to detect minds, how to spot a pocket dimension if it is hiding in one, and still not being able to detect the spirit without this specific and obscure spell? that isn't a security protocol using known magic, that's something outside it.

******* I overgeneralized a lot as well. I was talking about spell formulas / crafting. The tools which allows you feed it with your mana and you don't need to do anything else. What I meant it really translates very well into our general technology. So those schemas relate only to crafting and mana is energy which powers such constructs as electricity powers out technology.

And yes, I totally agree that mana is much more different than electricity.

Divine magic is very very interesting topic. (There are at least two more: spell formulas of aranea. medical magic). But Z&Z are on very very short time. Zorian needs to improve his soul magic ASAP as much as possible (if you'd see my other speculation about soul bonds), also continue into dimensionalism studies. They are out of time and connot fork larger amount attention to the studies of these subjects. At this stage we can just speculate on this fantastical topic.

The reason why QI was able to spot divine construction - he should have a VERY VERY ADVANCED soul magic/perception. And even with high skill like this he was barely able to detect this divine construct. I would also think he noticed soul strain of divine magic. The different strain of divine magic should be applied to physical forms and I'm not sure what kind of perception one needs to detect structure of divine enhancement. The general detection seems to be easy enough - otherwise people wouldn't distinguish divine items easily like this. But unfortunately I don't think we will see any headway into this...

As a side note to this all divine stuff I also like how the author used the modern myth "the stuff they were producing in the past was better quality than today". This argument is destroyed by statement "they made a lot of crap in the past and only quality items survived so you get a quality bias".

talking about networking and gate spirits, I can point out to dedicated private network. What is even more likely - master gate we don't know of which is handling the connections between all the nodes. The mechanism similar to Zorian uses to exchange information between his simulacrums using his soul. the soul/mind connections are idle and since there is no traffic you cannot detect anything. There is a single soul overlooking whole network, while each remote node has its identification (like simulacrum 3 for Zorian). And via soul links separate gates can communicate/coordinate with opening gate. It is simple explanation and if you rely on argument like Occams razor it is more likely than divine craft.

that gate network method is some pretty good thinking. are you an engineer by any chance? let me make sure I understand what you are suggesting: there is a single gate spirit which is capable of producing dimensional gates, creating simulacrums and using its soul to communicate with them, using mind blank, and communicate mentally with (at a minimum) humans and aranea. the gate overlord spirit is somewhere, it ultimately doesn't matter where. it creates and permanently maintains a simulacrum for each gate frame. when some specific signal is received at a gate frame, it reveals itself and contacts the person who sent the signal to find out the address of the target gate. it then contacts the overlord to coordinate with the simulacrum at the target gate, and the two simulacrums communicate through the overlord to produce the dimensional passage. that's actually a really nice solution, especially considering Silverlake's insistence that massive mana batteries are within the reach of mortal magics, which would allow a spirit to support so many simulacrums indefinitely.

********* The sovereign gates only deals with souls anyways. The original zach soul was transferred into machine. The rest of souls were copied together with bodies. When Zach will exit (administrative mode), his soul will be transferred back to his original body. So it is very unlikely there will be a solution which involves anything else besides soul entities.

I'm not a tech. engineer, I suppose I like puzzles.

Yes, I think that generic design for gates is like you've described. I'd say some little details are different. Like: The main soul/gate would be actually the one under Cyoria mana hole and has terribly large original mana pool + ultra divine blessing. Cyoria - because the largest mana hole, so the best place for original/central/modified soul to regenerate mana.

Remote gates are designed so that simulacra upkeep is the minimal (like Zorian cut his upkeep with golem design). This design takes it to extremes. There is no mind blank - the gate would be reachable via mental contact, but specific engagement sequence / port knock is either unique for each gate or same for every node. Each gate node is very passive+gate specific design makes it very difficult to notice that there's soul (or simulacra) present. We didn't hear any comment from a mage with a very well developed soul sight though.

I'm not sure there's a need for mana battery, however remote node have "limited" mana allowance from coordinating node - that's why for gate to open, enough local ambient mana concentration have to be present. It is possible that there is a mana battery present which absorbs ambient mana. By using crystallized mana aranea hasten mana absorbtion process.

But, as always, the author might have designed it some other different fashion. However such design we are discussing here makes a lot of sense.

** One mystery is unraveled (the Zach 2x mana - divine blessing), but conspiracy/background story got even more complex. According to QI the angels are really stingy with divine blessings - the forces behind putting Zach into looping (or opposing to it) are very heavyweight. I don't think it's a "compassion/compensation" due to loss from weeping from church/angels.

The whole interacting with QI avenu gives options of easily slipping "banish lich" trojan horse. Come to his location, ask him to trade knowledge. give him divine dagger, ask some questions, get some knowledge. give him another three items to choose from, all of them booby trapped - he might pick it up out of curiosity and they would easily gain a crown.

I've got some pet theories I'd like to share as well. The current main problem for Zorian is how to get out of the loop. And the funny thing is the author already explained how this happened ages ago. It's... souls bond. The Zach and Zorian will bound their souls, with Zach being as anchor. They already got soul fragments and machine does not care much about souls. So as soon as they get full key unlocked, Zorian should be able to piggy back on Zach to the real world. There's plenty of literature to research (including massive library he found hidden but never read up in Knyazov Dveri on his search for soul mages. Looking how rational everything is and heavy foreshadowing from author I'll be really surprised is the anything else will pop up as means to escape loop for Zorian. This level of trickery - huge approval from me. Nice done.

As for current invaders/QI dilemma, there is actual solution for the problem as well. Let me elaborate on this a bit more. The problem for Ulquaan Ibasa / necromancers is they live in very bad location. Nothern bare islands (cold/etc). Also the necromancers are not welcome due to well... undeads, etc. The solution Z&Z can come up with for the big shots of Ibasa - create a gate to Blantyrre (preferably the furthest away region) with QI and migrate everyone from there. Blantyrre is ruled by lizardman. Previous attempts to conquer it failed spectacularly. By flying the ship to Blantyrre, getting portal open with Arachna in the closest side, then finding the furthest away portal and getting password from there - Zorian needs to open gate for QI in there and offer: I'll open the gate for you, you transfer your operational gate to blantyrre instead from Cyoria and conquer that continent. No one gives a damn (besides some local lizardmen). Win-win-win (besides huge loss for lizardmen, but who cares about them ;) )

Both soul bonding and un-bonding techniques exist. The domination thing is a longer term issue - they would need to bond for a very short term. As who would dominate who - no clear answer. There wouldn't be any attempt to dominate since they already have enough trust. In the end even if Zach got more fighting instincts, Zorian is much more subtle. It's like woman vs man - man is the head, woman is the neck and she just makes sure the head is looking at the right direction.

The Machine would replace current Zach soul (with all extras, including bonded souls) because it is designed to do so. Zorian would need to do something about his original copy soul/body, since he would need to take over. Looking at the foreshadowing Zorian is preparing for this already. I didn't see a lot of low hanging fruit in this novel.

I'm pretty sure even with the key they won't be able to leave both. The machine was pretty strict about modifying/replacing the souls other than for operator. There might be no need for soul bonding, but looking at how the novel is built/designed from start, the exiting should make a LOT of sense. and for me - soul bond is the most RATIONAL choice.

So theoretically the Guardian should let them out once they have the Key - one of them, at least. Exactly what will happen depends on how the Gate handles itself in an inconsistent state. Complications include:

- Red Robe has already left. Which body did he land in, his own or Zach's?
- What happens to the Key after they use it? Will the one left behind be able to reuse it to un-bar the Gate a second time? Will he get reset and have to collect it again?

***** Mind blank is a disconnect from 'the great web', which means there is nothing for mind magic to target. A dispell is just regular ol magic. Mind blank won't protect you from being physically targeted by other magic.

In the early chapters, in the classroom when they discuss dispelling, Ilsa says "Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course. This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting"

She also says shortly after when the students try to dispell the magically started fire "This is another weakness of disruptor spells. They break down mana constructs, but any fundamentally non-magical effects caused by the spell are unaffected..."

I am curious to know if Mind Blank is one of the exceptions that falls under 'virtually all', but I still think it should be able to dispelled if it's a magically maintained effect.

******** you are mixing up transformation potions with perception potions.

Transformation was explained like clothes over the soul. You just wear different clothes temporary. Nochka and any other shifter have two set of clothes over the soul so they can easily switch them. Transformation potion gives temporary clothing. So most likely soul clothes would match the breed of cat it was made from.

With perception potions you gain additional sense on your current clothes. We've seen some combinations from via grey hunter. Some of the potions were created from parts of grey hunter which were responsible for like magic perception, the others vibrations.

Killing kittens would involve is someone wanted to create transformation potion (soul clothes). Chopping them up would include if you'd want to get one of their senses (like hearing/vision) for any human.

I think I've shared my opinion already. The better answer could be provided by author. From what I've read/recall you provide body to alchemist/potionmaster and then they brew potions from it. The process was never defined as well as quantity. I would assume from one sample body more than one transformation potion would be created (but not sure if it really linked to the size). Also the grey part on this whole potion creating business is - most likely efficiency should be better if specimen is alive while potion is being created/extracted from it (if the current soul is present) - but that's just a educated guess for me.

What I'd like to see for amusement would be creating transformation potion from a big cat (e.g., panther) and giving it to both kirille/nochka.

I guess in a way it's a great way to create fan fiction. There is very little fanfiction about this - so I would suggest just try to write up some how nochka and kirille steals some crystalised mana from under the bed, buys cat transformation potions and cause trouble/fights cranium rats/whatever and are known as bad ass cat duo during one particular restart. Great way to amuse oneself especially if you are fan. Not many people are asking questions like this, author is for sure don't have time to side stories/fillers. I'm pretty sure he'd even give some pointers after you create a draft.

It is a bit of catch 22 in this particular case. Since you cannot influence person via mind magic, the only other means are other mental inputs (like vision/smell/sound). It seems one would need to overwhelm some other senses - and I'd argue that technically this is not a dispelling. At best you can call it indirect dispelling.

Contrasting this attitude with the Zorian that exists outside the time loop shows just how much he has changed. I can imagine the previous Zorian arranging for himself to leave the country, with a minimal effort to try to get his brother Fortov to safety (so he can say that he tried).

In regards to the incoming war, I'm interested in how Zorian will react when it starts. Though it is unlikely that the story will cover it, it has repeatedly hinted that the current peace cannot last. Zorian might not believe that war will come but his perceptive is skewed.

Many things are being set up for this particular loop. Hopefully their intereaction with QI will be fruitful since they can't afford to contact him like that in each loop: he is unpredictable and might attack them instead if they're not careful.
