Is there any place I can read a summary of the plot up to the current chapter? I just don't have the time to reread the entire thing but I would really like to keep reading the updates.


** I think there is a wiki being build up, which will feature a summary. Correct me, if I am wrong.

*** It sounds like OP has already read the first chapters, but forgotten exactly what happened. And I think in general reading things you've already read is less fun than the first time, even if you've forgotten significant amounts.

*** Because then you can join the discussions, while the discussion threads to old chapters are dead, or many of the topics have been resolved in the text, etc.

I have sometimes done this, when updates came out faster than I could get up to date.

***** I do too. Other people may have other perspectives on what was written. I feel like I can get a more complete experience that way.
