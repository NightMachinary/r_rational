** What if a man from the Upper Paleolithic survived until the present day?

The Man from Earth is about a group of college professors and a grad student sitting together in a cabin during an intimate going-away party. They contemplate the plausibility of their departing professor friend's story: witnessing thousands of years of human progress first-hand.

One of the most down-to-earth depictions of a seemingly immortal man in movie history.

*** I love this movie. I've watched it several times, which confuses and bores the shit out of my wife.

My favorite mechanic in the film is that they are guessing, speculating, and then arguing over the validity of their theories.

***** I'm surprised it failed. I saw it when it was just released and thought it would mash it's goal.

****** They said they're going to restart the campaign soon though, [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1759006687/the-man-from-earth-ii-man-from-earth-millennium/posts][in the update]].

They have everything in place only they're not sure whether to do this through Kickstarter, or something like IndieGoGo where there is a definite transfer of funds.

*** My apologies -- I tried using a proxy from Dallas, Texas and that does seem to be the case.

Maybe you guys could also use a free proxy service? I have found [[http://www.proxfree.com][Proxfree]] (try France) to be generally reliable myself.. Or you could download the film somewhere -- [[http://torrentfreak.com/producer-thanks-pirates-for-stealing-his-film-071113][the producer heartily approves of it being torrented]].

I'd really appreciate if someone could dig up a link that works.. :/
