** So it seems like it would be better not to include Silverlake in future attempts at getting all the artifacts, because Alanic was surprisingly effective at fighting QI, who will be a huge challenge to get past. I'm not totally clear on what benefit Silverlake gives for getting the pieces of the key. Traps for QI maybe, but Zorian is better at wards than her so she won't be much help for the dagger. If the sun Temple is a straightforward combat challenge, losing the use of Alanic would be rather harmful.

For defending the Pearl, I think Zach is much better than Zorian for taking down opposing ships. Artillery spells arent always optimal because of how slow they are. For Zach, he can now make simulacra that can teleport. Simply have a simulacrum teleport on top of the airship, and fire piercing artillery spells down on it. Losing one of Zach's simulacra doesn't matter too much because they are the ectoplasm kind, and thus don't represent as large an investment of resources as Zorian's.

This could be a rather good tactic for a couple different situations. Have a simulacra start casting a huge artillery spell, and then teleport it to wherever you want a crater to be instead of an opponent just before it finishes. Or just load it down with alchemical bombs for a similar effect. Might not work if they're not willing to suicide themselves though.

*** Silverlake is your highly capable yet highly annoying member of the conspiracy. The default attitude toward her is to not involve her at group ops. But this theft, and its subsequent operations, is big deal. It's discourteous to left anybody out, so Zorian and Zach willing to give her a chance. This is the first, is it not? So yeah, without immense contribution later on, Z&Z might won't bother to involve her again.

I don't believe I understand this sentence. Artillery spell is devastating (no point for additional alchemical bomb there), but require static target. Do you suggest using dimensional gate so that it can hit moving large objects like airplane? Zorian's simulacrum stated that even 'just' teleporting between moving platform is challenging. I imagine the difficulty of operating dimensional passage would be insurmountable.

Why do you think it requires a static target?

******* Agreed. Alternatively, fire into a dimensional gate that, for example, opens up on some important part of the ship.

My guess, though, is that these airships are magically protected to be able to take artillery magic to a degree, so teleporting aboard and wrecking shit from the inside is more feasible.

"Well, simulacrum two opened a hole in the hull."

The shielding could defend against massive attacks but not weak ones---essentially like a /non-Newtonian fluid/.

#+end_quote

Does he?

It seems like breaking and entering is the path of most resistance. Why not diplomatically groundhog attack the royal family instead of breaking into the vaults?

I don't see why the royal family would be an order of magnitude more difficult to convince than Silverlake or Xvim or the Aranea (who cost multiple entire cycles each), and nothing is saying that they have to stop trying to break in while they convince the royal family. The royal family is the most likely of anyone to have time-traveler-contingency-codes and is also far more useful for getting things done once they're convinced. It seems like something that that Zach Noveda, Last of House Noveda, Prodigy Archmage, Slayer of the Dragon Oganj could be able to pull off with enough tries.

Their current 8+ man party is good, but an entire nation is a hell of a lot better.

--------------

Similarly, it seems odd that they haven't tried to use diplomancy on QI at all. They know it can be done since RR did it, and it would open up huge capabilities for backstabbing QI. Yes, he is very very very scary, but talking to him is not much more risky than the Aranea mindbreaking Zorian before he learned mind magic or how they're trusting Silverlake right now.

As the Ghost Serpent and Silverlake and the Aranea and literally everyone else they've ever opened up to has mentioned, it is a literally unbeatable tactic. And unlike the Ghost Serpent who wants nothing they have to offer, QI is making a very desperate and expensive gambit right now and could use all the help he can get.

Silverlake is also not openly malicious. I don't think she'd mangle the soul of a kid for telling her a tall tale.

On the other hand, QI could utterly twist their soul on a whim and he just might. He is utterly terrifying. Who knows what he'd see if he had time to causally look at the soul of a controller? What if he looked at Zorian's soul? Would he notice scarring that makes him think he caused the scarring?

No, I think befriending QI is a huge risk.

QI is a big risk, but since they can now reset the time loop instantly or even negotiate via simulacra, he's not much more of a risk. It's probably less of a risk in absolute terms to try to talk to him than to face him in battle.

Nah, there's no way a normal teenager would attempt to kill a grey hunter after reading up on it. And there's no way a normal teenager would intentionally find a grey hunter without learning about it first. If the teenager is dumb, then yeah, Silverlake made a dick move. However, like me, she probably doubted a dumb teenager would have been able to find her in the first place.

And if Zorian was a looper as he claimed, then fighting a grey hunter isn't actually that dangerous.

And yes, she could soul damage them, but so could Alanic. They put a /lot/ of trust in him because he seems okay. Kael had recommended Silverlake to Zorian, so they probably view her as annoying but not life- or soul-threatening.

As for using simulacra to talk to QI, I don't think that's any safer. Simulacra are still attached to the owner's soul.

I don't know; I just feel parlay with QI is incredibly dangerous, even more dangerous than facing him in battle where QI is more likely to be too busy to examine their souls up close.

However, you make a good point that Red Robe did it without fear. But maybe they knew each other from before the loop and so RR was comfortable enough with it.

Depression is unlikely make a teenager trapeze through the woods hunting stuff and looking for a witch so he can beg her for help with soul magic, spend time as the witch's apprentice, then go kill himself attacking a spider he wouldn't be able to find in the first place to do research.

Case in point, pre-loop why wasn't Zach going around adventuring like a daredevil? Because he was barely even a mage who was struggled to even keep up and was probably suffering from depression.

But there's something I keep forgetting to mention: Silverlake spent time with Zorian and could observe his temperament. I'd wager this influenced her decision.

She may be self-interested, but I don't think she'd send an innocent person to their death for absolutely no reason. I think she honestly thought he'd abandon the project as soon as he learned what a grey hunter was.

QI stealing information is a concern, but Zorian is probably creative enough to set up a way to know that it happened in time for him and Zach to kill themselves before QI got to them. With adequate precautions, it wouldn't be the worst idea to spend a restart or two trying it out, since it could easily take multiple restarts to defeat him and take the crown anyway.

****** It's not stated directly, but it seems fairly obvious given the evidence we've seen.

- Current top candidate for RR is Veyers. And if not Veyers, it's both narratively and statistically unlikely to be some 2nd tier Ibasan lich.
- RR was feeding QI future information.\\
- QI didn't know that RR was timelooping, which means that RR knew him well enough (likely via timetravel) to convince him without playing that card.
- RR had good relationship with QI, enough that he got him to come personally and QI was quipping with him. He was not /just/ an asset.\\
- RR had been helping the invasion for a great many loops, meaning he'd been in QI's confidences for a ton loops as well.
- RR knows obscure magics including mind magic and soul magic.
- RR also knows the very hard to get simulacrum spell (which all liches know, and it's a plot point on how hard it is to find) and the portal spell (which at a long distance is an Ibasan only spell).

The most straightforward answer is that RR was using his future knowledge to get QI to tutor him (or tutor him by proxy, like Matriarch/Novelty did with Zorian).

I suspect Alanic's reform included submitting to some kind of magically enforced oath of service to the church/good/law. They (the church or the state or whoever) allowed this because they could see how useful Alanic (including all necromancy knowledge) would be on the side of the law.

This would explain why Alanic is trusted to command such resources; because he is highly competent and the magical oath gives strong assurance he is acting for the common good. Alanic is like a Lensman of the MoL universe.

That said earlier he heard that magical oaths have become more or less useless in the modern era of magic as modern magic's versatility makes it far to easy to override them. But considering the nature of the power base the royals and church no doubt have, oaths might still be of value to them for select individuals they wish to keep on a leash as with their resources they may be able to check that those people are still under an oath. Thus it may be that if this is the case the royals are a group he literally can not oppose. I'm not sure this is the case but the idea itself is quite interesting.

** So conflict between Silverlake and Alanic huh they certainly are the sort of characters where I thought there might be tension/distrust between but I didn't expect outright conflict to be their reaction there is definitely a colorful history there. Both are useful allies and probably essential to pull off the escape(Silverlake especially if the keys don't work) But Alanic is probably right that Silverlake isn't really trustworthy(even if I suspect his views are somewhat tinted by past dealings with her) she is definitely looking for anything she can use as extra leverage and her secret coded notes definitely contain secrets. I suspect like the Spider queen from the early on(I can't remember their title/name been too long:P )She will want to do something beyond what she says such as looking to escape the loop as well or perhaps to sneakily get something she hasn't been able to get before abusing the loop. After all she is a very crafty one... I still remember the Grey Hunter. >_>

That said Alanic may be out regarding the treasury heist but he still seems to be amiable to the rest but that part will definitely need some extra care during the heist if they go that route. That said I'm not convinced the royals can't be reasoned with, assuming they could convince them in a reasonable time table that is, which would be a gamble so I can see why it might be a problem here

As for the airship that was an interesting jacking with lots of room for improvement though I am skeptical that it will be as useful in raiding the royal treasury as they seem to think right now. I would certainly prefer to deal with QI than that place as you at least have some idea what your dealing with there where as the royal treasury carries a very high unknown risk given the extreme degree of paranoia proofed defenses they seem to have yeah I'd only go for that after the others.

So correction - this is the first time Zorian is killing people who aren't either evil, hired by someone evil, or non-human persons.

The only instinctive-moral barrier left for him is attacking non-combatants (and barely even that - because both the Arana and the airship defenders were primarily acting in defense of territory and material resources. So they arguably only became "combatants" because Zorian sort of forced them to be combatants, which is an awful lot like attacking non-combatants.

The thing about gathering keys tho, if author want it to be a failure, Zorian would left without plan B. Then we will spend quite sometimes to develop another way out. If author want it to be a complete success, it would be cheap. You see, all your plan working out is not a great way to build a story.
