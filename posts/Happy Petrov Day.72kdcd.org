** So, I'm happy and all that the world didn't end, but I'm not sure this deserves much attention.

The system he was monitoring was new, and the reports looked anomalous. As anyone who has had to deal with the deployment of new systems knows, there are bound to be bugs. Suppose that Petrov had done the right thing and passed along the report along with his suspicions. The next person would probably have asked how likely it was to be a system glitch, and made the same choice.

The fact is that it wasn't his job to make the decision. I'm glad he was on the Soviet's side and not mine.

*** But then again, the USSR at the time, and especially its military, had a chronic culture of avoiding responsibility at all costs due to a history of draconic and arbitrary punishments. It's not inconceivable that many people in the chain would be repulsed from making a decision as opposed to passing the buck, and eventually, the highest political leadership would be told the latest and greatest flawless early-warning system has unambiguously detected a US first strike.

*** Respectfully, I disagree.

Per [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov#Incident][wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  He felt that his civilian training helped him make the right decision. He said that his colleagues were all professional soldiers with purely military training and, following instructions, would have reported a missile strike if they had been on his shift.

  There is some confusion as to precisely what Petrov's military role was in this incident. Petrov, as an individual, was not in a position where he could single-handedly have launched any of the Soviet missile arsenal. His sole duty was to monitor satellite surveillance equipment and report missile attack warnings up the chain of command; top Soviet leadership would have decided whether to launch a retaliatory attack against the West. But Petrov's role was crucial in providing information to make that decision. According to Bruce Blair, a Cold War nuclear strategies expert and nuclear disarmament advocate, formerly with the Center for Defense Information, "The top leadership, given only a couple of minutes to decide, told that an attack had been launched, would make a decision to retaliate."

Sure, most people nowadays assume that new computerized systems are bound to have bugs - but in 1983 Russia? I don't know that I would trust a higher up military official, who lacked Petrov's technical background, to consider that as a likely possibility.
