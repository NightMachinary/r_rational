This isn't a criticism of rational writing, I'm just curious if anyone has anything to unload. I feel like this may help writers if they know of what to avoid writing.

For me, my major pet peeve is the stat-like, mad lib approach to character creation, as if every character was made from some type of data form. Being good at X instead of Y and wanting A instead of B doesn't make different characters.


** Some stories try too hard to make their 'rationalist' character be the smartest in the room, much smarter than all those stupid scientists who dedicate their lives to the study of a subject. By applying absolutely basic logic, the main character determines a glaring flaw in the core of their practice and is praised as a genius.

It only shows the weakness of the author, and how huge their ego is.

******* Nightlord series is great for this. The main character is often, by far, the smartest man in the room. His crippling inferiority complex and lack of social awareness often form the root of his issues. The trope of the absentminded scientist plays out...but it doesn't /feel/ like a trope since the character is so obviously enjoying playing with ideas that he just honestly did build a potentially world destroying device without thinking about the consequences....oops. But even when he misses the small, normal, person to person interactions, the reasons why people like/respect/love him, he catches the larger social interactions. Why a group of people would do x or y under certain situations.

The character feels /real/ in other words. More, /every/ character has this type of thing going on. Each has a personality and history, drives, wants, and wishes. Each acts accordingly, no one feels like a cookie cut out.

His evil bad guys are a bit less nuanced, but even that has improved in later books.

You can have almost any amount of unrealistic luck /as long as it happens before the start of the story/. Think of the story's world as a thing that exists before the story is written - and then the author picks which character to follow. It's natural for them to pick the most interesting character, and the most interesting character probably has a non-standard background and isn't average. (Think of it as a form of the anthropic principle)

** A lack of realism. Or rather, a failure to make the world and challenges feel *real*.

Eliezer Yudkowsky once remarked that first-person stories like Dreaming of Sunshine feel more rational because it forces the author to view everything from the MCs eyes: What would /they/ do in that situation? What biases might they experience? What real-life challenges might they face? It makes the obstacles feel more real, and that makes the payoff from a clever solution that much more rewarding.

Instead, many authors treat their stories as text book problems. They look at the problem from god's POV, ask themselves what the optimal solution is, and then simply have the MC do that and let it work.

A related problem is a failure to appreciate what made the canon attractive to read in the first place. For example, authors will make Naruto ‘smart' by having him read a ton of books, without realizing that this completely changes the dynamic of his team. Without the central tension between Naruto and Sasuke, the driving force of the plot is gone and the whole thing starts to feel like wish fulfillment.

This is only a problem if they try [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][still using the old plot and tension devices]] after the changes they've made. If they adjust the genre and spirit of the story accordingly, this doesn't have to be a problem.

Using the same example, all these canon's inefficient bickering and conflict resolutions were there, because content like that was interesting to the readerbase. And since with a rational story the audience itself has different preferences, putting all these [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][conflicts balls]] back in wouldn't work.

Is it unrealistic for a 12-13 year old to make seemingly too optimised decisions for his age and have high emotional control? Maybe it is in real world (haven't looked up any potentially existing research on this), but this is the author's world --- if he says chakra (or HP's magic, etc) enhances the mind, then it does. The problem that remains is to keep the story self-consistent with this introduced rule (e.g. with all other things being equal, all chakra-wielding children of the same talent will be getting the same intelligence boost, not just the MC).

**** Right, there's nothing intrinsically *wrong* with deviating from the canon, but it's a problem if you don't realize the consequences to the overall story. Specifically, it's worth remembering that when you write rational fanfiction, you're still mainly writing for readers who enjoyed the original.

So for example, in HPMOR Harry is completely different from canon, but it still *feels* like you're reading a Harry Potter book because all of the wonder and the magic is still there. Imagine if instead Harry was completely uncaring about magic because he just saw it as a tool to be used. It wouldn't be appealing at all.

And that's the big advantage of writing an author tract: Sure, the fact that Harry is basically Eliezer can make it feel a bit preachy, but at least you get to feel like there's a real human being experiencing these things. And that's also why the SPHEW arc feels weakest: Aside from being tacked on, it doesn't feel *real* because they're just a bunch of events that happen for the sake of plot.

The contrast with the Azkeban arc could not be starker: There, you have the constant sense that anything could happen at any moment. As a reader you know that Harry is not going to die, but it *feels* like he might because the whole thing is written from the perspective of a real human being who has placed himself in that situation. You can tell that Eliezer felt the visceral horror of the dementors while he was writing. And for rational fiction, that sense of realness is essential. After all, if you're not going to connect your writing to the real world, then you might as well just write regular fiction.

*** I blame HPMOR for that. The founding example of rational fiction has a character who rarely questions his prior knowledge or, say, do an actual experiment that isn't just applying his super special knowledge he has from being so much more enlightened than everyone else. I was expecting a story where Harry shot spells through slits to see if they're a particle or wave (or neither), that is definitely not what happened.

An example of where HPJEV should have questioned his assumptions but didn't: McGonagall turned into a cat with a cat brain, but kept a human mind. This implies the mind may not exist within the brain like he thought, but he keeps on assuming something like a soul has to be impossible and doesn't even consider the possibility he might be wrong (because EY has correctly deduced this is the case IRL doesn't mean it has to be that in the story, or that the protagonist should somehow know without testing it).

That's a very fine and difficult line to thread, for my own experience I can say that I have felt turned down from a story because it went too much outside what's reasonable to expect from that setting as many times as they went into canon rehashes.

And in some sense the former is worse, because I do agree that revising parts of the known universe makes the fanfic more interesting, it's a careful game of balance I have seen only the very best succeeding in a satisfactory way (in my limited subjective experience).

*** Hmm...lack of strong feelings. I would say that ties into the need for narrative conflict, or making the challenges feel real.

The character has to want something, and then fail to get it. If a problem arises, and the first thing the characters do is tackle it logically and with minimal feeling, and then the character /wins/, then I think the author is missing a valuable opportunity to make the story more relatable.

I think Avatar the Last Airbender did this really well. We have Aang and his crew about to fight the Fire Nation, and at the end of the second season they lose. Badly. It was bold for a kids' cartoon, but very compelling and used to propel the narrative arcs of every character. We see not only the heroes struggling from the effects of that loss in the 3rd season, but some of the villains as well.

We care when the characters we like get hurt. Then we root for them to come back and win.

*** It seems like a common fallacy of poorly-written rational fiction to think of impulse or emotion as this thing that can be thwarted simply by realizing it exists.

For example, imagine a common phobia, like a fear of elevators. A badly-written rationalist with a fear of elevators would say, "I am unlikely to experience pain or injury while in an elevator. It's irrational for me to be afraid of elevators. Therefore, I will no longer have panic attacks when I enter an elevator. And if I ever start to have a panic attack, I just need to remind myself that the panic is irrational and I'm actually safe and then I'll stop having a panic attack. Wow, I just cured my fear of elevators! That was easy!"

A better approach would be, "Okay, I start panicking every time I enter an elevator. Why? I don't know exactly, maybe some childhood trauma, but whatever the case, the point is that my breathing quickens any time I even /see/ an elevator open up, so over the next month I'm going to get a trusted friend to help me slowly chip away at this fear through controlled exposure therapy, and I'm going to develop practices like breathing exercises to help myself through those moments of panic. Or, you know, maybe I'll seek out a therapist or someone who specializes in this sort of thing and benefit from their expertise."

You know, the kind of thing an actual person with a phobia would do to try and overcome their fear of elevators. (I wonder how many people writing this kind of scene would actually go up to a real person with a mental disorder and say, "Uh, have you tried not being depressed?" Obviously there are strategies for coping with different mental disorders, but rationally identifying the ideal coping mechanism is a far cry from actually implementing it, and the definition of "the ideal coping mechanism" can vary depending on the individual and in many cases has to be discovered through experimentation. It's actually for this reason that I find myself somewhat partial to fics about characters with certain mental disorders, because the authors of these fics usually do a much better job of acknowledging that emotions exist and affect the way that people operate and behave.)

Another adjacent example of the is a character whose "rationalism" has given them the super-power of being immune to hedonic motivation. For example, a person opens up the fridge, and sees a piece of cake. "I have appraised this piece of cake as an unhealthy eating choice," says the poorly-written rationalist. "I will instead eat this bag of carrot sticks and can of sardines instead, for they will provide for my nutritional needs. Yum, the sweet, sweet taste of utility."

On some level, I get why people do this. I imagine there are a lot of people who went to see Avengers 3 and came out of the theater thinking, "Gah, why did Starlord punch Thanos. So irrational!" They walk out of the theater frustrated, and understandably so. Then, their response is, "I'm going to write my own Avengers fic, one where Starlord isn't an idiot who punches Thanos." And then they start running in the complete opposite direction and barrel headlong into "my rational version of Starlord doesn't ever feel emotions! The temptation to punch someone for reasons other than strategic utility doesn't even enter his mind!" And then you get these weird characters that are completely devoid of emotion, and if strip a character like Starlord of his emotions you don't have much of a character left.

I didn't say that Taylor reacts optimally/rationally. I'm saying that Taylor seems like a sociopath /to other characters in the story/, because she delays processing trauma to deal with the latest thing that's going on. She has plenty of other emotional reactions, but people read her as "a sociopath" anyway because she specifically doesn't externalize emotions of fear, guilt, or shame. She internalizes them, which causes other emotions (like rage) to come to the fore in their place. (Same is true of plenty of other characters in /Worm/. Same is true of Harry in HPMoR, for that matter.)

Are you using "rational" here in some uncommon sense? I'm pretty sure it would be irrational to die in the burning building. It would be rational to do whatever it takes to /stop/ yourself from dying in the burning building. One thing such rationality can require is "controlling and suppressing your own emotions."

Note that I'm not saying that this is a /realistic/ response for your average human being. Not succumbing to grief in such a situation would require a Zen master. What I'm saying is that /that Zen mastery/ is "a rationality skill" that you should seek to attain, for the same reason you seek to attain any other rationality skill: to help you win.

And so, if you're writing a ratfic where your protagonist character is explicitly "rational"---then them being able to avoid succumbing to their emotions under stress, is a sensible character trait for them to have.

**** Fenskept beat me to Flowers for Algernon. It's a great example of scaling up and down intelligence. As the character grows more complex, the emotions he's capable of change. My wife says Gimpel the Fool is a good one. To Kill a Mockingbird is a great example of what average intelligence looks like. Tortilla Flat by Steinbeck is a loving look at a group of bums that aren't that bright; Cannery Row by Steinbeck does something similar.

A lot of rational writers don't like short sentences or simple dialogue, but brevity can lead to great characterization. Also, in my experience, the range of emotions ignorant and unintelligent people feel is less complex if just as intense. The sentences they think and write in are either simple sentences or run-ons, because there's a lack of experience and perhaps a lack of capacity for multiple thoughts at once.

The problem a lot of authors face is knowledge of what's going on, and unable to prevent that meta knowledge from affecting the MC. Or again, exposition dumps.

They might be similar to people, but because the author wants to demonstrate rationality they end up having a main character who is absurdly rational. This isn't to say that they lack emotions, although they might sometimes lack emotions, but the problem is more along the lines of them never reacting in a wrong way. They might do the wrong thing, or they might be wrong about something, but they very rarely react in split section situations with anything but perfect rationality. There are also other issues where secondary characters tend to be very weak and usually there is just one main character; this might be just a natural result of having a first person perspective in many rational fics, but I don't find that to be a very convincing argument.

If someone is trying to deceive you they won't go deeper than a lie, because lying about the lie has a risk of the other person thinking you're telling the truth and not doing what you want. Every level you add is another failure case, if you can pull off a lie there's no reason to make it more complicated and if you can't, you probably can't pull off a fake lie anyway. Because it rarely works, no one is going to do it, so you're better off trying to pick up on body language than trying to figure out what "level" someone is on. I'm going to tell you right now, as someone who has average social intuition, this multi-level deception stuff isn't how people work so if you have trouble understanding others it's not the way to go.

A Path Stained Red: I can't link this, it's on QQ and also not safe for work, but it's about a reincarnated pokemon trainer who is innately psychic and does crazy shit. I'd say it's somewhat rational in how they approach the world. The writing is kind of rough around the edges but this story sucked me in despite me being a stickler for well-constructed stories and it's one of the few that I actively follow. Shenanigans all around and an MC who does pretty morally questionable things in her pursuit of power.

Golden Empire: I can't link to this because it's on fiction.live and that site is very, very NSFW, but it's also an epic-length quest that has amazing worldbuilding and a smart main character.

Dreaming of Sunshine: Naruto fanfiction, you've probably heard of it, pretty good.

So yeah, that's 10 fics that I'd say are relatively or are rational. I've got more recs but they aren't really rational and I'd say that currently, I don't really read those kind of fics anymore. I'm working on my own rational fic currently but it's only 41k words in, needs to be edited and uploaded somewhere, and I don't want to shill for myself, but in any case that's also why I'm reading a little less now and working on my own stuff.

Hope some of these helped!

EDIT: Also, I'm sure I have more stuff, but I've read too many things and I've probably forgotten some of them by now. Which is to say, I'm not sure if these are the ones I've MOST enjoyed, ever ever ever, but they stand out to me in recent memory.

Read that one. Great, detailed writing --- even if there are some Bad Writing tropes present.

This is pretty much why I keep local copies with a bit of personal notes for each story. Otherwise there comes a point where you start feeling like the protagonist of /Memento/.

******* Oh my god that's a good description. Unfortunately, I'm well beyond that point and everything is basically mixed in my head aside from a few stand-outs.

And yeah, Bad Writing tropes are unfortunately really common in fanfics because---I think, at least---many people write a story in the way that they feel like a story should be written, with the protagonist having to, for example, have some kind of setback even if it doesn't make sense in-story. Which is why I like Practical Guide to Evil so much, it's literally the trope reversal of that haha.

*** Sadly, it's easier to gain an audience with a long-running work, and if you just put out short stories then people will not tend to look at them so much. An author motivated by reception will tend toward longer works even if they prefer shorter ones. (Speaking from experience here.)

**** I remember an essay by Andrzej Sapkowski where he pointed problems of serialized fantasy novels and insulted them. And then finished with "I'm doing a serialized novel too (Witcher) and I'm part of the problem, but an author gonna eat"

*** I don't mind if a work is long if it regularly feeds me additional plot. I need something like a (dramatic) climax on a regular basis or I'm constantly asking myself why I'm still reading. Nothing wears me out like the idea that a fundamental crisis is simply never going to come to a head.

I have questions. The author has established those questions. Giving me small answers from time to time, introducing new questions, works a lot better than extended side plots dealing with some side character's loyalty mission or some aspect of the backstory that nobody but the author cares about.

I'd like to see episodic fiction written like episodic TV: Each episode with its own self-contained and satisfying plot, even as it's spiced liberally with hints and challenges related to the ongoing arc.

Combined with the serial nature of the work prevents editing and focussing of the story.

** Lack of concision. I think there's an incentive to just neutrally describe what is happening without cutting anything out in rationalfic, because if you only describe the important parts, then the reader has a perverse incentive to read into little things in a special fantastical way- to reason as though the world runs on drama- and it fails at being rationalfic. No idea how to solve this.

** This reminds me of a passage from Dreaming of Sunshine:

#+begin_quote
  It made no sense. Why speak to us, then hide? Why set us on our guard? It was terrifying, but it would have been so much worse if he hadn't introduced himself.

  /Hello, my name is Zabuza Momochi and I'll be your assassin for this evening./
#+end_quote

This illustrates the problem: monologuing (and his uglier friend "repeat the broken logic until it sounds true"). Its a sub section of the "show, don't tell" problem and plagues quite a bit of rational works. There are others, but for me this is a big no-no as far as rational stories go.

But even before the rational aspect, a lot of authors have trouble with the more "classic" pitfalls of writing: Fleshing out characters, pacing, avoiding tunnel vision, grounded romance, personality variety for a group yet consistent for a character, grammar, and so on.

The first step (IMO) for a great rational story is not a rational protagonist, but a believable world.

[edit] And just because you are using an established franchise, doesn't mean you get to skip those.

** I don't think there's enough such work which is explicitly intended to be in the genre to make generalizations, and there's a bit of unfair selection effect where the admittance criteria are close enough to "general principles of good writing" that among literature which is retroactively admitted, only good works meet the criteria.

In general though when people are trying to sound smart in fiction, they use too much jargon for things that could be said more simply, make unrealistically stupid characters to show off the intelligence of the smart ones, conflate "rational" with cold detached spock archetypes, and overwrought pseudo-reductionist explanations for the story's magical elements which ultimately devolve into something much like sci-fi babble. I imagine people trying to write "rational" fiction would fall into the same traps.

It'd be nice to read something where the fact that a character is really smart is shown by them giving short explanations a) that anyone can understand, or b) are for the level of understanding the character they're addressing has.

** Uh, while I wouldn't characterize them as unfeeling robots, many of the protagonists seem, well, a little sociopathic in their utter disregard for what the rest of the world thinks. The environment for humans is /other humans/, and if you come off like an alien wearing a human skin, you're gonna have a bad time.

** I don't know that it's a writing flaw, or that it's specific to rational fics, but I really dislike when characters don't have a solid flavor. Like, preferring certain things or courses of action. Something as simple as a favorite meal, or past-time makes the characters far more identifiable. When we get a solid feeling for how the character thinks, what they value, those are things I look for and often characters in rational fics kinda don't seem to have those. Their actions are dictated by whatever contrivance is currently in-scene rather than a overriding principle of the character.

Related to that is the short-game vs long-game planning. Characters often make choices which are optimized in the moment, but don't reflect a consistent strategy which would make them more relatable/predicable. Being relatable/predicable makes is easier for others to side with and ally with you. When someone understands what you stand for, they can either side with you, or choose not to. By focusing purely on what's in their best interest in the moment, they often overlook longer-term strategies, though authors rarely have these matter in their stories.

I'm not certain if it's on the rational fiction spectrum, but a story which does a fantastic job at creating consistent characters is Beanstalk by E. Jade Lomax (available free ([[https://ejadelomax.com/leaguesandlegends/beanstalk/][here]])) [It's super good]

Not to be rude or anything, but it wouldn't surprise me if most of the flaws mentioned in this thread didn't actually apply because the fics that have 'em aren't actually considered rational or rationalist (at least not by this sub's standards) :/
