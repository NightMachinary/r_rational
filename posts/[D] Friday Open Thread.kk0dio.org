Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I fetched an entirely arbitrary 160.000 comments from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and calculated the number of works linked in the Monday Request and Recommendation Thread.

The results are in:

**** I checked the comments, and it was legit linked 11 times by 7 different people, with 8 out of those 11 comments being recommendations. Huh.

Edit: I think this is due to my sample of comments: it's the /last/ 160k comments, not random ones. /The Simulacrum/ was rather actively discussed 9-12 months ago, apparently. If I were to fetch all comments, it would probably be much lower on the list.

** [[https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/]]

A look at the optimisation techniques that went into that vaccine. Seems surprisingly easy this way! Example: mRNA ends on a sequence of As (AAA...) which degrades the more often its transcribed. And you want it to be transcribed often for high immune respone, so you just put more As at the end - about 100 of them ended up in the vaccine sequence.

** I played Among Us today for the first time, and it left me wondering...

There's no deadline to doing your tasks. So the games' Nash equilibrium should be "everybody bundles up into a tight ball and slowly does their tasks". Whoever walks away from the ball is either killed or ejected, being suspicious. It seems like a foolproof way for the crewmates to win, regardless of the other mechanics in play.

Why doesn't everybody do this?

For those wondering, Among Us wiki: [[https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Among_Us]]

*** Because it's boring as hell. Sure, if your only goal is to win as crewmate, you would do this every time and win. But spending 20 minutes in a ball alternately doing tasks or watching other people do tasks for a guaranteed victory as crewmate or loss as impostor would mean you end up playing Among Us a total of 3 times and then never again. The goal of playing is to have fun, not to win the most consistently.

And yes, ideally some aspect of the game design would prevent the most boring strategy from being the best one for winning the majority of the time, but that probably comes with compromises somewhere else, and people don't do the "optimal" strategy anyways so it's barely worth it. Or maybe the dev just hasn't thought of or managed to implement a good method of prevention.

(Minor nitpick, you don't want everyone in a tight ball, because that could disguise the impostor killing someone. You'd want everyone close enough to see each other but far enough away that the small jump the impostor does when killing someone is noticeable. You'd also need to keep everyone moving while watching one person do tasks to prevent the impostors from sabotaging)

**** You could really solve that by simply adding a timer, really. Imposter wins unless all tasks are performed in a certain time.

Also, I'm not even sure this IS the optimal strategy. What would I do as the Imposter if my opponents did the ball thing? Answer: trigger one of the game-ending sabotages (Oxygen or Reactor) that necessarily require them to split between two stations. Either they hesitate too much and lose to the sabotage, or coordinate poorly and someone ends up alone.

*** One significant hurdle is the lack of communication capability between each player during play (since you can only chat during meetings) which makes it a lot harder to coordinate where to go together. Another compounding issue I can think of is imposter sabotage, which would be likely to derail plans (you could forcibly split the party by locking doors, and reactor sabotage requires 2 people simultaneously pressing two buttons to fix).

That said, I suppose with enough planning and precommitment you could certain concoct a system that's theoretically foolproof against deception and would ensure victory. Such a system would need to specify contingencies for the expected behaviors for each type of sabotage)

*** Video games warp incentives. Playing Brawl Stars' battle royale mode (called "showdown") is interesting in this regard. There you'd actually seen the rational play of "bush camping" (which is just hiding in the bushes doing nothing) a lot. You'd even seen teaming, with the ritual being spinning.

*** Short story. With friends, we sometimes play a variant of Among Us - we intentionally agree to keep the voice chat on all the time, the imposter declares themselves at the beginning, has reduced visibility, and has to wait at the starting point until their first kill count cools down. No meetings, no sabotages and no reporting dead bodies. In other words, the game turns from mystery to slasher horror, with a single raving axe murderer running around trying to kill everyone while they desperately carry out their tasks and shout at each other information about the killer's location.

One game, being the imposter/murderer, I tried something. Everyone has to go to Electrical at some point for sure, I thought. So I simply camped there. Sure as hell, I scored two or three kills in a row. It took a while before the others connected the dots - "wait, is he ALWAYS in Electrical?". At that point, their best strategy would have been to rush me, relying on my cooldown to be too slow to kill them all before at least some finished their tasks, but of course it was super hard to coordinate. I ended up winning the game.

We all laughed and then added a new rule that no one should do that /ever again/, and that was that, because games are supposed to be fun.

** Has anybody here ever read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In the Bleak Midwinter]]? It's a Harry Potter Fanfiction told from the perspective of Tom Riddle Sr (Voldemort's father) who is confronted by a time-travelling Hermione with his baby son. I think it would classify as rational, but I'm not exactly an expert with the genre.

*** That's one of my all-time favorite fanfics, and I hope that the author continues it. I love the author's P. G. Wodehouse inspired style of comedy, and the level of detail put into the period setting is truly excellent.

Since it is a comedy, I wouldn't necessarily qualify it as rational. None of the characters carry the idiot ball, but they do make some foolish (and sometimes funny) mistakes because it's naturally in-character for them to do so. On the other hand, the story does meet most of the requirements on the sidebar. I would say the story has "intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources", "makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear", has "satisfying intelligent solution to its problems", and "the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures."

The story would also qualify as a deconstruction of tropes. Hermione and the other characters break the mold for what time-travelers typically try to change in the past. Most other time travel fics focus on stopping one particular evil-doer rather than less glamorous, farther-reaching utilitarian goals that would save millions of lives over time.

** Does anybody know a rationality community in Germany, better even in the south-west of it (Baden-Württemberg). I mean the non-fiction version, more like LessWrong. And not just online, but where people meet in real-life (outside of pandemics). Because I really would like to get into contact with people which are like-minded in this way - have never met one personally.

I don't have any social network accounts so I can't search there (efficiently).

Thought to check out this /meetup/ platform, but it is apparently only for marketing purposes. There is also some sort of tiny political party which stands for rationality according to self-description, but politics and rationality don't fit for me.
