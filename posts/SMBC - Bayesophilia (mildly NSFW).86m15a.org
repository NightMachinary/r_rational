****** I'm not sure that's really a jab. It's more that Pinker's book, full of valid arguments and data, is...

I think Pinker is taking his opponents too seriously when he tries to defend the Enlightenment. His opponents aren't attacking it because the present-day problems of real people, such as an isolated mugging, are somehow actually caused by the Enlightenment. His opponents are just the same scum who crawl out from under rocks whenever anyone feels bad and tries to tell them this is all the fault of reason and progress.

***** The very last panel says that they'll remember Steven thanks to cheaper solid-state memory drives and Steven Pinker is an authoritative figure in the field of cognitive psychology who firmly believes in a /computational/ theory of mind. The joke is, are they remembering him because of pictures saved on the drives or because his mind was copied and uploaded to the drives?

**** Is the icon on Progress Man's chest just a stylized P, or is it some other symbol?

I'd have thought a Delta would be pretty thematically appropriate for that kind of superhero, after all.

**** I mean, it's fun, but as an argument it's pretty weak. Yeah, it sucks to be That One Person who suffers from some super-rare event. Forget muggings, someone every year dies by being hit by lightning, or falling from their bed, or maybe being buried alive and suffocated by kittens. Each of these things sucks for the victim (ok, the kittens one is also somewhat awesome) but we as society never would consider it sane to band together and spend vast amounts of resources to try to fix these problems, if those resources had to be diverted from solving vastly more dangerous problems.

Pinker's argument is very motivated. It's not just about telling that everything is nice, it's about telling that things are, after all, nicer than people tend to think they are /because people thinking otherwise is in itself a potentially incredibly dangerous thing/. So perspective matters. If our priorities become skewed, forget diverting resources from the biggest problems, we may actually cause new ones. As seen by how many people who complain about a non-existent epidemic of out of control muggings immediately go on attributing it to those damn immigrants or something. So yeah, sucks to be the guy who /does/ die in a mugging, but I don't want to die in WW3 over people being hysterical because of an imagined crime wave, so Pinker's right to say those things (at least in principle, if he then communicates them in the wrong /way/ thus not reaching those who need reaching it's another matter).

***** We got slightly different things out of this comic. I can't remember who phrased it this way, but while it's true that, as Pinker says, the arc of history bends toward justice, what he fails to understand is that this is because of all the people throughout history doing the work of bending it. So pointing out how good things have gotten relative to the past, is about as useful as a superhero who points out how unlikely it is for you to get mugged, instead of actually helping you. This analogy does not operate on the individual level at all, as you seem to think. Income inequality still exists despite how it has changed over the years, and we care about it because of the societal trend, not because individual people happen to be poor. (Bad example, because income inequality has actually gotten worse, not better lmao.)

That all is leaving aside the real problem with Pinker, which this comic doesn't touch on, but which you seem to have bought into, and conveniently expressed very concisely: the idea that it is more dangerous to push for change than it is to do nothing. Specifically, I'm looking at when you say, and even emphasize as if it's your main point:

#+begin_quote
  it's about telling that things are, after all, nicer than people tend to think they are /because people thinking otherwise is in itself a potentially incredibly dangerous thing./
#+end_quote

This almost caused my eyebrows to hit the ceiling. I get an easy rhetorical out here, though, because so far as I can tell, the burden lies with Pinker and his fans to justify that conclusion (the bit you italicized), so for now I'm not going to bother responding to it in more detail than this: why?

****** Well, in a way, obviously pushing for change is potentially more dangerous - it's a higher risks, higher rewards affair. But that's not what I meant. I don't think Pinker is against pushing for change /in principle/ either. I'm talking about the very specifics of the kind of pushing for change that is going on in this historical moment in many western countries.

Pushing for change isn't a single action we can all bundle together. Pushing for positive change is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than pushing for negative change because you don't understand the problems. You can push for change and do harm if you have bad information or just are not very bright. Pushing for a democratic country to become a theocracy is pushing for change, it's also a terrible idea.

My point wasn't that you shouldn't push for change. Pushing for change so that we adopt renewable energy sources and mitigate climate change is awesome. Pushing for change so that we adopt potentially human rights violating anti-immigration policies to fix a crime emergency that only exists in your media-excited imagination, not so much.

******* Thanks for the reply. I mean, I agree with the words in your comment. Also, this is basically the public policy version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence][Chesterton's fence]], if you ever need a nice phrase for it.

If all that came of Pinker's work was people mentioning Chesterton's fence when discussing policy positions and progressivism, I wouldn't be worried. That's a useful warning to keep in mind while discussing policy preferences.

However, that's not the effect I see. Not only am I not optimistic about people getting the same lessons you've just expressed out of Pinker's work, but I see something more insidious: his ideas being used to stop discussing problems before even getting to the point of discussing policy. What I mean is that it's perfectly sensible to say, "Pushing for positive change is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than pushing for negative change because you don't understand the problems," there is a greater danger in what I see as a more common practical application of Pinker's ideas: "Talking about some problems is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than accepting the reality of social injustices that I personally don't understand."

I fully realize I'm strawmanning the shit out of this imaginary fan of Pinker, but my point is that the way of thinking that Pinker advocates is 1) useless as far as identifying which problems to focus on, 2) useful as a guard against uncareful thinking, in the form of the Chesterton's fence analogy, but 3) more likely to be used as motivation to promote the status quo and advocate against progressive policies.

Like, nobody needs a whole book or numerous media appearances to understand Chesterton's fence. Obviously we should understand problems as much as possible in order to most effectively solve them. And the rest of his ideas? Uninteresting if your goal is to improve the human condition, and just more motivation and rhetorical tricks for dismissing problems in society if you happen to be a white male.

******** The one danger I do see in Pinker's approach is that you should never extrapolate trends and take that for granted. An upward slope might as well be part of an exponential or of some unholy curve that's about to peak and plunge towards minus infinity. That much certainly needs to be understood and is a huge damper on excessively optimistic views of the world.

However, I also think that right now a lot of people want to smash fences that they don't understand anything about, or worse, build new ones for no good reason (this being both metaphorical /and/ literal, in this context...). As I said, I am separating Pinker's arguments from the way he communicates them. I am not convinced he's being very effective, in fact, like many people, he ends up preaching to the choir. Not that those outside the choir are very willing to listen anyways, being their own choir with their own preachers. Yes, what you say is a danger. Present me a single way of discussing a single thing that comes with zero danger of being misunderstood and I'll give you a cookie. But at the same time, I think it's a fallacious argument to reply to what he's saying "yeah, but what about that minority who /do/ fall victim to /insert thing here/?". Because yeah, of course we shouldn't abandon them. But we must also understand that perfect, total control over all of the accidents of humanity's actions is... just not a thing that's possible. If there's a serious rise in crime, some administrator might be to blame. If there's a small background noise of basically unpredictable crime, there comes a point where all you can blame is human nature itself. I'm not saying we shouldn't seek a solution, if it exists. I'm saying that it's a fallacy in itself to assume that a solution always exists at all - or more specifically, that it consists of just blaming someone and then removing them, and that'll fix stuff.
