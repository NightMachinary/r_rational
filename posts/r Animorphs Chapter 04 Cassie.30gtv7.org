*** I think the biggest one is: Cassie might have given away the fact that she's not an Andalite after failing to kill the Yeerk possessing her mother but then going back screaming at her father.

Of course, it's possible that the Yeerks will rationalize this as "the andalite is a really really good actor who never breaks character."

But geez, even discounting this, Cassie screwed up really big this chapter because of her character flaw and lost both of her dad and a lot of strategic information as a result. I wonder how the animorphs are going to get out of this one.

Also, Rachel was really, really stupid last chapter and now the Yeerks are prepared. Yikes.

**** On one hand characterisation is awesome. Real teenagers probably would behave just like that. On the other hand it's almost too painful to read about such acts of monumental stupidity.

** Wow! This is getting intense quickly. The Animorphs now have a difficult choice to make: Try to maintain the illusion of being Andilites and hide their numbers and identities with high risk of their families being converted soon, or take their families and flee- probably revealing their identities and putting themselves on the defensive. I wonder if they can find that magical hidden valley in this AU.

** Agreed.

Rachel was an idiot and now the Chapmans are dead.

Then Cassie was an idiot and now her father is infested and the Yeerks may indeed figure out that the Andalite gorilla fighters (gorillas haha, get it?) are a group of humans.

This is great writing; these are exactly the mistakes I'd expect from suburban kids thrown into a war.

** is Cassie's mother soon to be dead, due to being injured? An Injured host is not useful.

Surprised yeerks trust themselves to hold deadly weapons considering the incomplete control. A human needs only 3 seconds of control to kill itself and the yeerk.

*** The thing about hosts is that they're organisms. It's often the case that they heal.

Waiting a little bit for a host to heal is more efficient in the long run that discarding a host every time it gets punched in the nose. Not least because you don't have to make up cover stories for why these hosts are disappearing left and right.

****** Yeah, but I assumed by break people usually mean "fracture" or "broken but everything is still essentially in place"

I wasn't sure whether or not it was possible to snap your shinbone in half such that it's actually /bent/, and walk again. But I guess it probably is, especially if the doctors set it back in place quickly enough.
