There are many self inserts out there but there are not many, what I consider, well written ones. Most self inserts have a tendency to delve into wish fulfillment, harems, and fix-it sues. Those types of self inserts are trash solely for the reason it is simply unrealistic.

Think about it. Let's say you were reincarnated/transmigrated to a foreign universe with untamed powers that you have no idea to control. What is the first thing you would do? Have fun exploring and try out your new magical powers? Plan on meeting and befriending the canon characters? Save someone that you know is going to die if you won't do anything? All wrong.

The first thing and only thing I will do is survive. A self insert that focuses on doing anything to survive is a well written self insert.I don't to read self inserts that focuses on trying to fix everything in their limited means. Leave that to the canon characters. I want a self insert that does anything it takes to survive because that makes the story more realistic and rational. Human beings are selfish enough to prioritize their survival over others. On the other hand Saints are the ones with Anime's about them.

With that being said in order to survive you need power. But this is not a universe like the one you watched in an anime. This is a real rational universe that has its own laws and rules. I dont expect a self insert born into the naruto universe to instantly be a master in chakra like hes some sort of genius in par with itachi. Lets face it. You were average in real life. You are still average reborn into another universe.

But knowledge is another type of power which you have plenty of. You are a god of knowledge. Omniscient knowledge of the past, present, and future. With that knowledge the self insert can work harder and earlier than others dabbleing in munchkinry in order to achieve power rationally. But be warned. The minute you stepped into this universe you know so much of, canon is out the window. The butterfly effect is in motion and every action you take obscures everything you know of the future.

A good self insert also keeps power levels in check. In a realistic and rational Self insert, the SI starts out weak and progressively gets strong. There should always be someone or something stronger than the self insert. A stronger power to threaten the self insert. A stronger power that the self insert can strive for. If that is not true the self insert is basically a god and their godhood was either obtained through many chapters of trials and tribulations or the story you are reading is wish fulfillment trash that has no respect to the universe they are writing about.

It is hard to find well written self inserts, especially male self inserts. Here are the ones that I highly recommend and I hope you can suggest me your findings of well written self inserts as well.

** This use of the term 'self insert' is interesting to me, as a anime and manga consumer I have heard the phrase used very differently. In that community a 'self-insert character' is a character that is a blank slate, one that has little to no personality so that the consumer can project on to them, or is given a specific personality to appeal to a certain demographic. In this community it seems that the term means an author inserting themselves into the story as a character, or just inserting a character from our world into a fictional one (Worth the Candle and metaworld chronicles seem to be 'self insert' fiction), whereas in the anime community this genre is better known as 'Isekai' a Japanese term that means 'different world' or 'another world', it is interesting to see this difference in two forms of culture that likely mix often (through fanfiction sites and Reddit among other social media).

As another anime and manga consumer, I find this baffling in its entirety. The term has been widely used as OP has used it among the anime fanfiction community, without clarification, for at least the last seventeen years. (Longer than that, I'm pretty sure, but I've only found documented use as far back as [[http://jusenkyo.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_(D%27anna)][early 2001]].)

What you describe as your referent for that term, I --- and I think I would go so far as to say /we/ --- know as an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman][everyman protagonist]].

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think, even here^{1}, it only properly means the former. /Worth the Candle/ qualifies as an SI if the author has admitted to Juniper Smith being a thinly veiled expy of himself --- which he may or may not have done; the matter escapes me as irrelevant --- but it's SI*-adjacent* regardless; people who enjoy well-written self-insertions are likely to enjoy it.

This, conversely, only means the latter. Contrast the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant][/Chronicles of Thomas Covenant/]], which are a published /isekai/ series whose inserted character is decidedly /not/ an author-insert of any stripe; it is not, to my knowledge, called a "self-insertion" by anyone. Contrast also an old fad in Ranma ½ fanfiction wherein a self-insert character (thus called!) would come to Nerima as an "exchange student"; these predated common use of the term "/isekai/", but would not be called that even retrospectively.

If /those/ are the things that you care about, you can just point them out explicitly, but that requires actually reading the work, and if there's a sea of works out there that you're trying to comb through, it does make some sense to immediately dismiss works that are self-inserts simply out of a desire to separate the wheat from the chaff.

I felt like I missed a lot of the protagonist's internal referencesearly on and it took a good while to get used to how he thinks to himself, but I was pleased to find that not only is there a narrative reason for how he behaves, it also shows what happens when he can't deal with his life or issues and breaks. The protagonist is OP, but not invincible, and a lot of his issues stem from his incompatible wishes to both return to the real world, and to stay in the isekai world and keep his new friends safe and successful. The fic is complete, but it doesn't resolve the main plot; it very much ends in a way that leaves space for a follow-up.

Did no one question her, a mere genin, of where did she get that information? Did gaara not tell anyone himself that an s-class threat was after him? In a rational naruto universe this would not fly but that didnt stop me from reading. What stopped me was how most chapters were based off filler naruto episodes. I skipped naruto filler episodes because I personally hate filler and I dont really want to,god forbid, READ about filler rather than watch it.

Other than my whiny nitpicks its pretty good starter self insert if you like naruto fanfiction.

****** So, I went and found the specific conversation. The thing is, I don't really see it as a major problem. They weren't around anyone else, and she didn't have any of the problems telling Gaara that she would telling a Leaf ninja - the exact problems you bring up.

Why would she have to justify where she got the knowledge to Gaara? Sure she's just a genin, but he has no idea what she might have picked up elsewhere, and no reason to press her - she's a foreign ninja doing him a huge favour. He has no reason to tell anyone in Suna where he got this information from either - why would he risk trouble for this person he owes a great deal, that he bonds to in the very same scene? From a purely selfish standpoint, why would he risk this informant who's apparently bringing him S-rank information?

I can, however, see why you dropped it for following all the stations of canon religiously including the filler. I would note that the quality of the "filler" arcs isn't any less here - unlike in the anime, it's the same writer for all of this fic, not some lesser writers making stuff up for the filler - but just following the rails is too much for some people. It doesn't bother me nearly so much because I never watched the anime, so it doesn't really come across as filler so much.

*** I actually just came across this in the past few days and caught up.

It doesn't really have much to do with rationality. The SI is rather OP, frequently beating opponents that should by rights trounce her, and this is partially but not fully excused by being a reincarnate and thus more mature than your average child soldier. Also, it follows the stations of canon rather too strongly, to the point of sometimes seeming implausible.

That said, I did enjoy reading it, but not as a rational story; rather, it's more of a worldbuilding exercise, exploring what a character in the Naruto world, with a sprinkling of metaknowledge, could do. Marked as a follow, but not a favorite.

It's the kind of story where, much like canon, a handful of characters always run into interesting main-plotline situations and come out on top even when they ought to have been completely outclassed. It's a story where, like the sort-of-canon anime fillers, you could run into some wacky group of noodle ninjas who have no reason to exist and are never spoken of again. There is no way in hell that any of this is a coincidence and in a more rational fanfic /that would be a much bigger deal./

That makes sense, just make sure you don't knock things off the rails and destroy the world or something. I'm not familiar with Naruto, which you seem to prefer, but the two backgrounds I'm most familiar with, Harry Potter and Worm, butterflying the story at all is likely to lead to Bad Things.

So survival doesn't necessarily mean power, in those stories it means getting the heck outta Dodge and avoiding interacting with anyone in the story. If you can move to Australia and get an innocuous job where you don't matter to anyone outside Black Stump Corners, do it.

** I found this Dragon Age self-insert to be entertaining. The character enters the video game world from our reality, but has no prior knowledge of the game world when she arrives. IIRC they play it off like a parallel universe with no mention of it being a video game in her home universe.

And Sequel:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7270744/1/Post-Blight-Management-for-Dummies]]

Despite knowing nothing of the world she's arrived in, she does get swept up in the game plot. But she spends a humorous amount of time complaining about missing creature comforts like flush toilets and hot showers, and working to 'invent' those things and trying to force her new world to adopt them so they become widespread.

******** Well, spoilers, she sleeps around a bit but eventually settles into a sort of open relationship with Zevran. She also ends up using seduction of one of the major characters (not Zevran) as a method of yanking the plot in a non-cannon direction, so it's somewhat relevant that she's a bit sex obsessed. She's no monogamist, but there's romance between her and Zevran despite that.

I found her cheerful lasciviousness to be really similar to his in the game, that to them sex was a fun thing but didn't have any real meaning in and of itself, that the meaningfulness of their relationship came from the trust they had in each other. I liked her willingness to use any tools at her disposal, including her body, to stop the blight so she can go off to invent toilets and showers and enjoy using them. I also really liked that when she does sleep with others, even the man she seduced, it's not 100% coldly calculating/using them, she comes to care for everyone she's with even if it's not love.

Anyway, all that said, I can totally understand how that might not be someone's cup of tea, so fair enough on the warning :)

***** What bad choices would you say Jake made? I'd like to be able to improve for the next time around.

As to the science, which parts in particular did you think were bad? It's been a while since I wrote it, and the only specifically science-based thing I can think of offhand was the steam cannons. I did a lot of math before writing that section to convince myself that it worked, but it was later pointed out to me that I got it wrong. I patched the idea by saying that Loki had caused a very quiet miracle in order to make them work, as part of his effort to help keep his catspaw (Jake) in power. I even had Loki explicitly call out the mistake in the text, and then he got annoyed with Jake and said he would stop making them work, so Jake replaced the steam cannons with a magical solution based on Shrink Object.

(Oh, wait, there was another math error: I miscalculated how big the explosion would be when Isaac used Polymorph Any Object to create antimatter. I had it as something like 6kg when it should have been 6g. I promptly fixed that with a quick revision.)

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/][Life Ore Death]] is a great quasi-self-insert. It handles as a typical self-insert, but avoids all the typical downsides by making the insert an OC.

MC is Renka, a Feruchemist from the Mistborn Triology. It starts after said triology, so it contains a lot of spoilers. Even the beginning may be considered a spoiler, so I'll keep it vague beyond there being in-universe reasons for how it happens. Young Justice side is very similar to With This Ring/Assimilation etc, where she becomes a member of the team and they do missions together.

What I especially like are the character interactions and the reasoning behind how things unfold. The reason for the typical adult insert to team up with the teenagers is often very flimsy, but it is quite nice here. Renka's influence also feels more natural than the typical meta-knowledge influenced hypercompetence or "solving" of plot-hole related issues. She is also not as game-breakingly overpowered as others are, but actually part of the team.

Overlord is “What if your standard bad isekai was written by an excellent author,” and Konosuba is “What if we were aware that yes, this kind of isekai is trash, and played it for laughs;” Its not any more rational than standard isekai, but it doesnt try to pretend it is or take itself seriously which makes it much better than normal.

**** I don't really counts as a failing of the genre (I have opinions :rm: on it as a point in general, but that's not really relevant so I'll be avoiding that). At worst, it's a failing of japanese media in general, and isn't a standard part of the usual garbage isekai. What I'm referring to is:

The reason for transportation. In most isekai, this is either handwaved entirely, or happens as a result of a godlike being that appears out of nowhere and we never see again, usually with no real reason for their actions. Youjo Senki has neither.

The implausible, nonsensical world the protagonist is isekaid into. Take a look at, I dunno death march rhapsody or whatever; the world they enter is unfailingly a giant mess of plot convenience. In Youjo Senki, The author put a lot of effort. If you take a look at his "works cited" and suggested historical info, he put a lot of work into making a time appropriate political scene, and it really shows (So does his status as a victoria 2 fan, but honestly paradox games are pretty good about that whole thing as well).

An interesting setting. Most isekai are very, very bland power fantasies. Even without all the work the author put into their setting, having it in 20th century not!europe is already a huge improvement.

Characters having intelligence that matches their described intelligence. Unlike the standard isekai, Tanya's intelligence is a shown trait rather than just informed, and better yet this "actual intelligence" isn't limited to her either

-Adding on to this, as a character she's not bland black haired mc #1256, which can end my interest in a work so fastfart.
