**** Interesting. Victory let himself be destroyed, since his goal was the satisfaction of M2's goals, which would be thwarted by trying to defend himself from M2. Survival was explicitly created with separation from M2's consciousness, and his goal is not to aid M2, but to "Survive". Perhaps he will attempt to take over M2's brain when M2 grows tired of him?

*** Might be the weird hive mind crystal thing from one of the movies instead, Giratina isn't associated with unown and I feel like Mewtwo would have noticed if it was a ghost since they do weird stuff to psychics.

Still if this is Giratina I wonder what Palkia and Dialga will do, since they canonically have the power to literally destroy and remake the universe and legendaries seem to be getting power boosts in this story.

**** The Legendaries in this story aren't really any stronger than they are said to be in cannon (except maybe for Pressure), its just that their power is actually expressed in a realistic way instead of in-game mechanics. You can't beat one with a Rattata just because you overleveled it. The Stormbringers are supposed to be able to summon huge storms, the Weather trio is supposed to be able to alter the planet's climate, and here we see them doing so. Dialga and Palkia shouldn't behave any differently than they do in the games; they will have absurd power but won't want to actually use it unless a human messes with them. The Spear Pillar stuff will likely be handled human vs human

*** I think he's already not wholesome - before the incident with the shark pokemon, he seems calculating/analytical in his ability to survive/consider other pokemon's actions. After that, he appears to have some sort of a psychological trigger:

#+begin_quote
  ... I can barely focus my senses on any surrounding minds.

  ... The loneliness overwhelms me, and before I can make any conscious decision I find that I am already shaping a new tulpa.

  ... The thought of relearning how to walk is not in itself daunting, but what weighs on my thoughts instead is the feeling of failure.

  ... As I foraged, every unexpected noise made me jump, every shifting shadow sped my pulse. Once a flock of murkrow flew overhead, causing me to instinctively send a wave of force up at them... which, of course, did nothing.

  The thought that Giovanni may have been right to keep me confined and safe in the lab is humiliating, but impossible to entirely dismiss.

- They're aren't really killed, merely reintegrated, their memories and processing capacity becoming part of the one thought process.

** Well, fuck. How long do we have, lore wise, until the events of Sinnoh? Official sources place them 3 years after the Hoenn and Kanto games, so the clock is ticking. Cyrus trying to rewrite the universe seems like exactly the tear needed to speed up this “mad god”'s bridge to reality. Which would line up, assuming that was Giratina Mewtwo witnessed, a being which lore wise breaks into reality at the climax of Platinum version. Sinnoh seems out of scope, but I wonder if Turnback cave is the focal point of the unknown activities. It's not terribly separated from the solaceon ruins either.

On an unrelated note, I wonder if Mewtwo‘s human parent is related to Red. Probably not his parents, I can't see a connection to Giovanni there, but maybe extended family? It's probably silly, but their reliance on multiple aspects of themselves seems intentionally similar.

(And he really should have known better too, didn't his pursuers have Dark pokemon that were chasing him underwater?)

Bye-bye Victory, you will...only be missed when practically speaking. And hopefully won't be coming back. Survive's shaped up to be a much better pal.

I'm curious about Mewtwo's aversion of capturing others in Pokeballs. He's portrayed to be somewhat parallel to Red (e.g. development of tulpas), but on this case, in contrast, Red is actually rather enthusiastic in entering a Pokeball himself if the brain-death aspect of it can be engineered away, for its potential benefits (training programs, prolonging life). I wonder what could be the cause of the aversion in Mewtwo.

...A thought occurs. Could one of Mewtwo's human genetic parents have been /N/? Because he's the one person I just thought of who would feel so strongly against enslaving pokemon...although this might be a bit of a stretch. It's not like personality traits can reliably pass from parent to child.

Finally, my favourite part...the unown's secret. Whoo boy. I actually didn't expect this story to jump in scale so high, not too long ago - in an earlier chapter Aiko and Leaf were even discussing the "realistic" power levels of mythical pokemon ("Celebi probably can't /actually/ travel back in time, Jirachi probably can't /actually/ grant wishes"...) - but escalating events to world-level repercussions (competently) is pretty much my favourite thing in stories, so here I am, grinning like an idiot in gleeful anticipation. So while this probably isn't a thread that's going to be picked up anytime soon (Mewtwo only encountered the unown some weeks after Groudon/Kyogre, Red/Blue/Leaf's timeline as of last chapter was only two days after the event), I'll be eagerly waiting for it in future updates. With best wishes to the protagonists, assuming they're gonna have to be involved with it eventually.

Back to the point though - at first I thought the "mad god" was a reinterpreted Arceus - that was my assumption as well for the god that Wally influenced through his unown - but the discussion on this page convinced me Giratina fits much better. Still, if it was Giratina both times, that brings up an entirely new concern of Giratina's influence on Rayquaza that I wouldn't have if it was Arceus. Arceus is pretty much God, so I could accept his influence on Rayquaza to be a simple, and literal, divine intervention - but Giratina, "ruler of anti-matter" Giratina, I would question on both the "how" and "why".

I'm thinking one answer that satisfies both is that in this verse, Giratina already controls some of the legendaries (the how) and sending them around to actively hamper humanity is, in some way, letting it progress towards its goal of consuming that reality (the why). This /seems/ like a leap in logic, but somehow doesn't feel that way to me. I already wondered before if there was something actually intelligent in the way that the Storm Gods consistently harass the Kanto region, for one. And when I think about how, in the original games, Mewtwo's main Ability is Pressure, which in this fic he doesn't have yet...suddenly I see a connection between the way Mewtwo's mind was scrambled just by glimpsing the mad god, and the way Pressure, well, pressures all minds in its area of effect, and from there it's only a short jump to assuming how Pressure actually works: some kind of connection that exposes the minds around the legendary to the influence/presence of some eldritch god.

Well, in the end I can only call this a wild guess. I can already see a counter-argument starting with how some of the legendaries that I'm implying are under the influence of Giratina (the regis and Rayquaza) don't actually have Pressure, for one. Future chapters may prove me wrong entirely.

I don't know if Mewtwo would go straight back to Giovanni for help, or to some other humans - Giovanni definitely has the resources, but trust might be a bit harder to maintain. Either way, here's hoping Mewtwo's next encounter with humans go better.

** Really cool to get a Mewtwo interlude! We're finally in the middle stage of the story, and our main man (Pokeman?) is free!

I was honestly relieved when he took Victory down. There was always that sort of doubt that Victory would absorb the other tulpas, and I'm glad it was stopped quickly after. Survive seems interesting, since it's basically a fusion of the others. Also, now both Mewtwo and Red have one other /personality/ with them. Wonder how that will play out.

Mewtwo's human parent seems like a very interesting topic. The description might fit anyone really, but I was thinking someone like Professor Oak. I know it won't be the case here, but something like how Superboy has 2 parents in Superman and Lex Luthor would have been a cool idea to run with here. In that case, Giovanni and Oak.

So a legendary Pokémon's destructiveness are proportional to how easy it is to kill them.\\
Noone can touch the Stormbringers, but the far more dangerous Kyogre and Groudon were killed in a couple hours after making an appearance.

And now this new threat apparently wants to eat reality wholesale, but you probably just have to exterminate the Unown species to get rid off it.

Kyogre only went down because Groudon is its equal and Groudon had help, then Groudon was beaten only because Rayquaza came and crushed him.

I imagine Rayquaza could take any of the stormbringers and making one stormbringers fight another would probably work fairly well too (especially as they're probably not quite so evenly matched), but neither of those two things are really doable, Rayquaza doesn't care about stormbringers and they appear at different times of year so getting two to fight is unlikely.

**** We don't know whether Groudon was necessary to kill Kyogre, at all.\\
Its fate could very well have been sealed, as soon as it swallowed Surge's Magneton.\\
No good reason to assume that the aquarium fish would have stomach acids strong enough to dissolve metal.

What could it have possibly done against a Magneton inside its stomach constantly shocking it?

*** I mean, the closest example I can think of is people with Dissociative Personality Disorder. Generally I get the impression that it's not super explicitly a good/bad thing, and you can still live a relatively normal life. But I don't really know much about it.

*** I believe the "internal family system" thing is a recognized psychological tool. I often use something similar when deciding on what I want to do in any given moment. It's more helpful for aligning my actions with my priorities, rather than producing novel solutions to problems or multitasking (and when I say more helpful, I mean I've never gotten better problem solving abilities or abilities to multitask from it, and only use it for action prioritization). I've also found it helpful for increasing focus, thinking "ok, for this hour I will spend my time furthering goal X, so X-focused D0TheMath is in control right now". Overall, I'd say experiment with it for a few days, as with any new cognitive tool, to see if it produces good results for you.

*** There is in fact an [[/r/tulpas]] . Make of that what you will.

Edit: Ooh this is interesting. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/io6vn0/do_you_regret_creating_your_tulpa][Do You Regret Creating Your Tulpa]]

Common thread seems to be that many of the people there self report creating them to cope with loneliness/anxiety/depression, and self report it as a net positive / are happy with the decision.

*** They do have subs dedicated to it on Reddit - [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] seems to be the main one, and [[/r/tulpa][r/tulpa]] the alt. There's also a Wikipedia page, though it doesn't feature any comment from psychologists, which is what I'd be most interested in.

My impression of them after not-that-deep scrutiny as an outsider is that tulpas seem useful enough as an attempt for companionship. (Maybe overly so. Try sorting [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] by top of past week.) I don't think I've seen anyone on those subs who created tulpas for strictly constructive purposes, but I don't see how it's impossible to do so, if the tulpa is created with discipline. That said, it's not like there's much scientific research on it (that I saw), so it may be the case that it's not possible for some people to actually form tulpas without a mind that needs companionship (and thus is willing to force the brain into creating a companion), or is hyperactive (and thus has the brain processing to spare), or possess some fictional mind superpower. And then there's the possibility of something like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/j2wv5z/is_it_possible_to_bring_back_an_old_tulpa_that_i/g796uyy/][this]], where even if you succeed in forming a tulpa you're just that unlucky person whose tulpas don't actually stick around 24/7.

---- Oh wow.

Considering Survive weakened the partition, took partial control of the body, and is shown to have terrifying potential, all while lacking Victory's complacency, I am once again filled with dread. And all that aside from the swarm of poke-nanorobots taking over the world!

Thank you for this bombshell of a chapter. This was ...eventful!

** Quick question, which I wasn't sure whether to post here or in the main group. Is Origin of Species almost done? Not in a “man, I wish it was over,” way, but I'm going to have to reread a significant portion to catch up because it's been a while and I need the refresher. If it's due to be completed in the next year or so, I'll probably wait and read it all as a whole. If it's going to be ongoing for years, I'll just catch up and read it as it comes out.
