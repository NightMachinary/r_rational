**** In that case, you probably should just cut out the paragraph entirely and jump to the line break. However, I understand that you wanted to include the following paragraph about Tobias silently questioning if Seti changed his mind about sparing Libby.

You could work it in by writing about Seti's musings on whether he should have changed his mind as he walked out of the building (bolding is the original text from the chapter):

#+begin_quote
  *Everyone came out of the building, one at a time. Mindy and her parents were in front. Ivan wobbled after each step, his eyes downcast and empty. Libby didn't need anyone to force her forward, as she happily skipped and jumped ahead. Tobias and Seti were last* with Seti lost in thought. Seti wondered if he should have changed his answer about letting Libby live. Seti wouldn't say it aloud, but in some way, he understood Libby, even if her actions were abhorrent. He wondered what that meant for the future.

There's been some talk of controlled abilities and banned niches already. How would you prevent someone from using a power you didn't want them to be able to?

The obvious question that comes to mind is why didn't she take control of them during the test? I think it'd have to be because she knew there'd be a negative reaction.

I wonder if she'll become some type of indentured servant now controlled by vivamancers.

** I want to say that Abigail's action to soak Seti and herself in water before going into the fire is actually a terrible idea. You wouldn't grab a hot pan with a wet towel would you? It's because the fire would flash boil the water into super-heated steam to burn your hand. Water is great for cooling you down after a fire or when hot, but if you expect to run into a burning building, wearing something thick and dry would work better as insulation.

You don't see firefighters drenching themselves with water before running into a burning building do you?

*** I've read a few things regarding this scenario, and the answer is simply: it depends. In fact, I've read the opposite where you'd want to wrap yourself /and/ make the clothing wet in a short burst run.

In a mancer world, though, how a second year Prestige hydromancer fights off heat with water is another topic. I have, even in this chapter, made mention that an aeromancer is capable of suffocating the flames by withholding their air if their grit is strong enough. A similar concept with hydromancers is likely to exist.

***** Here's the quote I read before writing this scene:

#+begin_quote
  My fireman friend told me that there were always TWO people on the hose as they entered a hot blaze. The rookie was always the guy in front, because he felt the most heat, whereas the guy right behind him ( experienced fire-fighter) got the cooling mist that sprayed back. That would seem to indicate that water in any form would help you survive, assuming you do not stay in one place long enough to get that water very hot, in which case, the ability of water to hold heat could work against you. Short trip through fire? Get wet. Longer trip? run like hell.
#+end_quote

And I really hate to use the term "because magic", but I've given a lot of reasons where the reader can assume hydromancy may play a role in fighting against heat. I do not think the write up, as it is, is irrational.

**** I wonder how long till he starts his inevitable climb up the tiers then. Tier is just a measure of mana capacity/production no? I think the size of his air sense is a measure of his tier. So maybe every double is a tier? Hmm that doesn't seem good enough though. At T5 that'd give him 10*2^{4} =160 ft of coverage. At tier 8 that's 1280 ft radius which seems a bit small. Hmm.

*** The Night Watch books by Sergei Lukyanenko had a similar protagonist who starts off at the very low end of the power scale.

Let's just say that very rarely in fiction does the underdog truly stay at the bottom of the power levels the whole time without getting some sort of boost/equalizer/etc...

Incidentally, highly recommend the Night Watch series. Urban fantasy, post-Soviet style - has a very distinct voice from Western lit.

** I've just caught up with this story. You seem to have a knack for plot, in terms of hitting on various tropes that appeal to fantasy/webfiction readers.

However, there are a few issues with the story i've found frustrating. Part way through this chapter I decided to make notes on some of these issues as they arose:

Inconsistent values displayed by Seti- nearly unwilling to be soaked in urine in a situation where lives are on the line and time is of the essence but all high and mighty in a dumb narrow minded way with elderly lady. The fact that the time taken to only possibly save the previous lady would likely result in further deaths wasn't addressed.

No tension - never felt like SETI was in danger (character never ruminates on situation or genuinely worried plus not plausible that elder doesn't save them if worst comes to worst).

Characters behaving unrealistically - eg. Asking Toby's thoughts of the mafia while in a raging inferno trying to save everyone's lives where times of the essence or Libby's plan coming apart around her but she's rocking back in a chair relaxed and oh so casual when people discover her and Ivan. Mindy, not someone shown to be a calm individual, going from intense fear at being held hostage and to calmly cleaning Seti's face less than a minute after rescue.

Comically arrogant ‘bad guys' ala Libby. ‘Eyes wide with madness', ‘hysterical laughter', “no one can judge me”, reveals entire plan to the ‘good guys'.

I don't want to be all negative, I am still enjoying parts of the story.

#+end_quote

Two entirely different spectrums here. No one wants to be soaked in urine; he just had a hard time coping with it. As for the old lady, she was a physical being that would've definitely died had Seti ignored her, so her life and death was something in his hands. Indirectly blamed for something is judged differently than a direct blame.

#+begin_quote

It was. When that Kimberly person was found dead.

#+begin_quote

I never thought he was in danger. Seti never thought he was in danger. So we're of one accord here.

#+begin_quote
  Asking Toby's thoughts of the mafia while in a raging inferno
#+end_quote

That questioning came up when Toby was taking care of the fire. The two were happening simultaneously.

#+begin_quote
  Mindy, not someone shown to be a calm individual, going from intense fear at being held hostage and to calmly cleaning
#+end_quote

She cried with her parents while they hugged her after the fact. Only after she broke from their hold did she come to Seti.

  Libby

I won't comment here as her motivation plays a part in her actions.

*** Hamilton path is a layout style, which was something i looked up before writing the last chapter. The Hammington one i wrote is indeed a made up one, based on real world graph theories and a mix of what would likely exist in a mancer/primal world.

My thought process was this: if i used real world graph theories (that most readers wouldn't even know existed), someone might eventually ask how a mancer world came up with the exact same name and whatnot. So changed the name and didn't go deep into it. Which is a reasonable question as magic existing in the world changes how technology advances too, and all that.

No, it's a way of traversing graphs. I guess you could call graphs "layout styles", if you look at the cave solely as a series of intersections and connections; but for any given number of intersections (graph nodes) there are many possible graphs that have a Hamiltonian path.

  My thought process was this: if i used real world graph theories (that most readers wouldn't even know existed),

Maybe just don't call it a "graph theory" ? Maybe say it's "a standard layout" without specifying in what and both readers who don't know about graph theory and readers who do will be pacified.

The story is still quite good, I'll definitely keep reading, but this put me off quite a bit. Along with the continuous description of women as objects of sexual desire, though I guess this second can be part of the story and appealing to some readers.
