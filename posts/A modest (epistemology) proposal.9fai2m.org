So, I'm currently reading Eli's /Inadequate Equilibria/ (thanks to [[/u/FeepingCreature]] who let me know about it during a discussion) and the definition of "modest epistemology" that he presents in chapter 6 intrigued me, so much so that I jotted down a mathematical model of a very simple case of it, which gives some interesting results - mostly about asymmetries in judgement between groups with different epistemologies which result from the meta effect of trying to assess failure rates, and about the existence of non-trivial states where these asymmetries cease to exist and in fact /there's just no way to tell who's right/ (even if someone definitely is). Here's the small "paper" on it I just wrote:

It's the work of basically half an hour at most, so obviously it's not exactly a masterpiece of rigour, but I thought it'd be fun to discuss, at least.


** Good work on the paper. Looks interesting.
