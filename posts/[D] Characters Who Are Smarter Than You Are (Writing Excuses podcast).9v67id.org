This 25-minute episode of Writing Excuses features Howard Tayler (Schlock Mercenary), Mary Robinette Kowal (The Calculating Stars, Ghost Talkers), Dan Wells (I Am Not a Serial Killer, Partials), and Amal El-Mohtar (Seasons of Glass and Iron).

My notes on several points brought up in this episode:

- Seeing a character's thought process as they come up with possible ideas, reason through them, and reject the bad ideas finally arriving at a brilliant conclusion can actually make them appear smarter than if we just skipped to the part where they come up with a brilliant conclusion. Sherlock Holmes doesn't just tell us who the culprit is; he also explains how he deduced the answer.
- You can treat logic or competence within a specific domain the same way you might treat a hard magic system. As Brandon Sanderson's first law tells us, "an author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic." Likewise, an author's ability to solve conflict with logic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands that logic. (Applies to any kind of intellectual discipline: "smart" characters can solve problems with math, chemistry, their knowledge of information technology systems, etc.)
- An advantage that authors have over real-world geniuses: most real-world problem-solving involves starting with a problem, and then trying to come up with a (hopefully brilliant, but often merely adequate) solution. When writing a story, you can start with a brilliant solution, then come up with a problem that corresponds to that brilliant solution. This tends to be how heist stories are written: first, we decide that we want one of the members of our heist team to be a demolitions expert; that then requires that part of the heist involves facing a problem that requires the use of explosives.

  So, Max Gladstone and I have co-written a novella that is coming out in probably... I think it's... Probably, I think it's July 2019. It's a book of two dueling time traveling super spies. One written by Max and one written by me. I have a number of insecurities in this regard because, first of all, I mean, they're time traveling super spies, they have all of time and space at their disposal, they are the best there... They are the best there are at what they do. But Wolverine quote, "And what they do is not very nice." Etc. So, they're brilliant, and they're constantly outsmarting each other and one upping each other. I am not a time traveling superspy.

Wow, I've had the same premise in the back of my head for years, but I could never think of an interesting story to tell or coherent way to synch the timelines such that neither side of the conflict got immediately wiped from existence; I'll certainly be looking at this.

*** Yup. Time travel is difficult. You have to have a setup where a smart, ruthless character couldn't simply jump back in time as far as possible and control everything which happened subsequently, or jump back in time and tinker with their opponent's time travel gear/ability from the start, or erase their opponent from history, or jump back to /themselves/ and give themselves ALL the advantages from the start (or do it sneakily if there are fixed loops or paradoxes).

The whole thing has to be solid in four dimensions and logical from the viewpoint of each character at any given moment in their personal timeline. It's not easy to come up with a scenario which supports that, unless you have restrictions like "the time machine only works when it's convenient to the plot".

****** Yeah, it's hard but not impossible to have multiple time-travelling agents in the same story.

One example which handles this well is HPMoR, in which nothing (not even information) can time-travel more than six hours into the past, and trying to take too much advantage of time travel tends to lead to trouble ("DO NOT MESS WITH TIME").

Another example that's well-handled is the time travel arc in PS238 - there's actually multiple time travel arcs, with the same events seen from the perspective of first the protagonist, then (not in the same order) by a time-travelling antagonist, and both of them make perfect sense from their character's personal points of view (and also, they most certainly are not the same person).

#+end_quote

It's weird and kinda inconsistent. It can but it also can't. If it was a hard limit, then there could be only one time traveler in the world at any given time. If there were at least two and they, say, passed by one another on the street without talking, their bodies would surely exchange all sort of information - infrared photons, dust, particles of skin and hair if they bumped into one another, various chemicals one of them exhaled and another one inhaled, gravitational waves, etc, etc, etc. A sufficiently good analyzer then could deduce the fact of their meeting (and the state either of them was in during the meeting) just by observing one of them, which could allow them to receive information from further ahead than 6 hours.

What actually seems to be happening is that only information that someone consciously tries to use can't travel into the past. So that whole stuff about hair being exchanged would lead to a paradox if and only if there is a DNA analyzer nearby that intends to check one of them for hair and use that information to deduce information from 6+ hours into the future. Which, fair enough, a lot of magic seems consciousness - focused, maybe magic is a grumpy GM that slaps down any mage that tries to go above 6 the hour limit. But that's not, in principle, an inherent limit of the laws, it seems.

That's assuming that all of that information goes back with the time traveller. Perhaps it simply takes back the time traveller and leaves any forensic traces (hair etc.) back in the future?

********* How exactly would that work. You pass by a fireplace that another time traveler lit up, left half of your body heats up a bit, then one minute later you go back in time. Does time turner cool your body down? To what temperature? Heat gets distributed through your whole body, it's not just some dust on the surface you can pick up and throw away, it's velocities of molecules in your body. In that minute they had enough time to do a billion billion collisions which would have gone differently if the photons didn't carry all that extra energy in. What position and velocities does the time turner roll them back to?

Your body had to work a bit less hard at heating you up in that minute, and therefore spent a bit less ATP or whatever cells use for pure heat production. Does the extra unspent ATP get teleported out? Which molecules and how would it decide which ones to leave and which ones to keep?

Say you passing by that fireplace caused you to remember the time when you were listening to grandma stories about fireplaces as a kid. Does timeturner edit your memory so you aren't thinking about that when you go back in time? If so, what are you thinking about?

Hell, people can read minds here. Do you forget the fact that there was any fireplace there at all? Otherwise, someone could read your mind and thus see the fireplace and thus be capable of receiving some kind of signal from the second time traveler.

In general, if you try to make a semblance of sanity of this, you'd have to conclude that when you timeturn, timeturner, like, loads up the entire state of the universe X hours back, finds all time travelers within that state, somehow...deletes them and anything they did without actually deleting them or the things they did, simulates that state /forwards/ up until the moment where you'd have gone back in time, and then copies the state your body is in at that moment and sends /that/ back in time...

...which rather obviously would violate continuity of thought in all sorts of ways, and doesn't seem to happen.

Or you could claim magic makes guesses about what people would be able to tell from the state of the person being sent back in time and screws with that, at which point we are back to my theory.

You are carrying with you the information that a fire was lit a few minutes before you left. That information did not travel back in time to get to you - the time traveller lit the fire in your present, thus no information is moving back in time more than six hours even if you rewind the full six hours.

Now, that assumes that the future time traveller's decision to light that fire wasn't influenced by anything in your future. If the other time traveller's decision to light the fire was made (say) one hour after your time, then the presence of the fire indicates some information originating from one hour in your future. In this case, you can travel back through time no more than five hours, maximum, because you are carrying with you information from one hour in your future.

*********** I don't think you are getting the general point, which is that the way physics works you can infer things about the second time traveler just by passing by him. There is no "decision that wasn't influenced by the future of the second time traveler" as that is human talk. The second you two exchange photons of any sort you have exchanged information. It's done. Getting some useful human level decisions out of that information is a separate unrelated matter. If no information could ever travel back in time, then the second a time traveler pops up in your light cone maximum amount of time turning you could do would get sharply reduced, because the second they pop up in your light cone you have exchanged information.

************ Ah, but the thing is, the information I am exchanging with the future time traveller did not originate in my future.

Let's consider a concrete example. I wish to travel from 12:00 noon to 06:00 in the morning, the full six hours.

At 17:00 that evening, a time traveller travels back to 11:00 - again, the full six hours - and walks past me in the corridor. The left side of my body is very slightly warmed by his body heat.

Now, if I go back to 06:00, then the information that can be extracted from an incredibly close reading of my body heat is "someone walked past the left side of me" (and possibly some features about that person). This incident happened at 11:00; thus, the information only travelled back in time five hours, and has not gone back in time more than the six-hour limit.

That's the First Scenario. Let's consider also the Second Scenario. The only difference is that, in the Second Scenario, when the time traveller walks past me he states (in a loud, clear voice) the result of a horse race that finished at 15:00. Since I now have information on an event that happened at 15:00, I cannot travel back in time to before 09:00.

************** Hmmm. I see your point. But there is a fairly straightforward way to patch this plot hole.

/Fidelus/ is canon to Harry Potter - a spell that causes a secret to be magically bound, and in such a way that it /cannot/ be revealed except by the conscious, deliberate choice of one person (the Secret Keeper).

So, perhaps the time-travel spell has a built-in /Fidelus/ - the time traveller /cannot/ reveal information about the future except by means of conscious, deliberate choice. (This spell would probably change the time traveller's skin temperature to equal to the average temperature of the room he appeared in, plus a random low-amplitude white noise, or something similar to that).

So it's clearly hidden even if you know exactly where it by all rights should be.

**** I think a well-hidden dead man's switch in the past set to cause catastrophic consequences were it to go untriggered would suffice to ensure neither side was wiped from the timeline. However, it'd have to be a "natural" deadman's switch, so that its creation wouldn't be butterflied away by whatever event undoes the existence of the rival agency. It's difficult to imagine how an equilibrium like that could come into existence, how either agency would stumble on some deviation from the original timeline they'd consider mission critical to maintain, that'd simultaneously be secret from their opposition, that wouldn't incidentally be destroyed by all the other mucking about they're doing in times predating that point.

Another possibility is to make them sister splinters of the same original agency, such that changes to one's origins destabilize the others', although this obviously has holes. Similarly, each side has moles in the other's agency, then whenever one group is wiped out a remnant of the other would always be able to rebuild the opposition. But that's highly unstable. Figuring out how to make the deadman's switch work seems like the most promising avenue.

There's also the problem that two people traveling in time "simultaneously" makes very little sense. One of them has to trump the other. That it's much less clear how to begin getting a handle on. You could perhaps do an endless back-and-forth, but I think it'd seem contrived.

** It's also important to recognize when you /shouldn't/ have smart characters. I binged watched the first 3 seasons of Buffy, and the thing that constantly stood out in my mind (aside from "Willow and Oz are such a cute couple!") was how dumb everyone was. At one point we learn Evil Angel has been sneaking into Buffy's room at night and drawing her, as part of an evil taunting thing. To which my response was "Wait, /what/? Buffy has known a centuries old monster has been out to kill her personally for months now, and she is just now thinking about home security? Are you SERIOUS!?".

But the thing is the point of the show is to be a metaphor for normal teenage girl problems, and Evil Angel is a metaphor for a stalker ex boyfriend. So Buffy being smart and placing garlic in her window, or making all her friends carry crosses and holy water on them at all times, would 100% stop Evil Angel from doing anything. But that breaks the metaphor, because real teenage girls don't have stalker ex-boyfriend garlic they can hang in their window and they don't have Holy Crosses of Ex-Boyfriend Repellent they can hand out to their friends. So for the sake of the story, she must be an idiot to make her relatable.

I feel like all but the most locked down magic systems operate on this principle too, of placing drama over intelligence. It's simply too hard to prevent loopholes creeping into your magic system, and eventually you have to just have to introduce an arbitrary line in the sand to avoid your universe becoming ridiculous. For example in True Blood, when a vampire is uninvited from a house a force slowly pushes them to the nearest exit. No big deal you think? Nope, that's infinite energy and reactionless drives right there. Eventually an author just has to throw up his hands and say "Screw it, for the sake of preserving the relatability of this universe you cannot build a space house rocket ship using vampires as the fuel. In-universe logic be damned, this is the line we cannot cross".

Rationalist fiction is unique in placing in-universe logic ahead of real world drama, but it's sometimes useful to remember that it's not the only choice we can make.

There's a strong political element to the idea of people taking up weapons to defend themselves. In Canada it's straight up illegal for anyone to carry /any/ kind of weapon for self defense, even pepper spray. You have to pretend you're carrying the spray for "bear protection" (The most dangerous kind of bear walks on two legs, so not entirely a lie?) or you'll get slapped with criminal charges. So the show might also not want to have Buffy defeat Angel through the use of weapons because it offends their politics that teenage girls might be trying to do the real life equivalent (e.g. get a gun).

Personally I definitely would've enjoyed the show more if Buffy was a rationalist and just started carrying a Glock full of wooden bullets. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoR0jF0vuY][Buffy drops the karate gimmicks and just lays out a mofo]]

  used up all the vampire pushing energy!"

Just because there's an energy source doesn't mean it's feasibly exhaustible. Despite all the things that have been dropped over the years, gravity still works on Earth. If the energy source is the vampires, then it's not going to run out. If the energy source is a deity, then it may last as long as they're around (or care).

  Can the star of david repel vampires too?
#+end_quote

That varies from story to story. I've seen one answer that explicitly with 'If the vampire is jewish. Crosses only work on christian vampires. If a vampire loses faith, /nothing/ works.'

An author could also say 'it works with any religion!', or any suitably large religion because they've got enough worshippers that they have the power to help them out, or 'it works if the person holding the symbol believes'.

  There isn't any way to salvage this thing. Either this setting is insanely goofy, or you just put your foot down and say "No, I decide it arbitrarily does not work like that. End of story. Flying box vampires do not exist in my universe."

I have a tendency to reject arguments of the form 'there is no way' in the absence of a compelling reason to believe 'it is impossible to come up with a way'. (For example, there can be no perpetual motion machines because 'one of the laws of thermodynamics says it's impossible'.)

  It took me a few days to figure that out. She does it in seconds. I'm very proud of it.

I think this is another big thing about writing intelligent characters - you have all the time in the world to think of solutions and logical processes, and then you can write that out as happening in seconds/minutes. As well as the fact that, as the author, you already likely know what's going on everywhere, or at least have a good idea, so you already know what kind of conclusions you want your character to reach.

** I think it helps a lot to write some dumb characters for the smarties to get one over on. Like, the 'smart' level to play at is one level above your competition, yeah? So if you make the loser as smart as you can you are screwing yourself when it comes time to write the person who outwits them.
