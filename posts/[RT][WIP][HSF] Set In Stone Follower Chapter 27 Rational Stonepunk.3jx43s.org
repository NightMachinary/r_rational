** Well, Stateman Urda shows up. I'd like to know if anyone guessed what she was concerned about before she said it.

If you didn't guess what she would be concerned about, let me know if I left enough clues that it seems logical, looking back.

***** . . . That I can see, the long game /shakes head/ not so much. Allen is very much a shut up and multiply guy. Not to say he isn't ambitious, but his social grounding makes it clear to me that the power he'd want is a better farm. Considering, the height to which the officer corp actually seems to be good at judging people, I'd be surprised if they thought that was a concern. At least, without them taking action that clearly demonstrated themselves as an enemy, and not a reasonable investigator using all moral options. It doesn't make sense for the LT to be concerned about a rebellion though I can now see where you were working that, and even guess a few might be intentional catspaws of his if he was worried; it does makes perfect sense for the statesman, but I guess I was too in Allen's shoes to see him being assessed for that threat.

****** I will have to more clearly indicate that the officers were following orders. I did mention that the mail interference was at her orders, and the fact that she ordered them to make him angry. Should I more clearly indicate that she was pulling more strings than just the mail, from a distance, seeing if he would lose his temper and start acting rebelliously, as well as priming the situation so she could get a read on a frustrated and annoyed Allen if he didn't try to rebel?

******* I got that, and my perception is likely filtered through my own military experience. Everyone gets orders they don't like. You do them, and sometimes you grumble, but I didn't see things getting anywhere towards mutinous, just a frustrated leader, advisers ready to act as reasonable checks, and a scared and angry bright boy in a bad situation.

To be clear I think I might be assuming a much higher tipping point before any form of subversion or rebellion is worth considering. These militia are essentially in there own boot camp, which is part of my model, but they are conscripts and don't have a lot of trust in their first and second layer leaders, which is so foreign to me I didn't even realize it was a bias.

Thanks it's always good to get a better model of how you think.

***** It was obvious for me because of the discussion here about previous chapters pointing out Allen's growing political influence, but if I was reading straight through without the enforced waits between chapter updates it wouldn't have been nearly as easy to see.

The main factor is that Allen just isn't the sort of person who is greedy for power/control and with such a deep immersion in his character, I know I would have had not been able to guess at Urda's model of Allen's behavior since it's inaccurate and he simply won't being staging a takeover anytime soon.

** I'm not sure why they haven't sent Allen home once Albert verified his story. Balancing it out, it seems: Chance Allen reveals secret * damage of the secret > harm from sending him home. Harm from sending him home is only losing 1 person - others will already have the idea of claiming they spoke to Albert even if Allen isn't sent home.

Maybe they want him to stay and they're evaluating him for a leadership position, but I can't see why they think he'd accept.

*** Sending Allen home has a serious risk of demoralizing the camp, and or making millita-men think getting attacked is a way to get sent home.

*** Albert will confirm or deny if he spoke to people to Countymen and Statemen, in order to prevent that sort of scenario where people make claims. Most of the time though, people don't say anything about speaking to Albert, because he strongly discourages it, and he's very good with mental judo.

Allen lived his entire life and never knew his mother spoke to Albert until the letter from her that explained some of her encounter, for example. The officers know that Fobi spoke to Albert, but she won't say anything about it. Albert is very good at keeping people quiet if he wants them quiet.

That's one reason why the militia officers and Urda are concerned. Albert didn't work to try to keep Allen quiet.
