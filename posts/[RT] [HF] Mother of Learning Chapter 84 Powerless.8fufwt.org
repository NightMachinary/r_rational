** Why did Zorian get a critical failure when trying to convince Xvim? Even if he couldn't persuade him right there, he should have been able to tell Xvim the instructions for some super rare spells, including some which are unique to Z&Z like the modified Gate spell or the shield spell with ridiculous shaping requirements. This should have at least been enough to get Xvim to take his story seriously.

For that matter Zorian managed to convince Xvim of the time loop before without access to advanced knowledge/magic, though that took a couple of days and he didn't ask Xvim to cast any spells.

As for time dilation chambers, they are very tricky to access without magic and if they make even the slightest mistake they're stuck in a place they can't get out of.

*** I agree---I found Zorian's inability to convince Xvim extremely odd. Xvim's code, Alanic and Lukav's deaths, in-depth knowledge that only arch mages would have---and indeed knowledge that is based on novel research like the gate spell that can be casted without help from the destination, the advanced shield spell, Zorian's spell formulas and item schematics . . .

I feel even without magic, it would be enough to at least not get dismissed instantly by Xvim. But perhaps Xvim was so incredulous so quickly that Zorian got no chance to prove himself further.

Right now we're having breathers forced upon us by the 3-4 week gaps between chapters so non-plot chapters will make the wait doubly as long. But without those, a chapter with zorian re-approaching his classmates could provide great insight into his character growth and would actually end up helping the pacing massively imo.

#+begin_quote
  "/Unspeakable Cults/ is one of the most widely banned series of books circulating around Altazia and Xlotic," Zorian explained, idly leafing through the book. All sorts of ghastly drawings and descriptions immediately assaulted his eyes. "It was written by an anonymous author that had a penchant for infiltrating secretive cults and mage organizations so he could observe their ceremonies and activities. No one is quite sure how he did it, but considering the furor the books created, it's clear he didn't make it all up. Anyway, after infiltrating all these cults and watching them for gods know how long, he wrote a series of eight books that go into great detail about what he had seen. Every debauchery he had seen, every messed up sacrifice or morally-bankrupt experiment is described in great detail, and he even illustrated some scenes with drawings and diagrams. Although the books contain no actual spells or ritual setups, they have been banned almost everywhere as blasphemous, degenerate filth."

******* I'll agree with [[/u/eSPiaLx]] that it would be very, very nice to get some slice of life chapters/sidestories to MoL. However, I also agree with you - I'm eager to see the story move onto the next stage after the end of the time loop.

I actually enjoy Zorian's school setting and classmates to an unreasonable degree. I'd like to see much more of it - but not at the expense of moving the plot forward. The time loop has gone on for long enough. Just something to keep in mind for the future when you're looking at publishing MoL - a few sidestories would do a lot for fleshing out this world and the side characters. I'd especially like to see more of the wolf-girl in their class.

The point is that Zorian didn't gamble all or nothing on a single cure, and it is more that reasonable to expect Sudomir to collect various methods of soul repair and have tested their efficacy given his plan and hobbies.

*** Yeah, being unable to cast spells was too harsh of a result. There's no way for that to be a reoccurring obstacle and still have the story progress. If the damage was less severe, then it might have been able to be permanent, but as it is there isn't any way for Z&Z to do anything significant if their ability to do magic is significantly impaired.

Maybe if the damage was something like having constant bodily pains? Or some form of numbness, partial paralysis, or even memory loss. Those could have been things that stayed throughout the story, and acted as a real consequence for the previous chapter's mistake. Even if the damage slowly healed over time, or they needed to learn something to fix it, it would have been better. Instead there wasn't any way for them to do anything meaningful while they healed, meaning that from the reader's perspective not much time was spent on the consequences.

As an alternative, what if Z&Z needed to use crutches for the next few chapters, but they otherwise could function normally? It would be a real consequence that the reader would be reminded of, and very clearly see the results of that.

Zorian worked long and hard for those skills---like fifty chapters---so I'm okay with him knowing what to do.

***** That could have been demonstrated by having the ailment normally be permanent, but through Zorian's alchemy he makes it heal in a few months. The author controls everything anyways, he can have Zorian improve the situation from "permanent" to "a few months" just as easily as he made Zach's ailment go from "he may not wake up for weeks" to "he'll be fine in a little bit".

It doesn't matter how skilled a character is, if the author wants the audience to take injuries or setbacks seriously, we need to actually see the negative consequences of said setbacks. As it is, we were shown about as much story time spent on QI's attack's recovery as we had for Z&Z recovering from the injuries the Grey Hunter inflicted on them.

The number of restarts remaining decreased, but that's a classic example of "tell don't show". A number that barely any audience member was tracking anyways got decreased by some amount. The plans didn't change, their ability to enact those plans didn't change, and not only did Z&Z not have any permanent consequences, they even have improved due to the injury.

I know that we can't know the contents of the rest of the story at this point, but would the rest of the story have been significantly changed if the initial number of restarts remaining when they started tracking had been 5 fewer, and this whole subplot of QI injuring them was skipped? The thing with being injured with the Sword Divers made Zorian substantially less aggressive in gaining Aranean knowledge, and gave him a motive for revenge. He also started carrying around better suicide bomb things. The result of the current injury seems to be "Hey, let's try mind magic this time", something that would have been about equally likely to be thought of beforehand.

****** !delta. I don't feel the same gravitas with this as I felt with the Sword Divers death, which I still remember quite well. Although I will note that Zorian said without his soul and mind training, the damage could well have been permanent as his soul restructured his mind to integrate his loop memories.

In all honestly, though, I feel we'd be talking about this differently if these previous five restarts had occurred over three or four chapters where significant work was done despite not being able to do magic themselves. That would feel like serious consequences had occurred. Maybe it could go into depth about convincing Xvim sans magic---or perhaps Ilsa instead---then using whomever they recruit to help rescue Alanic and Lukath. Then they could find more to join their cause who would help them move goals forward in unexpected ways. It would be a five-month masterclass in minioning.

While that is one solution to the problem of this chapter, I don't think it's a great solution. It would kill the pacing, and I don't think that taking a multiple update break (translated into multiple real months of time) from using magic in a story where the magic is one of the most interesting focuses. Maybe if they had never been able to convince any of the people around them before of the time loop, and they had a few restarts where they focused on doing so rather than training, but at this point it would be really slow. It's barely even mentioned at this point how they convince their teachers of the time loop, so going back to spending a lot of time doing so would be annoying.

That said, I do commend you on offering a way of showing real consequences to Z&Z not being prepared for QI's attack. And I think it would have worked fairly well earlier on in the story. Just not at this point.

** Huh.

Unrelated to this chapter, I just realised what RR was probably up to, optimising the invasion over and over again.

If we assume that he owned that robe (since he had it easily available at the start of the month when he attacked Zach), and is thus an inner-circle cultist, then he actually wouldn't care all that much about maximising damage. But it didn't take him long to drop off tips to the invaders, and a more effective invasion would give him more time to work on the cult's true objective.

Remember how Zorian didn't think that their mind magic would be good enough to actually overpower the primordial? /What if they had someone who could try it over and over again in different ways, recording what worked well and what didn't?/

We now have a motive for initiating the loop early. Not a divine failsafe to contain the primordial, as some have suggested, but a secure laboratory to determine how best to break it out and put it on a leash.

Very unlikely. It's pretty hard to gather the five pieces, especially with QI wearing one, and RR didn't have to deal with the Gate being barred. I gather that the Controller doesn't normally need the Key in order to leave.

*** I don't think the primordial itself is looped. It's pretty clear that as powerful the Sovereign('s?) Gate is, it's not strong enough to loop anything more than what's within this "earth plane": spiritual planes, and therefore probably primordial dimensions, are off limits. When Silverlake inspected the summoning setup, she said that it's going to the same place, but from a different perspective: thus it's likely that connecting to a primordial within the loop actually connects to the linear-time extra-loop primordial, and the "different perspective" is because the loop dimension is located in a different meta-spatial position. The primordial is probably really confused about why these femtosecond-long gates keep pinging it at incredible frequency.

On that note, I strongly suspect that the reason for loop crash isn't something inherent to the primordial, but the time-speed differential between the primordial-dimension-body and the loop world.

Remember that Primordials contain an entire world inside them. So unlike measly human scale pocket dimension creation, it's possible that a primordial entering the time loop stresses out the Sovereign Gate and causes an automatic shutdown and restart in the same way that the time acceleration chamber shuts down when they try to bring the Imperial Orb with them.

What would it take to convince you that it won't work? Testing it? Zach /has/. He's tried to throw objects at QI a bunch of times, and QI literally handwaves them away.

And as for having him underestimate them, to even make the attempt, they would have to appear as nonthreatening as regular academy students. Which means shutting down some portion - quite possibly a large portion - of their activities, since those activities were enough to actually attract QI's attention and have him seek them out. So making any realistic attempt at tricking him into grabbing a thrown object has a significant opportunity cost. It's not at all a free shot that they're ignoring; it's a time and resources sink with no realistic prospect of a payoff.

Mind magic is a much more feasible approach. Since he's apparently not a psychic (based on his attack on Xvim), his only adequate defence against Zorian is Mind Blank. If Zach can dispel that, then QI can't just wave his hand and push Zorian out like he could knock away a soul coin. Either he goes mind-to-mind with Zorian and likely loses, or he evacuates and likely drops the crown.

One of the main issues that Zorian has to solve is about the fact that if he gets out of the loop, the original Zorian is still there with his own soul, so our Zorian has to find a way to get his body back without killing him. My theory is that he will use some form of soul magic to become something similar to a shifter (but having his own soul twice instead of two very different souls). We're told as early as chapter 29 that "shifters are people with two souls", and it seems to me to be particularly appropriate to the matter at hand.

Honestly the best part of this novel is going to be when they finally escape the loop and their actions have actual consequences on the world around them.

*** Risk/Reward. 19 restarts left, that's a year and a half. QI is the biggest threat IRL, and he represents direct access to one key and indirect access to another. They /have/ to interact with him a few more times just to practice getting the crown itself, and any information they can get on dunking him out of the loop would be invaluable.

QI's help is less crucial than it was. They have now had the chance to at least briefly examine the vault's wardstone, and they know how to break the tracker afterward. Busting the vault without QI would be very challenging, but has probably become possible.

Where before they would be harassed by the eagle riding royal dickwads, now they break the tether and continue through other plans of the restart even if they fail to get the dagger. They now have 19 attempts to get into the vault on their own.

** +I don't like the title of this chapter...+

Nevermind, the chapter title was a bit overdramatic. Fitting, but overdramatic nonetheless.

Tbh, I don't think it's such a bad thing for them to have taking their time off. I mean, it sucks that they were forced to lose those restarts but it doesn't hurt them to remember who they are doing those things for as well, and to rest their minds a little.
