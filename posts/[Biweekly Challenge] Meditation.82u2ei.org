[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z8jb8/biweekly_challenge_the_mentor/][Last time]], the prompt was "The Mentor". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z8jb8/biweekly_challenge_the_mentor/dun8us0/]["The Emperor's Final Meditation"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]] for their ninth win!

This time, the challenge will be *Meditation*. TVTropes has a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Meditation][useful notes]] page with a lot of links. I believe that meditation is of particular interest to the rationalist(-adjacent) community, largely because of its intersection with mindfulness and metacognition. In movies and television, meditation tends to be "magical", in the sense that it's really hard to show someone's thoughts on screen and is really easy to just show them sitting still and then snapping their eyes open with a sudden revelation. In prose, I think it's a good deal easier, because you can give the internal thoughts of the character and relate thoughts to metaphor, which gives a fair number of descriptive options. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, March 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Premortem*, here referring to a specific technique first coined by Gary Klein in [[https://www.amazon.com/Power-Intuition-Feelings-Better-Decisions/dp/0385502893][The Power of Intuition]]. In a pre-mortem, you imagine that something has failed, then imagine why that would be the case, as a sort of extension of [[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html][security mindset]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team][red team]] thinking. For the purposes of this challenge, you don't need to center your story around an actual pre-mortem, only around someone catching a mistake before it happens (or failing to catch a mistake, but at least putting in the effort), which should sufficiently open up the story-space. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/21*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2v1/challenge_companion_meditation/][is available here]].

*** u/Boron_the_Moron:
#+begin_quote
  I agree with Carl's assumption that the leaders of the cult probably don't understand the signal. Claiming to do so gives them leverage over the members of their cult, which explains why they want to keep its true contents under wraps.
#+end_quote

Or maybe they do understand the signal, enough to know that recording it onto a machine is a Really Bad Idea. Maybe they tried to scare away the viewpoint character for her own good, and her uploading the program has guaranteed that something horrific will soon happen. You ever read the SCP Foundation? Our hero could be about to unleash a doomsday-level memetic monster onto the world, yet she's so smugly assured of her own intelligence that she will never stop to consider that she might be in the wrong (until it's too late).

#+begin_quote
  I smile to myself. There's an even bigger hole in their plan: what will they do if I let that information go public? At that point, there's no incentive to kill me anymore. They will already have failed to keep the status quo, and killing me is unlikely to help them in facing the new situation.
#+end_quote

Why is the viewpoint character assuming that the cultists she's dealing with are as rational as she is? Maybe they'll kill her out of spite. How does she know that killing her is unlikely to help their goals? Maybe they'll kill her because she's been linked to their weird Earth-signal monster. She has no idea what's going on - she doesn't even have definite proof that the person(s?) who broke into her home and drugged her really are connected to the cult. They could be someone else entirely: her evidence is purely circumstantial. She doesn't even know if they really were malicious! They might have been trying to initiate her into their cult, by finishing her journey to signal-comprehension via chemical aids. /She doesn't know./

For a character who is supposed to be rational, she seems pretty irrationally confident in her own judgement, especially when it comes to judging the character of people she's never met. She also seems irrationally ignorant of the scope of her own ignorance. She's just discovered that meditation enables one's brain to pick up an encoded signal produced by the Earth's electromagnetic field, and now there's potentially a weird meditation cult trying to stop her research, and at no point does she consider that she might be out of her depth. She could be a monkey dancing on the Elephant's Foot and not even know it.

**** It IS unwise! Usually.

Personally, agonizing over a test (in the moment or in the weeks leading up to it) is my most probable failure mode. That doesn't mean I can skip material. I just can't wait until the last minute to learn it.
