** An impression of myself, by myself:

Here's a spreadsheet! Would you like to see a spreadsheet? Spreadsheets are fun!

In the background, my GPA slowly drains to nothing as I furiously try to program in a spreadsheet application that is not at all suited for programming.

** Re-posting my post from SV. I suggest we do the mission to go into town to trade. We already have to get through the swamp to get to town and can scout what and where things to be gathered from the swamp on our way in and out to report to our group. We won't be getting as much as if we scouted the swamp in full but we will be starting to forge/scout a safe path out should one be needed, which is important. Knowing what the lay of the land look like outside the swamp which can be done by obtaining a map or tracing one with our finger in town. If we want to risk it we could ask about the swamp from the people living next to it to see how traveled it is by ninja. This could lead to more jobs or a way of bribing the villagers to not report our being here if we can make the swamp safer for them to gather resources from if we report back our findings to Shikigami-sensei.

** I have to say that I find it odd that when the characters found out that the creatures of the swamp are strangely intelligent not a single person suggested making a ninja capable of communicating with them. Or even the possibility of communicating with them. That which has the power of reasoning abity can be reasoned with at least in theory.

Also I am real sad I am too late to join this game and make that suggestion.

*** Actually that was one of the first suggestions I made for a teammate. It was vetod because it would make them Jonin level, and thus too overpowered.
