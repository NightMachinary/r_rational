** Really agree, it's a hidden gem in all the garbage chinese cultivation novels, this one has a very particular horror setting and stands out in its worldbuilding and "cultivation" or advancement system. And it's the first one of at least two more books.

here's the problem dude, I haven't read a single chinese or korean novel since A Will Eternal was completed in wuxiaworld and even then that was the only one I was reading, this was barely after the webnovel model changes so I have no idea what pages are currently the most used to get around that problem. so that answer is not exactly helpful.

** The power fantasy and progression is pretty good, though it does fall to the standard asshole-protagonist-murders-and-exploits-lots-of-people-and-creatures-but-it's-justified-cuz-he's-the-protagonist(and somehow he's still a good guy cuz of that one good thing he does that he gets to congratulate himself over) framing that we've come to expect from the genre.

In order to gain power in this setting you have to eat lots and lots of sapient beings, including humans.

I'm on chapter 1000 or so, and the main things that bother me are the casual transphobia every ten chapters or so (which is bad enough that I've vowed to never give the author money in any way), and the anachronistically jarring fact that they play Texas Hold-Em in a Victorian-esque setting (and the translation even calls it "texas").

It's also in this odd place economically where it's both very cognizant about the plight of the poor and the environmental issues resulting from unfettered capitalism, but is also very adoring of money and capital. Combined with the transphobia and attitude towards animals etc, politically it's all very conservative Chinese.

The translation is a little janky, which might bother some people, but I don't mind; I like to think it's pretty clear to me the times when something is an artifact of the original language that didn't get ironed out in the adaptation, and to some extent I actually prefer it that way.

Some odd frequently-used words: Glabella. Genuflect.

*** The novel isn't transphobic. Dont try to completely misrepresent the entire story. With over 1300 chapters, you can count on one hand the instances where that could happen, which is hardly every 10 chapters. And in those scenes, you don't have to interpret it as transphobia. Especially since it involves a character physically transforming into the other sex, for the purpose of gaining a power level. And they do this by conducting sketchy rituals, and risk losing control of their mind and turning into a monster.

**** I am rather enjoying reading this story (I've stuck with it for over a thousand chapters!!), and I am sharing my honest thoughts on it, so it is unfair of you to accuse me of trying to misrepresent it. What I said is information I would have liked to have known going in, and that others may benefit from. Whether it's once every 10 chapters or once every 20, the transphobia is perennial enough that it becomes something of a rhythm within the story.

It is subtle and gentle enough that one could *very* generously read it as not having that problem at all, but that would be stretching things just to turn a blind eye. At the very least it was written without delicacy or understanding of trans issues, despite insisting on delving into related topics in a fairly dismissive and perversely intrusive manner, all the while being influenced by wider anti-trans philosophy.

To be fair to the story, despite the ongoing theme surrounding the relevant pathways, I did not expect a naturally trans person to show up at all, and when one did many hundreds of chapters in, while she wasn't understood well or fully accepted by the author nor by the other characters in the story, she at least was not unnecessarily maligned, and was treated as human (except by those who were clearly exploiting her, and properly framed as in the wrong). So there is that.

***** I can understand why you would want to know about that going in. I just dont see it being blantant and overtly transphobic, and have someone write off the novel because of it. Although Im not part of that group and obviously make that decision for them.

****** I am now very close to the end of the story, and instances of transphobia definitely taper off after chapter 1000 or so, so I can understand someone who has finished the story and was not particularly affected by the earlier instances might say the story is not transphobic, because of the availability heuristic -- the most recent 400 chapters they read of it are mostly fine in that regard.

Unrelatedly, a different complaint I had has been resolved, but I won't explain cuz spoilers.

EDIT: I have now finished the entire book. I rather enjoyed the ending, but I can't say I look forward to the sequel since it will apparently heavily involve the hunter/demoness pathways and I do not trust this author to handle that in anything approaching an appropriate manner.
