Links:  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13428239/1/Trials-of-a-Trainer][FFN]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21412963][AO3]]

Summary: There are trainers, and than there are great trainers. This is how I became the very best of them. Join Red and Blue as their rivalry takes them across a very dangerous Kanto in competition for the Grand Championship. Mix of game/anime/manga. Journey!fic Realistic!pok√©mon Realistic!PokemonBattles

Other Info: Influenced from Lamora's Game of Champions,  50CaliberChaos's The Sun Soul, and Vile Slander's The Saga of Kings, amongst many other fics.

Chapter 9 where Red has a bit of a breather after barely surviving his encounter with the scyther.

Stay safe everyone!


** Man I love this. Keep it up.
