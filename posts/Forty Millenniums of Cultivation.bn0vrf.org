** Glancing at the later chapters, I'm enjoying these (non-spoilerish) parts from chapters 1181 and 1182:

“You and I know the meaning and usage of the transliterations such as ‘romance' and ‘logic' because we share the memories of the ‘earthling Li Yao'. Both of the two words originated from the western civilizations on Earth and were passed on from Greek to English until they were loaned into the Chinese language!

“But Ding Lingdang and other people don't know anything about Earth. They don't know anything about ‘ancient Greek' and ‘English' at all. Then, why do they know the usages of the transliterations such as ‘logic' and ‘romance'?”

[/quote]

[quote]

“If the transliterations such as ‘romance' or ‘logic' are coincidences, how do you explain the following words?” Li Yao said coldly. “I've fought with the federal army and the Cultivators more times than I can count. Every time we are grasped by desperation, people always use two idioms to boost the morale---'break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back'!

“I didn't feel too strange about those two idioms before, but on second thought, do you not feel that it is horrifying?

“Where does the idiom ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' come from? It comes from an ancient general named Xiang Yu in the Chinese culture on Earth who smashed the cooking pots and burnt the boats, declaring to his army that there was no retreat, during the resistance against the Kingdom of Qin. Eventually, he crushed the magnificent Kingdom of Qin, thereby leaving the tale of ‘breaking the cooking pots and sinking the boats'!

“As for the idiom ‘fight with the river to our back', it is about another famous general named Han Xin, who deployed his army right in front of the river during a battle. It was also a method to encourage the soldiers to fight hard in the desperate situation because they had nowhere to retreat. In the end, he secured a victory, hence the idiom!

“It means that the two famous generals named Xiang Yu and Han Xin appeared on Earth first before the two idioms ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back' came into being!

“You and I boast the memories of the earthling Li Yao. So, it is not strange that we know the two idioms. But what about other people? Why are other people aware of the idioms that come from Earth?

“There are more popular idioms than ‘break the cooking pots and sink the boats' and ‘fight with the river to our back' in this era. For example, there are also ‘taste the gall on the hay' and ‘call a deer a house'... All of them are common idioms that people use on a daily basis, but they are based on the tales from Earth. Are they simply coincidences?

“Also, stocks, network, government, army... all those notions exist both on Earth and in the world of Cultivators and have the same spelling. How incredible is that?”

(Though I imagine 'call a deer a house' should be 'call a deer a horse'.)

*** I had this same reaction to it at first, but about... ten chapters in (which isn't far, with the length of them), I noticed that something happened in my mind, and two concepts that I had previously thought were inseparable---good writing, and good /prose/---sort of “delaminated” from one-another. The writing /was/ good, despite the prose being clunky, and in my mind I stopped noticing the prose, switching away from reading the English /as English/, and switching into the same frame of mind you enter when you read annotated middle-English, or follow along with the programme of a foreign-language opera---a mindset where the words on the page aren't the words of the story, but rather are a guide to visualizing what the words of the story /would/ be, if you could understand them; a guide that a native speaker of the story's original language could use to put the original sentences back together in their own mind.

This has never happened to me before, and I've read plenty of translated fiction, so I feel like there's something special here. I think it's just that the original quality of the prose /in Chinese/ often shines through, despite the translation rather than because of it.

As an aside: as a writer, I feel like this story's bad translation has actually improved my ability to draft! I now feel much more confident in what I'm doing when drafting: getting the /story/ down on paper, without trying at all to get the /prose/ I want down on paper. The translation here serves as a great example of what a /good/ author's unedited draft should look like, if they've internalized the concept of drafting as a separate phase from editing. (“Unedited” in the sense that anything that Microsoft Word could point out along the way has been fixed, but anything that requires a human editor to notice hasn't been.)

*** Skip to Chapter 95, past the first arc, to the MC going to college. The initial translator quit around that time and was replaced by the current one, who is very good. Also, the first arc is quite cliched, but the author improves greatly as the story progresses.

*** I'm a very big chunk behind, but IMO it does improve a fair bit with the newer translator. It never reached fluent English, though, and the “early” chapters is a very large amount of text in aggregate, so I'd advise avoiding this if the stuff you've read is beyond your patience.

** I'd like to recommend this here. 40 Millenniums starts out as a fairly typical xianxia story, but it turns into a deconstruction of pretty much every typical trope ever seen in the genre. Story focuses fairly heavily (compared to the genre, anyways) on transhumanism, morality, nature of humanity and other topics which seem interesting to this sub.

It also has flying swords used as amazon delivery drones and arguments on magical reddit.

It is also long for the fans of binging webserials. Like, very long. Currently the translation has 1190 chapters, which, even after you account for their smaller size compared to typical webfiction, still places it among the longest stories ever posted here, I think. Original has well over 3300 chapters, and translators are going at a sedate pace of just about 2 new translated chapters a day.

Is the original online as well? And, if so, is the prose less clunky in Chinese?

Asking because I've got a bilingual (natively Chinese-literate) friend who I've already convinced to read the story, but I'm wondering if I should advise they read the translation or (if possible) the original.

** Pretty good story, smart protagonist, and a good exercise in reviewing Cultivation Novel's clichees under a scientific and technological understanding.

My favorite part is when MC is reaching a new Cultivation stage in his original country, and he reserves an special facility dedicated to it.

It's like someone minmaxed the chances of the breakthrough, and pilled all kinds of bonuses in a single place: the record of an epic music executed by the most proficient orchestra, medicines administered by gas into the room that can be inhaled or absorbed by the skin, the paintings of the breakthroughs of several other cultivators.

Kudos to the author for the well tough scene.

*** That is exactly, canonically what happened: the Heaven's Origin sector wanted as many people as possible to advance to the Building Foundation stage, researched how that advancement happened, and then minmaxed the shit out of it because the expected value of doing so was large and positive. This is how people do things when they're competent and they actually care about the results.

** Speaking about chinese novels, I recommend [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/][Lord of the Mysteries]]

The setting is Viktorian styled with elements of mystery, Lovecraft and SCP. MC is cautious and carefully prepares. Internal contradictions are unusually low and translation is decent.

** Or fuck I here I thought I was close to the end of this book, currently on ch 789, and just found out that this series has not being finished yet...

So far is a good story, it avoids a lot of the cliches of other xianxia books, there are some moments, specially close to the end of an arc that God, they go on and on, on some lore or other background story that will somehow show up on the next arc... but overall great web novel...
