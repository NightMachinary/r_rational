The weird thing is, Malicia would probably be a better chancellor than Emperor. She focuses too much on political reality, and lacks long-term vision. In a way, I think the best possible outcome for team evil would be Catherine as Empress Victorious, Malicia as Chancellor, and Black as Black Knight or General. (Which, why the fuck is Adjutant a [name - edit], but General is not?)

**** Unfortunately, the very reasons for Alaya making a good Chancellor are also the ones that woukd ensure that she inevitably betrayed and supplanted her Tyrant. Because she focuses on political realities, she would become increasingly frustrated with the limitations imposed by Amadeus or Catherine or whoever else was on the throne. We already saw this conflict play out at Second Liesse. Amadeus and Alaya disagreed and came into conflict. If she had been Chancellor, that would have been exactly the moment she decided to betray the Tyrant of Praes.

Also, I think we (the fans) need to be more consistent in our use of the terms "Name" and "Role". Adjutant is a Name, but he fulfills the Role of "Right-Hand Man". Captain and Scribe are Names, and they each fill that same role. "Plucky Comedic Relief" is a role that might be filled by, for example, the Bumbling Conjurer. I believe ErraticErrata has been pretty consistent with those terms in-story.

The /mistake/ alluded to must be that dhe's letting him know Cat is alive and well. Bard did not say « She is dead » which would have been the optimal way to present it in context, but instead « she got killed again », and there is a heap of implications there Maddy could not miss.

***** So he was the diplomat representing Bellepheron in the Free Cities. Tyrant twisted a story around well enough to get him a Name, Hierarch, and elected him the leader of the Free Cities in a time of war.

Hierarch, being from a ridiculous democratic society, hates that he has a Name and is effectively a dictator, so he doesn't do much and Tyrant kind of rules in his stead a lot.

Bard pops up at the end of book 3 and talks to Hierarch saying she was the one who created the Name in the first place by accident. This gets Hierarch into a rare fit of pique (he gets them on occasion as he can pretty much see everything going on and he has a fair set of ethics to work off of, twisted as they are by Bellepheron).

Hierarch basically indicts Bard with a host of charges and sentences her to death. This decleration is so powerful she pops out of existence (like she does when she dies) and we don't see her again til much later.

I think he's got a ridiculously powerful name and a ridiculously powerful belief system and he's slowly developing into a counterpart to Cat in that he's pretty fucking pissed at the Gods Above and Below. He recently decided to pursue justice against the Choir of Judgement, so that will leave a mark on the Heavens.

I think he and Cat are going to be powerful pieces in getting the Accords signed and operational.

Also, I think he's hilarious. Just perfectly pissed off at his situation and the various laws he cites show a democracy run amok.

***** Basically, the bard pops in telling him he has to pick a side. Cause him sitting in the streets doing fuck all is mighty principled of him, but not how the game is played.

In response, the hierarch reveals he knows the bard, truly knows her, knows what she is. which gives us the epic quote

#+begin_quote
  “I know you,” he said.

  “We've met before,” the Wandering Bard agreed warily. “Had tea and everything.”

  “No,” Anaxares said. “I know you, old thing. You are the sound of the lash, the deal in the dark. You are the servant of stillness. I deny all you peddle.”
#+end_quote

after this he proceeds to renounce everything, gods above and below, and charges the bard with treason against the state. This actually seems to baffle the bard, after he finished speaking she pops out of existence as happens when she is attacked. Someone later mentions this seems to have actually disabled her for some time.
