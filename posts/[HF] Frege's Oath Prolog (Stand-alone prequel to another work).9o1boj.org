Damn, and I tried to explain the principles of the fourth dimension (which neighbors Kowalski's land) more throughly than in the old work (where I sorta skimmed over it) this time using Wattson for the Socratic dialog. You guys just can't appreciate my art. sigh! You try to explain rational fiction concepts of the rationality.

*** I mean, are you /sure/ you're not schizophrenic? Have you had the opportunity to see a doctor since the last time you posted, or otherwise considered the question?

Because from where I am, this looks a lot like schizophrenia, and I urge you to seek the opinion of a medical professional.

Seems a lot like word salad to me.

***** That's probably why we can't appreciate your art. You've got some over-active pattern matching going on, so where you're seeing a meaningful connection between two elements, the rest of us just aren't.

You may find other people enjoy your writing more if you find the right anti-psychotic medication, since it will make it easier for you to understand what patterns are going to be meaningful to other people.

******* Right, this didn't make sense. There were two big explanations for why it didn't make sense.

- I was failing to understand some obscure/occult dialect, and it was an intelligible work.

- They were failing to make sense.

I've read a lot of academic and occult stuff that "didn't make sense" at first glance, but was domain specific, or art, or whatever. I looked into their references more in depth to see if they were referencing a large body of pre-existing work that I was unaware of, like is was James Joyce fanfiction or something. A lot of the prominent names/references didn't show up when I searched for them.

This meant that they were probably just not making sense. There was a slight possibility that they were a very... academic type of academic, and english was not their first language. They could have been trying to translate some cultural archetypes from their native tongue, and that's why I couldn't find it. But it was a pretty small possibility. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_salad][word salad]] was a big warning sign in general.

#+begin_quote
  e.g. the question "Why do people believe in God?" could elicit a response consisting of a series of words commonly associated with religion or prayer but strung together with no regard to language rules.
#+end_quote

Schizophrenia and high-context art can look a lot alike from a distance, so the key was distinguishing between the academia/postmodernism/occultism/art cluster and actual schizophrenia.

If you're looking for specific warning size, well the big one was just that it didn't make sense. Generally with the non-schizophrenic academic/whatever stuff, well they want to make you work to understand it but there's a lot more of a common thread throughout. Whereas skimming through their stuff it was a lot more disconnected. It didn't seem like a story told out-of-order, it seemed like a bunch of disconnected scenes. Or scenes that you could only connect if you had hyper-active pattern matching, which is a symptom.

One warning sign was the imagery used.

#+begin_quote
  It was long ago said by Timaeus that geometry and the elements are connected. Fire, Yaltabaoth saw. He used it to make fiery pyramids. Earth, he used to make a cube.
#+end_quote

Basically anything that reads like the revelations was probably written while either high or mentally unwell. When you start talking about eyes within eyes, or a 6 faced beast where each face is a different animal, that's a big warning sign of over-active pattern matching and/or visual hallucinations (did you know that visual hallucinations tend to follow similar patterns in humans?).

Finally, there was the poor ability to predict the future. The youtube-channel linked included a link to a (deleted) kickstarter for a game based on this work. It was clear that they had no objective measure of the how meaningful other people would find it, which implied they had a muddled understanding of what makes something meaningful.
