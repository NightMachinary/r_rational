#+end_quote

Oh I love that, so many 'anti-hero' or grim dark hero's hold the high road because they say they are willing to compromise, but they aren't, they are willing to win a little less, if it means allies in the future, even Cat has made this mistake again and again, with Praes and Procer.

This is Cat realising that isn't how compromise works, someone has to give, someone has to let go. Unlike so many other characters in this situation she was able to give in and prove her willingness to sacrifice, this is a huge moment of character progression for Cat and I hope it goes well, instead of turning back against her like so many other choices.

Whole point of compromise is that both parties settle on the terms /together/. Offering the entirety of negotiating power to the other party is just willingly consigning yourself to whatevers shreds of honour and decency they might have.

  Hypocrite to end, was I? Demanding what I would not offer. Was compromise on my own terms even compromise at all, or just victory by another name? For all I'd said tonight, one thing had not changed: I had not learned to /lose/. I dragged myself up, biting my lip not to scream at the flare of pain.

** Many here have said that it's a bad move to turn down power, but I think it's been a running theme of the series.

#+begin_quote
  “Villains like Heiress think of power as something they can rain down on their enemies, but that's a false perception. She could set an entire field aflame and still die from an arrow in the throat. And unlike you, she will get in that situation. You make mistakes because of who you are, Catherine, not because of what your Name drives you to do. You can learn. You can adjust.”
#+end_quote

In this story all the strongest powers have strings attached by divine design. Black's entire strategy involves avoiding the easiest paths to power to avoid the inevitable fall those bring. No over reliance on super magic swords, doomsday weapons, etc.

Instead foundations are built on mortal strengths. Fair governance, meritocratic organization, competent leadership, etc. Supernatural tools are only used when they're under control.

It's looking like her goals will eventually bring her into conflict with the bard/gods. In such a situation the narrative charged winter mantle would be an easy target for the continents foremost expert in narrative.

By shunting that power onto an ally it leaves her significantly weaker personally, but in a strategic sense she's in a better position to manipulate the narrative than she has been in a long time.

*** In the short term this is going to deflect the attention of Saint and the Grey Pilgrim given that she's passed over the Winter crown. If she gets them where she wants them she can play them off against Procers heroes, and maybe even turn Pilgrim and Saint against each other when it comes to dealing with Catherine. Saints gone completely nuts and will always just want to cut her up, but depending on how Evil the role she picks up is she may be able to appeal to Pilgrim, he was thinking about cooperation before.

Some more symmetry: Cat giving up her claim and Uauu's father releasing his claim on Warlock. I'm not sure what that corrollation means, if anything honestly. He got his wishes of spending time with family by giving up power, but I'm not sure if that trend will hold for killing capital G Gods.

**** I'd be rather disappointed. Cat succeeding against her current foes without a scrap of personal power stretches belief, especially since it opens her up to a ton of stories she has little defense against. She's made it this far playing stories, yes, but having the narrative weight of Squire or Sovereign of Moonless Nights has saved her more than once. Not to mention the personal power involved. She'd have lost at Second Liesse, lost against the crusade, lost in Keter, and lost before even entering the Everdark without the improved capabilities of Name or Title, discounting Aspects and other esoteric powers.

My money here is on Cat gaining a Name as a result of her actions, likely one that encourages climbing the Tower. It makes narrative sense that having Winter interfered with her 'destiny' as a Tower Claimant, and now that she's given up the mantle in full, we're likely to see another verse.

****** Oh, it would.

That said, I doubt it'd be Heiress. Both people we've heard of with that title were literal heirs, nobility. If the Name was to do strictly with the Tower, my money would be on Claimant. It kinda fits Cat, too, as she's claimed quiet a few things. Queen of Callow (to Contrition), a Dukedom in Winter, Sovereignty of Winter.

Interestingly enough, if you merge her claim of being the Duke's 'child' with Winter overall, every claim she's made, she's made multiple times. For Callow, it'd be with Contrition, at her coronation, and with the ghost of a King of Callow in Keter.

Winter, it's being the daughter of the Duke of Violent Squalls, taking the Duke's position via combat (and subsequently having her heart torn out), and ripping the framework of Masego's working to accept Winter in full.

I'd have to look around a bit, but I suspect there's a third thing that Cat has laid claim to, and thrice over at that. It'd fit really neatly into a three-of-three pattern.

Alternatively, the third thing Cat claims thrice could be the Tower itself, with each claim also being a pivot in a Pattern of Three with Malicia. I could see Malicia striking the first blow, establishing the pattern and also giving the first loss. The second would be a win for Cat, setting up the climactic final showdown to determine the winner.

Probably not going to happen, but it'd be neat.
