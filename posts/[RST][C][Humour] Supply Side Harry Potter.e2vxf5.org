*** Congratulations. You've actually managed to make me feel sorry for Voldemort (as, if this were /really/ written by Ayn Rand, that speech would have gone on for /days/ before he was allowed to die).

** This is the second HP fanfic I've read. The first being MOR. Actually I'm not interested in fanfic, but reading somebody thought stealing it is worthwhile, it intrigued me. That said, is it tradition for rationalist Harry to be insufferable little twit?

Break the tradition!

I'd say there's a subset of philosophers whose written fiction have issues. (Though some are worse than others. With the really bad ones, you can tell that each book is a metaphor for something, but you don't have the faintest idea what it is, unless you stumble across another author who wrote the same story, and did a better job or explained in the intro what the book was about.)

*** There are not a whole lot of rationalist Harries that I'm aware of. Not even all that many rational ones, really.

Though I do recommend some of the sequels/continuations of MoR, like Significant Digits.

*** I read a Harry Potter/ warhammer 40k crossover, and Harry brings death to heretics, is that better than being a little twit?

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
#+end_quote

is the description. it turns out that Harry was transported to the grim dark future of humanity. Harry returns as an Inquisitor and due to a quirk of politics has to stay at Hogwarts.
