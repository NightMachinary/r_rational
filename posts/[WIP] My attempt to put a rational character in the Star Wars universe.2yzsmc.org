It's an interesting story, but we kind of need to see at least the first conversation or so before you can move on. If this was a story about someone else, and we the audience were to discover that they were influenced by a Sith Holocron later on, that would be a good way to write it. But he's the main character, and the influence these teachings have on his philosophy and methodology are kind of important, so we need to see more of that journey than you've shown.

**** I read it as just getting actual force training that a pre-master newb usually wouldn't, with the what and how of that to come later in the story -- maybe during a "teaching his friend" bit. A re-grounding on saber fundamentals, plus /passive/ stuff he picks up because he's a giant nerd like that explains his growth /as a force user/, I think.

Maybe training more like Luke had with Yoda, just...perhaps with dangerous Sithy shortcuts. In any case, nothing wrong with a little plot-as-you-go on that point or dramatic tension on the details.

Luke doesn't get much lightsaber training before trying for Vader, either, just lots of training in using the force. Vader wasn't just messing with him. Luke pushed him back a few times, and Vader was supposed to be a monster. Even scores a hit on his armor before losing.

From that point of view, the dueling stuff is just our protagonist's pod racing scene, to show how in touch he is with the force now. That his opponents tried to trip him up after seeing him winning by losing their own style-focus and emotional control could be telling. The force clearly wasn't with them in any case.

Or maybe he let the Sith take direct control of his body until after the contests were over. A risky strategy, and one that might explain his conversation after with her. And why he was avoiding his friend during that period. How he limited that sort of thing would be the trick, otherwise she'd likely have done something more or still be in control. Maybe she /did/ do something to guarantee his "loyalty" in learning from her and falling to the dark side.

--------------

Regardless, movie canon is that people don't detect /real/ Sith and the more passive use of their dark side powers until it is too late, even while standing right next to them. Unless they have a powerful prior relationship or /specifically/ want to be seen, that is. Darth Maul in Ep 1 is showing off during his final "ambush". Maul almost killed them without being detected earlier in the movie, after all. Any galaxy spanning, dark side detection jedi powers are all very much only in the EU.

I think it was suggested in this story that the jedi masters were looking for him using force techniques during his duels, but they might not have been looking for specifically Sith stuff. Detection of someone passively using the dark side in person is sort of vague and could go either way. Even detecting someone is full-on Sith is super hard for jedi masters.

In later movies, Darth Vader has a connection to Luke, which is how the long-distance sensing thing worked between them. Only started after TESB, when Luke got some training to power up. Even then, it was only after Vader was told who Luke really was and they met in person, face to face. Still ambushed Luke three times, though. Sith are sneaky like that. They don't have some evil aura or something.

Point is, Luke can't sense the Emperor long range. Or vice versa, as Vader senses Luke on the moon when the Emperor doesn't (at first, at least). Same deal with Obi-Wan and Vader, at least at relatively close range.

You practically have to make them whip out the force lightning or the red lightsaber to positively identify. So in this story, he might just be hiding any Gray or Dark force use. Works for direct control scenario as well. Will be interesting to see what you do with this point in the story.

  I am pretty curious how a Sith's teachings allow him to mend years of neglect in light saber training but it doesn't necessarily cause disbelief.

It's not entirely improbable. I studied dueling[1] for a number of years, and I recall that small things could make a huge difference in performance -- getting a grasp on distance and learning to beat foible-to-forte (as opposed to middle-to-middle) being two good examples of things that can be learned in a few hours and make a large difference to your combat ability.

[1] Fencing is a sport based around making a light come on by touching someone with the tip of your weapon. Dueling is the art of killing someone with a Western-style sword.

**** I'm almost certain your fic has to be well /before/ Revan does his/her thing in the Second Sith War, or a good while after.

Before means you need to do some research, after means some added complexity and fewer available KOTOR characters. Or just say "meh, none of that is official canon anyway now" and write something that sounds jedi-esque. Both work. I'll assume you want /some/ EU stuff.

[[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Sith_War][Great Sith War]], [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian_Wars][Mandalorian Wars]], [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Civil_War][Second Sith War]]. Lots there to work with. Check it out.

--------------

If placed after any of those wars, some scars would surely still remain, and people coming into contact with Sith stuff will be much more closely watched for a long while. After those wars, increasingly so after each, there were a lot fewer jedi for a while.

That didn't seem like the case here, so I'd shoot for before any major wars, or suggest that there was a /very/ quick return to Jedi Order status quo if placed soon after.

Which might in itself be effective. More commentary on how static and unchanging the jedi are. I don't remember /how/ secret the Darth Revan thing turns out to be to the general populace in either the games or EU stuff. Might be a good secret for someone finding their own way to stumble upon. Would be pretty shocking.

Especially the whole "mind wipe" bit. That's...not good. Memory wipe is death in almost all rational universes. That Revan has magic personality resilience was sort of a happenstance. No reason to think the Council wouldn't try to mindwipe our hero too, if he got annoying.

--------------

Character reference wise, a passing wave at Revan (before or after the council takes him/her down) or some such might work, maybe during the Mandalorian Wars. Could also do something with Exar Kun if the Great Sith War kicks off during the story.

But I wouldn't overdo it unless you want to start a fixfic for KOTOR or some seriously AU stuff. Again, might be easier to just place it somewhere vague if that isn't what you want to focus on.

Oh, and good start to your fic. Keep it up.

Interesting that he seems to be taking a Grey Jedi route. I would have liked to see more about what he learned from the Sith Holocron that got him so far ahead in lightsaber combat.

Of course, it could be as simple as "The masters don't deign to teach you anything important until you've been accepted" and "The Sith in the Holocron did."

*** Or a single year before the events of Episode Two, on a different planet that wasn't in Yoda/the council's area of influence.

A galaxy spanning organization having a central temple implies other temples, as we also see in Old Republic fics. There is also an organizational size issue. This could just be the "red shirts" level view we only see in EU books.

Good 'ole George's limited scope of imagination never really handled large scales very well. Distances, populations, economics, all shit in the movies. Even a couple of jedi per planet (making those selected for training one in several billion) would fill a single building of the scale of the central temple shown in the movies many times over.

Remember that senate room? Those aren't even assigned per-planet. Thousands of senators would be needed to fill that room, and they only represent a plurality of planets in the galaxy. No Hutt space, little outer rim, lots of systems not even represented.

Even suggesting most jedi are away from HQ most of the time doesn't fix that, given training rollup requirements (if that were the only temple), logistics trains, and pre-war conditions. Do only one in a hundred, or a thousand, jedi have direct access to that nifty library? Is Yoda's class the only one in that cohort? Seems iffly even if you allow for that. It's a mess.

Still, you are likely right. Seems like Old Republic given the setting cues. Might even be a Reven analog with the coming conflict as the same war he/she fought in. If Mandalorians start showing up, that'll be a tipoff.

I will note that that is still 'The Old Republic', which I meant as 'pre-Galactic Empire' and not 'Revan's time, ca. 3970 BBY'.

What you say makes eminent logical sense, and there are clearly other temples (we see the one on Dantooine in KOTOR for example) but the Coruscant one is the most central. There was a great library on Ossus, but it was destroyed in 3996 BBY by Exar Kun.

This is especially true since we know some races have much higher percentages of population that are force sensitive - there simply must be more temples and training areas.

This is my rant time.

That excuse just doesn't work anymore. Maybe for Eps 4-6, because of budget and scope and setting, but not for the new prequels, when the jedi order was supposed to be at its height. The Clone Wars cartoons, which get a lot better later if you have the stomach for it, don't even expand on this.

It would take maybe five words to minimally establish. With CGI and modern animation, you don't even need to make an expensive matte painting for a quick establishing shot if more was needed.

Everything is always about the temple on Coruscant, which in the prequels is the /only/ temple and the only force sensitive order at all (*in canon*), which just doesn't fit with the proper scale of things. Even the KOTOR games get closer to right, and they are still way off. The size of the Empire is at least that of the Republic. The Old Republic should be even larger at some times. Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars III re the current Empire:

#+begin_quote
  The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
#+end_quote

That's big. And that only counts the Republic planets, and they don't own the entire galaxy while apparently still accepting any force sensitive to the order. Anakin not being a republic citizen wasn't an issue that was raised, after all.

Still, if we're talking Republic space only, and /only/ around ten billion people per /system/ (assuming only /one/ habitable planet and no orbitals or other habitats), we're still looking at crazy huge scales here.

Thousands of systems, meaning at least two thousand, times ten billion, times how rare are jedi? Are successfully trained jedi literally one in ten billion? If not, the jedi order is too small. Two thousand jedi trained and in training is too small, and way more than are ever even /suggested/ to exist in the movies. Not even the AU books fix this with their agricorp blathering.

There could be maybe a hundred jedi knights in the Clone Wars cartoons (the most extensive look we get), but only a dozen or so that we ever see in detail. There are only about as many jedi masters as apprentice padawans shown, maybe three times as many younger students /in total/ at the central (and apparently only) temple, and in direct defiance of all hierarchical logic almost no "solo" knights other than Anakin even hinted at.

This is sloppy and bad, not just budget constraints. This is on the order of a planet being destroyed and it being "as if millions of voices suddenly cried out". A galactic war killing "millions" is a common failing in sci-fi. This dearth of jedi. Darth Dearth would be great.

A single line about "all the smaller fights" or "the lesser battles for the scattered temples being hard fought" or a single temple outpost behind Separatist lines would give much of that needed depth to the universe. There is simply no excuse for portraying a /galactic/ scale organization like that. Given how long they've existed, and the fact that they're a order guarding the galaxy's peace, not simply the local Lion's Club, Jedi should be as numerous as the clone troopers, at least at the lower levels of the order.

Lucas had no trouble with epic space battles and legions of anonymous CGI storm troopers. That there is limited time simply isn't an excuse that works anymore when CGI people can be made cheaply to add to the background. He showed how large the Republic government was with CGI. Why is the jedi order shown to be a handful of masters, with maybe two dozen jedi to muster with Mace when the shit hits the fan?

There should be /millions/ of jedi in the universe. Hundreds of thousands of jedi masters. Hundreds of temples, each headed by an elder at the level that might be considered for a council seat. That's how /real/ religious orders work, why not space ones? That's how a /real/ space opera would work, echoing or playing off familiar themes of things like the Catholic church or Buddhist orders.

Such lost opportunity.

I suppose. Notable however is that these seem to be historical period names akin to 'Middle Ages', or 'Classical Era' and not 'the set of all years in which the Galaxy was ruled by the Republic which existed before Palpatine's empire.'

The fact that the so called 'Rise of the Empire' period, which for some reason extends a thousand years before Palpatine's birth includes within it [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Age_of_the_Old_Republic][The so called Golden Age of the Old Republic]] tells me that whoever is writing these histories is a bit flaky.

Then again, ask 5 modern historians what years constitute the 'High Middle Ages' and you'll get 7 answers, so it's not surprising.

The rant is spot on. It's similar to the problem with Warhammer 40k's Imperium in a way - the Imperial Guard is noted as having trillions of members, which makes sense for its size, but even at their height, most Space Marine chapters have what, 1000 members? For multiple solar systems?

Even if each member was a man sized main battle tank that could fight for weeks, that's not enough to effectively conquer a single planet in any sensible length of time.

I suppose part of the problem with the Jedi is that millions of Jedi would not be defeatable. Especially with FTL and precognitive psychic sensing and communication. Order 66 doesn't work on that scale, even if you had the trooper numbers to pull it off - at those numbers there is no way to avoid a much larger percentage of jedi slipping through the cracks.

--------------

To get a feel for the scope of the issue, consider a back-of-the-napkin model of the "peaceful," not-at-Sith-war galaxy at a single point in time (WARNING READING REQUIRED):

- *One million trained and training jedi* in the galaxy, the top members of which sit on a council running the Republic's command and control organ for force-sensitives, i.e. the Jedi Order.

  - Which, X-Men style, also has a small fighting branch, the Jedi Knights. A /Force Special Forces/, if you will...Okay, I'll be good. Mouse away from the downvote button.

- Some wash out, so say one in ten graduate the school of serene knocks. I think that's actually better than the X-Men ever manage. That leaves *ten million more losers half-trained or worse*.

  - Who then either become normal dirt farmers (really?) or fall and become dark-side opponents at some very small fraction. All the better to prop up the Republic's jedi-industrial complex and their own religious beliefs about people who aren't trained falling to the dark side, 'natch.
  - NOTE: these are not true Sith-trained master/apprentice pairs, they just throw the lightning and maybe wear too much dark eye shadow.
  - Maybe at the rate of one in a million failed trainees turning? Seems low, doesn't it? Well, too high and failures would rationally just be killed, like Slytherin sortees should have. They were like, what? One in a thousand for becoming Death Eaters between the '60s and '99, and most rational readers consider that criminal. It isn't that sort of rational Jedi Order I'm discussing here, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that their methods work as they say.
  - So *ten or so meh trained dark force users* in the galaxy at any time directly caused by jedi training failures, assuming no major Sith bases running or massive cloning operations or such.

- Three times that are never asked. *Thirty million force users are left behind* in the galaxy.

  - /About/ two thirds not being worth training plus those not found makes sense if they recruit from -1 σ and up, assuming /those with force powers/ are on a bell curve
  - The rest of this figure is made up of those missed, found too late, outside Republic search program zones, living on crapsack worlds, joining other force cults, etc.
  - Call their dark side rate as actually higher, thus giving the benefit of the doubt to the Jedi Order -- you can sort of follow that logic.
  - Say, an order of magnitude more likely for them to turn? That's a lot. Call it *three hundred self-trained dark siders*.

- /Maybe/ *ten thousand combat ready Jedi Knights* at any time. An absurdly high rate for civilians, but also not exactly fighting monks levels. That's one percent of jedi actually being a warrior trained to kill people, and proven good at it. WWII was about 12% of the US population actually in the military, many fewer using weapons.

  - More than enough to find and contain the *three hundred ten or so dark force users* in the galaxy, not including the environmental Sith effects at whatever rate they pop up.
  - Much of that...err, /force/ will be used to keep casinos in business and merchants from being robbed by space pirates lead by wild talent force users who /aren't even dark siders/. Another budget prop, but actually justified in a galaxy where some people have superpowers /and/ super tech.
  - That level of control let's them say the galaxy is "peaceful" from their point of view, and helps justify their Senate budget bills by every dark sider breakout event scaring a few locals who report up the chain and hit galactic headline news.
  - Think L.A. car chase news, but with more face paint and dark clothing. Not genocide level stuff usually, but people die in city and planet significant numbers because of the dark side force users. And all news at high tech levels is galactic news.

- Here is where it gets weird. I started running these numbers before working out the consequences. So, call it *two* "true" *Sith* who actually studied the inner sect secrets coming from at-risk force users (failed jedi /plus/ unaccounted for force sensitives, all 40 million) at a rate of /not very often/.

  - Say that's a one in a million thing to happen to a vulnerable force user. What's that mean?
  - I'm assuming those already using the dark side would be most likely to be drawn to dark Sith secrets and relics, because Force.
  - That means once every 3,000 years or so (during relative peace times, more during open galactic warfare) two Sith pop up to wreck shit.
  - That just about fits, with three major Sith-related wars (counting the Rebellion against a Sith controlled Empire) in the Republic's 25,000 year history, plus a lot of rooting out lone gunmen Sith studying naughty things like immortality (this is canon). That means there is something like a 50/50 chance that a Sith pair will start a major war /just by themselves/.
  - A war that will kill /hundreds of trillions/.
  - Note that these two Sith will be /fighting/ 10,000 or or so Jedi Knights only if they get drastically stupid. They can obviously hide well. And are powerful.
  - But if you (a Sith) can cause even a small schism within the jedi order, you can get a force of tens of thousands of force sensitive trainees to torture into combat effectiveness quickly. This trope matches with Sith being heartless task masters (literally) for lots of little dark force user drones while also trying to avoid Sith on Sith violence by (eventually) limiting enrollment in the inner secrets.
  - Huh. Can kinda see the jedi's point with these numbers. *By only adding a small number of failures with their tactics to the potential Sith pool (compared to not training everyone -- which to fix would require bad means), the biggest issue is trained jedi splitting off the order when a random Sith shows up.* Better to not even train those people who would so defect, since that's where your problem really is -- trained jedi falling.

- I haven't included a conversion rate for trained jedi falling to the dark side or straight-up becoming Sith here. I'm giving the jedi the benefit of the doubt that /if people follow their methods/ then trained jedi don't fall like that, or the very few who do are pruned before the fall and are included in the loser dropout numbers of dark siders.

  - An order that loses many people post-secret-handshake works a lot different than the Jedi Order, who seemed surprised that people like Asoka and Dooku would just up and leave. That indicates it is a rare event as well, and they are mostly concerned with people splintering because of religious differences, not some instant-Sith disease or artifact effect.
  - And they're already set up by numbers and temperament (and even librarians being armed and partially trained civilians) to pile on and insta-gib dark siders and Sith who are so obvious as to become known to them by, say, cackling wildly during summer festivals or gutting a couple of students in the Garden of a Thousand Cliches.
  - Which makes obvious evil a non-starter and the canon secret Sith plots quite rational.

- As for the rest of the jedi, call it 100,000 in training at any time, and the rest just being monks, diplomats, scholars of jedi-specific topics, and teachers. I'd expect lots of effort there to avoid letting in someone who's about to chestburster into a dark sider, wandering the galaxy being self-important and wise, and lots and lots of wisely watching their own for heresy.

  - The upper tiers would be swapping in and out from running peacekeeping duties and central administration at HQ. They don't need to be combat monsters, just masters of the force.
  - Still, I'd expect a lot of art to come from the jedi order, pieces on philosophy and science. But they are all about containing ambition, so...that's effectively a dead population group for advancing culture. Sad, really, but not statistically significant on a galactic scale, so they don't suffer too badly for it.

--------------

Weird. I was expecting something else going in. But it seems like, given my assumptions (including a moral and effective Jedi Order as written), they actually do a really important job. Without 10,000 Jedi Knights cleaning house, the dark siders would run around unchecked, building up until a Sith popped out and started trying to rule/destroy the galaxy. And another. And another...

And it all seems to fit with canon "facts" and tropes. I think rational Star Wars is a lot more possible once you stop making the Star Wars story about a single shawarma joint full of superheroes, and more about managing ubiquitous and double-edged superpowers at a galactic scale.

*/tl;dr, a snarky Sith fan concludes that with realistic galactic numbers of force sensitives, dark siders ruin everything, the Jedi Order a necessary force for order in the galaxy./*

#+end_quote

Well, I'm thinking Order 66 could include attacks on /all/ temples, which would have been where most jedi non-combatants retreated during war. If the Dark Side clouding their perceptions work on a galactic scale on two dozen people, it doesn't exclude it working on a galactic scale on ten thousand, or a million people. It seems to be the distance thing was the hard to understand part there, not clouding the minds of lots of jedi. Anyway, even if it required thousands of Sith trained dark side force users (like Jade in EU) hunting down librarians to pull off, that isn't impossible. Then the clones frag their commands and Vader spends the next twenty years tracking down the dregs, along with a few thousand of his own trained non-Sith dark siders.

And we know they don't just kill all force sensitives. Jedi weren't doing a great job repopulating themselves either, so that didn't slow births of force sensitives. There will still be just as many being born after the purge. They just won't be getting trained /as jedi/. Wonder what the Emperor has planned for /them/. Egh.

But that's not the bad part of large numbers of force sensitives. It gets worse. I'm thinking about other larger groups this implies even during the "peace" of the Republic.

First, consider the Jedi Order* needs to be functional (rationally speaking) to in at least one thing to have it last 25,000 years mostly intact. Continuing to exist. And Sith all go straight for the Order when they pop up.

Now consider a million force sensitives in the Jedi Order maybe, total. Ten times that many rejected, dropouts, or "other". Not exactly a safety school here in the US, but still. I'm being generous.

Say, three times /that/ below entry threshold, never picked up, or part of the other force sensitive groups that /obviously/ should exist -- unless the jedi are keeping their Monopoly of Force in using the Force by...force.

/Ahem/.

That's a lot of non-jedi force users.

** Pretty cool!

Not much to comment on so far, but it really is well written and enjoyable. I would definitely like to see more.

I know very little of Star Wars canon beyond the films, but I thought all padawans who weren't apprenticed to a Jedi were asked to join the Jedi Service Corps?

*** There is no /official/ canon beyond the films and later cartoons anymore. Sorry. Also, that line still fits as they aren't /really/ in the jedi order.

Noted. Replace what I said with "I know very little about the Star Wars books, but ..." then.

You sure? [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Service_Corps][This wiki-article]] seems to say the opposite:

#+begin_quote
  The Jedi Service Corps was an organization formed by the Council of Reassignment during the Old Republic era as an alternative to serving in the more traditional capacity of the Jedi Knights. Because it was run by the Jedi Order, the members of the Service Corps were all considered Jedi, though many of its members had failed to pass their Initiate Trials and therefore could not proceed in training at the Jedi academy.

I have no idea how correct it is, though.

***** Good point. "Run by" reads to me as religious ownership of a business, or bureaucratic management of a government labor organization/concentration camp for failed ubermensch, but it could read in other ways.

Jedi is actually used in the films to mean more than in the EU books. I don't see how Vader can say to Luke, "Most Impressive, but you are not a Jedi yet" if a farmer without a lightsaber is one.

I mean, sick burn and all, but it doesn't logically add up.
