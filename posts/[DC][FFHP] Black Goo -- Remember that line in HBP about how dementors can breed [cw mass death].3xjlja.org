** There's a very interesting fanfiction out there (found the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][link]] ), in which the world is besieged by a zombie virus spawned by dementor reproduction. It's an interesting read. Never thought I'd see HP mixed with zombie apocalype.

** Hmm. They should be unable to breed further, no? With no humans left on Earth to feed them. Perhaps the Sol system could be warded...

*** The breeding stops, yes. But they don't starve. There are now a billion or so hungry dementors on that planet. All looking for food.

I suppose they could try to go back and erect wards. It's not clear if an imprisonment ward on that scale is possible. It would be a multi-generational effort (no FTL) and they'd never be sure it wasn't too late.

*** "And as if all that wasn't enough," said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, "we've got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and center..." Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.

"I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban," he said cautiously.

"They did," said Fudge wearily. "But not anymore. They've deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won't pretend that wasn't a blow."

"But," said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, "didn't you tell me they're the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?"

"That's right. *And they're breeding.* That's what's causing all this mist."

The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.
