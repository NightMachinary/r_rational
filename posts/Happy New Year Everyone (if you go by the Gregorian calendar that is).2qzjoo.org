It's a brand new year upon us and I have decided to issue a challenge!

Make a New Year's resolution about anything and use your skills in rationality to keep it.

Don't forgot to share your resolution and how well you maintained it.


** Happy New Year to all of you who don't actually know [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah][the New Year started in late September.]]

I "resolve" to finish my Bayesian stats textbook, and start into my textbooks in Algorithmic Information Theory and Probabilistic Models of Cognition.

Technically, I've started the latter already, and was already planning to do the former. Aren't /rational/ resolutions so easy?

Rosh Hashanah is a two-day celebration, which begins on the first day of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tishrei][Tishrei]]. Tishrei is the first month of the Jewish civil year, but the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year.

*** What are the names of your textbooks? It's hard to find a good textbook on my areas of interest without asking someone who's already looked through a couple.

Also, doesn't it defeat the purpose of pledging "rational" resolutions if you are going to do it anyway? It seems to only help by clarifying it as a clear goal instead of something you /might/ get to later. Which might be your point!

Carry on, nothing to see here.

Bayesian stats: /Introduction to Bayesian Statistics/ by Bolstad, with /Probability Theory: the Logic of Science/ by Jaynes for when I just want to read a mathematician ham it up on the level of the finest anime characters.

Probabilistic Models of Cognition: [[http://probmods.org][my God I just gave you the book's name]]. And I've preordered Pfeffer's /Practical Probabilistic Programming/ to help me learn this stuff in a typed language ;-).

Algorithmic Information Theory: /Information and Randomness/ by Calude

I've also got Smullyan's /Logical Labyrinths/ and some old /The Elements of Mathematical Logic/ and /The Theory of Sets/ my advisor threw out (NO REALLY MY MSC ADVISOR THREW OUT THESE BOOKS WHEN HE MOVED OFFICES). Also /Conceptual Mathematics/ and /Certified Programming with Dependent Types/. And Aluffi's /Algebra: Chapter 0/. And possibly a Coursera sequence on statistics, ML, and data analysis, though I'm currently using /Understanding Machine Learning/ by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David for the last course of my MSc.

EDIT: OH, and then the /Homotopy Type Theory/ book is very interesting just as a cool new approach to founding math in computation.

SECOND EDIT: NOTE TO SELF, STOCHASTIC DOMAIN THEORY NEEDS TO BE A THING.

THIRD EDIT: LEARN TOPOLOGY. IT'S BASICALLY THE /DETAILED/ MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION. ALL TOPOLOGY THEOREMS ARE, IN SOME FASHION, COMPUTATION THEOREMS.

Basically, by the time I'm actually done with /all/ the textbooks I want to get through, I will go from my current academic levels (BSc Comp Sci, MSc Comp Sci, uncredited minor in mathematics with focus on statistics) to BSc Comp Sci + MSc Comp Sci + uncredited second BSc major in mathematics with a focus on statistics + uncredited MSc Theoretical Comp Sci + research-level background in programming languages and a hope to start understanding computational cognitive science.

[[http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/caffienekitty/11224213/2575701/2575701_original.jpg][AND IT STILL WON'T BE ENOUGH.]] I /might/, at that point, be /kinda-sorta/ ready for a PhD program.

Yes, that's my point. New Year's resolutions are usually signals rather than /plans/.

EDIT: So in that spirit, my New Year's resolution is to /actually find time to indulge a fiction-writing hobby/. This is something I've been profoundly failing at.

** I'll start us off with a classic.

I've only ever done running as serious exercise (jogging 4 miles every other day) and I'm building up some muscle in hopes of being healthy enough to live until the medical singularity. Therefore I promise to exercise every day for five days out of the seven days in a week. The exercise requirement is permanently set at 25 pushups per day.

The quota is deliberately set so low, because the hardest part of exercise is getting started. If I only need to do a trifling amount, I'm sure to do more most days.

I already started by doing 50 push-ups within the first 15 minutes of the New Years!

PS If you have more suggestions of how I should do things, I'm willing to listen and spend five minutes by the clock thinking about it.

Wait wait wait wait. You're excited about indefinite longevity, so /you actually set yourself a program of diet and exercise?!/ If you manage to succeed in this, you are already way, way ahead of most so-called immortalists. Congratulations.

** Well, I've already made one, which is to come clean about my crushes on my friends between now and mid-February, when I move out of town; this is intended as an exposure-therapy-type thing to make me more comfortable admitting to emotions. And while it doesn't have the usual form of a resolution, I'm following through on my plans to become a Real Programmer by moving to SF for App Academy and learning Real Business Programming.

** Sorry, wasn't online much for the last couple days, trying to sort things out for my resolution, which is to start following my Emi [[http://i.imgur.com/Kwy0C.jpg][push-up sheet]] and stay 3-4 chapters ahead in my Differential Equations, University Physics, and Electronics textbooks and make easy to reference typed summary sheets for each chapter I finish before going through the homework.

Also, how to unicycle and aim a bow properly.

Much fun to be had.
