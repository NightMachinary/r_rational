Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** One personal example of culture war:

So I study computer science and there was this event with multiple speakers from game and software companies in another city. This event was very drinking focused, people basically drank for three days in a row, but I thought it was a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of fantastic people.

Anyway, we went to the event by a bus. We had an official WhatsApp group where people could chat. At one point early on we had a "Joke corner" in which people could suggest jokes in the WhatsApp chat and then a guy from our association would tell all the best jokes speaking to a microphone. Very quickly people started to compete who could tell the most offending joke possible, and nigger jokes, holocaust jokes, dead baby jokes and some pedophile jokes were the most common - and this guy would tell all the jokes speaking to a microphone.

I thought this could alienate some people who come to these events and make them less popular and taint the image of our association so I raised the topic in our association's executive board meeting today and said that they should do that a little less. Also, I personally think they're ethically problematic, but I was trying mainly to think about the good of our association here. The people in the executive board meeting weren't there so many of them were quite shocked and I got a lot of compliments for saying it aloud.

I don't really think that's a culture war thing? Almost everyone will act 'shocked' when in an official meeting after hearing about something like that; it's hard to tell whether they were shocked because of some internalized culture difference, or just because of the different context.

I'm pretty sure it is, I know these people and I'm friends with the rest. To explain it fully, I'd have to go through everything that has happened during the last few months but I don't have the time right now. Let's just say that the trip was a complete failure from the viewpoint of our association and at least one previous leading person was fired and is not welcome in anything that has to do with this student association. And why it failed has a lot to do with that joke session and other things that happened on the way there + other kind of organizational dysfunction. I don't think anyone who made those jokes on the way there was even in the meeting yesterday.

*** What's the context? If it's a public group, then you have no reason to speak against people with a poor sense of humor; if it's a private group (either corporate or recreational), then you have every right to campaign to get them restricted. And whatever you do, don't just assume that dark humor damages reputation - it might on a national scale, but on a small scale it's a form of in-group signaling. (As a general rule, think about what motivations a /reasonable/ person would have for making a joke outside the Overton Window. They certainly wouldn't do it if it /damaged/ their standing in regards to normal people.)

I don't think there's an ethical concern regarding dark humor, but it /is/ immature, and that is concerning. Just make sure you're not censoring speech needlessly.

******* Not to start some political bullshit here, but no, that's not what [[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26551][the e-mail]] is saying (I'm assuming it's that one because there was a ZeroHedge article about it). First, they're talking about internal polls, not media organization polling. Second, there are legitimate reasons to oversample a demographic or area; first and foremost, a larger sample means that there's less of a margin of error. If you want a poll of Wisconsin but are especially interested in CD-8, you would want to oversample CD-8 in order to get a better picture of what's going on there rather than just naively sampling equally from all CDs. Afterward, you adjust your results by demographic weight ([[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3104][that's what they're talking about in this e-mail]]).

So when they're talking about oversampling of different races or in key districts, it's because they're especially concerned with those demographics or districts.

Edit: So, for example, if you're taking a sample of 400 people in a population that's 90% A and 10% B, your sample will probably only have about 40 B, which gives you a double-digit margin of error there. This is really bad if you're trying to decide whether to do a media buy that's meant to shore up support from the B population; you'd want to get better data about how the B population is feeling, and oversampling is one way to do that.

- Regional differences in jobs and coal in West Virginia should be explored by micro-targeting programs, oversamples in regions and focus groups. (See the Issues/Messaging section for more.)
- Consider focus groups or an oversampling of the following blocs of infrequent progressive voters: youth (18-29) vote (96,000 infrequent progressive voters), urban apartment dwellers (45,000), urban African Americans (24,000), Somali, Native American, and Urban Hmong (5,000).
- The campaign may wish to conduct larger sample polls, region-specific polls, or selected oversamples to gather data at a micro-level to make informed media decisions.
- Consider individual polls for specific media markets, or at least oversamples for important regions.

It should be clear from this context that "oversample" is a way of gathering extra data, not a way to "skew" the polls.

  1. Our early forecasts of Trump's nomination chances weren't based on a statistical model, which may have been most of the problem.

  2. Trump's nomination is just one event, and that makes it hard to judge the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast.

  3. The historical evidence clearly suggested that Trump was an underdog, but the sample size probably wasn't large enough to assign him quite so low a probability of winning.

  4. Trump's nomination is potentially a point in favor of “polls-only” as opposed to “fundamentals” models.

  5. There's a danger in hindsight bias, and in overcorrecting after an unexpected event such as Trump's nomination.

*** That's an interesting question. Breaking it down:

The number of simulated tortures shouldn't matter, except in that you might be able to claim there's a legitimate use for a smaller number (e.g. studying the response to terror in a simulated brain to better treat PTSD), whereas a trillion is probably excessive for all but the most contrived situations. If you were comparing the /magnitude/ of immorality of two options (e.g. torture 1 trillion simulated brains, kill 1 real person) it would be important.

Does the fact that they're simulated matter? I don't think it does, personally. If being simulated means something has no moral value, surely I couldn't object to somebody torturing trillions of simulated versions of me. There's probably a ratio of utility weights between simulated and real, but that's not relevant for a binary "bad or not".

Likewise, does the fact that it's just the limbic system matter? This is a more complex issue. Arguably, without a body or brain to contextualise the emotion, it's all just the movement of charge. Again, I would tend to say that it is morally negative, but by how much I couldn't say.

With that in mind, I would say that simulating the torture of a trillion human limbic systems has a negative utility. What the magnitude of it is is far too complex a question for me to calculate (it depends entirely on how you weight the components).

There's an interesting but tangential question that just occurred to me. A computer isn't magically real. Simulations are just patterns in the flow of electrons through the circuits. A piece of paper displaying the memory for a simulation has just as much reality; a system composed of a man who studies the paper and writes the next iteration manually is homomorphic to the simulation, only much slower.

In fact, neither the man/paper system nor the computer/program system need have any understanding of what they're simulating. So the question is, is /every/ system that is homomorphic to a torture simulation equally bad, or does intentionality factor in?

Less Wrong's idea that there's no such thing as a 0% chance turns the "greater than 0% chance" into a truism, leaving the "greater than 50% chance" interpretation as the only meaningful one.

I'm not getting that. "It" doesn't refer to "P(A)", it refers to "A" itself. It has to because Pr(Pr(A)) doesn't make any sense.

The only way to get that interpretation is to interpret "not" as "some impossible thing", which seems like a stretch, because it means the whole phrase is "It's likelier than (not anything that is possible)" instead of the much more intuitive phrase, "It's likelier than (not it)."

But "not" wouldn't be short for "not likely," it would be short for "an event with the lowest probability worth considering," or to use the word, "not any event with a probability worth considering." This also seems like a stretch to me...

If it was just short for "an event that is not likely," then it would reduce to... Pr(A) > Pr(B) and Pr(B) < .5, which would mean that, at least Pr(A) >= .5
