*** No, that one's completely outside the canon universe and has none of the original characters.

Or, in short, very, very little of the actual sweet pony goodness.

** I keep trying to read this one, and I keep getting the awful feeling that the plot of the /Assassin's Creed/ trilogy is about to jump out and go /BOO!/.

The "$SENTIENT_SPECIES was created as a mind-controlled slave-race" thing is now... a thing. That's a bit disturbing, seeing that one become a trope with multiple actual occurrences.

*** It's pretty old in sci-fi. I mean just look at house elves, or the robots from asimov. The only real difference is that this story shows their perspective. It's always been a "thing".

**** Well Robots from Asimov are just made that way, they're not controlled by constraining their psyche. House Elves... are /actually portrayed as a moral issue in canon/.

Whereas in this newer, AC-y-er version, I'm sort of left wondering/worrying about how the heck the Servant Race are going to end up getting free, or what happens to the parent species, or how the story is going to avoid turning into an AC-like author tract about how everything $SENTIENT_SPECIES ever believed in was a Big Lie invented to enslave them.

As in, you know, humans believe in gods and religions and ideologies TO ENSLAVE THEM, AAAAAH. And genetically-engineered ponies will end up believing in friendship and niceness TO ENSLAVE THEM, AAAAH. Inevitably there will be some kind of ultra-cynical "fuck everything, maaaan, get free, maaaan" message.

If someone can promise me this is /not/ about to happen, I will actually push through the initial chapters and read the damn story.

Seriously, Assassins' Creed made me go /bleck/.

EDIT: Actually, rationalfic of AC would be a great way to teach the meta-ethics sequence.

***** I'm not really familiar with assassins creed. "The maker", the local equivalent of a god, was real. The master race sort of believes they believe it. Some people care about it, so whatever. There are much more effective methods of social control built into their society, taking cues from communism and secret police and the like.

The servitors have terrifying wireheading magic, so god doesn't really come into it for them. They're pretty much treated like furniture, no brainwashing effort required. The protagonists need to be clever, which is mostly why I posted it here.

****** Aaaand that took until /Chapter fucking Three/ to go all /Assassins' Creed/, with the Elements of Harmony being roughly the Apples of Eden.

([[#s][AC series spoiler]])

I hate being right.

******* Heh, fair enough. I suppose there is a parallel. I'm not really familiar with assassins creed. That parts isn't really important to the plot so far though.
