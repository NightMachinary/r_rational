I assume there are probably more than one, but is there one you would call /definitive/?

*** I always find this utterly hilarious. On LessWrong itself we all talk in this ultra-dry, wannabe-academic tone, as if trying to imitate Quirrellmort. And then 183 LWers compose the only /actively labeled/ LWian fiction group, which is distinctly devoted to pony.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Rational-stories/117575/]]

I've set up one. It seems a bit slow to update, but I'll add all the fanfiction from this subreddit to it so in a couple hours we'll have one.

I've included these so far. I dunno when it will update. It seems to have a character limit too so it looks a bit weird at the moment.

[ remove ] 1. Harry Potter and the Natural 20 [8096183] by Sir Poley [ remove ] 2. Pokemon: The Origin of Species [9794740] by daystar721 [ remove ] 3. Branches on the Tree of Time [9658524] by alexanderwales [ remove ] 4. The Last Christmas [9915682] by alexanderwales [ remove ] 5. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie [10023949] by alexanderwales [ remove ] 6. The Metropolitan Man [10360716] by alexanderwales [ remove ] 7.

The feed seems to show the list, in a weird code format. I've updated it with luminosity too.

*** Don't think Time Braid goes on there - it's excellent, but not rationalfic.

**** Any reason why?

I'm trying to make a fairly clear and fair way to add stories that isn't based on my personal taste. At the moment I'm adding all the reasonably highly upvoted stories from this sub. I could add in that if anyone comments with a good reason I can remove one.

I vaguely remember most of the things that happen being motivation driven, most factions being driven into conflict by belief and all having plausible and ethical reasons for their actions, most problems being solved through intelligent application of knowledge, the rules being consistent.

***** It seems to me inappropriate to take other people's fics and claim them as 'rationalfic' when they might well, for all we know, disagree; and more importantly, I think the sidebar of this reddit is just plain wrong and way too inclusive. Rationalfic is (a) fic that was explicitly written in an attempt to be rationalfic or in a rationality-inspired way or (b) fic that focuses in on characters' thinking skills in a way that at least attempts, successfully or not, to transmit them to the reader.

This definition does appear to me to be perhaps less subject to acrimonious debates than the one that appears in the sidebar (we can ask the creator if they meant it as rationalfic), and also less subject to appropriating other people's stories under our own banner without asking them whether they like the label.
