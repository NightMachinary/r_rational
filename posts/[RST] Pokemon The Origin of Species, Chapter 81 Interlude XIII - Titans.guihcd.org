** So this is what an outside context problem feels like. You go around having an adventure in Kanto. There's some ecounters with the storm birds, and they are terrifying but at least a known quantity. There's mysterious renegade plots afoot. A hidden conspiracy to create a manmade pokémon that you might be let in on because of your special psycic abilities. There's many plotlines going on, but every day you and your friends learn more and grow stronger, hoping to make a difference in the world.

Then it all ends because some idiots down in Hoenn played around with forces they couldn't control and you die in an earthquake, crshed by debris. Or maybe survive, but only due to dumb luck. You're not even getting involved later on, there's some other kids having their own adventure who are working on it. Because not everything in the world revolves around you, and the planet is filled with lots of people all living their own lives and being the protagonists of their own stories.

But hey, maybe you find a secret team rocket base in a basement and fight the secret evil boss and get some magic ghost goggles and everything works out somehow. Who knows, it might happen.

** BEST. CHAPER. EVER

Yes I am a Hoenn baby. I was lucky enough to experience gen 3 as a kid, so my imagination made everything greater. But it never EVER came close to this level of disaster. I don't think words could explain how this chapter makes me feel, a deep part of my mind finally watching its childish adventures adquire the size and horrifying terror they should inspire. I feel like... like justice has finally been made for Hoenn.

I am so happy right now. My only regret is that we don't have a whole book of this. Bias aside, the story of brendam and the others looks much more interesting, they even got latios and latias! And wally is with them! And bias inside, you even sort of confirmed mega evolution!

** So there are definitely hints that this is more ORAS than RS mostly from the whole riding of Latias/os, the emotionless girl running with Team Magma, the pirate reference in regards to Team Aqua, the Mega-stone-element-type-things, also the teams having the right orbs and the legendary they're associated with getting larger within a visible timespan is probably foreshadowing it's primal reversion. The whole Groudon and Kyogre conflict thing being "solved" in canon by rayquaza is less than encouraging in the general sense. I really think it's funny that where our group of Red, Blue and Leaf got stalled by the appearance of a Mobile Disaster Legendary that Brandon, May and Wally weren't stopped and that their plot speed progression went apace which leaves their climax months of time in advance.

Also nods to the fact that Dark-trainers cannot be teleported (yet) which is internally consistent and appreciated. Also small island is probably mirage island, Birch isn't a former trainer from his being tree-ed by a route one mon which in this canon was much more of an actual threat and less of a joke in context. I also appreciate that Groudon is literally hot enough to burn through/sublimate the ozone layer above it.

Also Mewtwo is riding along with Kawabata which means the AI has officially breached containment and may the basilisk have mercy upon them all.

***** The sky pillar and mirage island are not the same.

In the games, the sky pillar has the crumbling floor you need to bike the really fast, and in the manga, it requires two people (one adult sized and child sized) working together to traverse. In both, it is an enormous tower with powerful pokemon that Rayquaza sleeps at the top of.

Mirage island, on the other hand, is an island that only appears under rare circumstances. In the game, it's the only way to get the wynaut line and a rare type of berry, and has no impact on the plot. In the manga, time alternates between flowing quickly and slowly, and it's somewhat sheilded from the outside world; as such, it's where Ruby and Sapphire practice teamwork to take down Kyogre and Groudon while Steven Stone uses the Regi trio to stall them in sootopolis.

**** I mean that's possible but like we've never seen any legendary that was willing to help people I wasn't sure that we could even count it as a possibility. It does make some sense that in general Rayquaza is the force that balances Groudon and Kyogre, but like we don't have the same kind of benevolent Legendary context of most other canons. I mean even a neutral would probably be good enough in this situation but like i'm not convinced that Rayquaza doesn't just still the air around it to the point that even getting near it suffocates you. At the same time Brendan and May riding the Lati-twins so it could go either way.

****** It's certainly possible. I still feel wierd in retrospect that like N is running around and while Leaf isn't the opposing hero that like Reshiram and Zekrom aren't like the big ticket legendaries of Unova. I mean even within the canon of Alola like the Tapus are just a force of nature and it's hard to ascribe either malevolence or benevolence to them. Like even StormBringers are explicitly compared to like giant storms and it's hard to imagine a force like choosing */now/* to intervene minus like explicitly a force of i dunno stasis or something? I mean it kinda does give Lugia a counter theme to Ho-oh's rebirth if it's stasis in contrast.

​

Edit: like yeah no it seems like most of the box art legendary mons are either secluded or outright sealed, but like it's even wierder to think that anything could seal them. Or that say Reshiram and Zekrom would be forgotten given their place in history. Also calling it now that AZ's weapon weakened the non-active Legendaries or like made it so that they were dormant till now.

**** It also reflects the flaws of rational enemies without trust. Archie seems to have betrayed Maxie. This means Maxie cant trust not to betray him again. Archie knows this and cannot trust Maxie either.

This lack of trust causes the prisoner's dilemna. Each is worried about the other getting the Titan, thus needs to get it first. Each is worried about the ideology they believe the other holds that surely endangers the world. While in reality they each are likely not as extreme.

Also in the Manga, Maxie was a bit more altruistic, while Archie was a complete monster.

It also doesnt help that Giovonni is involved somehow as a wildcard.

*** So the Lake Trio seemed like the most likely legendaries to be non-destructive? Or at least non-walking-disasters. One thing I've been very aware of whenever I mention other regions is that, if people want to write OoS-fanfics in other regions, I don't want to stomp on too many of their own ideas for how things would work/go (this chapter in particular was hard to write because of picking up a story so close to the end without focusing on any of the major characters).

I know Hoenn introduced the titans, but they were locked in caves. Since Regigigas is in Sinnoh, and to awaken him you have to bring all the regis to his location, /and/ there are regis in Sinnoh as well, the way I'm envisioning it is that there's actually multiple regis, and if Regigigas in sinnoh rises during "the Sinnnoh story" it'll be because the ones there converged on its location. Whether that means there's a Regigigas in every region that has titans, I'm less sure. Maybe it can just be formed anywhere that the titans are awake?

In any case, this is the event that causes the titans in Hoenn to wake up, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Couldn't think of a way to work it into the weather trio before/during other than them trying to fight Groudon and Kyogre, but that seemed like it would take too much away from them being each-other's fated enemies.

But then, who would wander and wreak havoc on Sinnoh? Darkrai and Cresselia? The Lake Trio? Surely the Creation gang slumbers as well.... Maybe Sinnoh is as safe as Hoenn (or it was, anyways...)

Come to think of it, most legendaries start the series comatose and are brought to life. Makes you wonder how many of these plots overlap; obviously gens 1 and 3 are occuring. We heard rumour of Giovanni's son, Silver, implying that perhaps gen 2 plot is underway, or just being setup to start after gen 1. But then who woke the Dogs?

**** We have Aiko encountering Ho-oh, which is implied to be the missing Spring-time Stormbringer. Aiko and all the other pokemon on the ranch experience the Pressure. Sadly she never told anyone before she got herself killed :(

In the anime, spotting Ho-oh is what happened to Ash (minus the Pressure, which isn't a thing in the Anime). It was a little weird, cause it happened in the first episode when the Gen 2 games weren't even out yet.

** I'm not going to lie, when I saw that this chapter is an interlude, I was a little sad.

...for about five seconds. Then I remembered what happened last time, and what this interlude was likely to be, and holy shit am I so glad to be right.

This chapter was so cool! It felt almost like a peek into an alternate universe where this story is an adaptation of Hoenn, and the Birch scene is the culmination of a fic-long character arc about his insecurity about not being a battle professor but wanting to help, haha. Seeing the hints at Brendan and May's journey from third-party perspectives trying to figure out what the heck is going on was really cool.

I think the Weather Institute head is my new favorite character.

** So DaystarEld, I have to ask something that's been on my mind lately about your world's setting. It's obvious at this point that legendaries and mythicals split into two categories: well-known terrors who roam the world, or myths and legends that no one is truly sure if they exist or not. It seems like the only legendaries that the populace as a whole acknowledge as existing are the violent legendaries that threaten people's lives with their very existence. But, surely there must be some benevolent legendaries and mythicals that people know exist, right? Are there truly no well-known legendaries in this setting that are considered benevolent or helpful? I know that in your setting, the idea of the legends being actual beings of nature or gods is blurred, but certainly, there has to be some legends that are helpful, right?

In a sense these are actually "neutral" by the way they don't cause massive destruction, but in that sense Ho-oh and Lugia fit the bill too. It's hard to justify actual "helpful" pokemon because that implies some level of sapience, unless they just have a passive positive effect, which is how I imagine pokemon like Xerneas working. My headcanon for the Swords is something like "they seek out powerful opponents" which is why there are stories of them only ever fighting rampaging, powerful pokemon, rather than killing humans.

*** We get a little of that in this chapter actually with the latis. Its been stated before that the only real problem with them is if they break the sound barrier too close to settlements. Otherwise they seem to have a thriving taxi business transporting 10 year olds to battlefields. In the games, legendaries are also split into two categories: those in the game and those gifted at events. The latter ones are called the mythics (mew, celebii, darkrai, arceus, keldeo, etc). It seems daystar is more or less following that trend where the gift legendaries are the fairy tale pokemon and the in game legendaries are the force of nature pokemon. The only legendary group that might break this trend is probably the lake trio since their lore is closer in feel to that of the mythical pokemon.

** At first I wondered if Steven's confusion over Tabitha being male or female was a rib on his name being feminine. But on retrospect, maybe that's a somewhat sexist notion. I guess it's a rib on his cartoonish character design then? With his non-gender-conforming name just a point of additional confusion for later, if poor Steven tries to follow up on that train of thought.

Another point of curiosity: Brendan, May and Wally had other companions with them? In a way it makes sense, since breaking into a renegade hideout is something you probably should have numbers for, but Birch's PoV didn't indicate he was aware their group was bigger than the main three, like it would if he thought to get around the "glitch" by locating where Brendan and May's friends are clustered...unless the "other trainers he's keeping tabs on" passage specifically meant he was trying exactly that? (I actually thought the extra members could have been Latios and Latias, since in some stories they're depicted as being able to shapeshift into/create illusions of humans - but probably not, considering what was said elsewhere in this comments page, about pokemon with sapience breaking the setting.)

Another thing this comments page enlightened me to: the Pokemon games apparently have a canonical ordering, where Gen I and III takes place at approximately the same time. So the awakening of two of the Weather Trio here wasn't /just/ a matter of unfortunate coincidence wrecking the floor of Celadon casino's floors and presumably some of Team Rocket's secrecy along with it, huh.

Further random thoughts: high-profile Dark trainers like Sidney and Karen seem to consistently favour Dark pokemon...or maybe it's the opposite, and Dark pokemon, at a high enough level, tend to come under Dark trainers. Either way, that's probably not helping the perception of Dark trainers being attracted to Dark pokemon. Also, looking back, it probably should seem odd that everyone refers to Norman by first name and Birch by last name, and only doesn't by virtue of the fact those are the only names for them that we know. From an in-universe perspective though...is Birch's first name something really embarrassing? That might explain why even a (presumably) close friend like Norman refers to Birch via last name. Well, the alternative is that Norman is just strict enough in character that he refers to most people by last name...but nah, the idea that Birch's first name is embarrassing it too amusing.

Not sure if the next chapter's going to be another interlude to finish off the side-story in Hoenn, or we're heading straight back to Kanto to see how things are going down under the Celadon casino, but looking forward to it regardless.

I'm basically treating them as genderqueer/non-binary, if not outright trans, due to the translation error of their name, and yeah their new appearance is fairly androgynous.

As for other characters like Norman and Birch, I tend to cobble together names from their Japanese and English ones, so if one of them is missing it's just easier to treat them like the kind of person everyone refers to by their first/pseudonym (gym leaders) or their surname (most professors... who also might just be using pseudonyms, because goddamn are there a lot of plant-based Professors somehow)

#+begin_quote
  "We suspect so." Matsubusa says. "As Kyogre has been growing in strength as well."
#+end_quote

First and probably second period should be commas. The "a" in "As" should be decapitalized if second period is a comma, or the "As" should be dropped if the second period is kept.

** I loved this. It makes we want to revisit my D&D idea of someone summoning an Atropal in a neighbouring locale and the characters having to deal with the effects during a different genre adventure.

I have a couple of questions.

1: Regardless of whether they actually show up in the story, which seems unlikely, how much of a threat do you figure the Ultra-Beasts to be? How would you have them work in this setting? The games and show have both depicted parallel versions of their worlds that were wrecked by them, and there is a chilling theory that the universes where the original games were set were ultimately destroyed by Ultra-Beast incursions because they lacked the power of mega-evolution and Z-moves necessary to contend with them.

2: I caught a shiny Groudon in Pokemon Go. Is there one of those hiding below Hoenn too?

*** 1: Since Ultra Beasts apparently aren't quite "legendaries" of their own world and don't even have a BST of 600, I would basically treat them like very powerful but not godly pokemon, on par with pokemon like Snorlax or even the pseudo-legendaries, despite their lower stats.

2: Congrats! And... maybe! :D

** No prior familiarity with the story or characters from Gen3, so I thought for sure that having someone named /Steven/ with a link to /gem/ mining (as well as an absent mother and an excitable father) was a Steven Universe reference.

But no, there he is on Bulbapedia; Steven Stone, Hoenn champion.
