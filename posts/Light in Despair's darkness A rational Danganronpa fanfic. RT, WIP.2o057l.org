** I think Danganronpa is a really interesting choice as a setting for a rational fic. I'll definitely give it a read.

** This whole thing feels wrong to read.

The only real culprit is the Monobear. He is holding people captive, he is blackmailing them and he is preventing them from trying anything else other than playing the game. Voting to punish fellow players is ludicrous considering that their only option is to play the game in the hopes of wining and leaving their prison behind.

But even if a person somehow succeeds in graduating their life is still over. With the power the Monobear has so far displayed it would be no problem for his game to continue on into the future. Besides having enormous amounts of money to build and maintain his devices, he is also show to be knowledgeable in their personalities. That takes dedication and resources and willingness to above and beyond for his daily dose of fun.

This video game joke explains my point best I think.

A good idea would be to negotiate somehow with MB by threatening their lack of cooperation, maybe gaming the voting system so everyone votes the person next to them or something similar. MB appears to care about entertainment so him losing all of his victims in one go would be unsatisfying, which isn't much but is better than prolonged torture and losing a minimum of 2 persons a day.

Another idea would be for all the players to stop playing or even paying attention to MB and just ignore any of his attempts to get their attention, no matter how drastic. Blindfolds, ears plugs and fortress up a room with barren walls.

As for someone trying to win from inside the system, it should not come as a surprise to Naegi that all his plans are known to MB. Especially if he's carrying a datapad which is always connected to the game system. Never mind something like putting microphones in walls or light fixtures, none of which we see being tested for.

Also there is no reason why there can be only one person in charge as the Dungeon Master.

I am also having trouble telling the exact premise of the story, is the MB part of Despair? Did Despair somehow strip the school fort of anything usefull? But how since the story implies Naegi and his crew were planing something for before the memory loss.

The story also doesn't give a lot of insight into the characters mind or reasoning skills, sometimes leaving his deductions and thought processes hidden, which isn't a problem for a story where there are plenty of details to gain insight into the plot, but that's not the case here. Some more details, not clues or hints, just details of situations would be great.

And sometimes it's hard to see who is speaking to whom. That could be my flawed reading comprehension though.

But since this is a WIP I can assume the author will go back and edit his work later on.

I might think of more things later, I've been reading nonstop so far so i could have missed some things.

*** My thanks for the review--I'll incorporate the advice therein into future chapters. As for the rewrite, I am intending to do one for arc 1 at least after I finish up through arc 5.
