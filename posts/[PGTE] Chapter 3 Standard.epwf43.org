** Another Black Queen reveal to a 3rd party, set-up as an excuse for us to fan wank over Cat. It's so self indulgent but I can't help enjoying it nonetheless.

*** Well it's not /just/ fan wank. It lets Cat establish, in addition to all the other little nods to her first encounters with Black, that she is just as much a Drama Queen as Amadeus. +But totally not an excuse to reassure this little boy that she is the Queen of the Lost and Found. Dammit, stop smirking Indrani!+

*** One of the things that I like about PGTE is that the internal rules of the universe allow for big cheesy moments to be entirely justified. Eg making an anguished declaration of love mid battle is a viable strategy for getting a power up and turning the tide. So from a readers perspective you can have these kind of indulgent moments without violating suspension of disbelief

**** If Cat and Hanno /aren't/ involved, I sort of expect that they're holding it in reserve for exactly this scenario. It's functionally a single use Get Out of Doom card.

***** On an actual level, I don't see it, but I can imaging them pulling this with a pile of snark, like how Kairos through the hero off of a short balcony.

*** I always love those moments in books (in any media, really). Yes, we already know the MC became a badass in whatever regard is relevant, but that 3rd party acknowledgement gives it weight, makes it real.

*** Not if she doesn't want Tancred to think Akua's Cat's lover instead.

I mean, it'll make Akua happy...

**** I would have bet 2:1 that Akua would trap an angel, by heroism or larceny to become a heroine, but Tyrant and Hierach already used that trick so I'd need a few chapters to see the tone of akua and angelic interactions to be willing to make a projection this book, but it does still seem likely.

Anybodies guess if it's comes out as loyalty or Cat riding her new traitorous lieutenant though.
