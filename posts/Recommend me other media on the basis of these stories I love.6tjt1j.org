** Before anything else, have you checked this subreddit's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki]] yet? It includes many of this genre's defining works and other works more alike rational fiction than unalike.

Special recommendation out of the stories there is [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/][The Waves Arisen]], a Naruto fanfic in which Naruto is clever and in a unique enough position to exploit the system and skyrockets in power as the threats he has to face escalate just as fast.

Alongside The Waves Arisen I can draw special attention to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][The Two Year Emperor]], a story about a Rules As Written D&D setting where a country's system of government involves summoning random people from the multiverse to be a dictator for two years. The kingdom is under threat from a large foreign army, and the new king happens to be a D&D player from Earth; exploits ensue. Like The Waves Arisen, the power levels skyrocket pretty quickly on both sides and it is very satisfying to read.

Similar to Two Year Emperor, I can recommend [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]]. The Inath Federation is under attack by zombie hordes, so the queen uses a powerful ritual to summon a hero to lead the quest for a fabled sword that will save the Federation from the hordes. The ritual works and the hero begins his quest, but our protagonist is a materials engineer the ritual dragged along for the ride and dropped at the edge of civilization.

To diverge from things from the wiki, I can recommend two stories with a remarkably similar premise given that neither was made knowing about the other. [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm a Spider, So What?]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/][The Snake Report]] are both stories about a human dying and reincarnating into a fantasy world as a weak monster and having to draw on every resource they can just to stay alive. I could go at length about in what ways they're similar and different, but suffice it to say that they're both very fun and you should definitely give them a look.

Happy reading!

**** The Snake Report is very much like it, though written in English on Reddit as a response to a Writing Prompt. The difference between it and Spider, in a broad stroke, is that The Snake Report is more frantic. Things rarely feel in his control and his plans often backfire as much as they work, but at the end of the day he still finds a way to survive. Overall, it's /very/ fun to read.

***** Have either the spider or snake story been finished? It's hard to tell at a glance, and I'm not a fan of incomplete stories, but the premise seems quite interesting.

****** Both of them are still in progress, unfortunately. I'm a Spider, So What? is a lot further along if you can read the original Japanese, but since The Snake Report is written in English there's no reading ahead.

******* I would argue that "I'm a Spider, So What?" is over. I'm on like chapter 300 and the original premise has been completely abandoned at this point. We are following completely different characters, the original spider character is gone, the world and its RPG rules basically doesn't have any effect on the plot anymore, and the story is more about metaphysical god-stuff now.

******** I'd ask you to put that in spoiler tags if it wasn't already too late. I'm not sure if you're aware, but the translation I've linked and have been reading is only at chapter 120 or so, and you basically spoiled the future of the story for me.

**** It's an online Japanese light novel, actively updating. This guy has the best translation, but he took a hiatus and I think he's actually starting again. There's a huge gap between where he is and where the story actually is.

I don't have the link, but you can probably Google to find the crappier more up to date translation. That's mostly why I haven't really followed the story further, because the other guy's translations made things confusing.

Btw, the interlude type parts happen a long time (a decade I think) after the main story. You might want to read one, then the other. Interludes usually break my flow in reading the story if they're more than a chapter in length.

****** You do you, but there's around 100 chapters not yet translated in the better version, and blastron has only promised once every two weeks (but probably more often), so you might be waiting awhile. I /loved/ it, and am mostly waiting because I don't feel like putting in the effort to (re)read the new parts. I had read quite a bit into it, but I can't particularly remember too much beyond blastron's translation, because the other translation is so confusing.

I would actually recommend reading it, because it's quite good, and that may be enough to have you continue into the bad translation. If not, I'd highly recommend the manga version, which is rapidly approaching blastron's point. That said, the manga doesn't have any of the interlude parts yet either. It's great, though, and I have been keeping up with that.

******* Hang on, I'm confused. I have read all of Blastron's translations, loved it, want more.

Are you saying that there is 100 chapters "better version" translations available somewhere? Or that the original japanese story is 100 chapters ahead of the (current) end of Blastron's translation?

Also, I don't read Japanese, so I am restricted to english. Has the manga been translated?

******** Blastron's is the better version, but there is 100 or so more chapters of [[https://turb0translation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html][lesser quality translation]]. It's actually split into [[http://raisingthedead.ninja/current-j-z/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/][two parts]].

The manga is full and actively updating (I think). [[http://mangakakalot.com/manga/kumo_desu_ga_nani_ka][Here]]'s a link I found.

** I assume you've read the [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml][sequel to Luminosity]], the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/][various HPMOR recursive fics]] (scroll down), as well as [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]?

Since you've mentioned one MLP fic, I'd recommend anything by [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith][Forthwith]], especially his (sadly abandoned) [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power][Seeking Power]].

You might like Eric Flint's first novel [[http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/Mother%20of%20Demons/index.htm][Mother of Demons]]. Its plot definitely shows that it's his first, but the setting, crisis of survival, and kingdom-uplifting problem are still very compelling at least to me.

Also, David Brin has a number of good books that partake of rationalist themes. I'd especially recommend /Glory Season/ and /Kiln People/, as well as his excellent and chilling short story "[[https://web.archive.org/web/20120712170314/http://www.davidbrin.com/thor1.htm][Thor Meets Captain America]]."

**** I would like to blatantly push my own book:

[[https://smile.amazon.com/Digital-Me-Alston-Sleet-ebook/dp/B06XR335RT][Digital Me]]

It's a story about a man who, through a bit of legal tom foolery and willingness to do something stupid to take a last chance to survive, ends up being uploaded into a digital world and becomes immortal....and then what happens to him dealing with his /training/ for becoming a so called 'all powerful' digital mind.

it's on kindle unlimited so if you have that it's a free read.
