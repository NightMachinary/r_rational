** I like some of the counterintuitive choices like Lewis and Adams... there's more to rationality than just atheism and mundanity.

*** I read quite a bit of translated work, and I think translation can be really tricky thing. A bad translation can destroy tone and beauty of the language, as well as stripping out a lot of the idioms, puns, etc. Douglas Hofstadter (of /Gödel, Escher, Bach/ fame) writes about this a lot in /Le Ton beau de Marot/, which I recommend.

***** I thought Lem robot stories series can't be translated. Especially the ones with Trurl and Klapaucius. Then I read Kandel translation. This is masterpiece. Like writing the book a second time, in another language.

BTW I just learned he is translating Jacek Dukaj. I'm happy.

*** And don't forget all the stories, fables, legends, and oral traditions lost in the currents of time, which no translator can ever revive.

*** This is a problem with fiction, I think. Niche fiction (like sci-fi) has this problem to a greater extent.

It also created another problem: Hardly anyone writes sci-fi or fantasy in Dutch (to give one example) because the market isn't big enough.

  Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future 2 (movie, 1989). Another complex model of metatime -- I set my students to work trying to figure out the model of time travel here, and they at least got close. (Chalmers)
#+end_quote

That's always a high-scorer for [[http://xkcd.com/356/][nerd-sniping]]... always feels like a consistent model is /just slightly/ out of reach; that you could hammer out the last details with a little bit more thought.

*** It's probably included there because a fair portion of the plot is devoted to a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

<Tattooed Prisoner> Give it to me. You can tell 'em I took it by force. Give it to me, and I'll do what you shoulda did ten minutes ago.

******* The point of the scene was that the Tattooed Prisoner is more rational than the whoever held the button. Thus the "what you shoulda did ten minutes ago"; it's an object lesson in precommitment.
