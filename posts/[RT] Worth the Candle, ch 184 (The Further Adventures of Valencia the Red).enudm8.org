** I always love chapters of Worth the Candle like this, because I think that they drive at the heart of one thing that Fantasy as a genre does better than every other genre and medium: the relationship between power and ethics.

In every other genre, and in the real world, the ethical restraints that are placed on people are always in the context of their personal power, which is, relatively speaking, minimal. Even when you look at someone extremely powerful, politically speaking, the strength that they wield is qualitatively different from what Bethel wields, or any other extremely powerful person in a fantasy story. Being able to order an assassination, or an extra hundred bushels of wheat, is in a moral sense not the same as being able to summon a city-destroying meteor or whatever other ability the overpowered protagonist of the day has access to. A State or Commonwealth has different duties from a person, but what happens when a single person wields equivalent or greater power? How do their duties transform? What about their limitations? And what does that say about people as a whole?

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the relationship between power and ethics is a major part of the human condition, and it's a relationship that only fantasy can explore to its fullest degree--- even though so few fantasy stories actually exploit that ability. So I'm especially glad to see it in a fantasy story that's actually good.

** Imagine how surreal this situation is for Annad. He's sitting there trapped, with his life on the line, while two self-admitted demi-gods have an ethical argument about the value of his life and why it is or isn't okay to brutally dismember him.

I appreciated how sensible Annad was as well. Too often characters in his position are set-up for an exercise in justice porn and only are allowed to realise how out of their depth they are until they've already thrown their life away. Annad actually has some sense of self-preservation.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, but /I'm/ not allowed to engage in bouts of violence,” said Nephthys with a pout.

  “Of course you are, when the situation warrants it,” replied Rossa.

  “No,” replied Nephthys, shaking her head. “Because every time someone comes along with some moronic plan to do harm to me or the people inside me, I'm told that I should exercise /restraint/, that I should just hold them in place for questioning --- questioning which, I might add, is never the way that /I/ would do it, which must never start or end with dismemberment or physical violence.” She glared at Annad. “Even now, this thug, you would think less of me if I sliced him up.”

Technically I'd argue that it doesn't. We know from Juniper's narration that when the story takes someone else's perspective it's based on what they told him after the fact. Valencia could still be pretending to be good at that point in the future just as she might have been pretending to be good in the doomed timeline. She's playing the exceptionally long game.

That said, I don't really believe she's secretly evil. I just don't think it's completely ruled out yet.

I don't believe this is true. IIRC we have had two quasi-POV chapters from Amaryllis that are based on what Joon believed happened after the fact and both chapters have triple parentheses comments inserted by Junper, which none of the non-Amaryllis POV's contain.

If all non-Joon POV's were after the fact recounts by Joon, for example, that would mean that the first POV of this chapter from Horus was retold by Joon. That's not impossible (Val could for some odd reason provide Joon with a plausible recount of what was going through Horus' mind) but it would be unusual.

  this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn't have at the end of the last chapter, and won't have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don't mind.
#+end_quote

I had taken that to imply that the whole work is a retelling by Joon who is using poetic license with information others gave him after the fact to fill in chapters from other people's POV. However, it looks like you are correct that those triple parentheticals only occur in Amaryllis chapters, so you're right that we don't know if he's the author for the non-Amaryllis non-Joon POVs. And naturally, if he isn't, then we're just getting Valencia's perspective and it would disprove the Valencia-is-evil idea.

So it could argued that unless wiping out the human race is one of Valencia's short term goals, any conceivable ultra-long term goal would have her acting good. Even if you do your evil in secret, a thousand or a million evil acts with a 0.00001 % chance of being found out do add up.

I love Bethel's glee at someone coming in to try to extort them. There was that line in one of the Sound and Silence chapters about Bethel seeming nearly giddy at the prospect of someone trying to break in, and this is a fun example of it.

  The gods all claim to have “arrived” around 30,000 BE, though they refuse to say where they had been before that time. Invreizen describes Aerb as being “thawed out”, Karakter describes it as a “fracture”, Skaduwee says “a lightening”, Aarde refers to it as a “mudslide”, and Truuk has never told the same story twice. These variable descriptions are difficult to reconcile with each other, though it's possible that they arrived in different places on Aerb, or perhaps came at different times.

So we know basically nothing about the gods besides their name and how many there are.

oho. and why hasn't THIS been abused before by someone? One would think if commerce with the afterlife were possible, it would be exploited by both sides. Soul-Reapers on Aerb hired by demons to kill specific targets and let their souls transmigrate, in return for cushy spots in the afterlife. Influence traded with politicians, and so-on. Infernals would be the strongest lobby on Aerb. If they were willing to part with torturing some individuals, they could own the world!

If they did unify, the population disparity would mean they could easily conquer Aerb militarily, which Amaryllis pointed out.

Second, mortals don't all go to a singular hell when they die. When they die, they go to the upper hells preferentially, with a probability peak at the 500th hell with a long tail down from there. Even if an entire hell could agree to honor an agreement like that, an individual mortal isn't likely to end up in that hell. It would be complicated and costly to find an individual person out of all the hells that they could end up in, and then arrange for them to be transported to the place that made the initial promise. Possible, but complicated enough and with enough chance of failure that most mortals wouldn't likely be willing to risk it, even if devils weren't already known to be perfect liars and sadistic manipulators.

Eternal reward for the mortals when the alternative is infinite torture or, in the best case, a CHANCE at mere non-existance is invaluable. The internals would have an incentive to keep their promises since results are verifiable via inferniscope. The ultimate result should be the worst possible hegemony, where the powerful farm souls on aerb for the demons in exchange for eternal reward. The "middle class" of employed enforcers are kept in line with the promise of being bottled, with the dim hope of progressing up the chain. It's an inverted religion, where the worst tyrants are rewarded and the innocent poor suffer forever.

Edit: in fact, demons could even short circuit this by issuing a mandate that non-anima be respected and left unharmed. Any that hurt non anima would suffer additional torture, while those that helped them are rewarded.

*** Aside from what others already said, the story actually mentions this when they discuss the Couch Potato (the monster that mind controls people through TVs, one of the reasons the library has been shutting down tech developments).

#+begin_quote
  “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “*Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there's every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes.* There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity's good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it's a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”
#+end_quote

This suggests that infernals do make these kinds of deals with cultists every now and then, but they usually don't keep their word.

While it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it's pretty clear from the in-story hints and the worldbuilding docs that infernal society is terrible at coordinating, which makes it bad at following its own incentives.

Like, in this chapter, when we hear about a demon being asked to pay taxes to contribute to the effort to stop /the only thing in the universe that could possibly threaten it/, its immediate reaction is to plan tax evasion.

So we can imagine that some infernals managed to, say, build a safe haven of eternal okay-ness and used it as an incentive to control a cult that did various horrible things in their name; and that the place lasted about 200 hundred years, until the devils who built it lost a civil war or something and some infernal gangs (who did not control the government, and thus did not benefit individually from the cult's continued activity) broke in and abducted all the cultists, and started torturing them forever.

That's beyond the fact that anybody callous and desperate enough to, say, bomb an hospital for infernals is probably not going to be very good at anticipating the consequences of their actions.

Devils are apparently VERY smart and crafty, capable of long term planning and manipulation of humans if given the opportunity, and also immortal.

I'm not talking about them trying to convince a group of cultists to bomb a hospital - I'm talking about devils tempting Kings and Emperors with promise of personal immunity in return for systemic changes and political influence.

A coordinated effort among devils to maximize the influx of souls would look more like a successful Nazi Germany or USSR than a few scattered death cults. And wealthy, powerful people - who have a strong chance of also being selfish - would have strong incentive to cooperate if their safety in the afterlife could be guaranteed.

Devils wouldn't have to offer amnesty to large numbers of people - just the right people.

And the current system - where a large portion of the population is getting bottled - is cutting severely into their income. If they were actually smart and self interested, they would be organizing a response on the same scale as systematic bottling to combat that problem.

  Hell was an ecosystem, and every part of that ecosystem fed on mortal suffering in one way or another, usually indirectly by following incentives. All the mortal species regenerated in the hells, which made them the ecological equivalent to the sun, the source of all life and energy.

  Some of this was my design. We'd done a campaign inspired by Dante's Inferno, and I'd done my best to make justifications for why hell looked so suspiciously tailored to producing suffering. I'd had more of a flourish to my design, as I hadn't really felt the need to be grounded and wanted big set pieces, but some of what I had made had been lifted directly, and even if it hadn't been, I could recognize my own fingerprints, even if I was certain that my fingers hadn't been the ones to make them. The hells were, in some sense, my sort of hells, hells that didn't really care about you and only tortured you because there was something in it for them. Infernals made people eat gross stuff because that helped make their own food taste better. People were farmed for their blood, muscle, skin, and bone, to within the limits of their enhanced post-death bodies to withstand such things.

  I felt my stomach churn. Hell #321 wasn't even one of the really bad ones. Deep down, the rules got harsher for mortals.

** I'm torn on liking this chapter. Like another post mentions, I love when stories explore the philosophy of situations that can't exist in the real world. On one hand I like that it's an entertaining dialogue in the socratic meaning (dialectic?), but on the other hand it feels cheap. It's like the argument was put in as a strawman instead of an authentic part of the story.

Val says that the protection racket exists because of a gap in society, but that's not really the case for protection rackets. The protection rackets is the quintessential example of crime that you can /actually/ deal with by cutting off the head. Prostitution is something that can occur anytime a trade of sex for resources is economically beneficial, and drugs means that the law is always fighting against the supply/demand curve making it continually profitable. Even opportunistic crime can be a result of poverty, which is solved by fixing the rest of the world.

But protection rackets require organized groups capable of physical force, which are /known/ to be capable of physical force, to which there is no alternative force able/willing to stop it, and the people must know that nobody will stop them. If you take out any of those elements (eg by killing the face of the operation in the city), the racket collapses. People stop paying because you no longer appear invincible, you can't /actually/ fight everyone because that would bring in the real authorities, and without the income you can't maintain your force. By wiping out the heads, you do a huge blow to the operation. The solution really works. We were arguably so successful at dealing with organized crime using this model that it handicapped us when other models of crime took precedence (eg the war on drugs).

Val should know better. Perhaps she's lying to Bethel. However, Val also discusses why she's not lying in her own POV, so it wouldn't make sense to do so. Bethel only gives the weakest strawman counterarguments; she's just setting up the pins for Val to knock down.

What furthers the feeling of a straw man is that Joon's Uncle is described as having 'fantasy of retribution and justice' which is later paralleled with Bethel having the same view where she's shown to be wrong. Except that this is actually part of the solution in real life. Protection rackets had a harder time taking hold in America and were always weaker in part because of rogue actors like Joon's Uncle who get angry and handle the problem themselves when people like Annad come knocking. You can walk in and extort a candy shop in New York, but trying to do the same in Nashville just gets you shot. (Fun historical note, the first conviction in New York's Sullivan Act which made concealed carry illegal in NYC, was a man defending himself from a protection racket.)

Which brings me to why this situation feels inauthentic. Annad is too weak and nowhere in Aerb has the population been shown to be helpless. Every other locale we've been to has had plenty of people who could just kill him. I think /literally/ every locale, even when Joon and the gang aren't looking for it. City in the desert? Plenty of mages and an active guerilla war. Cranberry bay? Random strike teams in the street. Nondescript suburbs? Avatar of Goodness is patrolling around. Take a train? Heavily armed frogs with spirit weapons. Go to the library? Uther's last living knight wielding orbs of annihilation (I guess that's a special case).

How did Annad possibly survive for years to get a reputation as a strong guy? He gets caught in a second, then doesn't try anything to escape, and his enforces are just people with muscles. If he'd tried this in Li'O then the next time he came around to collect he'd die from his skull being vibrated by the shopkeeper's cousin or something. We aren't given any background on why Orrangush seems to be uniquely weak such that somebody who is so helpless can make a living from violence. Hell, maybe even plain bullets would do the job. And /if/ Annad has some secret capabilities not shown in his POV that make him bulletproof and unassailable to the martially inclined in the city, it calls into question Val's solution of turning him for her gain, since he could potentially be strong enough to cause problems.

Anyways, I like the idea of this chapter in theory, exploring how power interacts with ethics, but I feel like in execution the philosophical side of it is really weak. It doesn't seem to have the effort or verisimilitude put into it to make it either an interesting parallel to real life or a believable situation on Aerb.

Val running a candy shop is super cute though.

You can probably see how I think those two statements would be at odds with each other, right? Besides that, Valencia readily admits that Bethel could simply kill them all:

#+begin_quote
  You could become the entity that keeps the gap closed by killing anyone who steps out of line. You could kill everyone with the temperament and training to fill that gap. But that requires time and resources, resources that you've already said you're loath to spend.
#+end_quote

We might disagree on either the framing or the results here, but in my view, killing one person at the top creates a power vacuum, and unless there's some /persistent/ alternative force, you do temporary damage to the organization which will heal over time, unless there's some systemic change as a consequence of that decapitation. Even if you eradicate the organization entirely, that likely doesn't mean that no equivalent organization will come into being.

All Valencia is suggesting is using Annad as the counterforce.

--------------

Regarding power levels, Annad is mentioned as having a warder, and you could probably assume that he's got other mages on staff in some capacity or another. The groups that the party has fought so far are relatively above strength for their locales, but the closest example is probably Aumann, who had himself (gold mage), a revision mage, a still mage, a warder, and a velocity mage ... but he was also the most powerful man in Barren Jewel, owned a lot of properties and businesses, and in a place where there's not much expectation of law. (But Barren Jewel is also special for other reasons, and part of the reason that Aumann has more forces is because he's not just at risk from other people in Barren Jewel, he's at risk from forces around the empire that might want to take over his profitable factories.)

Most people aren't mages, and most people who /are/ mages aren't combat mages. I think bone mages are the most common, being roughly as common as physicians, but it's pretty rare for them to do anything but the same thing that physicians do, and most would be crap in combat. A handgun is enough to kill ... well, I could make a list, but the answer is "a lot of them", especially if you get the drop on them. Part of that is because most of the utility that magic provides /isn't/ combat utility, it's just that we mostly view Aerb through the lens of people repeatedly engaged in combat with one another.

**** Somewhat tangential, but I love that a lot of magics have almost no combat utility, but are extremely important for their mundane utility. Warders, steel mages, and bone mages have all extensively changed how Aerb works, but none of them are particularly useful in a fight (bone mages being a minor exception, but they're mostly medics). In a lot of other media, these magical schools usually have a primary focus on combat, and it's usually the most visible part of magic to the reader. Tournament style things are super common to showcase magic, even if "how much can you help to make a sword?" is in a ton of cases more important, even to a military, than "how much can you defend against one?".

On the other hand, there's flower, pustule, and gem mages, where you really have to stretch to find an economical non-combat use for their magic.

We definitely disagree on how the world works in this case.

It is my belief that removing leadership is an effective measure and that history validates this view. Once we started using RICO, we basically shattered organized crime in short order after half a century of trying. I can't speak to the conditions on Aerb, but IRL American organized crime was empowered by prohibition then existed because of organizational inertia until we finally broke them with leadership decapitation. I do not /at all/ believe that if you had a Deathnote in 1933 and removed the top 500 mobsters that organized crime would just spontaneously generate again in America. (Nor does Val's statements make it seem like there's some Aerb prohibition analogue causing an unusual amount of crime.)

Yes, removing leadership causes a power vacuum, which also means that there's opportunities for infighting and a succession crisis, like with Carlo Gambino. That's probably a good thing if you're like Bethel, wanting to punish crime but not particularly caring about reducing overall deaths. Yes, inconsistently applied it means these organizations can recover eventually. But just because the organization /might/ recover years later doesn't mean it's ineffective.

--------------

As an aside, my assumption was that Aerb gun ownership / combat capability is much higher than even American standards. They're generally more prepared for disasters than most, and they have to deal with stuff like giant monsters appearing with hordes of antimemetic things you need to fight. I just assumed everyone has a couple guns (and maybe a sword or two, it is Aerb) and a high percent of the population has a CCW. Thus why it's weird to me that only 3 people without seemingly amazing combat abilities would be sufficient for a shakedown. That couldn't rob a Texas diner, let alone how I imagine an Aerbian one is kitted out.

  It is my belief that removing leadership is an effective measure and that history validates this view. Once we started using RICO, we basically shattered organized crime in short order after half a century of trying. I can't speak to the conditions on Aerb, but IRL American organized crime was empowered by prohibition then existed because of organizational inertia until we finally broke them with leadership decapitation.
#+end_quote

Thia is a systemic change you are describing. Remove the economic source for the criminal activities (prohibition) and create new laws to catch them (RICO). The analogy I would use would be one of soul magic and spirit ironically enough. Changing the system (spirit) doesn't immediately change the state (soul) of it, hence why even after prohibition it took time and work for the system to break the situation it had been in.

Here we see the opposite, killing this one guy does nothing because the system will just restore it without the systemic changes. To compare to the example you used, yes a RICO like systemic force would fix it, shooting one guy as a vigilante cop wouldn't.

RICO is a /systemic/ legal framework that enables it to go for leaders. You were the one that brought up the momentum of the criminal organizations from prohibition. My point is again that you are discussing a systemic change (e.g. people are still brought up on RICO charges today) to show why a non-systemic change (Val and Bethel killing some people before they leave town and never come back) should work.

Sure but they lost the territory to other organized crime. The repeal of prohibition meant there was less criminal activity to go around, so when these gangs took hits like the loss of their leaders they ended up dying (notably it took 7 years for the gang to actually die out after that). The point being that killing the leaders didn't really change the system, just the players.

There are two reasons for this.

The first reason is that RICO is very complex. Charging someone with RICO requires "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." ([[https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-109-rico-charges][Source.]]) Each of those components has a specific legal meaning that would take a page to fully explain.

The second, more important factor is that RICO, unlike many other federal laws, is both civilly and criminally enforceable. In addition to the federal government, private entities can file RICO lawsuits. Frequently, these lawsuits are filed by somebody with a political axe to grind - there have been RICO lawsuits targeted at protestors against the DAPL, the Republican National Committee, legal marijuana dispensaries, and the financial sector. These lawsuits have a low probability of success, but the objective of plaintiffs in these cases is to harass, not necessarily to win.

*** I don't agree with you about the dynamics of threatening for money. It doesn't need an organized group capable of violence that everyone knows no one will do anything about. (If it did, it wouldn't happen all the time. That is a super rare situation.) It needs a target (a person who cares), and asset (the thing the person cares about) and an attacker (a person who can threaten the asset).

The attacker doesn't need to threaten the target, they need to threaten the asset. Stores are a classic asset, because they can't run away or defend themselves. Reputations are another. Careers a third.

The target being personally fierce is not relevant to this deal. Your Nashville and NY examples are equally helpless if they care about their stores. They can pay a small amount to the attacker, or lose a big amount in their asset. The only thing the Tenesee guy's belligerence gets him is a third losing option, going to jail for murdering the kid who delivers the threat.

Bethel and Val aren't immune to Annad's boss' threat because they are able to defeat him. They are immune because they don't care about the asset (in this case, being able to remain in the city and operate a candy store).

Such men exist because in a society with poverty, people with no compunctions about violence and no other prospects will resort to that kind of behavior.

A systemic solution is remove the motivations for that kind of behavior like creating a post scarcity world or to a lesser degree, create great economic prosperity and abundant opportunities.

I think the point being made is that physical force is cheap. If you get rid of one band which projects physical force as a means of intimidation, another will take its place. That's why it's said that States exist to exert a monopoly on violence: you can't end violence entirely, but you can make it so that anyone who uses it without authorization is punished.

So, the problem here isn't that there's a violent band of criminals, it's that a monopoly on violence isn't being enforced. There's no State, or an ineffectual one. To fix that, they need a group capable of inflicting violence in order to claim that monopoly for themselves (for the benefit of the people of the city, of course).

Moreover, most people (even trained soldiers) do not immediately jump to murder as a solution. That shopkeeper's cousin would probably try to talk to the police or make a non-lethal show of force, which allows Annad to come back later and ambush them with more goons.

This confused me at first. If I recall correctly, Bethel didn't particularly care about Uther copulating with her human-shaped force projection.

  “I didn't care, at the time,” said Zona. “What did nudity mean to me, when it was just an illusion that I was projecting?” She gestured to Tiff's form. “This isn't my body, my house is the body, if you'd like to stretch the analogy. Even after I was smart enough to understand, the sexual relations didn't bother me. *No, it was the obvious shame he felt, the threats he made afterward, the way he tossed me aside once I'd served his purposes.*”
#+end_quote

Though presumably the entad-feeding - painful, permanently mind-altering, and disregarding her repeated pleas to stop - was on a whole other level.

Still, even if Bethel might agree that it could be appropriate to call the entad-feeding "rape", I don't think she'd assume it as the first interpretation of the word. So I don't think that's what Valencia meant either.

**** From my view and the commentary Valencia has about it afterwords I think she meant "all of the above" with the word "rape". In that discussing the specifics of it gets messy, but certainly everyone can agree Uther raped Bethel in one way or another. Whether from the human-sexual viewpoint, the entad-feeding viewpoint, or the emotional-abuse aspects. She chose it carefully because any of those viewpoints are valid and she can choose the path to go down as needed in the specific situation.

**** It's a believable claim though, at least in the sense of rape. There was no physical interaction between Uther and her, just the hologram thing she was projecting.

The only parallel between that and rape is the feeling of helplessness when someone more powerful makes you do something you don't want to do. But without that sexual element, it's literally not rape, it has more in line with having a police officer or authority figure abuse their power and position to order you to do something you resent.

** Val's and Beth's conversations about their ideal world reminded me of [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-5-esprit-de-corpse/5-04/][Twig]]. Especially, how would they react to Helen presenting her ideal world? (Spoilers for Twig from hereon out).

#+begin_quote
  “Everything that isn't necessary to getting what we want is gone,” she said, eyes closing, as if she was vividly imagining. “There's an abundance of it all, thanks to science. Food is everywhere and it overflows and there's nothing to worry about because we have and we want and we take. We're, and by we I mean people, we're everywhere and we spill over into one another and we're all knit together, physically and mentally. It's an exquisite landscape of things that don't ever run out to see and touches and tastes and smells and mating and eating and mindless fighting and eating-mating and fighting-eating and fighting-”

  “Okay,” I said, interrupting. I paused, then when I couldn't think of what to say. “Okay.”

  Helen reached down to her plate, used a fingertip to wipe up a bit of frosting, and popped it into her mouth, sucking it off.

  “Okay,” I said, still at a bit of a loss for words.

  “That's a mental image that's going to be with me forever,” Jamie said, dropping his head down until his face was in his hands.

  “I don't see where ethics come into that world,” I said, more to see Jamie's reaction than out of curiosity.

  “No,” Jamie said. “Don't-”

  “The closer you get to perfection, the further you get from ethics,” Helen said, as if it was common sense.
#+end_quote

Helen's similarily non-human to Bethel, but coming at it from a more... predator-like direction. She was purpose-built to be a killing machine who gets up close and personal, while Bethel was never /intended/ to be anything but a house. Their background with regards to their "creator" is a little similar, though, what with Helen being made attractive to Ibbot's precise sensibilities, and her not respecting or liking him.

#+end_quote

I think [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/egl22m/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_177183/][all the outrage in the last thread]] about the capture missed something.

Look at Respec, ch172:

#+begin_quote
  This time, I had friends and allies around me, plus as much information about the underlying mechanics of the system as Reimer could give me [...]

  Reimer's interpretation of “effective skill” had been that it was just the base number, meaning that it would be multiplied by my abilities, rather than by whoever's abilities I had borrowed from, at least for the purposes of Symbiosis. Taken that way, my nine in Flattery was really useless, because Symbiosis would push me up into the mid-twenties. The same applied to pretty much all of the social skills I had retained.
#+end_quote

What if Reimer was just /wrong/ about how it works? There's a whole scene about them talking through multipliers and target numbers. What if he misremembered, or it's not "taken that way", or the rules of the game layer are not a fleshed-out version of the rulebook Reimer remembers?

I think the capture is best explained by something along these lines, that Joon screwed up his social skills and we're in for a few chapters of him putting his foot in his mouth before he figures it out. Hopefully he does it before he completely runs out Solace's patience.
