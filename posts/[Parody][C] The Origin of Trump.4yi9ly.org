** I always felt that part of HP:MoR's backstory was amusing, but also one of the least realistic part of the story.

First off, if the Magic Britain military was really so weak, why had it not been invaded by a dozen dark lords at this point? And secondly, we only have Voldermort's word that his "Super-Mega-Enhanced Dark Lord: Turbo HD Remix" would have been incredibly effective and powerful. Maybe he would have failed for the same reasons Munroe did; maybe Voldemort sucks at getting anything from people without threatening them with torture or death.
