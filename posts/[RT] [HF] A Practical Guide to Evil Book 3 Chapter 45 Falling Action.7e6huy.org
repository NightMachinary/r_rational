** Awesome chapter, though the consequences (and cost) of this victory remain to be seen. The implications of this on the overarching story are rather massive. Winter and Summer are supposed to be (flawed) mirrors of Evil and Good. Cat broke something critical there.

** That was the right choice, the good choice. Free and safe passage into Arcadia will almost certainly end up saving untold thousands of lives of those under Catherine's command. Nauk is one person. Heck, if she wants Nauk healed so badly she can just have whats-her-name do the human sacrifice and still be far better off in terms of lives saved.

*** This assuming that she retains the /ability/ to open paths to Arcadia once her heart is returned and fealty to Winter removed. That would be a pretty typically fae fulfilment of the letter but not the spirit of a bargain.

I don't think it'll happen, as it would be narratively unfair at this point. Maybe as a de-powering later on to bring the start of the next book closer to status quo at the start of this one. But for now she should be able to act on the bargain.

** From a previous chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “That,” the Empress said quietly, “is worrying. Wekesa once told me that Arcadia is akin to a first draft of Creation, and mirrors it still. If Winter is meant to he be the reflection of villainy, and yet bound to it, there are... implications.”
#+end_quote

Winter and Summer are now married and one court. If Winter is the first draft of villainy, then Summer would be the first draft of heroism... what does that mean for Creation?

- Blended teams? The Woe are already going down this path.

- More ambiguously aligned Names? Ranger and her apprentices tend to be more neutral than Good or Evil; could it be that most Names will be like that going forward?

- An allegory for Praes and Callow becoming as one?

- A new path for Cat's next Name? IIRC, Grey Knight isn't going to happen as per the author, but that doesn't mean she needs to become the next Black (or White) Knight either.

*** u/Menolith:
#+begin_quote
  An allegory for Praes and Callow becoming as one?
#+end_quote

I think it's this, first and foremost. It's Black's endgame, and the Woe are only mirroring the effect.

Praes is very Evil and Callow is very Good, and the relationship between the countries is a watered-down version of the Courts. Well, at least in Praes' part, as I don't think Callow would have minded if Praes had turned to an empty desert overnight. Until now, the nations could still have been separated by a ragtag gang of heroes, but with the Courts fused the rules have changed.

As for the name... Very hard to say if it ties directly to the unification. Whatever she becomes will be affected by it along with everything else she has done, but past that I'm not sure if there will be clearer parallels.

** That's an impressive win. We know that Cat has lost a lot of men, some friends and a shitload of power. I wonder what else she's going to lose (or gain) now that she's lost the connection to Winter.
