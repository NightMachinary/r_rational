** Since you asked for constructive criticism: the beginning feels a bit choppy and exaggerated. It's obvious later that the Professor is being purposefully extravagant, but it still felt offputting to me. Maybe smooth the narration out a bit, with more scene setting so it's not quite so sharp.

Other than that, seems like an interesting start :) Definitely going to keep an eye out for more.

*** I misread the opening at first too - thought he was genuinely pissed off and being a /gigantic/ asshole. Then they were just kidding around... took a second read with the addition of context to 'get it'.

That said, once I was armed with that context it was all really rather good, definite success in the "picturing the scene" stakes. Added to my reading list.

**** I appreciate having this pointed out. Trying to work out a way to keep this element of the introductory scene while quickly making the context clearer - if I can't, I'll likely just scrap the faux-anger part.

Cheers!

***** Might be a breach of "show don't tell", but it could be as simple as inserting a thought from Red into the narrative that makes plain that he knows Oak is joking; didn't take much of a hint before it became clear. That or move some of the suppressed laughter a bit further up the paragraph to serve more or less the same purpose.

****** I've inserted a line right after Oak's first flare-up, to the effect that Red is containing his laughter so as not to lose the game they're playing. It's not a perfect fix, more of a stop-gap measure for new readers until I complete a full edit. Thanks for the feedback!

******* I think my first read was after this edit already, and I can say that the beginning was not offputting to me. I think it is because that sentence comes when you are still wondering what's going on in this situation, so the feeling that the anger/conflict is real doesn't have time to settle.

********* I've read it both before and after the change. I actually liked it better before.

I read fast too, but I also react fast, so I did feel the conflict -- but the discovery that it was in fact a joke actually made the reveal MORE impactful. Having more tension in place means that breaking that tension has a greater effect. It made the scene actually funnier, and it made the resolution more heartwarming.

Perhaps a good balance might be to put more emphasis and description into the reveal, so that there's no doubt in a reader's mind that the two characters are actually very close and that it was intentionally staged.

*********** I know that the "false twist" reveal can be compelling but keep in mind that Red is the viewpoint character of your story. Not knowing what he knows in this situation leaves the readers experiencing the whole event in a way that not a single person there, including the aides, does.

Just think of it this way. Imagine instead of us reading the story we were invisible strangers that happen to stumble into the scene. Would it make sense for us to feel like they are probably joking around (even if we're not completely sure about it) even before the two of them start laughing? If yes then in my opinion the same indications should be discernible at first read through to uphold immersion and authenticity. Reveals that are only reveals because of the medium of storytelling instead of being because of the situation itself never rubbed me in the right way in this kind of stories. Especially in a first person rational adventure story.

************ I've edited the introduction a few times now, and I'm at the point where I'm willing to just let it sit. I'll come back to it in a few weeks or so, when it's left my mind and I can look at it with clear eyes.

I've saved your comment, though, so I can look through it when that time comes. I agree with your feelings about tricksy reveals like that - they're actually a pet irritation of mine as well. But I'm not going to take this one on again for a while, as any changes it receives would probably be of the major-overhaul variety, rather than the subtle-alteration sort, and I'm just too close to it right now to do that properly.

Thanks for the feedback, mate!

************* I mostly was speaking in light of people telling you that the first edition was better. The way I described that it should be is the way that it was for me on my read through just now. Slight but noticeable hints that this is all an inside joke between the two Oaks. So what I'm arguing is that your edit was a good idea.

*** Hi!

Looking through with that in mind, I definitely see what you mean. Reads more like...well, just badly written anger. I'll revise this in the next edit. I appreciate the feedback!

***** No, it was a joke that on reflection is probably a bit too oblique.

While writing, I noticed that I had Blue shrugging quite often. I liked the idea of expressing that he must have overmuscled trapezoids, but it's not very well-communicated.

** I like the beginning (just to provide a counterpoint). You're /supposed/ to be tricked for a second when someone's pretending.

Interesting that red says dad, but blue says grampa. So Oak adopted Red as a son, but Red is younger than blue?
