** Wait, is the implication here that the Comet King is /Sohu's father?/ Is this new information? It would certainly explain the flying kayak.

Who's going to save the world, other than the Comet King?

****** I agree that it really looks like she's the Comet King's daughter. Just saying, we don't have explicit confirmation. There could be some other character who thought they'd save the world and credit God. Probability seems low, but non-zero.

******* She's Aaron's time-displaced daughter.

(Which is not mutually exclusive with her being the Comet King's daughter, obviously)

***** I think so. It's hard to say. Scott [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/25/predictions-for-2016/][only gave 50% probability]] that he would not miss any Unsong updates this year. And yet in his 2015 predictions, he gave 60% probability that "I will not finish [project]", and he judged that prediction incorrect.

I think the best hypothesis at the moment is that he has a complete first draft that his close friends have read, but that he's editing it into completed form week-by-week.

**** This was the first time I can recall backing up to take in a characters lines again, for /every/ line in a chapter. When this is finished, I might open tabs for all the Uriel+Sohu chapters and just read them all alone, grinning until it hurts.

Wait.
