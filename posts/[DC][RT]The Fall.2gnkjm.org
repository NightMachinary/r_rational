So [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTYFqs4VnQ][The Fall]] is a PC game with a pretty simple premise, you've crash landed on an unknown planet and your pilot is unresponsive. You need to find them medical treatment while also trying to deal with other AI systems with their own goals and methodologies. I think the game does a great job of setting up every character's goals and limitations to make things interesting storywise, and that's reflected to a certain extent in the mechanics as well which is always nice to see. At the same time, there are a few things that simply exist for a nice visual effect for the player, the biggest one being the AI's BIOS which displays all of its primary objectives and which parts of the combat suit it has access to.

Bear in mind that this is essentially just the first few chapters of the story being told, according to the developer the remaining two parts should come out soon.

If you're interested in buying the game it's on Steam and the Humble Bundle store, otherwise [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYJgwaBxtY][this]] is a pretty good Let's Play of the game in four parts.


** The aesthetic reminds me a lot of [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/231160/][The Swapper]], which is a really fun puzzle game that brings up issues and thoughts about human identity and copies of people but doesn't really present a concrete thesis (just raises a bunch of fairly interesting questions).

Note that The Swapper's been on the Humble Bundle multiple times and also has been quite heavily discounted in various steam sales at various times, so paying full price is probably not a wise investment of your money. edit: humble bundle has it for $10.49 USD currently, but it's been in bundles for like $7-8 for it and like 6+ other games too, so...

** I'm about 3/5 of the way through the let's play. So far, it seems to have the a theme that ties into FAI theory. Namely, it's problem solving skills involve utilizing solutions that violate our values, but are otherwise successes. Good example, sucking the baby into the disposal pipe to make it quit crying.

*** Note that it is also possible (and I have done it), to shoot the baby for the same result.

**** Huh. Cool. The Let's Play guy shot it like 40 times, but maybe not in the right place or the right time.

** I'm not that much impressed by the game so far, it does a lot of "you need to use this specific item on this other specific item, to get the effect that in real life you could have achieved a bazillion different ways". Getting wires, breaking stuff, etc, etc.

Plus, I think the game may have bugged out on me since I can't seem to do what happens in the 2:38 point of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_H-x41lqDs]] , and the game may be unfinishable for me now. I watched the video exactly just because I couldn't seem to progress any further past a point and was wondering what I could have missed.

So, not recommending this.

*** Well it seems to have all the standard adventure game tropes. Which I guess is very annoying if you're not familiar with them but also makes it very annoying for me to watch the lets play.

** I enjoyed the game, but the experience is not significantly better than it would be if I were just watching someone playing the game. The gameplay itself is moderately interesting, lots of thinking and fetching items and putting them in places, and the fight system is pretty good, but the controls can be finnicky at times and the puzzles themselves are not interesting to solve.

I recommend watching a good let's play of this game, and not purchasing it. The ideas and the plot are good, but it's not engaging enough to keep me gripped.
