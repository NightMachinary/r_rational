Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Imagine that earth once had magic (and magical creatures), but for underspecified reasons, the magic left. Now, magic is returning, and the magical creatures along with it.

But as it turns out, Humans are magical too-- some of our little ticks and quirks come from our brains trying to invoke magic, but not quite succeeding. For example, the feeling that there's something watching you comes from your brain trying to use a magical danger-sense and recieving a false-positive.

What would be some cool innate abilities for humans to get?

The idea here would be to think of some way to make humans reach some parity on an individual level with fantasy civilizations (think dwarves, fae, giants), but still leaving humans bad enough at magic that, combined with technology, we wouldn't just steamroll over a bunch of medieval-stasis type kingdoms (or whatever.)

We wouldn't have access to any sort of magic system, though; that would be restricted to some other species, so technology doesn't steamroll them immediatelly.

*** Deja vu (the generally false feeling that you're experiencing something you've experienced before) as a 'false positive' on innate ability to be aware of magical memory tampering? Perhaps 'elves' (or whoever) mainly were potent due to secrecy abilities and the capability to conceal their cities, lay false memories, strike then retreat beyond retaliation, etc, and 'I think I've experienced this before' comes from innate attempts to pierce this? Yes, I'm cribbing from The Matrix and 'They Changed Something!'.

Aside from the obvious things like prayer (alter the odds of an event occurring by a measurable amount with sufficient meditation) and dreaming (which could enable clairvoyance, telepathy, and/or future-telling) --- I would particularly add enhancements to the placebo effect, allowing a human to enchant anything edible for the purpose of curing the ailments of others.

*** I just looked up some clickbait on "weird things the human body/brain does". Here's some of the more applicable ones:

- Afterimages (negative color images in your eye after looking at a bright light) are a form of postcognition. With magic, you can get afterimages from things you haven't seen.

- Vertigo is from being in an eddy of a mana flow, and the chaotic motion is throwing you off.

- Forgetting why you entered a room is a method of clearing out your short term memory to store the new scrying/clarivoyance you automatically do of your surroundings (unfortunately, with no magic, it just clears your memory without replacing it with anything.)

- Your brain is awful at probability because the (magical) world is awful at probability. Humans perform better at probability calculations in a magical world than naive Bayes does if it doesn't account for the probability bending effects of magic.

- Phantom limbs represent where your spirit/soul is in the real world. They can interact with other spirits, but not with inert matter.

*** Speaking as a former believer in pseudoscience, debunked ideas that retain popularity are a gold mine for this universe. One of the main reasons I originally got into New Age spiritualism, ESP while meditating, and reiki healing was because something about them felt fundamentally correct, like a world with those thing was one that intuitively made sense. After discovering rationality I have since backpedaled on my claims, of course, and now side with the skeptics.

In this universe, the reason humans would have believed in things with no scientific basis is because our predisposition towards magical thinking was a survival mechanism. However, when we made the cultural transition from revering the supernatural to trying to understand and control it, the supernatural faded. Skepticism probably shouldn't be a form of anti-magic, but the trend of humans towards thinking more scientifically even pre-Enlightenment should have something to do with the backstory.

In the distant past, humans had so little knowledge of or control over their environment that we had to have blind faith in forces beyond their understanding. As we survived and learned, however, we began to question our old ways even if we didn't abandon them completely. Religion was institutionalized because it was logical for gods greater than us to be the same everywhere on Earth, people claiming to possess magical abilities gained high status in society for their apparent service, mystical artifacts were always incredibly valuable, and monsters were legally hunted down to be punished for their local crimes.

That is largely the western cultural perspective, though, which emphasized individualism and rewards the exceptional. Eastern cultures were all about collectivism and recognized no difference between the magical and mundane, mages were as likely to run businesses as fight evil. The perspective there was one where the universe was subtly manipulated by supernatural forces, with their own bureaucratic institutions, who chose to share their secrets with those who met their qualifications and would work against any who displeased them including governments.

Sorry that my response has been so abstract and I haven't given you any specific examples, but I just love the premise you've concocted and had to share my thoughts. I REALLY want to see what sort of story you end up telling.

*** So, when you say "now", do you mean, like... /now/ now? Because technology has been just stupidly overpowered since at least World War I. Honestly, if you kitted out an army of elves with circa-1500 gear, each one twice as good at everything as the best human Olympic athlete, supplemented with a magical communication network and magical artillery, with a full battalion of dragons, and you set that army against Napoleon, I'd expect the elves to be speaking French before the end of the decade. The sorts of magic you'd need to overcome our technological advances wouldn't let you look anything like a medieval-stasis kingdom. If you want us to be balanced, then it's probably not a great idea to give us both magic /and/ machine guns.

Unfortunately, I'm not very good at the sort of free association that would help with the question you actually seem to be interested in, but I hope you get interesting suggestions.

**** I think you're a little TOO optimistic here.

Firstly: communications. If you have 30000 guys with 1800 tech versus 10000 guys with 1800 tech PLUS wireless communications, the 10000 guys with (magitech) raio win almost every time.

Secondly: Just HOW powerful is this "magical artillery"? Is it more Napoleon-level, or WWI level? If it's even Crimean-War level, the Napoleonic army probably loses unless it has a huge numbers advantage.

Thirdly: Napoleonic armies don't have good AAA. Depending on how tough the dragons are, and what weapons they carry, they might have the potential to cause massive direct damage, ON TOP of the advantage provided by aerial recon.

The point where technology starts allowing you to TRULY blast a medieval army to bits with minimal effort comes in the late 18th century. (See: Battle of Omdurman, the entire second half of the Anglo-Zulu war, etc.)

***** Indeed, a napoleonic army would struggle against an elf army as I described, and victory is not assured. I agree that winning isn't a virtual certainty until later. I meant that more as the earliest point that it is reasonable to argue that technology matches most magics that neither cause nor require an industrial revolution. If the elves had a good magic-industrial complex with theater-spanning communications, and a modern howitzer in every hand, and mature air support doctrines, they'd win against a napoleonic army, sure. But those magical innovations are exactly the things that would transform their economy and culture to be incompatible with anything like our middle ages.

*** Dreaming was originally an autonomous and un-controllable low fidelity scrying of the future, intending to prepare you for events before they happened. In cases that there were blind spots the ancient human brain used already stored knowledge instead.

Modern day human brains have been operating for a long time on the assumption that the whole world was warded from scrying, only preparing us based on knowledge we actually already have and vague predictions of the future.

Working as intended this would manifest in vague ideas about notable events in the near to medium term future, and feeling as though you've practiced important tasks once or twice before.

*** A bit of a case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural][Neurodiversity is Supernatural]] but synesthesia could be an uncommon but natural talent for seeing the shape of magic. Each word/sound/letter/color has an effect on local magic flowing through it. Most of the time it has some random innocuous effect that doesn't amount to anything (like light or radio being refracted or reflected in different ways by various objects), but if you combine them into the right combination (like an incantation, or inscribed rune), you get a useful effect. Synesthetes can see this effect (and as a result are better at discovering new spells/inscriptions) but because there is no magic it gets mismapped in their head as some other sensory effect.

*** I thought up a couple innate bits of innate magic a while ago for humans in a little worldbuilding project. The first one was a passive immune system buff, effectively the magic tries its best to help it along and suppresses the symptoms while sick. I figured it was pretty fair. You'd still feel the illnesses and the worst of them would still likely spell death, but a case of the common cold could come and go without much of an effect.

But the other idea I had was for humans to not starve. The idea is that the magic takes the food you just ate, your immune system, and if they're not compatible, bridges the gap. We don't eat grass, but if you had this magic you could eat grass and your passive magic would try and squeeze nutrients out of it anyhow. You'd still find it disgusting, since your taste buds still prefer 'edible' food, and any magic spent on digesting grass is magic not spent on buffing your immune system, but what's notable is that your magic bridges the gap. It doesn't just squeeze nutrients out of the grass for you, it slowly alters you to be able to handle the grass easier and use up less magic.

The farthest-reaching versions of this passive magic have humans able to survive, in a miserable existence, eating nothing but the sand of the desert or simply drinking seawater. Over time, however, the passive magic that keeps you alive would adapt you to this type of food, matching the composition of your body and the mechanics of your digestive system to the food you eat to minimize strain on your magic. People who eat nothing but sand are adapted by their magic to have drier bodies, with cells formed more and more out of the chemicals that make up sand. People who only drink seawater slowly become more and more water-based on every level of their biology. With a generous interpretation of this adaptation effect, this is how demihumans came to exist in my world. Some people would go off to a hostile environment and, in order to survive on the 'food' there, adapt to better match the 'food'.

** Ever since seeing an EcoSphere in an issue of Popular Mechanics decades ago, I've had a sort of fascination with small, closed ecosystems. I've had a few terrariums, but it's really hard to make a terrarium that's properly balanced so that it doesn't require intervention, and even in the ideal it's pretty far from a closed system. Fiction is more aesthetically pleasing than reality anyway; that's why I spent a lot of doodling time mapping out enclosed systems (floating islands, microplanets, cities in a bottle, etc.).

What's the smallest size for functional enclosed societies? [[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated.html#.VBiC_XtDLwo][80 people]] is supposedly enough for ten generations with no genetic defects, assuming that you have some social engineering. But that leaves basically no wiggle room in case of unexpected deaths, and eighty people doesn't seem like enough unless the tech level is really high or really low; a population of eighty seems appropriate to a small Iron Age fishing village on an island or a small space-faring colony whose needs are largely met by automation. I have some question about the inbetween areas of technological development, but historical records aren't a great guide because your average 1600s village would assume some level of trade.

There are obviously different levels of enclosure; if you've got a floating island, there's still interaction with the aerial biosphere and native weather system of wherever it's floating. I know basically nothing about how you would /actually/ set up a bottle city so that biowaste gets turned into food and oxygen levels are balanced against carbon dioxide, I just know that those are things that need to be done (and in space habitat diagrams that I've seen, can be done in a space smaller than a shipping container if you only care about a few people).

** Hello. This is my first time trying this.

I have a rather well worked out setting in mind, which I plan to use as the basis for a player quest on sufficient velocity.

Here's the link to what I'm trying to do:

My current main concern is that I do not know how to push potential players towards following a certain plotline. There are loopeholes, I discovered, which could allow the player to exploit the 'tutorial' part of the setting without ever taking a step in the real world.

The setting is called ElectroSphere and its a post-human, post-material, approaching post-technological singularity where about ten duodecillion humans live in a structured electron shell bound between the gravity of an Earth-sized neutron star and the electrons' own self-repulsion.

The player is supposed to wake up with no memory of previous events, a small toolkit of programs and helper-bots, a timer counting down from 3 seconds and a cryptic message.

Ask below for more about the setting, the plot I'm trying to play through and suggestions on how you tried handling this sort of problem.

**** The inhabitants of electrosphere live at different frequencies.

Public servers render people at a Megahertz: 1000000 seconds simulated for 1 second of real time. Private servers offer different frequencies. The richest have access to Gigahertz, 1000 times faster than the rest. They have access to their own slices of reality The poorest can sell their simulation time and live at 1k or less. Blanksleep is a method of time travel, where you are rendered more slowly than reality, and costs very little.

The protagonist wakes in a state of 12GHz, inside a public server. Everyone else seems motionless and unresponsive. The players learns a bit about the world before their special status ends. If they learn too much, they might exploit their situation without bothering to follow the trail of clues I laid out.

Unfortunately doing the latter should be tricky, even at that level over a timespan of a few hours it should be clear that things are moving, just incredibly slowly. You'd need to keep them moving so they can't stay still long enough to notice.

I presume the clues are related to whatever mystery trigger ends the effect? Hmm. There's limits, you can make the clues more obvious, but in a quest people will often try to explore. What it really sounds like you need is a method of preventing exploitation of the situation, or at least pushing on a time limit to guide them along the path. Are there any negative consequences of existing at 12000x speed on a public server? Seems like the kind of thing law enforcement would be after, watching for people running at higher speeds as naturally doing so would greatly aid lawbreaking efforts.

****** The 12000x speed is one of the clues required to understand the situation the player is in. It lasts for about an hour in subjective time, or about 0.3 seconds of public time.

In Electrosphere, calculation power is simulation time is money. You can be rich if you have a lot of currency to your name, if you can live for a certain amount of years, or if you can command a certain amount of calculation time from a server.

The hour is so that the players can learn about their inventory, the value system, and the first clues that will hook them up to the main plot's mystery. If the hour elapses and they haven't done anything except wander around aimlessly, they will find themselves looking like a drunk homeless mute and dumb man stumbling around at rush hour. Arrested quickly, and find themselves unable to answer the police's questions.

The player is supposed to find out rather early that the hour they spent was very costly. It was paid for by someone who wanted them to circulate through a public server without being noticed. To escape? To exfiltrate? The other clues will help them.

So far, I think the solution is making the 'helper bots' much more vocal, by offering help and asking questions rather than just answering requests.
