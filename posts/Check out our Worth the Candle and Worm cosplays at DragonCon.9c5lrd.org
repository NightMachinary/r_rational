**** Yeah, I saw that. It's smaller than the pot, which is a crime on its own :P

I think if there was something about 'smith' that could work for me, otherwise meh, too many interpretations.

** Worm the Candle.

Oorang is the best one, although of course the DM is pitch-perfect. Nice!

*** You wouldn't believe how much time it took for us to glue all those darn leaves on, thanks!

As to the DM, I'm glad you liked it! I was feeling unsure since I took some artistic liberties (grey hoodie instead of a dark grey hoodie, a die instead of just text, and my natural eye color instead of blue).

** I recognize Solace and Canary. Who's the lazy guy supposed to be?

Edit: also, cosplaying a character in a relatively obscure webserial must give the ultimate geek cred at one of these things.
