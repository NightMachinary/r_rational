** Are you actually seeking feedback/suggestions in the document? The share settings put readers into suggestion mode where they can just start typing and it will start making an edit suggestion.

**** I was mostly asking because seeing other people's cursors in the story and them accidentally making suggestions detracts from the reading experience. If you didn't intend for that sort of interaction, you could modify the sharing permissions to just let people read non-interactively.

****** They don't really grab me. Read the first chapter, got a little into the second, decided I didn't care.

For me at least it's somewhat unclear what it wants to be about. A elf (or angel? I can't remember my lotr well enough to tell) goes for a jog, he is really fast? Someone is taking to him? Or was talking to him earlier? He tries to hunt ducks with a "pure kenetic blast" it just knocks some back. We end.

Also I found my self skimming the more complicated descriptions.

Sorry if this isn't the kind of comment you were asking for..

******** Ah the term Vanier felt tolkien ish, and I might have misread the reddit title. And I know very little about Runescape. Hmm, it probably would have made more sense if I had made that connection. Hm. Sorry!

******** Well I am afraid I didn't like that either. *embarrassed*

The poetic effect of the writing on me was disinterest. It felt uniform and vague, and emotionally flat, and contributed to my sense of nothing happening/confusion. I mean I did get the sense that the characters cared about..something?

But it's quite possible I am just not your audience.
