That kind of still matches the games. You don't find out they're team rocket until the battle starts, except if you're infiltrating their hq or some operation. It just looks like some random hiker in Mt Moon and then the battle starts and they have an R. If you take their overworld sprite as what they're actually wearing and the battle sprite as a metaphor for who they really are it fits.

But I guess it might not matter, as their stances on what to sacrifice in a dangerous situation are about to be dramatically tested; nothing better than life-or-death situation to put things into practice.

****** IRL, Kyushu /is/ oriented that way, but during game development, the island was rotated 90 degrees to improve playability. And based on (admittedly obscure) game dialogue, that design choice included making the top of the Hoenn map oriented north within the Pokemon world. According to Bulbapedia, in Pokemon Emerald, if you call May with Match Call after connecting the two halves of Rusturf Tunnel, her dialogue is:

/"<player>, how are you? I'm out on Route 111 now. I'm going to get a rest at an old lady's house. She lives just north of the desert."/

[[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/May_(game][https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/May_(game)]])

#+end_quote

Absolutely true. But I believe it's evident that Daystareld also interprets the Hoenn map to be oriented top = north. /If/ top = east, then the east coast of Hoenn would be the Fortree / Fallabor coast. But in the source material, the games, that specific coastline and the offshore ocean never features in the story, and is never explored (other than Soaring over it in Alpha/Omega). In contrast, if top = north, then the east coast of Hoenn is the Lillycove-Mossdeep-Sootopolis region, which lines up with the game lore of the Seafloor Cavern being ground-zero for a super-ancient Legendary Pokemon in all Hoenn games.

/If/ Daystareld adapts Pokemon Emerald's version of the story, then only Kyogre is in the Seafloor Carvern while Groudon is inside Mt. Chimney. But even if top = east, then it would make more sense for the epicenter of the first earthquake to be described as closer to central Hoenn rather than off of the Fortree / Fallabor coast =)

** Just finished catching up, assorted reactions:

1) they just developed this tulpa mind technology, and we know that the way it works, one mind can be affected by a mental effect while the other one is free to act(see: red's merger with egg pokemon). We also know that red's second mind feels like something that encompasses the first, like a bubble within a bubble, to both red and other psychics(see: red's examination by the psych doctor). Further, Pressure is very likely a mental(or well, emotional) effect, mostly because I don't think there is anything else that they wouldn't have thought of guarding against by now(e.g. weird sound beyond the range of human hearing would show up on recording devices, and would be possible to fend off against with good sound insulation)

my hypothesis thus is: can you guard against Pressure with a tulpa by just dumping the entire mental effect into one mind and subsequently ignoring it

A thing you'd need to test before testing this if you can kill a tulpa, since you probably don't want a pressured insane mind inside your noggin.

2) Blue can get dabbed on with his non-risk-management ethics. Here is me, dabbing on him: \o\

3) I strongly suspect red could have made the whole storm night much safer by spending some % of that 150k bank he has on purchasing pre-trained pokemon. Given how shitty their world is, having more stuff to put between yourself and whatever is trying to kill you really seems pretty essential. A basic flier, some easy to catch pokemons with status effect attacks, something like a Tauros for the sheer bulk - surely all of those should be cheap due to supply being very significant. I can't really buy that glorified cattle would be expensive to raise in a world where you can make them follow all orders unconditionally by just putting them on a shelf in a pokeball for a week.

A shock suit would have helped greatly too, and he was thinking of buying one all the way back in chapter 7. That whole Magnemite fight had a lot of close calls, and being immune to electricity would sure have helped.

All this to say: what are the chances that at least one of the common-sense purchases red could have made in order to prepare for /general/ threats before that night would have helped with the whole fire hospital fiasco? A pokemon that can prevent the roof from crushing you, some firefighter suit? Hell, just a basic construciton helmet, thing fairly useful for keeping yourself alive when things fall on your head?

I do not think assigning lower odds to this than 5% is justified, so red has at the minimum directly murdered 5% of Aiko by being insufficiently prepared for threats and not utilizing his monetary advantages.

*** Pokemon that are better at battling than the average trainer can capture and train themselves within a couple months are *very* expensive in this world, since, as you say, supply and demand. Tauros are not just good at battling, however, they're actually super rare, hence the Safari Zone nature preserve.

For trainers to buy their own powerful pokemon, they have to believe they will need it NOW rather than just collecting powerful pokemon for later. If you've ever played a video game and not purchased some good gear from a vendor because you might find gear just as good or better on your own soon, I'm picturing the same mentality.

All that said, yes, underutilizing their money to gain advantages in survivability is a mistake that they made. Red in particular has his money bookmarked for other things that might help in his research, but as the end of this chapter showed a hint of, they have all definitely updated on that mistake.

*** I've just recently become obsessed with the 2004 cult classic 'Evil Genius', where you build a lair full of mooks and henchmen, so I'm obviously an expert at this subject;

1. So first off, your general purpose raw man power to buy furniture, dynamite caves out and set up rooms, pick up the briefcases full of money, set up cameras and traps... the odds and ends.

2. You get your hospitality industry; the friendly front behind which you operate your shady business. The restaurant, hotel, resort, whatever. They'll also be at shell corporations making your business look good and profitable and stable and not at all money laundering.

3. Then of course the guards are trained in fighting, and can do gigs as terrorists, mercenaries, guns for hire, security, kidnappings, whatever.

4. The iconic researchers and technicians will run your computer systems monitoring the global situation (where can we deploy soldiers too? Who needs a fake charity to boost our image?), as well as to research new and interesting things (You know, a camera with a laser on it is basically a motion sensor, right? And this furnace we're shoveling coal into, well it's in the basement, and we could just open the floor up to it. We'll just tell everyone that works here not to step right HERE, and when the bad guys break in, they fall into the flames!)

Obviously all of these mooks could level up from basic grunts to karate masters or sharpshooters, from lab techs to quantum physicists, etc.

Don't forget, the only way to turn a henchman into anything other than a henchman is to have him kidnap a maid or plumber or something and strap them into a chair and interrogate them. Usually with Michael Jackson moves, sometimes cymbals.

Also tentative is my rising hope for Red and Leaf! We may have nudged in the right direction in this chapter, though it's still a bit shaky.

I must admit, the first quake I didn't connect to the showers indicating it was the Hoenn pair going at it, but it clicked a bit after.

*** The world is extremely well-built, as are the characters. Some scenes are so visceral that every thunderstorm, I find myself thinking of a line from the chapter with Zapdos.

At times the characters' thoughts could stand to be a little more "show, don't tell," but this is intended as a "rationalist" story, so that's a stylistic choice. I really dislike the "therapy" chapters (basically entirely told, not shown), but they're few and far between. There's also a fair bit of woo-woo psychology, some of it taken seriously.

I've been reading this story every month for more than five years, so let that inform how you take my critique.

I think you've read so little that you've only seen the story's weaknesses. You should give it another shot, reading at least a few more chapters; once the cliffhangers start, I expect you'll be hooked.

Also, I vaguely remember that the first few chapters were being rewritten. They might be better now; I haven't reread them.

But I can see where in some places there's just a lot of /talking/, as well as exposition about some world stuff. Sometimes I find myself skipping lines, and even though I go back to read them when I catch myself doing it I don't think it would hurt my enjoyment of the action scenes down the line.
