I am going to be doing [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2qrex5/fanfic_tuesday_fanfics_week_0/][this]], which means this fic will be updating every Tuesday, and it will probably be updating there, not here. As such, I consider this the last week for pandering requests. If you want Korra to get a pet bunny that shoots lasers out of its tail, now's the time to say!

Try to solve the definitely rational plot ahead of time, guys. Who blew up the hospital? When will Korra figure out who her party is? When is Zolt going to totally kill Mako like he is gonna? And when will we be seeing some Korrasami lezphysics action dammit.

OH AND THE SHOW'S OVER CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS [[#s][Spoilers]]

Can't disagree. See [[/r/TrueAnime]]'s [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2q6a58/tuesday_nonanime_discussion_thread_1223/cn3chxj][thread about the ending]] (not that it's actually an anime, but nevermind).

**** Meh, I liked it. I think that a lot of what people have a problem with is the romance stuff, which seems like a stupid thing to focus on, especially given how much of it is subtext, and how unimportant it was compared to the three or four plots in play.

***** I think what the finale really needed to work right was a "Reconstruction Effort" Montage between the final fight and the wedding. Not much - just some shots of Asami in a hard hat or construction mech and Korra Rubble-Bending. Because logically, both of them would be up to their eyeballs in that effort, and it would make the romantic vacation ending feel more logical and less rushed.

**** I thought it was pretty good. Not as good as ATLA, of course, but seasons 3 and 4 redeemed the show for me. Less focus on romance, no deus ex machina, and interesting character development for Korra and some of the side characters like Lin. The villains were good too, though I do agree that they [[#s][Korra book 4]] Like [[/u/alexanderwales]] said, the romance had so little screentime that, though it did come out of left field, I don't think it took away from an otherwise strong ending.

That said, it's a bit... ham-handed? or perhaps cheesy that you reference the Sequences by name. Not that I am complaining, it works form an in-world perspective, just not from a meta-textual perspective.

** You want a random request to pander to? You've got it!

I looked up online for a random word generator. The twelve words given are: premium, tire, mind, plain, neat, venomous, towering, grateful, ring, teaching, books, and crowd.

My random idea is therefore.../drum-roll/...Korra gets a premium tire to be used as a ring for a (grateful?) bride in a marriage ceremony inside a library to teach about snakes.

/blinks slowly/

Ok that was a weird idea, but it's up to you to follow the idea exactly as much as you want.
