Rational/rationalist Overwatch fanfic. Many different POV chapters and various idea debating as well as a over arching plot to keep it all in a good direction story wise.


** In this chapter we learn that courts have a higher requisite for evidence and that groups of similar thinking people can decide on a idea based on emotional reasoning. Good thing robo-monk is here to save the day, at least until the resident time traveler gives a vague enough warning that renders all the evidence talk unnecessary.

Benedict , I have to say letting the group be swayed by their friends warning is character consistent but not rational consistent. I can understand if you're pushing for plot advancement over detailed discussion though.

*** That's pretty much exactly the fight I had with myself while writing the chapter. They /don't/ have a lot of hard evidence, and should be looking at this more carefully. (I think they /do/ have enough evidence to promote it as a hypothesis and justify an intelligence-gathering mission.) I was going to get into a whole thing with using Athena to figure out if Sombra was trying to trick them, but I was having trouble figuring out how to structure that with Athena's panic shutdown- and eventually realized I could just short-circuit that scene with some time travel stuff I needed to set up anyway.

Like you said, I ultimately decided to push for character-consistent plot advancement over rationality-consistent detailed discussion- that kind of thing is why I don't describe AVWD as rationalfic. (Nonetheless, it inevitably shows up on this subreddit because of the material it deals with and the people that read my work.)

That said, the discussion isn't totally over, yet- there's an upcoming chapter wherein they need to convince /Symmetra/ to help them with the mission, which is going to require a considerably more careful analysis of the Lakshmi hypothesis. Mercy's also going to get a chance to weigh in, and should notice some flaws in the reasoning that were predictably overlooked by a room full of keyed-up Gryffindors.

** A rational story where there are plenty of intelligent characters, and even the characters not explicitly described as being wise, cunning, or super smart are capable of giving good insights?

I like it. :)
