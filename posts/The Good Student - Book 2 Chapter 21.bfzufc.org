** How's the second book doing? I felt like it fell apart at the end of book 1, but I'm open to encouragement.

*** It's interesting, but not as good as the first arc yet. The second arc has seen Nick have a lot less freedom of action than he was permitted in the first arc. As such it's been a bit of a downer since that character is best to read when he is being proactive and making plans.

**** It definitely has given me the sense that Nic has control of his life and has been cast adrift in an environment he knows much less about.

Its certainly been a move away from the academic environment, in a way he's no longer doing what brought him to the dance.
