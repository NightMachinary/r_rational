Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** You know what would be a really cool justification for the "medieval stasis" trope? Whenever a civilization becomes too advanced, dragons/aliens/ect become worried they will soon advance even more and be able to fight them, and so immediately wipe them out and burn their libraries and technology, and even attack their neighbors just in case some technology or knowledge had spread. Thus, an extreme taboo against technology rises.

*** Interestingly, we actually see this to an extent in real-life with nuclear technology, not just for weapons but also for energy. Most smaller less-developed countries are pretty content to just not even try to develop it because of the potential international shitstorm it would cause.

As one example, Iraq makes for an interesting lesson of how a mere allegation of nuclear weapons development could be used as justification to bomb the country, overthrow its government, and execute its leader, causing about a million civilian excess deaths and creating two million refugees. Iran is another interesting example, one of the few who are openly trying to develop nuclear energy (and allegedly weapons) and they've been hit with trade sanctions, Stuxnet, multiple assassinations of their nuclear physicists (allegedly), and the constant threat of being subjected to an Israeli airstrike and missile barrage potentially backed up by a US invasion.

In a fictional setting, I imagine much of this might be similar. Perhaps elves tolerate the humans as trading partners, but once they see their air and water becoming polluted by industrialization, they demand that the humans shut down their factories. If the humans are weak, the elves will simply invade, lay siege to their cities, burn their libraries, and destroy every factory they find. If the humans are strong(er), the elves impose trade sanctions, assassinate industrialists, sabotage factories, scare off superstitious workers with bad omens, and threaten to attack if the humans don't back down.

As another possibility, maybe dragons claim dominion over all of the land and tolerate humans only as a useful way to extract gold, gems, and silver from the earth. As long as the humans maintain regular shipments of treasure to add to their hoards, the dragons will spare their fields and cities from being lit afire. However, each time the humans try to industrialize, develop gunpowder weapons, or attempt to unite their kingdoms, the dragons see the humans as a threat and basically go on a rampage, killing and destroying enough to set the humans back at least a few hundred years or so.

*** Practical Guide to Evil has this with its Gnomes, though they don't form an important part of the plot in any way.

It's also strongly implied that the stasis is maintained by the setting's capricious Gods, who view the world as a source of entertainment, gambling, and a philosophical testbed.

** If a healer existed who didn't need resources to restore peoples health existed, but was limited by touch, would the healer mostly be moved around or centralized? Because the bigger the area/population the healer serves the more it becomes a need to get all the injured/sick to them instead of the healer to the masses. Is my thinking correct?

*** I think that's usually true, but maybe not always. Places with infrastructure will maximize the absolute number of people who have access to the supernatural healer, true. But whether that's what you want to optimize will depend on what sorts of healing are most important.

For example there are considerations like disease eradication. A lot of the holdouts keeping the last enclaves of polio from being eradicated are regions where it is very difficult to build infrastructure or transport enough equipment and trained personnel. A supernatural healer with less logistical overhead might be the ideal candidate to reach places like this.

I could also imagine somebody with an ability like this being deployed with a global rapid response team to hotspots where new plagues are emerging. Depending on the details of their ability, they might be really helpful in containing potential pandemics or even smaller but still serious outbreaks of infectious diseases before they can spread.

But if all you're concerned about is maximizing patients treated or coordinating access, I think centralizing makes sense.

*** It depends on how much time it takes them to do the healing, the type of healing they can offer, and the relative speed, cost, and safety of your available transportation methods.

If the healing can be done instantly upon contact, then you'd ideally want some kind of setup which allows people to reach the healer as fast possible. This might favor centralizing the healer at a purpose-built facility, perhaps with the healer on one conveyor belt, and people to be healed moving along on two adjacent conveyor belts traveling in the opposite direction. If it takes anywhere from a few seconds to a minute, then on-site logistics are no longer a chokepoint, so you could plausibly have the healer traveling to reduce the logistical burden of transporting millions of people to them. If it takes hours or days to do the healing, then the logistical burden for transporting people to the healer becomes small, and there's a relatively greater advantage to having a consistent place for the healer to be so that the people in greatest need can be triaged and seen first.

Regarding the type of healing, if they can fix literally anything - blindness, amputations, nerve damage, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, strokes, obesity, etc., then every city in the world could benefit from them. This was my assumed case for the paragraph above. If they can only heal 'injuries', like cuts, burns, gunshot wounds, broken legs, then the ideal approach might be to station them in areas with the highest expected need; probably large cities with high crime rates in peacetime, and then switching to secure locations near war zones or other conflict areas when such events occur.

Transportation is the only other issue that I think would impact things. Obviously, losing the healer in a car accident would be devastating. I would expect road travel to resemble a presidential convoy, with police blocking off all side-streets and clearing the roads ahead of the healer's motorcade. Travel by air would need to be done with multiple redundant safety systems which are re-certified before every flight, with parachutes available, appropriate equipment for dropping into water or in dangerous territory, equipment for signalling rescue teams, and of course, having high-speed search-and-rescue teams on standby. Travel by ship would be risky due to the possibility of rogue waves, so it would have to be done exclusively in calm seas, avoiding storms at all times, and having evac available on the ship in case of unexpected weather changes. Higher transportation costs favor moving the healer to reduce the transportation burden, and higher transportation speeds also favor moving the healer since it takes less time out of their available time for healing.

If it's one person in the whole world and there are no other ways to be healed: they stay in place and have an administration around them to organize everything.

If there are comparable services everywhere then the healer probably moves around to wherever their capacity is needed the most

*** I imagine them not moving hardly at all. Transportation is safe, but not as safe as staying put. Building infrastructure to bring people to them is easy if they don't move.

But if you have three healers, things become very different. Two of them can travel, together--not on the same vehicle, but near enough that if one gets injured the other can heal them back. In catastrophe the third still exists. In that case moving them around becomes much more feasible and attractive.

** Hey all! Back for more brainstorming on applications of antigravity crystals in a fantasy/steampunk setting.

Setting is floating islands held aloft by "magic" crystals. the crystals are shards of a massive obelisk that shattered in a past cataclysm, and now drift in orbit around it. The crystals lift is proportional to their volume, so small slivers (3 cm) can be held in a heavy vial, and large crystals (2-3 m) can hold up an airship. massive crystal complexes embedded in rock support entire islands that can sustain life.

Crystals emit an audible vibration, pitch based again on size, and exert a weak but wide range attractive force around them (akin to another form of gravity), allowing islands to stick together and causing condensation of water vapor in the immediate area. this allows for weather cycles in the vicinity of large crystals and formation of permanent bodies of water on the islands.

Islands drift haphazardly and over time mini-continents will form and break apart, much more rapidly than earth tectonics. this has allowed for migration between different islands by various species over the centuries.

Not 100% clear on what the planet below is like, been toying with it just being a gas giant with increasingly dense clouds giving way to a hot ocean the further down you go. Behemoths prowl the depths, making exploration dangerous.

Tech level of civilizations is just barely post-medieval, with a recent Di Vinci style renaissance of flying contraptions and simple machines.

What kinds of fun contraptions might you expect that leverage this tech level and physics?

*** If the islands are only loosely bound together through magical attractive forces, I think you would have people planting trees and other plants to attempt to bind islands together more than they naturally are. Failure of this system could mean that whatever polity is located near the edge would immediately lose some substantial amount of farmland, or possibly towns or cities. But until that happens, huge swathes of land dedicated to old growth forests isn't particularly profitable, so there's an individual incentive to turn that land towards either pasture land, or to turn all that lumber into something. This is very profitable until it suddenly isn't. Could work in various analogies for the destructive nature of clear-cutting, coastal erosiom, any number of things really.

It really seems like earthquakes would be extremely common, though probably not as destructive overall. You might see architecture styles more similar to Japan even with an overall European aesthetic.

You could leverage the floating crystals for architectural uses, if your population density is large enough to justify it. This could range from huge bridges that span far longer stretches than would be ordinarily possible, to impossibly tall but otherwise ordinary buildings, or any number of things.

If levitation if not powered flight is relatively easy, I think you would see something equivalent to a crow's nest on ships, but for cities and towns. Communication speeds with medieval tech are the speed of a racing horse under normal conditions, but it's possible to get much faster speeds if you have long sight lines, like with mountains, by using some light source to send signals. If you just have rotating crews of people on platforms suspended hundreds of feet in the sky, you could replicate this and send morse code with large mirrors (or selectively blocked fires at night) to other platforms, dramatically speeding up communication speed. Tether the platforms to the ground with rope, have people go up and down ropes with small levitation platforms and then just pull themselves up the rope... I think it could work well. There's some obvious ability to perform scouting and surveying with this as well.

The military uses of levitation are obvious. Lift rocks, drop them on approaching army. Any city could have a ring of platforms just for that purpose. Any artillery pieces would have ludicrous range, though you would have stability issues. The tether holding those platforms to the ground would be vulnerable, but also pretty hard to hit.

I think you could have much better naval transport utilizing the floating crystals. You don't need deep water ports, sail boats could go far faster, rowing would be more effective since there's not nearly as much drag from the water, or you can just haul much more cargo. Obviously depends on substantial rivers and seas, but I think the ability to control your direction with oars would give these ships an edge over airships that need something more complicated to fly in opposition to the wind.

Your world is going to have some huge elevation differences on its land, as individual islands don't precisely merge with the level of the main continent. Highly mountainous terrain, or equivalent, is going to incentivize relatively stagnant political maps over the large scale, because mountains are really, really difficult to move armies through. This may also stifle trade, and would lead to very interesting hydrology. The hydrology will probably need to be worked out in a bit of detail, because the rivers and oceans that connect different places are going to seriously affect political dynamics.

**** lots of awesome thoughts, thanks for putting some time into this =)

The last point about hydrology and differing plateau levels is super interesting from a world-building standpoint. Having massive waterfalls as common features could lead to advances in hydro power and mills as commonplace. I hadn't considered this element but I like it a lot.

Securing the soil is also a major environmental concern that would be interesting to explore. Poor farmers would be literally pushed to the "edge" of society, and be left scrabbling at loose earth with risk of losing chunks of their farmland to errant sky quakes.

Levitating artillery to increase range is also something I hadn't thought about much. I have some ballistae already worked into some of the armies as common weapons, having batteries of them on levitating platforms would be pretty dope.

great ideas, lots to consider!

***** I think the bridges I mentioned earlier would be extremely useful for the increased variance in terrain height. Depending on how good your engineering is, you could make some huge bridges to help span the gaps caused by huge cliffs, canyons, etc. Bypass rough mountain passes to make trade easier.

You're naturally going to get some incredible scenery, with the enormous mountains, cliffs, and waterfalls. Maybe you would get some really weird things like a sea that isn't level because it spans two conjoined islands at different heights, or a river that runs in a loop.

The large variations in height make trains much harder, since they can only handle pretty small inclines. Obviously this is a little past medieval tech. You could have trains for traversing mostly flat land, and something like an elevator or series of elevators using the floating platforms to move freight/people up large elevation changes, which then offloads into another train station for the next part of the trip. Works less well for extended mountain ranges or other places where there's substantial horizontal distance in addition to vertical distance.

In a much closer analogue to coastal erosion, you would want forests ringing every island and continent, so that soil doesn't wash away in the rain. I'm assuming that soil that goes over the sides eventually comes back through whatever means, but without something securing the soil, the edges of every floating landmass would be fairly barren.

Given the difficulty of making a stable platform, I would think ballistae would have the best range, but you're more limited on the structural damage you can cause. Carting the floating platforms on the ground means you can set up siege engines well in advance then float them into engagement range. Having floating platforms makes logistics a lot easier for an advancing army, because they need less horses to pull a given weight, and if they're fully floating then rough terrain is much easier to get through.

I would imagine for the large crystal complexes, you get something like the feeling of a large train passing, or the thrum of a large factory's boiler room, something almost more felt than heard. These are usually burred in layers of rock, so it's a vibration felt through your feet, but if encountered in the open it would be deafening.

*** The crystals apparently aren't precisely "antigravity", or else they would have been shot off into space by the planet's gravity. Since you're talking about island interactions resembling plate tectonics, it would suggest interactions mostly occurring along the surface of an imaginary sphere. This would suggest that you might have two mass-proportional forces in opposition to each other, with ordinary gravity plus a more rapidly diminishing force with a repulsive effect.

Regular gravity is the product of the masses divided by the square of the distance, times the gravitational constant, /G/. For the mass-proportional repulsion effect, let's say that the force diminishes with the cube of the distance.

Suppose that 'naked' crystals without islands normally rest at an altitude of 58,000 km above the planet's center, somewhere in its upper atmosphere. The planet has a mass of 5.0×10^{26} kg, similar to Saturn. At 58,000 km, the exerted downward force on a 1 kg mass would be a gentle 9.9 N. The upward force would also have to be about 9.9 N at this altitude, though in the opposite direction, so our anti-/G/ (/!G/) will be -/G/ × 5.8×10^{7} m, and the equation for the force would be F = /!G/ (mass1 × mass2)/distance^{3} .

Of course, there's actually a second mass-proportional force to consider, which causes everything near the crystals to clump up. Presumably, this diminishes even more rapidly with distance than the other force, so perhaps it diminishes with the fourth power of the distance (though this will be dangerous to get close to).

Let's say that a 1,000 kg sphere of the crystal can exert enough force to overcome gravity at an altitude of 58,000 km at a distance of 200 m. For a 1 kg object to experience 9.9 N at 200 m from that, our new /G/ (let's call it /Gᵦ/) would have to be equal to 1.584×10^{7} m^{5} ⋅ kg^{-1} ⋅ s^{-2} , and our new formula would be F = /Gᵦ/ × (mass1 × mass2)/distance^{4} , which, when we apply it to a 1 kg crystal at 58,000 km from the planet's center, works out to about 4.67 × 10^{-8} newtons, which is thankfully negligible.

So, if we join these formulae together, we get F = (/G/ × (mass1 × mass2)/distance^{2} ) + (/!G/ × (mass1 × mass2)/distance^{3} ) + (Gᵦ × (mass1 × mass2)/distance^{4} ). If you'd prefer some Python code to mess around with:

#+begin_example
  G1 = 6.6743e-11
  G2 = -G1 * 5.8 * 10**7
  G3 = 15840000.0
  def f (mass1, mass2, distance):
      m2 = mass1 * mass2
  return  G1*m2/distance**2 + G2*m2/distance**3 + G3*m2/distance**4
#+end_example

Messing around with this, I see that if I were just under 200 m below a 1,000 kg crystal, I'd start falling upward. If I were 170 m below a 1,000 kg crystal, I'd be in a zone where the upward force counters the downward force sufficiently to create close to 1 g of upward acceleration. By 155 m, that goes up to 2 g. At 145 m, it's an uncomfortable 3 g. Getting much closer than that would quickly become deadly. Don't get too close to large naked crystals.

As for smaller crystals, let's say I want to approach a 1 g crystal floating in the air. At 10 m, it only exerts 0.15 N per kg of my body mass. If there's an equal and opposite force, the crystal would be drawn to me with about 12 N of force. At 5 m, it's exerting 2.5 N per kg of my body mass, close to ¼ g on me, and absurdly rapid acceleration for it. At 1 cm from my skin, it's exerting 158 billion N of force per kg of my body mass. I'm instantly ripped apart, liquefied by absurd tidal forces comparable to a black hole. These crystals are nippy little bastards - make sure they have a decently-sized shell around them to make them safe to handle!

** So I just got done writing the prologue for my fic and I don't really know what to do with it. It's not too long (only 800 words or so) and it's also not terribly important for the immediate plot, it's more like light worldbuilding to signal that the fic (a fanfic of an original fic based on a fanfic, which is also a fanfic of a fanfic of another series) takes place in an AU that while similar on a surface level to the source material the main plot will go in a completely different direction.

Things which I like about it:

- Sets some of the themes that will come into play later on.

- Clarifies some inconsistencies present on the canon setting.

- Gets speculation started with regards to what happened between the past and the present.

- Gives a reasonable answer as to why the powerlevels are bound to get wack (I got rid of the asspull magic and stupid macguffins so people actually have to think and prepare a plan to deal with the BBEG that goes beyond 'find the Dragon Balls before the bad guy does and hope for the best').

- Foreshadows the genre shift down the line.

Things which I'm on the fence about:

- Some of the tech and terms on the prologue will likely come across as nonsense or technobabble.

- The event that takes place in the prologue kinda pushes suspension of disbelief because of how... loose the canon associations and powerlevels are. A god dies in it, except the 'god' is closer to the Entities from Worm in nature and it's not all powerful like most gods from religion usually are (which is what I guess most people will associate with the word 'God', hence thinking it shouldn't be able to be killed, therefore thinking the worldbuilding isn't well thought out, etc)

- The tone of the prologue is dark, which is to be expected from a creation/fall from grace myth, but still darker than 60-70% of the rest of the fic will be.

Possible solutions:

- Rewrite it so it's more vague and condensed.

- Rewrite it but make it so the darker tone/events are only implied.

- Repurpose the prologue as an interlude.

- Get rid of it then find a way to expose it throughout the story.

I'm considering all of these except the last one, one thing I noticed with regards to these kind of myths or events that happen in 'ancient times' is that it's very hard to present them in a way that is natural and not just 'side character destroys chapter's pacing to explain in rigorous detail an event that realistically they either would have no way of knowing or should be common knowledge by now'. I also think it's more fun if the readers and the characters know or have different beliefs with regards to how events played out, but I'm aware of how frustrating that can come across when handled poorly (which is why I'm trying to get this right).

Any tips or advice? I'm not losing sleep over this so I can settle for any thoughts or insights y'all might have with regards to prologues or info dumping in other books or fics.

Then, when I've reached a significant milestone, and go back to proof read and edit, I find the first couple chapters lackluster and give them a major overhaul/rewrite. I'd generally advise not to be too picky about the beginning (prologue or no) and just keep writing.
