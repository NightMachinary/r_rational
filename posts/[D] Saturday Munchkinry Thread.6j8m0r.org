Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** So I've watched some let's plays of danganronpa and I found it a very interesting concept. I mean, what would you do in the situation? For those who don't know, the basic rules are as shown:

Rule #1: People may reside only within the building. Leaving this area is an unacceptable use of time.

Rule #2: "Nighttime" is from 10 pm to 7 am. Some areas are off-limits at night.

Rule #3: Sleeping anywhere other than the dormitory will be punished accordingly.

Rule #4: With minimal restrictions, you are free to explore the building at your discretion.

Rule #5: Violence against "Monokuma" (the one trapping you there) is strictly prohibited, as is destruction of surveillance cameras.

Rule #6: Anyone who kills a fellow person and becomes "blackened" will be able to leave, unless they are discovered.

Rule #7: Additional school regulations may be added if necessary.

Rule #8: Once a murder takes place, a trial will begin shortly thereafter, with time given for gathering evidence. Participation is mandatory for all surviving persons.

Rule #9: If the guilty party is exposed during the trial, they alone will be executed.

Rule #10: If the guilty party is not exposed, they alone will be able to leave, and all remaining persons will be executed.

Rule #11: Lending your "e-Handbook" (which has the list of rule, is necessary to enter certain areas, and holds evidence that is discovered) to another person is strictly prohibited.

Rule #12: The guilty party may only kill a maximum of two people.

Rule #13: Attempting to break into locked rooms is strictly prohibited.

If any of these rules are broken, the rule breaker is executed.

So my question is this: what is the rational method for surviving (or escaping)? Everything is provided for, but you have to go to the cafeteria to get food, for example. In this case, let's say you are trapped with 15 others, all around your age, with a 50/50 gender split.

I don't think a successful trial necessarily means everyone who is not the murderer gets to leave. In your proposed situation, after the trial is done, the only thing that's changed is that there is one less person.

*** I can think of three classes of scenarios describing how you end up in this situation. The first is that you are unexpectedly kidnapped by the crazy person running this and they appear to be running things with conventional technology. The second is that you are unexpectedly forced into this situation by an apparently supernatural force. In both of these cases you do not have a strong reason to believe that the rules that are handed to you will actually be followed by Monokuma. That rule #7 is explicitly written to allow Monokuma to change the rules only gives more reason to not expect them to be obeyed by Monokuma. In particular, although within the rules of the game rule #10 is the only way to escape alive, there is no way for you to witness somebody else successfully apply it. Attempting to take advantage of it yourself is a big risk with a small chance of success, so I don't recommend it.

Instead, I believe the best option is simply to try and survive, wait to be rescued, and covertly seek opportunities to escape. Unless I underestimate how much peoples' character changes in extreme situations, I don't expect anybody to murder anybody else for years, and you have a decent chance of living out the rest of your natural lifespan, during which time there are lots of chances of new development: Monokuma changing the rules in cruel and arbitrary ways, being rescued, someone discovering a way to escape.

The third scenario for how you end up in this situation is that some world developments lead to you recognize situations analogous this one as things that actually happen from time to time and to become confident that in situations like this the rules will actually be followed as stated. In that case the same evidence that convinces you the rules will be followed should also give useful information on what to expect to happen in this sort of situation. More details on this evidence is necessary to give advice.

Imagine a Flatlander with an eyestalk extending into the third dimension, allowing him to look down and see inside nearby objects. This power is the same, but a dimension higher.

*** The problem with 4d vision is we don't have it. Each eye gives us a 2 dimensional image of a 3 dimensional universe. An eyestalk in the 4th dimension would have to have a 3d retina. Now try imagining having a 3d retina, where you could look at an image of a human being inside and out, seeing all cross-sections at the same time. How to do this? Maybe you could send to the optic nerve all the cross sections in a grid, and eventually the brain will figure it out, in a similar way to how if you put on [[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down][goggles]] that turn everything upside down, you get used to it, and then everything looks upside down when the goggles are removed.

** You have gained the supernatural ability to move objects with your mind, a.k.a. telekinesis. The accuracy/strength/dexterity/sensitivity/etc. of your telekinesis is exactly the same as if you are using your hand to move objects.

However! This ability is defective: it nullifies itself whenever someone else detects it. So if someone sees you levitating stuff, that stuff stops levitating. If someone hears you telekinetically bashing an object against the wall, your telekinetic grip on that object is released. If someone feels you telekinetically trying to move them, that telekinetic force is dispelled. If someone so much as thinks "Hey you're doing magic!" your telekinetic magic is immediately nullified (until they stop thinking it).

How do you exploit this ability?

Sneaky telekinises offers him a range of options he didn't have available before. Including picking up that gun just out of reach that nobody is watching.

All great ideas O_O. Due to the range limitation, the second one might be hard, but still better than trying to do it using your actual hands. The third one seems pretty doable if you know how the door is locked, though maybe not for all doors.

And yes, you can totally lift yourself! Not others because of the detection rule, but yourself is totally doable! Well, assuming you can lift yourself with your own hands (like a pull-up), which is typically doable with training and keeping your body weight low. So yes, you can use it as a limited form of flight (limited because you do get exhausted from all the pulling-up, not to mention the balancing of your body weight would provide some interesting challenges).

That said, it seems like a pretty dangerous thing to do. After all, if someone so much as sees you floating in the sky, your ability self-nullifies, and you fall to your death x_x.

You would have to work out your telekinetic hand to strengthen it, and it strengthens/exhausts the same way as your normal hands. So you can't use a prosthetic since that just replaces your regular hands, not your telekinetic one.

Yes for the first one, if anyone so much as thinks you specifically are doing something supernatural, you stop being able to do anything supernatural until they stop thinking/believing it. The second one no, because they are just discussing the power, they don't think that you specifically have that power.

#+begin_quote
  There are no pain receptors inside the brain. Can I squish it?

No, the point of all these defects is to make it almost impossible to prove to someone that you can do telekinesis. Your telekinetic force can't be directly applied on any sentient being, nor can it be used in ways that allow a sentient being to observe you using them. You can throw stuff at them while hidden, but the fact that your telekinetic force is as strong as your hand means people will just think you used your hand to throw the stuff. You can record it on camera, but then the fact that you can't do in front of them what you did on camera makes it really suspicious whether its a hoax. And even on the off-chance that you do convince someone, the very fact that they believe you have a supernatural ability prevents you from using your supernatural ability.

#+end_quote

It would feel as though you are sticking your hand in a fire, so it would hurt a lot. But since your telekinetic hand isn't made of carbon like your real hand, it won't actually burn. So it would just feel as if you are touching something extremely hot. Very painful, but as long as you can endure the pain, yes you can use telekinesis to hurl globs of burning material around.

#+begin_quote

Huh. I actually didn't think of this one. I'll say yes, but the fingerprints won't match your physical hands, since it's a different "hand" that's doing the telekinesis.

I'm not sure I understand this question. If you're asking if you can hold a hammer in your real hand and then telekinetically manifest a telekinetic hammer to drive in a nail, the answer is no. If you want to hammer nails with telekinesis, you have to pick up a hammer with your telekinetic hand and use it.

You could potentially grow your own custom neural material, but using existing humans to do computing for you, without them knowing or being any worse for the wear is rather implausible.\\
Of course the whole matrix premise in general is based on the implausible idea that human minds would somehow be able to reject a paradise simulation (if you're considering a fanfic I assume you've seen the animatrix) and you'd really need to bend over backwards to come up with reasons for them to keep unwitting humans in an ancestor simulation.

****** I haven't seen the animatrix. But I've read the wiki page on what happened before the movies.

I've decided that the processing part is basically an unconscious hijack of the brain. Most of the time, the brain is processing what the Matrix wants it to process. (Bitcoin mining, anyone?) A small percentage of the time, the brain is processing virtual senses and making memories and doing what's natural. The consequence of this is that time in the Matrix is slower than it is in the real world. This also /might/ allow the possibility for someone, either by hacking or being the One or something, to realize how shitty the Matrix's framerate is and learn how to dodge bullets. Although that might require the passage of Matrix time to be like, .1% of realtime? So maybe, not dodge bullets, but at least dodge fists and other stuff. Even at 10% realtime, humans would live for hundreds if not thousands of real years, hooked up to the Matrix, and experience a 80 year lifetime. Also, after Neo's spent a few days in there trying to find the Oracle, when he comes out of it it's already Christmas.

Why is the Matrix a simulation of the 21st century and not losing your virginity with your soulmate 24/7? Either for historical purposes, or so they can torture those who didn't assist in creating the Machines. Or both.

Why are there humans outside of the Matrix? Because there was a malfunction, or a robot human sympathizer helped them out, or somebody found an exploit, broke the laws of physics, and managed to wake himself up before an AI detected his hacking and shut his brain down. Or maybe there's something else going on that I will come up with later that's more interesting than the whole The One fiasco for gorrilla glueing the issue of humans randomly waking up.

Oh and in my Matrix universe, the Machines darkened the sky. Which is cool for them, because they designed it to /actually capture all the solar energy for them/, instead of just darkening the Sun to kill everything.

That was hard. Maybe I should write a rational Terminator instead.

******* Having humans actually spend most their time does processing for the machines that they're not aware of is actually pretty clever. However human brains aren't very versatile general purpose computers so what it makes sense to use them for is going to be pretty limited. So during the periods you don't remember the machines ought to have you doing some sort of task that humans are far better at than the presumably stupid AI (if they weren't dumb intelligence explosion would wreck your setting).\\
Also it's unclear what exactly you mean by the time dilation, but it can't be a general slowdown of the brain because human brains just don't have the ability to run at slower speeds (again they're not versatile in the same ways as computers) so people will have to be either prevented from remembering what happens when they're used by the machines (anterograde amnesia) or memory wiped.\\
Admittedly this could be cool because it could possibly mean that people could in theory remembering the other level of the simulation where the AI's force them to work on various problems and potentially forcefully alter their mind to make them more efficient (also this sort of thing would mean the AI would want to likely select for extremely clever humans for efficiencies sake).

Historical purposes doesn't really make any sense (if they're human enough to care about running ancestor sims that doesn't fit well with them being inferior to humans in the ways that stop intelligence explosions and keep humans useful). As for punishment that would require a bizzare level of spitefulness once you get past the first generation of people who were alive before the machine uprising. However even if you accept that, using the current world as a punishment is weird. Since the suffering is sort of weirdly stratified and semi-random and again what would lead one to decide that this particular era just happens to be the best for that or really any purpose other than ancestor sim?\\
That's sort of the main issue, if they care enough about us to even let us have a sim in the first place then it's hard to imagine a criterion by which this particular era would be ideal.

I think to some extent the AI in the Matrix are friendly, which is why they aren't exterminating us or, say, killing anyone outside of the matrix and raising those in the matrix in a simulated "environment" of processing random shit for dopamine that's so far from reality they would have a seizure if they woke up. No, these machines have individuals and society, and maybe even feelings. They did a nice thing for humanity by improving the economyand then some greedy humans didn't like that and a war started. Now the Machines keep us in the Matrix mainly for defensive purposes, so they include a simulation of a normal life and they even /allow/ a few of us to live in the real world under a tight watch. Morpheus is /allowed/ to free a limited number of people from the Matrix, and Neo is not flushed down the toilet and rescued, he's carried right to Morpheus.

And if you want a sense of bleakness and extinction without the ridiculous blocking of the Sun, what if the Machines /removed the atmosphere/? Maximum sunlight for them, and you get a landscape of dead rock under a constantly dark but starry sky. I think that's better than constant storming like in the movies.

** You /somehow/ stumble across a magic spell, one you can teach to others, one that allows for portals. Portals that you can power from the electrical power grid, but there are caveats:

1.  Portals are always created in pairs. They don't need to be attached to anything.
2.  The creation of a portal costs significantly more energy than keeping it open.
3.  More distance being covered increases energy demands exponentially ( E ≈ 4/3 x π x distance^{3} ). Yes, that formula is intentional, because
4.  Portals act like two opposite points on the surface of a sphere, and traversing matter/information takes a random path between those points.
5.  The space between portals can be filled with anything you want, the portals don't care, they remain open, unless
6.  Another portal is opened up between the two existing ones.
7.  These sphere's are forcefully terminated when overlapping with another portal pair's sphere.
8.  Disruption of a sphere leads to currently traversing information/matter being semi-uniformly distributed on a molecular level across the sphere's real world coordinates.
9.  Traversal of portals takes no subjective time.
10. Assume energy cannot be generated ex nihilo this way, there's no harnessing of potential energy or other shenanigans.
11. Also assume that you can only traverse a portal at certain speeds or whatever physics would be necessary

Sure, if you can arrange it well you could dispose of all kinds of things this way, but what would this allow for on larger, geopolitical scales?

The economic usage depends on how difficult it would be to disrupt, and how easy it is to prevent disruption, which depend on the power requirements.

2. Rules 8 and 9 appear to be contradictory. If there is no travel time, how can any matter be "currently traversing"?

3. Can the spell be cast mechanically, or does it require a human to cast?

Eh, how about 1 kW sustained power draw for a portal 1 km distant, and the initial cost would be 100 times that. This is totally arbitrary, of course. I mean, going with these numbers that Earth-Moon-Portal would draw about 150 terawatts (or 64 times average global power consumption) for continuous use.

Take a long distance, e.g. to the moon. You enter the portal, and a fraction of a second later, as seen by an outside observer, someone creates a small portal at the L1 point. Both portals blink out, but you're suddenly uniformly distributed in a sphere a light second across. Keep in mind, this requires coincidence or planning; you can't send a signal for someone to create a portal in reaction to entering one yourself, you'd move as fast as the signal.

See, this is what I want, think I hadn't though of myself. Thank you for that :)

Now let me think. Hm... You know, this is a really good point. Now I wonder if the portals could be gigantic, yet close to each other, relatively speaking. But that way lays exploits, methinks. Hm...

How about, if the portals themselves were spherical, they couldn't touch. So the minimum distance is double their radius, and the portals on both sides themselves are by definition the same size.

#+begin_quote
  Do the portals require power/machinery on both sides, or only one? What happens if the generator powering the portal passes through the portal?
#+end_quote

No, it can be powered from one side. And if you shove the power generator sustaining the portal into the portal, the portal is disrupted and the generator dispersed.

--------------

Sorry, [[/u/Gurkenglas]] (love the name), my bad.

I already explicitly vetoed killing physics or everyone, so that's nothing to be worried about. As for gravity wells... Traversing the portal draws more/less power for when you're leaving the gravity well, or moving up, or get an increase in tangential force (as related to latitude).

This means, going from the North pole to the equator draw more power. Going from the seafloor to Mt Everest draws more power. Going from your place to space, well, congratulations, you're falling down, unless you happen to be orbiting at geostationary orbit.

Hm... this orbit thing is something worth looking into.

***** Ah, got it. I had been thinking of portal usage as instantaneous, not subject to lightspeed delay.

I have mostly been assuming that knowledge of portal generation will eventually leak to all involved parties.

- Small portals are the way to maximize usage. By having a long series of short hops, you can pass the majority of your journal through portals, while minimizing the volume covered and power usage.

- Subway tunnels are about 10 meters in diameter, which would make the minimum hop be 10 meters in distance. This would be about 1 W of power per jump. With jumps placed every 20 meter, transit time would be reduced by a factor of 2, as half the distance would be covered by portals. For a subway system the size of New York City's, this would increase power usage by about 20 kW, a trivial increase on top of its ~500 MW current usage.

- Long-distance passenger travel remains unchanged, as planes cannot take advantage of this. A plane could project a portal in front of itself, but could not travel through it without disbursing the portal.

- Portable disruption of service would be trivial to do. A laptop battery could provide ~100 W for an hour. This would be enough to maintain a 450 meter portal, or to initiate a 100 meter portal. Carrying one into a subway, or even above a subway, would be enough to take it entirely out of service.

- Subway lines could protect themselves by having more portals than necessary. There are the portals that the subways travel through, and then there are also many small portals set up around the subway. These portals would re-initialize themselves over and over, so that any intruder portals would short-circuit these first, rather than the primary portals. If any of the security portals go down, the subway system is halted and an investigation begins.

- Further protection could be done by activating portals repeatedly. Each time the subway is going through a portal, activate the portal once to disable any other portals in the area, then activate it again to use. It would increase power usage, but would avoid disruption by non-sanctioned portals.

- Country level disruption wouldn't be possible. The largest power station, the Three Gorges Dam, outputs 22.5 GW. If that were used in its entirety to open a portal, it would only go about 60 km. No way to make a portal sphere encompassing the Earth to disrupt portals across the world.

You can definitely research malaria charities and experts, on your phone.

A online database of strategies for common tasks could be helpful. (WikiHow?) I'll take a look and see what I can find and/or think about making and running it myself.

Alternatively, a real expert-finding app for networking might be helpful (LinkedIn?).

Still, that feels like offloading my thinking to others (which can be good, but slightly misses the point of the exercise) rather than the phone helping me think better. How could it help you achieve expertise, if no one had ever looked at malaria before?

I'm confused and I need to find better words for this. I don't think I'm communicating the concept I have very well. Some of my confusion is in the word 'thinking' -- if I break things down into memory, communication, research, understanding, planning, calculating, and awareness of time, then it becomes obvious that it actually is helpful.

Another way to accomplish this is an entirely sound-based interface. (Sight has to be focused in a direction - sound can be heard no matter where it is, so it's a better sense to interface with when the person's attention is elsewhere). But there's two halves to an interface; having the phone talk to you is easy. Ideally, you still have to provide input to the phone. Now, for something like a GPS system, the input is provided (through an attention-stealing eye/touch interface) almost entirely at the start of the journey; and then audio output is provided until the destination is reached.

One solution to applications that need on-the-spot input without stealing attention is an audio-only input. Modern phones are halfway there - I can tap on the bar at the bottom of my phone, drag, and input a voice query prefaced with "OK Google" to get a Google-search response. Now I just need to be able to turn that on without looking at my phone.

(Mind you, the direct neural interface would be more useful than a pure-audio one. But not, I think, /that/ much more useful - the pure-audio interface has the look of something with a fair degree of untapped potential)
