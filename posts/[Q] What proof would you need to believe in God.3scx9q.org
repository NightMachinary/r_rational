To begin with, I'm asking this out of curiosity because I want to see the discussion, not as an attempt to convert anyone. Yahweh, God, or Allah: What proof would you need to be convinced that God is real, as opposed to an advanced alien trying to trick you, or your own insane mind?


** An exorbitant amount.

It'd be comparatively easy to prove that a godlike being exists when compared to the amount of evidence it'd take to prove a God from the Abrahamic religions does in fact exist.

A godlike being could convince me of its power by preforming actions which either breaks the laws of physics as I currently understand it (assuming that I am capable of seeing through any 'tricks' to fake the abilities) or feats which are impossible for current level of technology.

Note that the above cases are distinguishing between supernatural abilities, or highly advanced aliens.

However for the existence of a religious God, my requirements simplifies to treating religion like any other scientific hypothesis and finding evidence to support it. The main reason why religion isn't considered to be scientific is because the existence of God can't be falsified. But if God exists and there is evidence of God's existence, then we can apply the scientific method to proving God's existence.

After all of that, it'd boil down to me deciding between the existence of God, or me living in some stimulation of the universe with a construct of God. Evidence sufficient to convince me of a God as described by Judaism, Christianity, Muslim, or others of a similar type would require events such as religious prophecies coming true, priests/rabbi/mullah developing genuine abilities which can't be replicated by science in any form, *AND* the revelation of a valid argument for how an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent God could exist while allowing the current state of the world to occur.

I didn't think I'd find a good answer to that question. But then I read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][this]]. (Although I still don't believe for the other reasons you list):

#+begin_quote
  Job asked: “God, why do bad things happen to good people? Why would You, who are perfect, create a universe filled with so much that is evil?”

  Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, saying “WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSE WOULD YOU PREFER ME TO HAVE CREATED?”

  Job said “A universe that was perfectly just and full of happiness, of course.”

  “OH,” said God. “YES, I CREATED ONE OF THOSE. IT'S EXACTLY AS NICE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT.”

  Job facepalmed. “But then why would You also create this universe?”

  Answered God: “DON'T YOU LIKE EXISTING?”

  “Yes,” said Job, “but all else being equal, I'd rather be in the perfectly just and happy universe.”

  “OH, DON'T WORRY,” said God. “THERE'S A VERSION OF YOU IN THAT UNIVERSE TOO. HE SAYS HI.”

  “Okay,” said Job, very carefully. “I can see I'm going to have to phrase my questions more specifically. Why didn't You also make this universe perfectly just and happy?”

  “BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO IDENTICAL INDIVIDUALS. IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF IDENTITY, THEN TWO PEOPLE WHOSE EXPERIENCE IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SATURATED BY BLISS ARE JUST ONE PERSON. IF I MADE THIS UNIVERSE EXACTLY LIKE THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE, THEN THERE WOULD ONLY BE THE POPULATION OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE, WHICH WOULD BE LESS GOOD THAN HAVING THE POPULATION OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE PLUS THE POPULATION OF ONE EXTRA UNIVERSE THAT IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT HAPPY.”

  “Hmmmmm. But couldn't You have have made this universe like the happy and just universe except for one tiny detail? Like in that universe, the sun is a sphere, but in our universe, the sun is a cube? Then you would have individuals who experienced a spherical sun, and other individuals who experienced a cubic sun, which would be enough to differentiate them.”

  “I DID THAT TOO. I HAVE CREATED ALL POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE AND ITS POPULACE.”

  “All of them? That would be...a lot of universes.”

  “NOT AS MANY AS YOU THINK.” said God. “IN THE END IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONLY ABOUT 10^{10^(10^(10^(10^{984}}))). AFTER THAT I RAN OUT OF POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF UNIVERSES THAT COULD REASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND JUST. SO I STARTED CREATING ONES INCLUDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF EVIL.”

  “Small amounts! But the universe has...”

  “I WAS NOT REFERRING TO YOUR UNIVERSE. I EXHAUSTED THOSE, AND THEN I STARTED CREATING ONES INCLUDING IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF EVIL.”

  “Oh.” Then: “What, exactly, is Your endgame here?”

  “I AM OMNIBENEVOLENT. I WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH HAPPINESS AND JOY AS POSSIBLE. THIS REQUIRES INSTANTIATING ALL POSSIBLE BEINGS WHOSE TOTAL LIFETIME HAPPINESS IS GREATER THAN THEIR TOTAL LIFETIME SUFFERING.” ...

**** That argument almost works to convince me that a moral God can exist and still allow evil to occur. It just means God has decided that it's more important to have a large quantity of goodness even if it allows a small amount of evil over a small amount of good with no evil at all.

I wouldn't agree with the morality of such a God, but it works well enough to convince me that a benevolent (by my standards) God can exist and still allow the current world to exist. Congratulations! You have convinced someone on the Internet!

Of course, this brings up the question can a objective moral system exist where it is considered good from every individual's subjective perspective?

This is a hard problem in logic and philosophy where you can have different axiomatic systems which are each internally consistent, but disagree with each other.

Note that I'm distinguishing between a God who follows a moral system (especially one we can understand and agree with) which seems to be the type you are describing, and a God who is perceived as 'good' by every single sapient being which every religion uses to persuade people by saying "You can't question God, He's perfect in every possible way! Never mind that it's logically impossible!".

****** I'm not entirely sure, but I think the point that the argument is making is that God is only allowing our current universe to exist is because God has already created all other possible universes which are more 'good' from an objective point and if our universe is any more 'good', it'd be identical to one of the other universes already created.

  The need for many universes seems like they are existing only for us to compare against.

Although....it brings up the interesting scenario, is there any reason for God to have created our particular current universe, assuming that there is only ever exactly one universe?

That doesn't make sense to me. What does it mean to integrate over multiple moralities? Also, there is no guarantee that it's even possible to reconcile different moral systems.

For example, our culture considers cannibalism to be a deeply unethical act (barring circumstances where both people would starve to death otherwise). However, there have been other cultures throughout history who considered it to be a necessary ethical behavior to eat the flesh of our ancestors once they have passed on out of a 'life is a cycle' style philosophy.

How do you reconcile two moral systems who have opposite opinions of the same action?

******* When he says 'integrate over all the subjective moralities' I believe he's just saying to take the average over everyone's individual subjective morality. I can't write it well in reddit's markup, but take its own actions, and sum how moral those are perceived to be by EVERYONE, and divide by number of people judging you.

In your example of cannibalism (good choice, btw), a 'omnibenevolent' being would seek to maximize their total moral character as seen by everyone - thus, if more people think allowing cannibalism is morally abhorrent than not, it is not allowed.

Caveat to all the prior: I don't actually agree with this as a sound moral framework, as it inevitably leads to tyranny of the majority extending to definitions of morals. It is, however, an interesting model, and one I can see a bit of in society as a whole; once something gets majority approval, it ceases to be morally repugnant for that society.

There is exactly one moral system defined by M2 = -f(x), the function of an agent who would be seen as pure perfect evil under M1. (and to it, agents operating under M1 would be seen as pure perfect evil)

Any summing or averaging or integrating of all possible moral systems seems like it would produce a function that calls every possible action morally neutral, ie 0.

Eh, I don't really think anything can be considered to be non-scientific. Basically all proofs made outside of axiomatic systems, are going to be probabilistic.

If we pick another hypothesis like: 'the sky is green'. Then if we observe evidence to the contrary, I can make a hypothesis to explain the new data such as: 'the Illuminati hypnotised everyone'. Even though we might scoff at it and call it a rationalization, it is still a valid hypothesis.

The only difference between 'the sky is green' and 'god exists' is the number of people willing to support it. So it's not the hypothesis which is non-scientific it's just people not acting rationally.

**** While I agree with you that scientific methods can help us estimate the probability of God's existence, /technically/ only falsifiable theories can be scientific theories. God's existence is famously unfalsifiable, since religious people like to point out that if God exists (and is omnipotent) he can easily confound any tool used to look for him. While that's true, it's an extremely cheap argument to try to explain the lack of God around us. To me at least, it's a clear sign that religious people are starting to give up, how the mighty have fallen.

***** Ah, just to head off communication issues before they happen, I should mention that I'm an agnost. With that said, I feel like you should avoid statements like: "how the mighty have fallen". It needlessly polarizes a discussion, and is basically acting anti-rationally.

Aside from that, I do not believe falsifiability to be a necessary condition, for the scientific method to be applicable. As I stated above, that limitation would restrict the domain of science, to axiomatic systems; and while we all agree that math is the foundation of science, I do not think anyone would say it is it's sum total.

So, if I'm understanding your thoughts correctly (which you may correct me on, if I am not). You believe religion to be non-scientific, on account of the inability to use evidence to refute it. But the same can be said for any other hypothesis, in the same vein as the story of the Dragon in the Garage ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/]]).

The point I was getting at in my previous post, is that, in order to gain information one needs to make certain assumptions. An example of a common assumption is Occam's razor, but one can make alternate assumptions (Such as, a religious one). How you treat evidence, is dependent on this perspective.

Under this guise one can think of rationality, as a sort of meta level assumption. In words it would be something like: 'I will assume that which will increase my expected utility, by the largest amount'. Which means people who hold a /belief in belief/, are generally acting irrationally.

Now, it is my personal *opinion*, that arguments in favour of religion are as irrational, as arguments in favour of the sky being green. But under another set of assumptions, I could be made to believe otherwise. This does not affect the applicability of gathering evidence, either for or against a hypothesis, it only reflects my personal assumptions. So as per my previous post, it isn't the hypothesis which is non-scientific, it is the people.

Really? That wasn't my intention at all, I only meant it as a commentary on how organised religions have gone from being dominant world powers to the lesser position they have today.

#+begin_quote

Well, this right here is the root of the matter then. By definition, scientific claims must be falsifiable (they must make predictions that can be tested), otherwise it is not scientific.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I know religion to be non-scientific, and I disagree that this can be said about any other hypothesis, though it can be said about some. For instance, my statement /the sun will rise before 07:00 tomorrow morning/ makes a prediction and is quite testable. The claim /there's a dragon in my garage/ (without modifiers) is also testable, and thus subject to scientific inquiry, but the claim /there's a dragon in my garage and there is absolutely no way to tell/ is not. I hope that explains the point.

The fact that God's existence isn't a scientific hypothesis means that it's hard to gather strong evidence against it, but it also means that the claim in itself is "weak" in the sense that it isn't very useful. After all, what's the point of knowledge if it can't be applied to other knowledge in some way, such as making predictions?

Now comes the part where I think we will agree: the fact that God's existence can't be directly tested means that we can't acquire any hard knowledge on the matter, but that doesn't mean we can't make an estimate with educated guesses. So, we can assign some sort of probability (or rather an interval of probabilities) to the existence of God, not because it is a scientific hypothesis but because it is a statement about our world, and they can all be assigned some probabilities. The key point here is that our guesses about non-scientific claims will be much more loose than our guesses about scientific statements, all other things being equal, which is mirrored in the width of the probability interval. With the specific case about God we do have an advantage; we have a very long period of data to review. Nowhere in recorded history is there any evidence for God's existence, which do give our estimation some strength simply by virtue of a lot of correlated data.

AFAIK, "Science" is a method to determine better/best/good questions. Ideally, you can use information theory and Science! to determine the "question which will teach you the most" (information quotient), although I don't think that's usually possible. Still, ideals to strive for and all that.

As such, non-falsifiable claims aren't useful (scientific) because they cannot result in questions with answers.

Note that this means Science! can be applied to subjective things, which is pretty cool (it's just that the subjective learning can't be applied to other people).

In general, propositions can often be /either/ proven or falsified, not both. The existence of things can be proven if they are found, but are hard to falsify since we might not have found them yet. Scientific theories are never proven, but are used as long as no one has successfully falsified them by finding enough discordant data to convince the consensus of scientists in that field. Even when falsified, a scientific theory might be usable under certain conditions: the case with Isaac Newton's laws is one of the most obvious ones. Einstein's theory of relativity successfully falsified Newton's earlier theory, and showed that Newton's laws doesn't always work when describing the movement of an object. However, Newton's formulae are much simpler, so if one is considering a thrown tennis ball (that moves significantly slower than light) everyone still uses the old way.

I'm not incredibly familiar with the rationalist community but I haven't seen anyone yet talk about the falsifiability vs. verifiability distinction. As you say, what makes a hypothesis "scientific" is that it is falsifiable. But try to create a falsification test that I exist. You cannot, one because to disprove my existence you would need to search the entire universe and not find me and two because I do, in fact, exist. Like my existence, any hypothesis seeking to prove God's existence must be a test of verification. Am I making any sense?

If my argument stands, then searching for God using the scientific method would a bit like looking for a rose while wearing rose colored glasses. You're excluding the possibility of finding it by the method you're employing.

I could be wanting information of many kinds.

Like I can ask a question "is there a shape of matter which obstructs moving sticks through it that matches your shape definition?" that is easier to falsify and test.

To be more specific and even more broken down I can test "Is there a shape of matter defined as you that obstructs me moving a stick through it which is actually in reach of my stick poking?"

We can break down to simpler or move on to different discrete tests for the capabilities/properties of 'things' like 'god' and 'you' until we run out of attention, resources or questions that are useful.

**** FOR EVERYONE - Here's a good [[http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=312][link]] that better sums up the difference between falsification and verification for anyone reading this who may be confused.

FOR RATIONALFIDEISM - You are right that proving your non-existence is difficult because it requires searching the entire universe for you or evidence of your existence (for example this post is sufficient to prove you exist even though I have never seen you in person). It is only after searching the entire universe (or just planet since you are assumed to be human) that I can actually say that you don't officially exist.

However, the above paragraph has detailed an entire procedure for how I can conceivably prove the statement 'Rationalfidiesm doesn't exist'. When it comes to God, there is no test that I can even conceive of to prove to people that God doesn't exist. It's only the fact that we have never found evidence of God weakly proves the statement 'God doesn't exist' (I know other people think they have found proof, but I don't consider anything in religion to be evidence).

To clarify further, let's do a thought experiment. Pretend for a moment that a subatomic physicist has been thrown to the ancient past of humanity around 100 B.C. There is no way for him to recreate any of his physics experiments to prove his knowledge due to lacking the advance technology to prove it. Yet he can still imagine some theoretical test which doesn't violate any laws of physics (otherwise it'd be just a thought experiment), making his knowledge falsifiable.

It basically boils down to whether or not that there exists some potential test to disprove your statement (regardless of the feasibility of your test) that determines whether or not the statement is falsifiable.

***** Let me rephrase the question for you:

A being claiming to be the God of the (Torah/Bible/Koran) appears, and he wants to convince you of his identity without manipulating your mind and solely by providing whatever evidence you request. His goal is to honestly convince you of his identity by argument and evidence. You may demand any proof you can think of that could convince you that he is who he claims to be. He won't use his power to "cheat" in any way, unless you specifically ask him to supernaturally change your mind. What proof do you ask for?

****** Tricky. The God of the Torah/Bible/Koran is all over the place as far as what the documentation describes, there isn't just one non-contradictory description that can be distilled out of that.

I suppose I could ask it to let me into Heaven. Heaven is usually where God is described as keeping all the most Godly stuff. If Heaven's nice enough I might just go ahead and concede the argument so I can stay there. Conversely if it sucks I could try to take a look at what the competition has to offer downstairs. :)

That's a little cheaty, though, and if this is really God it's supposed to be able to see through such "I'll believe if you pay me well enough" approaches. In fact, it's often described as getting a bit cross when such arguments are attempted.

Hm... Honestly? I think this is the real best approach: get a team of experts on the subject. I'm really not well qualified to judge this personally, but I've generally found that the scientific community does a good job in the long run. So I'll tell "God" that I'll believe it when the overwhelming majority of the scientific community has become convinced it's telling the truth. I'd then send it off to go do its best to argue its case to the various scientists and researchers of the world and see how it goes. The physics community is probably the most important subset of those since they're down into the basics of how reality works.

Ultimately, this is how I would answer /most/ questions about things that are well outside my areas of expertise - turn the actual experts loose on the question and see what their consensus is once they settle on one.

Put into those terms, I guess the answer is "nothing", even if it does succeed, it could still be a trick.

In practice, I doubt I would be as thoroughly rigorous.

Let's try this one on for size:

- The Catholic church, the Anglican church, all the various denominations or protestants and pseudo-protestants, they all shed the 2000 years of obvious nonsense that have been layered on top of their religions, stripping everything from Saul's letters onwards out of their holy books, and the Council of Nicea is undone.
- Priests that are insufficiently Christ-like spontaneously leave the church and take up secular occupations.
- Prayer is unambiguously answered, laying on of hands actually heals people, and so on.

I don't think I'd remain skeptical in that situation. And, hey, that's how things are supposed to be, right?

But it would certainly be one /step/ towards proving there is a God; my estimate for the chance of God existing would be a lot higher after that.

If the entity were to then explain how many apparently incoherent philosophical claims made by religions really were coherent after all, my estimate would go even higher. Likewise if science suddenly started finding evidence that religious texts predicted things about the real world that could not possibly have been known or guessed by the authors.

At some point, the evidence would be so good that I would agree that there is a God, even though

********* Consider a multiversal approach to your idea of going back in time to kill yourself.

Physicists like to make thought experiments within a multiverse approach. Where being every choice on the quantum level makes a universe with every possible quantum state. Now think about that from a linear time traveller.

As soon as the time traveller decides to go back in time they are creating an endless amount of possibility, (if the standard model holds true) thus anything they are /going/ to do, as in actions in their own personal future on a linear time scale, will create the universes necessary to accomplish any task regardless how improbable the time traveller's actions may be. This universe creation includes futures where the time traveller travels back in time to kill themselves.

However since the time travelling happened in the future from when the time traveller decided to go into the past, then travelling into the past is not necessarily in the same universe, maybe the time traveller was shunted into another universe.

Even if it was the same universe that the time traveller traveled into the past to, as soon as the time traveller kills their past self, then the time traveller may be shunted into a new quantum reality the moment when they've killed their past self. A universe where this very thing has happened.

Now framing this into the original idea of an omnipotent God. Perhaps the omnipotent God exists across and maybe even outside all multiverses simultaneously, reasonably an omnipotent God could create, destroy and alter all realities and itself. Could an omnipotent God create an object that God couldn't destroy? Yes, and no: at the same time. It depends on the scope of perspective really.

Could God create a universe where it sets the rules for itself that it cannot destroy objects? If God is omnipotent then yes, it could. An omnipotent God would be able to limit it's omnipotence without limit, but still retain omnipotence.

Sort of like Schrodinger's cat, the wave function is only collapsed when an outside perspective is inteoduced making either the yes or the no true. However if God's Perspective is the only perspective in a universe where the omnipotent God limited its omnipotence and created an object it couldn't destroy, then from the singular perspective that is true, that object cannot be destroyed by God.

Though that's just in that particular singular reality. If you are asking the blanket statement of "can an omnipotent God create an object it cannot destroy" then that answer should be yes. But that does not mean the omnipotent God is not omnipotent, just that there was a self-imposed restriction of omnipotence by making multiple realities where in one reality the answer was yes, and another reality is no.

However, since, as I don't anticipate any removed limbs of mine to be able to be replaced, I have no incentive to put any putative deities to the test by removing one of my limbs and having them replace it, I came up with an equivalent test: Just have me grow a new limb, in a fashion current science couldn't manage. A nice, long tail would be ideal.

(Why yes, I did suggest to certain people that if they wanted me to avoid the pains of hellfire for not believing as they did, that they should pray for me to grow a lovely tail. I have no idea whether any of them actually did or not.)

**** Not by itself, no. But remember, just as every theory needs to pay rent in anticipated experiences, every question has to pay rent by letting you change your behaviour depending on the answer. If a putative deity can't do at /least/ one small miracle on demand, then I have no reason to put said deity to further questioning. Thus, growing a tail is a particular example of a class of miracles, the demonstration of any one of which would be necessary to start considering further questions and evidence, even if, on their own, they are insufficient to differentiate between God and aliens.

Having heard of various stories where someone demanded, "Prove your power by doing X!", and having X demonstrated to the demander's sorrow, out of that class of miracles I simply picked one that had the combination of highest predictive power (as in, being incredibly unlikely to happen without Something Unusual going on) and the least likelihood of my regretting it should it actually happen (ie, I'm reasonably confident that I could live a happy life with such a tail).

This particular piece of evidence also has the interesting property of, very likely, being time-limited; in that, depending on certain advancements in various possible technologies - robotics and cybernetics and human-computer interfaces, or biotechnology, or uploading minds into software form with customizable virtual bodies - then me living with a tail may turn out to be something that can be accomplished within the century, without any alien or divine intervention required.

** I could be persuaded into believing in a creator of our universe. I feel like that proof wouldn't even have to be difficult, show me the universe untethered by a linear time point of view. That'd probably do it.

If I was at a bar, and a person sat down next to me and was like "I'm God, check it." And then showed my brain the universe from start to end without the complication of time. I'd totally believe.

The belief wouldn't change anything about my life though. I believe a creator of our universe may exist. I do not believe in God as any religion on Earth frames it, because people are bullshit, and the more people there are, the more bullshit happens. A human being cannot even keep their own memory straight. You can introduce false memories that people will fervently believe are absolute fact with very little coaxing. I can't imagine *any* religion is even *close* to correct on what God is or represents.

I'm not even certain that we're not just like the cells and/or neurons of God's mind. Maybe we're all just autonomic functions of God's being that it is barely aware of.

The average human breathes 12 to 20 times per minute. How many neurons does that take to make sure that task functions? I don't know, but are you aware of every firing of each neuron that it takes to make you breathe roughly 20,000 times per day? Are your cells aware that they are part of a larger being? Awareness relies on definitions of consciousness that the greatest philosophers throughout the ages have yet to come to consensus on.

Do I believe in a creator? I cannot prove or disprove nor am I qualified to make such judgements.

Do I believe in anyone's "God"? I cannot.

I could not accept any religions version of God. Especially a judeo-christian God. Any omnipotent being, who sets moral codes of behavior for humanity and then sits by and allows those doctrines to be blatantly broken, to the suffering of "God's children" is no deity of mine.

**** Yes, that might be it. The reason is inverted though- deep down, I believe in god. But I do believe in a world where god, gods, could exist. I don't know how delusional that is. On the other hand, examination implies god either doesn't exist, or is so subtle as to be irrelevant to my mental model of the world.

Unexamined, I believe god exists, that that's an immutable facet of the universe. I've adjusted my parameters for god's behavior over the years, but i never really disbelieved he existed, merely that his defeinition of good was accurate. For me, God is like some lovecraftian deity, or a paperclip AI. His priorities are close enough to think we can know him, but more than far enough away to prove futile, and powerful enough to avoid our gaze if it would be counterproductive. As such, if he is defeatable, the best course of action is to plan around him and if neccessary, to wage war on him, and if he isn't, pursue your goals while trying to avoid his gaze and minimize his harm to your life. I don't think he's omnipotent- or if he is, he's doing this for the game, like a video game player- they could hack in and insta-win, but that wouldn't be any fun, so they follow rules anyways- but i do think his power outscales ours tremendously.

I tend to find myself thinking, or even planning as though this is the case, if i'm not careful. little, superstitous things, like not taking deities' names in vain or believing in providence rather than luck. It's an undercurrent of belief, i suppose.

If someone walked up to me and tried to prove god existed, I'd be far too credulous, I suspect. Carefully examined, I believe god doesn't exist. but the instant i turn my back, i find myself thinking like he does. It's not a huge difference, but it is there.

I don't believe God doesn't exist, but I should, hence why I said "I disbelieve in my belief." But that doesn't change the fact, that when you asked if there is a creator when i'm distracted I'd say yes, before pausing and correcting myself.

If you asked where god is, I'd say I don't know, but if you asked if it would be possible to see him with omni-knowledge i'd say yes- because it's not a matter of throwing the flour in the garage, it's a matter of a single invisible dragon somewhere in the galaxy.

But since most don't have any proof he does exist, I believe he doesn't IFF I stop and check my beliefs, or manually replace them. But it just keeps sitting there anyways, a subtle trap for any future plans.

Tested, reality implies god doesn't exist, or doesn't have enough power, or doesn't care to meddle with us- that this is all some salt crystal collection, and our existence is a coincidence, or that our origins aren't from a meddling creator, so it shifts my plans very little.

But very little isn't none. It leads to a slight bias towards what I consider moral behavior, which doesn't always overlap with right behavior, in the same way belief in karma might.

It might be belief in belief, but I want to disbelieve in god. It's just not that easy. Wanting to disbelieve doesn't make me disbelieve it. It's a bit of "disbelief in belief", really. I believe something, but I don't want to believe i believe it.

huh. I notice i am confused. Something in this is probably innacurate... on the other hand, i'm talking about how the map i use automatically doesn't match up with the one i'd use if i manually thought it through. of course i'm a little confused.

E.g., there was no need for atoms or quantum particles until people performed experiments that demanded answers. Or the only stars that existed were the ones visible to the naked eye, until the telescope was invented. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this, but I'm sympathetic to your point and I think it's a reasonable position. I suspect the best answer we have is that humans have evolved an evolutionary bias towards believing in the supernatural because those types of beliefs and resulting actions have kept us alive through either rudimentary science or social cohesion.

** To echo some other comments here: I will treat [X] as if [X] = [Y] if enough evidence is provided that [X] = [Y] is the most compelling hypothesis.

To portray this in terms of Occam's Razor: badly-faked, it's a simpler proposition that [X] is only pretending to be [Y] and is in fact something else. Perfectly faked, it's a more complex proposition to imagine levels of pretending (more so if successive). The most likely version of reality will be treated as true, always while keeping in mind that I could in fact be a brain in a tank or a vacuum fluctuation or similar. (There's the perspective of 'if someone is willing to go to these lengths to fool me by satisfying my curiosity, I might as well give up and reward their dedication'.)

In practice, both 'reality as consistent with that deity existing actually make sense' and 'it doesn't just make sense, something with that level of control actually exists' would need to be demonstrated, at least ideally. If minds really didn't die when they were thought to, but 'woke up' from a simulation (or afterlife, et cetera) then a lot could be explained in terms of permitted ethics (though easily disagreed with, regarding suffering). For example, I'd be much more okay with {agreeing beforehand to put myself through the fear of death without risk of death} than I would be with actually facing the risk of death, and I might be willing to forgive a lot if I learned I had never actually risked death. That said, while it would be wonderful if there weren't actually any risk of death, it's not at all convincing that that's the case, and so it is wholly appropriate to act as though there's no safety net. ...though then there's the valid perspective of 'even if a being shows you an afterlife, should you devote your life to immortality research to improve your chances in the slim-subjective-probability event that you're being tricked?'.

The second necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be explicable. If it took the time to explain itself to me, it would help, but with sufficient scrutiny of the phenomenon this might not be necessary. Perhaps it is a remainder in the fundamental constants of the big bang taken sentience, which somehow allows it to selectively manipulate spacetime and the forces to achieve its miracles, in a process that can be described by physics and experimentally verified. If after learning about a phenomenon the phenomenon is still MYSTERIOUS, then we don't yet understand the phenomenon well enough to conclude it an act of god rather than an act of David Copperfield.

The third necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be demonstrable. That is, despite being possible, and explicable, it must yet turn out to actually occur. At some point, the god has to actually show up and offer to buy me a drink, or have an effect on the world which is different from how the world should be expected to progress if it were absent, which can be distinguished and verified. It must not be merely a fiction written by a creative person with a plausible explanation of how god could be.

The fourth necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be deific. My shoe is demonstrable, is self-consistent, and explicable, but it is hardly a god. The entity proposed must be capable of doing something that will by some mechanism be forever beyond the ability of humans to duplicate. This is the difference between a god and a Kryptonian. Perhaps as in the above example the god is "made" of a self-propagating remainder in physics. Humans will never have access to such materials as generate such a force to build with, and so cannot replicate the god. The god must also be in some way sentient, if not an actual personality that can be talked to. This excludes the mundane and the universe itself from being god.

Fail any one of these, and I am not convinced. Succeed in all, and I will believe in it. And then, if it turns out to be responsible for all the suffering of humanity by having shoddily created the universe in a premeditated act it foresaw the consequences of, I will attempt to murder it.

Seems to me that you can have some of those traits while still being consistent, if you add the minor restriction that omnipotence is defined as "can do anything that is not logically self-contradictory". So, an omnipotent being can't (eg) make a round square, but can rearrange every star in the heavens to spell your name.

A god could be (omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent){1-3} or (omnibenevolent, omnipresent){1-2} but also completely {apathetic, !empathy){1-2}; that would match what we see. It's only when you add omnibenevolent to the first set that you have a problem. A being could also be omnibenevolent and lack the power to effect change. (Whether this is a god is an open question.)

Side note: my iPhone knows "omnipotent" and "omniscient" but not "omnibenevolent". There's a joke in there somewhere about corporate beliefs and Apple's culture.

/are already false./ Claiming to have done things a way other than the way they happened in reality makes you wrong. Getting /more/ evidence about how creationism is wrong won't make things /better/ for the creator god.

  Plenty of Kryptonians could easily perform feats beyond the ability of humans to duplicate.

Lex Luthor duplicated Kryptonians several times. They operate on DNA that can be cloned, giving him control. He made a superpotion that gave him Superman's powers. The methods used in-setting by Kryptonians to achieve their feats are human-attainable. If we find a Kryptonian in real life, and they work by /magic humans can't have/, we're in business.

***** Ok I see what you mean now about the parts that I quoted. However, if God explained to you that he intentionally erased the evidence of the flood and planted false evidence of no worldwide flood happening, that would be at least logically possible, unlike an omnipotent being.

As to your Kryptonian point, that still seems to me to be a strange bar to set for the supernatural. There are plenty of logically possible feats that a hypothetical alien race could achieve that are outside the capability of humans and that would not prove the existence of any gods. Still, I applaud you on your knowledge of the example you chose. I didn't know that about Lex.

******* Everything you just said is true, but how does that support your point that if an alien can do things we can't, it is supernatural? Or your apparent point that a sufficiently powerful being couldn't plant false evidence to deceive our primitive scientists?

********* Hmm. Good point. It seems like most conceptions of God are that he exists outside of the universe (since he created it) and is not bound by its laws. In some sense, anything that interacts with our universe, whether it follows the perceived laws of nature or not, must be natural, but at that point the definition becomes so broad as to be almost unusable.

********** To exist is to "occupy a region of space for a duration of time".

The universe is "the set of all things that exist".

Saying your god is beyond the universe, outside space and time, makes it not exist.

Most people prefer their god to exist always and everywhere, not nowhere and never.

************ If we were to find a magical wardrobe that opened into Narnia, that wouldn't be another universe, it would be part of this one. And we'd just have been wrong about the shape of it.
