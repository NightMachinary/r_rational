Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** As a cryonicist, I'm drafting out a text describing my revival preferences and requests, to be stored along with my other paperwork. (Oddly enough, this isn't a standard practice.) The current draft is [[https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cryo%20Revival%20Preferences%20-%20draft%200.1.1.txt][here]]. I'm currently seeking suggestions for improvement, and a lot of the people around here seem to have good heads on their shoulders, so I thought I'd ask for comments here. Any thoughts?

The change: Added new paragraph.

There is no such thing as being able to have 100% certainty that a piece of software is without flaws or errors. One of the few methods for detecting a large proportion of any program's is to allow many people, with all their varied perspectives and skills, to examine it, by proclaiming that the program is free and open source and releasing both the source code and binaries for inspection. Without that strategy, not only are bugs much more likely to remain, but when someone does manage to find a bug, it is likely to remain secret and uncorrected. Such uncorrected bugs can be used by unscrupulous people to do just about anything to any data stored on a computer. This is bad enough when that data is merely personal email, or even a bank's financial records; when the data is a sapient mind, the possibilities are horrifying. Given the possible downsides, I find it difficult to trust the motives of anyone who wishes to run an uploaded mind on a computer that uses closed-source software. Therefore, if there is a choice between uploading my mind using uninspectable, closed-source software, and not being revived, I would choose not to be uploaded in that fashion, even if doing so increases the risk of never being revived at all. If there is a choice between being uploading my mind using closed-source software that the uploaded mind can inspect, then if that includes all the documentation that is necessary for the uploaded mind to learn how to understand the software, I would reluctantly agree to the uploading procedure as being preferable to risking never being revived at all.

*** I didn't read your text, but one of the things that has kept me from being a cryonicist is that I don't know if it'll actually work. I have no reason to believe that it is possible to revive someone after having their body frozen, it's just a conjecture based on a hypothesis of what consciousness is. I don't know if my theory of mind is correct, but I have no reason to abandon it.

As it is, I can't help but see attempts to undo death as selfish and vain. If evidence comes forward to change my definition of life and death, then I may see cryonics as a technique to preserve life, but I currently see it as wasteful and kind of repulsive. I know it isn't rational to think so, but I can't help the way I feel.

****** No actually. Speeding up the process of freezing will be equally damaging as doing it slowly. The issue with freezing cells is that ice first forms as tiny crystals, which then grow to rip and destroy the cells. Speeding up the process will have the same effect (flash freezing someone is fatal regardless of all the super-villains in cartoons with a freeze-gun). You need certain enzymes which act as an antifreeze to keep the ice crystals small and from damaging the cells.

I know that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says you really can't stop atomic motion, so its all theory, speculation, dreaming. I was talking about getting an atom so cold it loses it's energy which could potentially alter it's wave function and stop reactions like forming ice crystals. Like I said, this is just my theory, which is one of many theories about freezing humans. I bet the most likely secret to freezing people lies in tardigrades.

** I've found that it seems like a awfully large number of people seem to hold very similar theories of consciousness to me and yet I've never really found anything that espoused my particular position in much detail.\\
I'll link to this thing I wrote so I don't have to keep repeating my position: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkJL_8USmcAHNpdYd-vdtDkV-plPcuH3sSxCkSLzGtk/edit?usp=sharing]] I would really implore you to read that brief link before responding, since the point of it was to state my actual position.

I'm interested how many people hold similar views and in where else people have seriously talked about this position. I can't really seem to find much on it by googling, so i'm interested in what else you can link to me. This comic is somewhat relevant to my position [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1]] (however I don't think sleep is actually a cessation of experience).

I'm happy to hear any criticisms of this position, and haven't really gotten to hear any good one's. I've mostly heard the tired old non-argument of "Oh but that would mean you die everytime you sleep"\\
I've heard this position mentioned a great many places, and yet people never seem to seriously delve into it; frequently they just seem to stop when they get to the point where they think it would necessarily imply that you die every time you sleep (even though that's not an actual argument against it).

/Note:/ This is something which has large consequences; like whether you think cryonics could actually save a person (though even if you think it wouldn't, you might have other reasons for wanting a clone of you to exist in the future). It also raises questions as to whether anesthesia is a horrifying prospect.\\
So I don't think this is just a minor philosophical nitpick, /this is quite literally life or death/ so I would hope that you really think about it seriously.\\
The primary purpose of this theory is to actually make predictions about anticipated experience; whether particular things are likely to result in a cessation of experience.

*** To me, the most glaring problem with the 'sleep must mean death' is that it sound prescriptive instead of descriptive. It sounds like saying that, even though people cry at funerals but not at bedtime, that you should really cry at bedtime because the two are no different. Whenever I hear something like that, it sets off warning bells to the tune of 'you're trying to force one thing to mean the same thing as something else, and there's evidence to the contrary.'

At the same time, the 'clone teleportation' concept brings up a different issue. If you take the same pattern of atoms and construct it the same way multiple times, neither instance is 'not a person', but they stop being the same person. What I'm trying to get at is what I'm thinking of as a 'soul' assumption of identity. Not in the sense that a soul literally exists and identity stems from that, but that the identity is like a soul with respect to how it is a discrete value that persists from birth to death. If you hold this assumption, anything that interferes with the identity must be a 'death'. If you deconstruct a person in a teleporter and simultaneously reconstruct them twice in two different places, it's obvious that something has happened to the identity. Even if both clones gain the same identity, they must immediately diverge, so something must have happened. Therefore, death.

Something I've been considering, as a way of framing things, is the notion of every time you refer to someone, write their name, speak it, think it, every reference to their identity, it came with a timestamp. "Greg [April 1, 2006] didn't like that prank so much." It would help get past the idea that they're exactly the same person as they were back then. You aren't like you were as a child, if an identical replica of your childhood best friend as they were back then met you today, even disregarding the physical differences of your grownup age they wouldn't see the same person as your past self. The perspective I'm looking for, I think, is identity not as a soul that persists from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of 'who you are' and 'what you're like'. An infinite sequence of births and deaths with every passing moment that adds information to your brain or memory that passes out of your grasp.

So why would we cry at funerals? Why do we feel like our identity is a constant, a soul of sorts that makes me the same person from birth to death? Well, imagine your friend nowadays. Each time you see him, he's a little bit different. He woke up differently, knows some new things and forgot some old things, but he's close enough to the person he was yesterday that it really makes no difference. We adjust to the incredibly minor differences and are calibrated for the next minuscule change in our next meeting. If you meet up with a friend you haven't seen since childhood, and they're all grown up and you're all grown up, the differences are much greater and you don't feel like they're the same person you played at recess with.

If it's an infinite sequence of births and deaths, those are hardly the right terms to describe it. They carry too much weight, make us think we should be feeling things we have no obligation to feel. It's better, I think, to use 'beginnings and ends', since those are general enough to not demand reactions from us. Your childhood self is ended, your best friend's childhood self is ended. Yesterday's you ended, tomorrow's you will begin after you wake up. These are all different identities, regardless of the shared memories, and your friend from your teenage years might feel melancholy about the you and him back then, those ended identities that were so different from today's you and him that it feels like a little death for those identities to not exist nowadays.

If you are deconstructed in a teleporter, and reconstructed twice simultaneously, each version of you diverges in identity. One may discover a fascination for a new genre of music, another may fall in love with a certain type of food. The composition of what 'makes you you' diverges, and so do their identities. But this isn't a death for deconstructed you any more than teenage you died as you slowly became adult. If one clone stays in the same life and the other goes to a Mars colony for a new life, to anyone else in your original setting it's like nothing happened. Your best friend still sees the you ever so slightly different from how you were yesterday, everyone else you know recognizes the same 'identity' because 2016 you hasn't died like 2015 you died, and like 2014 you died, and so on. We cry at funerals because instead of a minuscule change every day, where you can look a thousand days back and say 'what a different person' and feel like a little death has happened, real, funeral-type death is an abrupt change from 'everything that makes you you' to a lump of flesh, and nothing more.

Truth be told, I couldn't say I properly understood half of all that until I set about trying to tell you what I thought, but that's basically how I view identity these days. Not as an immutable 'soul' with your name on it from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of little changes each day that result in the end of old identities and the beginning of new identities, as if every time someone referred to you, the mention came with a time stamp of what you they're talking about. Well, now that I've said all that, what do you think about the concept I rambled around in this horridly long post?

**** Ok well the major thing I should emphasize (though I assume you read the post I linked so you understand a bit about my position)\\
Is that I don't really think questions about the sort of identity you're talking about are really going to have meaningful answers because there's no clear criteria for a meaningful answer.\\
I think when talking about whether to expect a cessation of personal experience one should really only talk about whether the process your mind was carrying out that contained experience stopped. I think other stuff like whether that process maintained the same memories can't plausibly affect whether that process has a subjective cessation of experience.

So for instance I don't think that if you were given a drug that instantly wiped away your memories and changed your brain chemistry (so there would be no link in terms of personality similarities) that you ought to expect a subjective cessation of experience.\\
I think since it's the only thing we actually experience that our continuous qualia (yes that term sometimes has weird connotations in philosophy sometimes, don't overthink it) is the only thing that ought to be taken into account when talking about whether something will cause subjective death.

***** As far as identity goes, we can distinguish between answers that make sense and answers that don't make sense, though. You've said that 'you die every time you sleep' is stupid, and I figure that our concept of identity (and thus related concepts like personal growth or death) should be consistent with our reactions to related phenomena. We cry at funerals, a significant reaction, so it is consistent to say a significant thing happened to cause that significant reaction. Just the same, we don't cry at bedtime, an insignificant reaction, so it is consistent to say that bedtime is an insignificant thing, as far as identity is concerned. Much of what I talked about is extrapolating from real-life examples (like meeting a childhood friend or your current best friend) to find a definition of identity that matches the reactions each example gives. In this way, I think a meaningful answer to defining identity exists and can be explored.

As far as consciousness apart from identity, well, sorry. I got caught up in thinking about identity that I missed how you were talking about it separately. It might be the connection with death, and that I think of death as intertwined with identity as with consciousness, but I can take a gander at consciousness as a separate concept.

Like my identity idea, I want here to look at examples of human reaction to related events and build a concept that is consistent with our reactions. Under this perspective, what you say about sleep not truly being a cessation of experience due to the continuing thought processes that we simply can't remember sounds a little off. If someone put a microchip in my brain that forced a cessation of experience as I neared sleep and restored experience at a time afterwards, I wouldn't see it as any different from sleep. When you say subjective death, I can't agree with the idea that of two events I can't discern the difference between (sleep and microchip), one of them results in a subjective death and the other doesn't. Or at least, if subjective death /must/ occur in one and only one of the two scenarios, it's meaning is such that I find no reason to care about the concept in the first place.

A drug that wipes my memories and changes my brain chemistry would result in a cessation of experience, but as I understand it, it would also result in a drastic change in identity. The identity theory that I talked about would then cover why I would care about the concept and describe it as a death, but I don't believe the fact that it is an explicit cessation of experience has changed anything meaningful about the event.

****** I think you don't die when you sleep, because I think you don't have a cessation of consciousness when you sleep, I think you are experiencing things even if they aren't very notable during sleep; /remember I say in the writing I linked that I seriously worried sleep might mean death at one point,/ so the emotional appeal of an idea means very little to me.

I don't think people's emotional reactions have any special ability to somehow discern whether a claim is true, and thus I can't get what point you're making in in your first paragraph. How would people's reactions have any method of distinguishing truth? What causal mechanism would somehow allow that?

As for the bit about experience during non-dream sleep, well first off I talk about it in my writing; I didn't say there was a /thought process/ (though during parts there might be sort of fragments of thoughts), however you can experience things other than thoughts, meditation is an obvious example.\\
As for the microchip example: I do think you'd probably notice, because usually people get a sense of time having passed when they wake up instead of feeling like they skipped forward in time. However it may be that for you sleep does feel that way possibly due to not storing memories of it very well. I do mention in the writing that even when woken up during deep sleep I can sort of remember something even if it's barely anything.

I disagree that one's memories are necessarily a good metric for determining whether you had subjective experiencing during a given period, as I mention we know of plenty of circumstances where you definitely have experiences that you either don't consolidate as memory or soon forget. So you can't very well say it doesn't matter /because we know that you have those sorts of experiences all the time and don't remember it/.

Something I could say about my model is that it is talking about what some people call the part of you that experiences events, and doesn't consider what one would call the ego useful in determining whether subjective events continue. It hasn't been lost on me that this does have much in common with eastern philosophy where one's memories and even personality are separate from the "true you" (which in my model is nothing more profound than the process that has the experiences).

As for your last part about the drug: But why would you expect the process in your brain that experiences stuff to shut off at any point just because a bunch of data in other areas got corrupted or lost?

******* Hmm... I think an analogy might help explain my perspective here. If a company is contracted to build a house, and they select quality materials for the frame, the walls and floors, and every other aspect, but build it on a shoddy foundation, on first glance and even thorough examination the house they built will come across as well-built, but hidden beneath the surface it's poorly built and wrong. That notion, of it being wrong in a way no one can tell, isn't something I think applies to philosophical questions about ourselves. This isn't to say that everything is surface-thin, that a casual glance tells you all you need to know, since you can thoroughly inspect the house and only see quality construction. But for something entirely hidden from view, unable to view or observe, I reject the idea that anything under that category is meaningful in evaluations of the human mind. If we scan every minute detail of the human mind and understand it fully, there is no hidden foundation that in some mystic way eludes our knowledge and yet has concrete effects on our understanding of the human condition.

The company analogy is, of course, imperfect, but I think it conveys what I mean. Our brains are fundamentally a resolvable problem, something that /makes sense/, so we can't derive our conclusions assuming they aren't. It sounds cold, inhuman, to say that our brains are just machines ticking along, or that there is no real meaning behind our thoughts and experiences, but I would say that while there is no arbitrarily imposed meaning behind our thoughts and experience there is meaning in how we view and understand them.

If everything meaningful we need to know about the brain stems from the brain and not some external framework, we should be able to use the way the brain behaves to answer the meaningful questions about it. This is the fundamental understanding I hold when I talk about us crying at funerals but not at bedtime being relevant to the meaningful nature of our identity, and why it makes no sense to me to say that events our brains have no means of telling the difference between affect meaningful questions about our identity. There is no shoddy foundation, no hidden variable affecting real equations, and a thorough investigation of the house /will/ tell you if the construction crew did a good job.

I probably misunderstood your examples from earlier, but to keep this conversation from spiraling out of control in scope I'll just drop that specific line of topic. Right now, we're talking primarily about understanding identity and consciousness. Also, I have to go to sleep, so I likely won't be able to respond again for a good few hours.

******** Ok so to address your first paragraph: I think you can /easily/ make a case for people being wrong about their past subjective experiences /because of the stuff I mentioned about memory/. If someone says they don't experience /anything/ during /any/ part of sleep (not that I'm claiming that's your position) then they're demonstrably wrong. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say here. What part of my position do you think involves any mysticism or other magical thinking? I should make it clear that I am very much a hard determinist, materialist and even a nihilist by most standards.\\
BTW for no reason I'd like to link this talk on free will by Sam Harris because even though I was already a determinist going in I still found it extremely brilliant and novel, it also demolishes the idea of free will being compatible with determinism: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g&index=13&list=PL8Fthy2NnpXnfkcXztLkNSTbAz6JhzA0s]]

********* What I'm trying to say isn't really about mysticism. In a sense, I could even accept mysticism. If you said that there's 'energies' in the air and that they influence my emotions, while I might not jump to agree with you, I wouldn't see it as inconsistent. What would be happening there isn't a hidden variable affecting meaningful understandings of life and death, what would be happening there is a non-physical, but still visible, variable affecting a factor which in turn affects our understanding of philosophical questions about the mind.

What I'm trying to say is that if you took me apart and created two clones identical to me before disassembly, that our questions of 'did I die?' or 'what are the identities of these two clones?' can't be dependent on something invisible. Mystic stuff, if it exists, would count as visible in how you could 'sense' it and it would affect your brain like your chemical balance does. But some quality that, ultimately, has no affect on our physical state cannot be a crucial factor in a question of identity or life and death.

*** If I understand your view correctly, you are essentially saying that you believe that in general, consciousness is identical to an ongoing process occurring in the brain; and that specifically, your consciousness/identity/self is associated with the process occurring in your own brain.

Given that, I don't understand why continuity is so important to you. Assuming you're a physicalist, you believe that your mental state at any given time is completely determined by the physical arrangement of particles in your brain. So, suppose that you could pause time just for your body, while the universe continued as before. Your experience would have ceased until time was unpaused again, but you would notice nothing at all except for a sudden change in surroundings. So, your experience is discontinuous with respect to the passage of time in the universe (let's call this t), but continuous with respect to your perception of the passage of time (let's call this t').

Insisting on t'-continuity means you have to bite some rather strange bullets, which I'm happy to share if you would like to hear them. But t-continuity seems to be a much stricter criterion than what we would ordinarily demand from a physical process, and without a good reason, it seems arbitrary and unsound to subject stricter demands of consciousness than of other physical processes.

In either case, though, it seems strange to object to anesthesia when you don't to sleep. If it's missing time you're worried about, then I don't think there's really a dividing line between sleep and anesthesia--personally, I've had non-REM naps and even full nights of REM sleep that felt like like lying down and then "suddenly being awake with no sense of the intervening time actually having happened." And though I'm not a neuroscientist or sleep scientist, I expect that there are periods during nightly sleep when your brain's activity is essentially identical to what happens under anesthesia. You can resolve that as a self-death happening in both cases or in neither case, but at least given my present knowledge, it seems very strange to worry about one but not the other.

**** Ok first off anesthesia: I think anesthesia is /potentially/ a cessation of experience whereas sleep is not, because anesthesia is somewhat different from sleep. You can be vaguely aware of stuff during sleep, you can be woken usually easily and /most/ people don't feel like they skipped forward in time when they wake up, unlike anesthesia*. I just think anesthesia can't make as good a case for you having experiences during it as sleep can. A brain under anesthesia has less stuff going on than one in deep sleep.\\
*However it's not the sensation of skipping time that worries me; it's whether or not that's what you would see if you could theoretically watch someone's experiences through some weird qualia viewing machine. For an individual things are much harder to appraise due to all the problems I brought up with memory.

[[http://academic.pgcc.edu/%7Emhspear/sleep/stages/nrsleep.html][http://academic.pgcc.edu/~mhspear/sleep/stages/nrsleep.html]] here's a link about non-REM dreams. I'm really trying to drive in the point that we have a considerable amount of experiences which we don't remember. I suppose this is going to be harder for you to swallow since you remember far less about your unconscious experiences than many it would seem.

As for the bullets you think my position would force me to bite I'll be glad to hear them.

Ok so as for why I care about continuity, I don't think should the internal experiencing process stop that any future process can make any more plausible claim to continuing your experience than any other. Remember I don't think anything about the mental process except the experiencing bit matters in this scenario, so that bit is what i'm calling you in this circumstance.\\
As thus I don't think there's anything about any future process that would make it more you than any other, I think the only thing that makes your current process you is just that it has been running continuously.

As for stuff to do with pausing time, well I'm not sure actually /pausing time/ is possible and anything less won't have /totally/ stopped from the perspective of the rest of the universe and poses no difficulty to me model. However that whole line of questioning might be total nonsense for all I know since simultaneity, order of events and that sort of thing get all weird in relativity. In fact even theoretically the idea of totally stopping time might be impossible due to weird complications with infinity.

***** You seem more informed than me on the matter of sleep vs. anesthetized brain states, so I'll defer to you there. However, I find it /very/ interesting that you don't seem the sensation of time skipping, since it's essentially having (retrograde) amnesia for the skipped period. I suppose that if you think it's something that happens to some extent every time you sleep (maybe less for you than for others, given your frequent lucid dreaming), I can understand how it would be less of a concern for you. On the other hand, any degree of retrograde amnesia violates t'-continuity, so under that criterion there is no difference between anesthetization and forgetful sleep.

If you have objections to the time-pausing thing on realism grounds, consider it instead to be suspending the execution of a 1-to-1 scale simulation of your brain. The effect is the same. Most of my other weird things are also more applicable to software emulations of your brain, but that shouldn't be an issue if the process and continuity really are what is important. But as far as I can see, a theory that requires t' continuity and nothing further should also endorse:

-That (as before) if you are suspended and resumed much later, this should not worry you, existentially.

-That if you are suspended, copied, and resumed, both copies are you

-That if you are suspended, copied exactly, and the original is destroyed, the copy is you and the original should not consider this a problem, so long as the copy is allowed to resume.

-That the above holds even if, say, the original is your biological brain and the copy is a computer simulation. Aside from body dysmorphia, you should feel no apprehension about becoming a computer copy that you don't feel about becoming ordinary future bio-brain-you.

-That this is still true even if the "computer simulation" is some guy performing computations by wheeling file folders around a warehouse on a hand-truck instead of a processor moving electrons around.

I think I had some others, but I don't remember them. Anyway, these are the sorts of conclusions that I find sufficient to reject the idea of you-as-process, and which you will have to handle somehow should you keep your present view.

******* Basically, I reject it because I don't want to die. I'll agree that a computer simulation of my mind, if initialized to an exact replica of my bio-brain state at some time t_0, has as much right to claim descent from from pre-t_0 me as the still-existing biological version of me would. I expect it would diverge more widely in less time due to different brain-body interactions, but it would still have all my pre-t_0 memories and feel that, other than the sudden shock of body transplant, it had an uninterrupted experience of being me that went all the way back to my earliest childhood.

What I'm not okay with is destroying the original. Essentially, I think that identity-as-process is insensitive to differences between instances of the same process, but these are important and should be distinguished. I consider death to be the termination of my current instance, regardless of any others, the same way we would say a person died even if their genes lived on in an identical twin. I guess this view is sort of a hybrid of self-as-process and self-as-hardware, and it seems obvious enough that I'm not really sure why it never seems to be proposed in these discussions.

For example, process theory of identity says that a copy-move-destroy teleporter situation is okay, because you walk out the other side having an experience that is continuous with the one you were having when you walked in. I agree that for exit-me, there is no problem. However, I know that when entry-me walks into the teleporter, he is having the last experience he will ever undergo. Obviously, entry-me prefers exit-me existing to having no me exist, for the same reason that I hope other humans exist after my death. But it's not the same as being around to witness it myself.

I don't care if there exists any me-process with experience continuous into the past; I care if there exists /this/ me-process. That's why sleep and anesthesia don't bother me: As long as I wake up on the other end, no death happens.

********* Interesting. I'd like to understand your position better, because while it seems like a perfectly reasonable attitude looking from the outside in, I have difficulty accepting that you wouldn't want to distinguish between elements of the set of you from the inside. After all, if one box is suddenly hit by a meteor, the two box-beings will no longer have identical qualia, and it seems like it will matter an awful lot which box you experience. Given such a possibility, it seems that the important thing would be whether the two beings' experience has the possibility to diverge in the future, not whether such divergence had occurred already. But leaving that aside for a minute, if you identify with the set of beings with identical qualia to yours, no matter how large the set, then it shouldn't matter what size the set is (as long as it isn't empty), right?

Suppose that a robot walks into each of the rooms you mention. Each robot has a gun, and one gun is loaded with blanks, the other with bullets. Otherwise, each robot is identical in its movements, mannerisms, speech, etc, so that your qualia remains the same between rooms. The robot offers to shoot you both, and pay the survivor (who is in the room with the blanks) $1,000,000,000. The robot is a trained shooter who knows the human body well, and he promises to shoot you in such a way that will be ~immediately fatal and therefore ~painless for the one in the room with the bullets. Assuming that you can trust the robot to keep its word, do you accept its offer? What if it offered just $20? Or $0.01? If not, why not?

For that matter, if you knew MWI was true, it seems to me that your position commits you to attempt quantum suicide for arbitrarily small gains, so long as those gains were known to be possible in >=1 world(s) in which you existed. Do you accept this commitment, and if not, why not?

*********** Thanks for clearing that up for me, and especially for playing along with the spirit of my questions. I feel I can now understand your position much better, and I look forward to reading that Tegmark paper. As an aside, though, I'm curious what measure of qualia difference you'd consider to disqualify members from the set of you. Is any difference sufficient, no matter how small, or is there a threshold of qualia significance such that differences below the threshold are ignored for set membership? Or would your adoption of any standard here depend on experiments with multiple you-copies that haven't yet been performed?

I'm also interested in the quantum suicide strategy you mentioned in the first edit. It seems like it could work for some things, like playing the lottery (assuming each of copies first earned enough money to buy their ticket; otherwise, you might as well just be buying 1000 tickets yourself), but for anything that genuinely turns on the outcome of a random quantum event, it seems like having many copies in a single universe would add no benefit relative to only having 1 per universe. Is that right, or is there something to your strategy that I'm not seeing?

************* It seems foolish to even make note of which is the original, given your theory of self. Assuming the original you is an emulation anyway, then it seems to make more sense to include original you in the quantum suicide pact. That way there's no need to fuse "copy me" and "original me" in the case that the original wins.

If "original me" is still a meat-brain, then you could use the process described in edit 2. That process is only going to be important if you need your meat-body for some practical reason, though, since you don't privilege the original's continued experience. If you don't, it might be simpler (if messier) to instantaneously kill the meat body, assuming such a thing is possible.

****** Ok the difference with sleep is that many people who don't feel like they skipped time may not remember any details, but they still have some small amount of memory of the sleep even if it's basically devoid of memories, they still feel like /something/ was happening. With amnesia the worry isn't so much that you forgot the experience, but that there that there /wasn't anything to experience/, so you might not have forgotten anything per-say.\\
The thing I care about when it comes to t-continuity isn't continuity of memory but /continuity of experience/, which due to flaws in human memory is unfortunately hard to be sure about.

With simulation of one's brain I think that would likely violate continuity, which is why I would want to avoid ever pausing simulated minds, and would aim for continuous uploading techniques. Among the reasons I found other consciousness models untenable is because of the example you brought up, of both copies being you. Sure both copies can have your ego, but you clearly wouldn't be subjectively experiencing being both of them at once so the idea of them /actually/ both being you is incoherent.

I should state for clarifications that i'm /absolutely/ a transhumanist, I just think it's extremely important to have uploading and stuff done as a continuous process, but no I don't think the hardware of the human brain has any privileged status.

******* For what it's worth, I very much agree with you on the importance of doing uploading as a continuous process, but for different reasons.

So what you care about then is actual continuity of experience (i.e., t-continuity), not continuity of apparent experience (i.e., t'-continuity). That's helpful to know. However, I'm still a bit lost on why continuity is important.

The main justification you give is that it's necessary to distinguish between identical copies of the the process of you. However, without considering continuity, it's already trivial to distinguish them! Whichever instance is physically responsible for your ongoing experience is the "real you," and each copy will be able to distinguish themselves the same way. It's true that the one with t-continuity back to before the copies were made is the original. But that seems unimportant when the original and the copies all have identical mental states. It seems to be just a case of "privileging the hardware" of the original, which is something you say you're against.

******** I don't think continuity is important for distinguishing the original for an outside observer, I think identical version of the same person should be treated the same. The reason I think it's important to keep track of continuity of experience is for determining whether a given process is killing people even if it wouldn't be obvious from naively watching the outcome.\\
Given you also want uploading to be done continuously, I imagine you also might share my fear of how horrible it might be if a star trek style transporter became widespread, so I think this sort of thing is really important for potentially stopping those sort of utterly horrible scenarios from coming to pass, and to avoid accidentally dying yourself.

This sort of thing has incredibly high stakes; if people have the wrong theory of consciousness countless people might march unknowingly to their deaths through certain future technologies.

Determining whether any copy is the real you may not be very important /after/ the fact, however it's certainly very important before the fact since one's decisions determine whether someone is going to end up dying.

Also among other things I think apparent continuity of experience is a terrible way of predicting experience because of human memory. Like I have said in previous comments, it's undeniable that people experience far more than they are aware of that gets lost, the best example to bring up is that most people lost most of their dreams, and basically no-one remembers their non-rem dreams.

********* Hmm. I agree about the importance of this thing. However, I still don't see the importance of continuity, other than as a means to prevent what we really see as bad, namely, termination of a given instance of the you-process.

Was anesthetization something you were worried about before you came up with your continuity theory? Because if it was, then I guess we just have different intuitions in this matter, and they aren't to be reconciled. But if you were initially okay with it, and only concluded anesthetization was bad by deduction from your theory, then I suggest your theory may be giving unreliable results.

I guess I'm kind of harping on this point. It's just that there is a very important difference between anesthetization and the teleporter, namely: An patient scheduled for anesthetization can expect to wake up and continue living afterwards. A passenger who enters the teleporter can correctly expect all experience to cease, permanently, when it activates.

It just seems to me that if you anticipate having experiences after some event, that event cannot be your death, as the word is commonly used. But I suppose it is precisely "you" and "your" that is up for discussion.

How so? How is that any different from someone saying that our unwillingness to get into a teleporter is objectively bad for us (if teleporters were widespread enough not using them would be pretty inconvenient), and thus it must be unreliable.\\
This isn't a question of ethics, where how good something sounds is the primary way of evaluating a given theory; this is a question about anticipated experience /that ought to have a real answer/ and we shouldn't expect whether the answer is convenient to affect it's likelihood of being true.

*********** Apologies. That last bit that seemed weird was me realizing that I was assuming my conclusion the whole time. I probably should have just deleted the post and started over at that point. As it is, I guess I'll make one more try at it.

Yes, it's true that a person who is anesthetized either wakes up or doesn't, just as it's true that a person who enters a teleporter either continues their experience or doesn't, making both questions literally a matter of life and death. Therefore, it is very important to find the true answer, if it is possible. I'm 100% on board with the idea that the convenience of an answer doesn't affect its likelihood of being true.

For teleportation, this is fortunately pretty easy. A person who walks into a teleporter is copied and then physically dismantled at a molecular level. That may not be a good, maximally-inclusive minimally-exclusive definition of death, but it is sufficient for us to know that death has occurred.

In the case of anesthetization, however, I can't seem to think of any experiment that could be done, even in principle, to determine the answer to the question of "Should a person who is going under anesthesia expect to experience anything ever again?" We can appeal to brain activity, of course, but that only helps if we've already agreed, arbitrarily, to define death as a certain pattern of brain activity. So we have a question that we can answer with any model, but for which no answer will tell us if we have a good model. So at least on this question, it is exactly like doing ethics, where we can always answer the question "How do we maximize the good?" but no answer will tell us if our arbitrarily-chosen definition of "good" actually captures all the nuance we want it to.

I think it's somewhat analogous to the issue of P-zombies, where a person acts identically whether they have a soul or are a zombie. Similarly, a person emerging from anesthesia acts identically whether or not they are a true continuation of the pre-anesthesia person or actually a newborn clone with all the memories of the original. There is no difference, even from the inside. So my intuition is the same in both cases: Apply Occam's Razor and conclude that what occurs is exactly what seems to occur: There is no difference between zombies and non-zombies, and the person who wakes from anesthesia is the same person who went under.

Anyway, given that intuition is all we have to go on here, my criticism essentially boils down to:

1: The discontinuity = death model is good because it captures everything that my intuition describes as death. However,

2: It violates my intuition by labeling the unknowable-in-principle situation of anesthetization as death, when intuitively, it is not.

3: Other models of consciousness capture everything that my intuition describes as death and additionally accord with it regarding anesthesia.

4: Therefore, one of those models is probably better.

That's why I asked whether your intuition was different than mine for point 2. If our intuitions agree, then my criticism is valid. If they disagree, then it isn't, and that's that.

Right, in that sense, your model seems very similar to vakusdrake's. The main issue I have with it is that, /even if we know exactly what processes are identified with consciousness/, that only tells us whether consciousness is happening when we can measure it. So if we determine that certain necessary parts of the consciousness process are inoperative during anesthesia, we would know then that someone under anesthesia is not conscious. (It's worth stating, though, that we don't know what the processes that cause consciousness are, and given what I know, I believe anesthesia in particular is more sleep-like/differently-conscious than death-like/non-conscious. However, this is a belief subject to change upon new evidence).

However, the really important question, from my point of view, happens later. When a person wakes up from unconsciousness, presumably some sort of re-booting occurs. We know the brain hasn't been wiped clean, because people who wake from unconsciousness retain the memories of prior consciousness. If we continue the computer analogy, then there are two main possibilities for this new consciousness-process (understanding that since the brain is not the kind of computer we are familiar with, it's likely that neither of these is an exact description of what actually happens in the brain):

1. It is a new process, initiated from scratch after the Brain reboot. The process finds your memories where it expects to find them, says "great, this must be me!" and so you 2.0 believes they are a continuation of you 1.0.

2. Maybe, instead of initializing a new process, it's closer to resuming a suspended process. The consciousness process was always there, but it was waiting on hold until your brain had the resources to run it again.

If I understand vakusdrake (and given how we seemed to be talking past each other, I'm not entirely sure I do), he believes that both options mean death for the original. Personally, I believe that 1 is probably death, because it seems similar to the teleporter situation in certain essential ways. Since the original brain continues existing, though, I'm less certain that 1 means death than I am that the teleporter does. I also believe that 2 is not death, because it seems more similar to the "emulated you is paused, then after some time resumed" situation, which I also believe not to be death.

Given my (layman's) understanding of how the brain works, I think that something 2-ish is the more likely possibility (though again, this could change given new evidence). For that reason, and because I think anesthesia is more sleep-like than death-like, I don't worry about anesthesia. However, it's possible that different types or methods of inducing unconsciousness (anesthesia, physical trauma, asphyxiation, etc) differ between 1 and 2, and so I may learn in the future that I should fear anesthesia, but being knocked out with a club is perfectly alright (assuming it causes no lasting damage).

Regarding this part:

#+begin_quote
  So the difference isn't undetectable from my perspective
#+end_quote

If you just mean that there is a detectable process associated with consciousness, even if we don't know what it is, then I agree. If you mean that, having awakened from anesthesia, you can determine whether you experienced death, then I disagree. You would have an identical experience of the event whether you were a copy or survived it with your consciousness intact. That's the part that I meant was undetectable. In some thought-experiments, like the teleporter, what happens is sufficient for us to rule out the possibility of mind-survival. However, I think that as long as the brain remains intact, retains its arrangement of neural connections and strengths, and is capable of being returned to its previous state of animation, it seems somewhat premature to conclude that any cessation of consciousness is permanent for the one that experiences it.

That's it exactly. In order to tell the difference between identical patterns, you have to look at their history. This works for copies that exist in a separate place from the original: The copy is the one that was physically instantiated more recently.

Imagine the following scenario: A computer runs an emulation of your brain at the molecular level. This emulation of your brain experiences consciousness the same as you do, and it has memories and feelings identical to yours. Now, suppose the computer needs to do something else. Your emulation still exists in the computer's memory, but because it's given no attention by the CPU, it is not updated as time passes. The emulation does not experience the passage of time, or anything else. It just sits there, frozen, until the CPU can give it attention again. This is essentially what I meant in #2: The pattern exists, but is not being updated. I don't think that this is exactly what happens in the brain during anesthesia.

************* Ah I found this looking through old threads. I would like to state for the record that i'm not confident either way about whether anesthesia would mean death.\\
After anesthesia you may feel just like you skipped over a period of time during as though your consciousness didn't exist for that time, which if it were true would mean death in my view, since I view any break in continous experience as probable death.

However I don't know that that's how anesthesia actually works, it could simply be that anesthesia gives you anterograde amnesia so you are having some incredibly basic experiences, that simply leave no trace of their existence after the fact.\\
My worry about amnesia is fundamentally, that I have no way of knowing whether you are experiencing things during it. Whether there's a way that it's "like" to be under anesthesia, or whether that's as silly a question as asking what it's like to be a rock.

In contrast, I think even deep sleep is still some form of consciousness. When I wake up from deep sleep (usually because of an alarm, left to one's own devices people usually wake up from REM) I don't feel as though I just woke up from a dream or just fell asleep then woke up. For the record I know when I wake up from deep sleep because you are way more tired waking up from it than other sleep phases.\\
Let me put it this way, if sleep other than dreams was just /nothing/. Then when you woke up, if you could remember your dreams, you would /always/ feel as though you just woke up from a dream, regardless of what phase of sleep you woke up from.

Anyway I'm glad to see someone else with what seems like the same position as me, because it seems like among the rational community this position is phenomenally rare. After all cryonics is pretty popular among this community and within our view it wouldn't really save your life (though you might still think that having a copy of you alive in the future would be neat), but our position never really gets addressed when talking about whether cryonics would actually save your life.

Anyway even if you read my little paper on this position before, I would recommend you read it again, because I've added a few things, and one intuition pump regarding meditation that you might find useful for defending this position: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkJL_8USmcAHNpdYd-vdtDkV-plPcuH3sSxCkSLzGtk/edit?usp=sharing]]

************ My objection to your solution with occam's razor is that it is basically an appeal to to intuition, that something looks a given way so that seems most likely. The problem is that you can easily imagine slight variations on anesthesia that would unquestionably be temporary death that would look very similar from the outside, there's no easy way out of this dilemma.

For instance you can imagine a variation on anesthesia that temporarily makes the person brain dead while their body is kept alive via assisted breathing for the duration of the time they're "under"; there's no easy way to decide where the cut off point of death is in brain activity until neuroscience is far more advanced and we can directly tell whether someone is having experiences.

As for your numbered points: I of course said I'm by no means certain that anesthesia means death, but I think you can't rule out that possibility. However I don't think one's intuitions on the matter are a reliable way to evaluate a claim like this, being horrible if true, doesn't make it less likely to be true.\\
I have difficulty imagining how you think one's intuitions would affect the probability of this claims validity, given I can't imagine any way that the subconscious factors that lead to your intuitions could gain information about the probability of anesthesia entailing oblivion.

************* Hmm. Well, that's a very interesting point about assisted breathing and brain death. I actually would question whether that situation counts as death. Brain-death is, after all, only considered death because it marks the point at which no revival is possible. If someone is put into brain-death and then awakened, that would just lead me to believe that brain-death is not a good indication of true death having happened. Brain-death would become an outdated indicator of death, the same as the absence of a heartbeat is an obsolete indicator of death in our present world.

With that understood, the brain-death scenario suffers the same problem as the ordinary anesthesia scenario, namely, that no experiment can determine whether or not the individual undergoing the process can expect to have further experiences after a "successful" revival.

As for the role of intuition--since intuitions are developed by observing and understanding the world, I consider them weak evidence for whatever matter they happen to touch on. So they aren't completely divorced from the facts in this case, but neither are they particularly noteworthy. But even weak evidence can be important when it is the only evidence, as it is here. So I feel justified in rejecting theories that conflict with it when there are others that don't. This probably seems horrifying to you, since you consider that I'm treating death rather nonchalantly. But if not for your intuition that continuity is of ultimate importance, you'd have little reason to suspect anesthesia might entail oblivion in the first place. It's possible that I'm wrong, but I estimate the risk of death as lower than for things I do without worry, like climbing mountains or driving on the highway.

Anyway, as long as our intuitions can't be reconciled in this matter, I expect that further discussion will be largely unproductive.

It wouldn't in practice be any different from if a person was frozen solid then thawed (safely) the stuff that happens while the person is frozen/vegetative can't really be said to matter, since they don't in any meaningful sense exist.\\
Thus there's no reason it would be different from the transporter scenario which you said means death; it therefore follows that you ought to treat cryosleep and temporary brain death as analogous to transporters.

Intuitions /can/ provide information about the world, however just as often they are consistently biased so as to be worse than chance, because the brain has evolved to find only a very narrow scope of reality intuitive. The validity of a intuition with no plausible mechanism for having obtained information on the thing that intuition is about, can't be counted on for even weak evidence. I happen to find my consciousness model intuitive in many ways, /however that has never been among my justification for it/.\\
If you read my writing linked in the original post, and the stuff in my comments to you and others in this thread; I think my model is the most tenable because I think it is the most self consistent and I think their are flaws in other models that I point out. Just because there's not empirical evidence for any position /doesn't make all hypothesis equally valid/. There are a number of other qualities that will affect how likely you should rate a hypothesis such as simplicity and self consistency; there are plenty of hypothesis that don't even need to be tested to be ruled out because they are logically impossible due to internal inconsistencies.\\
For more on stuff regarding that I would recommend the Yudkowsky's sequences they deal with a lot of relevant probability theory.

I think a lot of the last paragraph misses the point that this isn't just a situation where we are talking about which theory was most satisfying. From the beginning I was talking about ways in which other theories have flaws that mine lacks; ways in which my theory /more defensible/.

I'm understanding this to mean if you had anesthesia (assuming it doesn't have continuity), then any possible changes could be made and when the person in the hospital awoke, they would be just as valid. Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding.

If I'm getting the above right, does this also apply to other people? Eg. If your friend went to the hospital and it's likely they had anesthesia (assuming they lose continuity), then it's likely that you aren't friends anymore (unless you're friends with everyone)?

****** Well the anesthesia example is tricky because it's not really possible to be certain of what is going on in someones head while under so I'm not sure one way or the other, however I think that since there's few surgeries that can't be done with other methods that one should maybe play it safe. People sometimes wake up during anesthesia (but don't remember it because they give you drugs that stop you from forming memories) so I suppose that's one thing that makes it seem more likely to not be as close to death.\\
My point about continuity was about whether you would be risking subjective death though, how you treat others who are clones of themselves is a different question.

Lets replace anesthesia with something I'm more sure is a cessation of experience, like say something like cryosleep in sci-fi. In a case where somebody woke up from it there's no reason to treat them different than somebody created with a cloning machine I will agree.\\
However I'm of the opinion that since you are presumably friends with people because of their qualities (their personality/memories) it wouldn't make sense to treat a clone of them any different than the original. The only exception to this would be to respect the originals wishes to some extent, but not more than the wishes of any clones.

I simply put forth that your consciousness might just be your continued experience, I think a lot of discussion misses the point which I think really ought to be about what subjective experience to expect.

There's also the issue that you can have evidence to favor arguments other than just experimental data. Not every currently untestable hypothesis is created equal; some things will have complexity penalties and others are disqualified for being logically inconsistent.\\
So no your belief in souls is totally incomparable to most materialist philosophy, because there's a difference between faith based claims, and claims that in lieu of evidence are the most justifiable position.\\
That is unless you think you have really strong justifications for the soul; however given you said evidence wouldn't change your mind any justifications you give are not really justifications since they have no bearing on your belief.

Still you can definitely get most of the stuff without much math since I managed with a mediocre mathematical ability and unwillingness to stop reading and do math.

Given a model for how the soul would work seems like it would necessitate observable interactions with the brain; I really want to know what your model is, and why it would make whole brain emulation impossible. Does your model also prohibit /any/ sufficiently complex computer programs from existing? Also what's your position on animals, where if anywhere is the cut off point for animals/intelligence level? Also if simulating minds is possible than isn't /not/ believing in souls a easier explanation since in that scenario souls would have ceased to have any explanatory power?

Regarding the genetic component you brought up; that seems really unlikely to be more than confounding factors. Religiosity is associated negatively with wealth and intelligence which immediately complicates things. Additionally people often have to face a great deal of hardship in not following the acceptable belief system of their social group, which explains the gender gap and also means religiousity will be negatively correlated with higher levels of rebelliousness. Plus given the countries that are majority atheist it's clear that any genetic factor would have to have a relatively small affect anyway. You can start to see how any direct genetic factor for religiosity /specifically/ would be nearly impossible to pin down.

As for your anecdotes, the fact they're anecdotes isn't probably what would make me dispute them, more likely I would dispute the idea that anything supernatural was involved. Depending on what kind of theism you have you may or may not find it notable that people all over the world with radically different religious beliefs (plus the new age-ers who thought they were connecting with aliens or something) have many of the same spiritual experiences, but the specifics tend to fit whatever ideas they already believed or were prevalent in their culture.\\
I don't know if you've heard of the god-helmet but you may also find it notable /that you can deliberately cause spiritual experiences by putting a magnet on someone's head/.\\
Given we know these experiences can be triggered by very mundane psychological sources; even if you believe in the supernatural, you have to consider whether a legitimate supernatural event is the most likely thing in the vast majority of cases. Obviously miracles can't be /that/ common or they would have some sort of observable effect, and prayer studies certainly didn't show it to be more effective than placebo.

I'm bad at remembering usernames, so I don't remember if you were there for it, but I've mentioned at least once in what I think was the previous conversation about this topic that's been brought up here what I base my own personal assessment of life and death on. Namely, I base them upon the idea of agency.

As it stands, at this very moment, there is an agent which, under my agency, is sitting in front of a desktop computer, typing this message. If, for any number of reasons, that agent were to cease acting under my agency, and another were to initiate it elsewhere, then from the perspective of my agency, the event would only be good or bad in so far as the difference between agents' abilities to act under my agency, as determined by their physical form, their location in space and time, the side-effects of one agent's cessation and another's initiation on the world, and so on.

Death, from your perspective, is only death from my perspective if my agency is over only one agent, and that agent ceases to act under my agency without replacement (with the qualification that the value of a future agent initiating under my agency after an interstice of zero agents is multiplied by the probability such a future arising).

I also have some points about how whether or not an agent is acting under my agency is determined, which is based at a local level on mutual satisfaction of agency, and at a global level on local connectedness. I can go further into that if you want to hear it at a later time, but it's getting late, and I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule so I can stop missing my morning classes.

That seems to totally miss everything about my writing. Agency, action and even one's memories play absolutely no necessary part in my model. The model is simply about continuous experience and anticipated future experience, you seem to be talking about identity in the sense of the ego, which is not really what this theory is about.

You are clearly using a different meaning of life and death than what my model defines so it's not clear if you actually have anything to say about the topic, except that you like to use different definitions of those words, so it's probably best to clarify about what it is that you are actually trying to make a point about.

One area we likely differ is that you based on your comment don't actually seem to care whether your existence is cut short if something else steps up to continue your goals, I have encountered people with similar positions before who don't actually seem to care about oblivion, and seem to be primarily motivated to live by obligations; however most people are most definitely more concerned with continuing their experience of existing than they are with ensuring their goals are continued towards.

I think my model is, as far as I know the most defensible one for justifying predictions about whether a given course of action will result in oblivion. Actually predicting whether an action will result in people's experience being permanently terminated, seems like the only real stakes of any actual practical value when it comes to philosophical theories of consciousness.

*** I hadn't planned to return to this conversation, but as I was falling asleep last night, I thought of something that I thought you would probably want to know.

It's your position that any discontinuity in the conscious process means death. You said (I think) that you believe this to apply in the case of an emulated human on a computer whose execution is paused and then resumed: As soon as the em is paused, they die. This has some rather startling implications, I'm afraid:

-Firstly: A computer is a series of values stored in memory and a processor that updates them one-at-a-time (or, with N processors/cores, N-at-a-time). It takes a non-zero duration the processor to do this, and there is non-zero duration between updates. If the duration of the discontinuity really is irrelevant, then ems die after each update, while waiting for the next one. This happens many times each second of their existence.

-Secondly, if we are in a computer simulation, the same is neccessarily true for us too.

-Thirdly, your theory seems to assume that physical time is continuous, but this is not known to be the case. Some theories of physics suggest that physics works more like a computer in this respect: That time is not continuous, but increases incrementally, one Planck Time at a time. If these theories are true, then we die every moment of our existence, even if not in a simulation.

Your position is still self-consistent and reality-consistent, given these observations. And if it's true, there isn't really anything we can do about it--we are always dying every moment, and feels just like normal experience. "Don't do X or you'll die," somewhat loses its argumentative force, however. Furthermore, it seems to me that any definition of consciousness which implies that we die every moment without realizing it in the course of ordinary experience without realizing it is not really a good definition of consciousness. Even if it were (somehow) known to be true, it's just not a very useful way of describing things, and on that basis, I find it worth rejecting.

A modification might be made: Instead of requiring strict continuity, you could redefine continuous to mean "continuous iff time is continuous; else, having no discontinuities longer than the smallest physical increment of time." That seems like a defensible re-definition that preserves your theory, in the case that physics is otherwise than we assume. It would mean that we don't die every moment if physics is discontinuous. However, it doesn't improve the outlook at all for ems or for simulation-us. Since the time between computer updates is variable, and dependent on the hardware, and always larger than the Planck time, I don't think there is any redefinition that preserves your intent, is non-arbitrary about the maximum-length permissible discontinuity, and doesn't imply unceasing death for computer-instantiated consciousness. If you think there's a fair chance that we live in a simulation, and you rejected the first definition, then I expect you'll probably reject this one too, for the same reason.

I'd find it interesting to hear your thoughts on this.

**** Well I think the example regarding EM's isn't actually a problem because I don't think updates would necessarily occur like that. I don't think whichever process or processes are vital for experience are as simple as just an on off switch or anything, different parts might be shut off during updates but I doubt you would need to shut off the whole thing at once; effectively I think updates could likely occur more like continuous uploading than destructive uploading.\\
Basically the em scenario is only going to be a problem if you are running a system where you shut the programs down while they're updating, and it assumes there would be any purpose to updating the experiential core (or whatever it is) anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Thirdly, your theory seems to assume that physical time is continuous, but this is not known to be the case. Some theories of physics suggest that physics works more like a computer in this respect: That time is not continuous, but increases incrementally, one Planck Time at a time. If these theories are true, then we die every moment of our existence, even if not in a simulation.
#+end_quote

Well that would only be a problem within particular models, however I have some doubt of the plausibility of any computer-like models like that. For one time doesn't really have absolute simultaneity and whether an event happened before another event isn't something that can be agreed upon between reference frames. Sure time likely has a minimum theoretical span, however in most circumstances it's going to be really bizarre and fuzzy; different parts of the experiential process are likely going to have occurred at slightly different times relative to each other.\\
The thing is i'm not sure the idea you put forth is /even coherent/ in reality, it may only apply to a newtonian model of the universe without relativity or quantum mechanics. The thing is whether time is continuous may not really be a meaningful question at the most fundamental levels of reality; so I can't really guess /what/ that means for my model.

***** For what it's worth, I have a B.S. and an abiding interest in Physics, and I've done a lot of undergrad-level reading about fundamental theories. There may be some reason that's over my head why what I proposed does not work exactly as I described. However, it does seem that a lot of people who know much more about fundamental physics than I do consider something that is /basically/ what I described to be possible. As for the bit about quantized time (or perhaps the quantization of time being equal and truly simultaneous throughout the universe; I couldn't tell what you were referring to here) only being coherent in Newtonian models, I can assure you that's false. If you don't trust my expertise, however, you can do your own research. It's quite interesting.

Regarding the computer and ems: I'm not talking about uploading, updating firmware, or shutting anything off. I'm talking about how computers work. If you emulate a brain, then you have a copy of that brain's entire state, down to the molecular (or atomic, if necessary) level, in the computer's memory. When the brain-process is "running," that means the processor is going around to virtual molecules and updating their virtual positions and momenta according to the appropriate laws of physics. (This is what I meant by "updating.") That's what brain-emulation means. The processor is not infinitely fast, so some finite time passes between one change made by the processor and the next. During that time, the brain that exists in the computer's memory is just sitting there, existing, unchanging.

Now, you've said that if a brain emulation were to be frozen or paused for some time, and later resumed from the same state, this is discontinuity (and therefore death) under your theory. It turns out that the difference between a brain emulation which runs with the full resources and attention of its processor and the pause-unpause scenario is a difference of the duration of the pause, and not a difference in essential kind. This doesn't depend on any weird assumptions about physics, or details of software implementation. It's even true any reasonable choice (and most unreasonable choices) of hardware. If there are brain emulations, and they run on computers, this will be true for them.

This puts you on the horns of a dilemma: Either ems experience death in every moment that they experience anything, or the pause-unpause scenario isn't actually death. You can take the first horn (bite the bullet) or the second (refine or replace your model). I don't particularly care which you take. I just thought you would appreciate knowing that this is where your assumptions--as currently set forth--lead. Especially since you asked for criticism. That's all.

****** Ok regarding ems: I meant that if the update is happening staggered then there's not necessarily a problem. But I'm not imagining a whole brain emulation where you're just simulating the individual particles and they do nothing except when they get updated. Such a process would seem a incredibly inefficient way to simulate a mind anyway.

I'm imagining a system where any momentary halts will happen localized and staggered enough that you can't say the total system is ever stopped at a given time. At the same time you might also say there's always updates happening at any given period of time so things are also continuous in that sense.

As for the stuff about quantized time; I'm not sure how a system where time ticks along by quantized amounts universally would actually be coherent given relativity. Not to mention not every part of the process that experiences is going to be totally coordinated if that's the case, different parts will tick by at slightly different rates and will have to tick at different times.\\
So even with that variety of quantized time you might get out of the problem by the fact the halts to the process are staggered over the system meaning the whole thing never actually halts.\\
Plus there's something of a problem saying that things ever pause and unpause that way, because unless you have some external reference frame that doesn't even really have a clear meaning.

But to clarify I think planck times are likely similar to planck lengths. In that at the most basic levels you would expect lots of superpositions and for things to be fuzzy; in a similar way to the way location and distance is already fuzzy within quantum phenomenon.

If all they want is mindless violence and dungeon looting, your expectations might be too different for you to enjoy a game together.

If the other players are open to more roleplaying, try to get the GM to encourage it, with diplomacy hooks in combat encounters (that can be as simple as having a goblin about to be stabbed by your rogue beg for mercy, making things evolve into a hostage situation with its friends) and other incentives. If the "responsibility" still ends up on your shoulders most of the time, the GM should probably try to focus more on setting up a dialogue with other players, and give them personal incentives for good roleplaying (this merchant has the item your mage needs, but he wants something in exchange that the mage isn't ready to do / give; what to do?).

*** Your problem sounds like an engagement issue. I've experienced this from all three sides: as a GM dealing with unruly players, as an unruly player in a game, and as an exasperated player in a game with a bunch of unruly players, and it's definitely one of the most difficult problems to solve in a tabletop game.

From the unruly player's perspective, the issue is disconnect. They don't care about the outcome of the conflicts in the game, either because they just aren't particularly interested in the plot or because they don't feel their actions matter. This usually means that they either take a backseat (making their actions matter even less), start treating the game as a board game (avoiding the elements that bore them in favour of a more impactful pure-mechanics experience), or deliberately derail the game (making them more engaged because their actions have a noticeable impact, but at the same time making the disconnect even worse).

I've tried a few solutions, mostly trying to filter for people more likely to start and stay engaged, but none of them have really worked. Broadly speaking, I think it's mostly about making the connection between action and consequence as clear as possible. What definitely does /not/ work is forcing the players to engage by punishing lack of it, either by forcing roleplaying encounters or by directly punishing failure to roleplay.

Because we're capable of understanding social interaction without the need for numerical abstraction it seems ungainly to try to make rules for it.

That said, the rules that do try to approach social interaction are atrocious. Bluff, sense motive, and diplomacy are minimized at my table because they're incredible oversimplifications. I suppose I would be open to improvements there.

Upon revision, I think I should clarify that I think rules governing personality are unnecessary (maybe even detrimental) but rules for communication and "social perception" such as lie detection have some potential and should be improved.

** This comment will contain massive spoilers for the game /Life is Strange/. If you are playing, or want to play the game, then I would heavily suggest you avoid reading this comment. Normally, I'd spoiler-text it but then the entire comment would be pretty much black and I don't want to do that. So I'm giving you fair warning here. Spoilers lie ahead.

Ok so, long story short, Life is Strange is the story of a small town girl, the protaganist, who somehow acquires time reversal powers (think Prince of Persia time rewinding as opposed to /Back to the Future/ type travel) and rewinds time to save her best friend, Chloe, from being shot in an altercation in a school bathroom, which you do in the early stages of the game. It's a game sort of like Heavy Rain, so more of an interactive movie than anything else. The game's heavy on allowing you to make your own choices about things, and will give you stats on how you chose compared to the other players.

As the game progresses, Chloe dies several times (with you rewinding to save her each time) in increasingly far fetched (though nothing straight out supernatural) ways. Think Final Destination. Each time, you have to go further and further to save her, compromising your morals just a bit more in some scenarios. The game's climax is a standard "fate is real" sort of thing. Chloe was meant to die in that bathroom at the beginning of the game. Time does not like you mucking with it. Cue supernatural superstorm coming to wipe out your hometown. The game gives you the choice: Go back in time and let Chloe die in that bathroom or allow the storm to wipe out the town. The implication is that, once the storm wipes out the town, the universe will be satisfied and Chloe's fate will 'reset' so if you save her, she'll actually be saved. No fatalistic trolling. So...what choice do you make?

To me, as I'm sure it is to most rationalists, the choice is clear: *Let Chloe die.* There's simply no way to justify sacrificing hundreds (possibly thousands) of lives for one. However, literally every single person I've asked this question of in my life (3 close friends, 4 coworkers who I'd call acquaintances) said they'd save their friend and let the town die. Once I added the caveat that we would assume everyone you know in town is elsewhere and so left inside it are just thousands of people you don't know, the hesitant no's became resounding yes'. And this perplexed me.

I understand the impulse; from a human stand point, we suck at caring for things that aren't right in front of us. I know this. But I just thought, intellectually speaking, everyone would be able to suck it up and rise above their basic nature. And....I was swiftly proven wrong. And also called a bad friend for not being willing to sacrifice hundreds of innocents for my own selfish desires to keep my friend alive. GG.

I mostly wrote this to see what some of your opinions/insights on this would be. And also what you would choose in the scenario. Actually, any and all discussion that could branch off from this is cool with me. Go nuts!

*** I think there are a lot of variables involved, making work about this sort of thing fairly difficult. For example, let's say that the people in sub-saharan Africa and who were brought to the US as slaves were genetically identical to Anglos, but just looked different, or spoke a different language, or something. I'd STILL expect these groups to have below-average IQ. Why? Well, because of non-genetic reasons. Here are a few.

1. *Parasite Load.* This one is pretty well known and needs no explanation.
2. *Poverty in the US specifically affecting them.* If they're the descendants of slaves, they'll have less money due to the way inheritance and wealth mobility works, and money is correlated with IQ. Rich parents spend more on their children to get them good educations, sufficient nutrition, things that promote mental growth etc.
3. *National Poverty in sub-saharan Africa.* It's generally tougher to do well in life and focus on your intelligence when your country is poor. Sub-saharan Africa has many poor countries, so we'd expect lower average IQs even if pops were genetically identical.
4. *Systems and standardized tests that were explicitly developed to be discriminatory.* Less true now than it used to be, but standardized tests (both IQ in particular and college admissions in particular) at one point used to explicitly attempt to help out the dominate race in the US.

I'm sure there are more, but you get the idea. The real issue here is the lack of a control group, as we have in a lot of social science stuff. Perhaps it really is true that people of mixed anglo/african descent (african americans) and also, people of just african descent (people in sub-saharan africa) are less genetically predisposed to intelligence than anglos are. However, if that was true, we'd still never know it, because of all the other stuff that is piled on them anyways. No controls! You need controls!

If something covered in napalm is burning, it's entirely possible the base object is flammable, but how would we know?

Heck, even famous american eugenicist Lewis Terman agrees somewhat:

  "Perhaps a median IQ of 80 for Italian, Portuguese, and Mexican school children in the cities of California would be a liberal estimate. How much of this inferiority is due to the language handicap and to other environmental factors it is impossible to say, but the relatively good showing made by certain other immigrant groups similarly handicapped would suggest that the true causes lie deeper than environment."

*** Man, that guy has an agenda and isn't afraid to push it.

Even ignoring all the other arguments against him, the argument is easily falsifiable because of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][Flynn Effect]] alone. There was a 13.3 point increase in IQ between 1950-1998 for male conscripts in denmark, followed by a 1.3 point decrease between 1998-2004. That's for a very homogenous populations.

That doesn't call into question the actual figures (that whites/asians are slightly above average, hispanics/blacks are below average) but looking at the timespan involved, it's highly unlikely genetic changes alone could have caused that variance in score. Instead, it's likely attributable to some combination of better nutrition, better childhood healthcare, advancements in education, or even just more familiarity with standardized testing.

And it's well known that black and hispanic students in the US are more likely to live in poverty, and thus recieve worse healthcare, worse education, and worse attitudes about schooling.

I wouldn't be surprised if there /were/ IQ differences between races, but the US isn't where they'd show up-- The majority of African Americans should really more accurately be called "mixed race," and the same is true for hispanics.

tl;dr the moderator is a bigot trying to push an easily falsifiable position.

  How long (or short) is that timespan? The argument says "5000 generations", which, at 20 years per generation, is 100k years, way too much. But I can see it happening with 250 generations = 5000 years.
#+end_quote

I literally posted the years involved. 1950 to 2004.

  Because everyone is very mixed?
#+end_quote

My point is that, because we're so mixed, if IQ really was tied to race we'd see a negligible difference between the US "races."

#+begin_quote
  Still, they do show up, in the IQ test averages.
#+end_quote

No, they don't. We see a variation of twenty points at most, when we already know that IQ varies heavily due to stuff like nutrition, education, and financial situation. The statistics are /true/, but there isn't nearly enough long-term data to conclude the difference is because of race, and not some confounding factor.

I'll believe it when someone gives me a study that's controlled for things like socioeconomic condition of parents, region, school district, physical fitness as children, etc. That is to say, I'll probably never believe it because there are so many confounding variables, any single explanation is incredibly difficult to prove.

About 20 points (~1 standard deviation) seems like a pretty significant difference to me.

********* Blacks are a minority group, who tend to have similar economic statuses. I'd predict that whites vary more as the majority group. So in any given situation, the whites and blacks would be largely similar, with some bias in favor of whites. Situations where you'd expect to encounter less intelligent people will be less white-biased, but I don't think the difference is enough that mixed race group of peers will have very different IQs. For example, I'd expect to see black doctors and white doctors have similar intelligences, as well as black garbagemen versus white garbagemen.

********** That does make sense, and it seems like it'd be easy to check. I cannot search at the moment because my lunch break is nearly over, but there must be studies that compare intelligence per race, accounting for economic status/income. I'll try to give that a look when I have some free time.

*********** Note that there's another factor a lot of these studies fail to consider: namely, that because of discriminatory housing practices, black students tend to be in worse school districts than white students with similar economic means.

*** I don't know much about the statistics involved, but I'd like to point out that anyone on this thread is likely to have motivated bias against the data presented in this link (especially since the poster is very passive-aggressive about them).

So I'm expecting other answers to hold the 'article' to higher standards than they would expect from a less controversial article.

*** I think our knowledge of ancient human evolution and migration patterns is still a bit too sketchy for his conclusion to be very strong, but its certainly interesting. The idea that H. Sapiens wasn't as smart as we are now to begin with, and it was our inbreeding with H. Neanderthalensis and H. Denisova that pushed us over the edge is definitely interesting if nothing else.

The problem with his theory I think is that people didn't just migrate to one place and stay there, there was a massive amount of local and long distance trade, even in the ancient world. People travelled, went one place and then had their children return to where their parents were from, had kids and ditched them, there's a lot of genetic crosstalk. Aside from some indigenious tribal groups that managed to very thoroughly isolate themselves on remote islands or deep in jungles, human genetics never really became that isolated from each other. The author makes the argument that these different groups had 5,000 generations in isolation, but they didn't, none of them were really that isolated from each other. Even if the underlying theory he's trying to identify is 100% valid, its a lot deeper and more complex than he's trying to make it out as.

People aren't Galapagos finches, we didn't have nearly that perfectly isolated of an environment from others to allow our genes to diverge that much.

*** I think the presentation is way too abrasive, but the argument sound. I also wish to note that much of the lower IQ of sub-saharan africans is likely because of parasite load and malnutrition.

And mentiong this interpretation of the observations (called, by some, Human Biodiversity), in polite meatspace company is tricky.

**** Thanks, I hadn't thought of parasites, although that may just be a factor of wealth, which I did look into. I'll make sure to check it out.
