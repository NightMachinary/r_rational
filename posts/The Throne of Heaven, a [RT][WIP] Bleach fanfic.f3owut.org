** The author's note in chapter 1 doesn't inspire confidence that I'll be rewarded with a novel plot if I keep reading. Is there a meaningful deviation from canon?

** I found some minor spelling and grammar errors as I was reading - English isn't the author's first language - but they didn't detract from my reading experience with an enjoyable reimagining of the early arcs of Bleach.
