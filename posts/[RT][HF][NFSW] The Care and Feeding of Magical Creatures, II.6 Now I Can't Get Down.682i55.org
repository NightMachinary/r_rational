Newpost here: [[http://sadehall.tumblr.com/post/160083083960/now-i-cant-get-down]]

Clever quote to be posted here soon, in the meantime don't let the unreliable narrators bite - or do if you're into that.

*** I read that more in the sense of a teasing "Is that why your imaginary friend hated us back when he existed?", Not "Is that why Jahova hated us back when he was a tangible entity?"

On the other hand, Lyra started as an imaginary friend, and most polytheistic deities are anthropomorphic, I would not be remotely surprised if most known deities were originally succubi, and heroic humans or demigods being their hosts.

I would absolutely love to see this world's version of Orpheus and Eurydice.

*** This was something I almost actually took out because I think it's unclear to the reader. The answer, of course, is that he's /wrong/, but that his obsession with this issue tells us something about what's happening to him mentally at this moment and represents something that I've noticed to be a pretty common mental failure mode for people (e.g., myself) who end up in extremely out-of-context circumstances. I'm curious to see if anyone's unpicked what, before I go posting about it.

***** I can't say a lot without being spoileriffic (PM for details), but I can say...let's think about the True Sea and how that works, and what our narrator may have missed looking at it and the fact that "Spirit" is a thing you can distill out of it.

I will also let slip that you can definitely find electromagnetism and baryonic matter in the the True Sea, but we've already seen this.

...

...right?

** Nice update. More world building, with tie ins back to real world religion stuff, and of course the standard, kinky sexual byplay we've come to expect from this story. I must admit, I'm still more than a bit confused by why Lyra seems limited in what she says, but I suppose I missed something or I'll simply learn why that is in time.

Any plans on what sort of update schedule you'll be looking at moving forward?

*** I'm really trying to get back on the Fridayish thing, where 'ish' means 'hopefully Thursday night really'.

As to the speech limitation thing, it's sort of a riddle about /either/ how magic works in Pandemonium, how our narratrix is made, or both. The answer is there in something she says all dramatically talking to no one in particular at one point...but all will be revealed soon enough. On a Fridayish.

#+end_quote

But apparently not out loud? Another thing pointing to how her mental censorship is speech-focused instead of general.

#+begin_quote
  How uppity can I sound? “Maaaaybe?”
#+end_quote

And "no" is not in her vocab anymore even when she tests its limits. Someone better be spiked for this until the spikes grow spikes for him daring to not gracefully receive them.

#+begin_quote
  if I was an animal like that cacodemon we saw,I'd take one taste of you and it'd tear me to bits.

Duplicate word.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Expecto Patronum', you have to go look the words up to really know and yet it kinda feels like you know what the spell's going to be as soon as you hear the words
#+end_quote

I somehow feel like HPMOR readers will have a more intuitive understanding of this feeling :D

#+begin_quote
  Ugh, listen to me, who's topping this? It's just, I know what I'm doing...
#+end_quote

Oh girl. A sub is allowed to teach an inexperienced dom how to tie knots that are both secure and riskless. Would be useful to be able to let go of who's topping at least during conversations that are both constructive /and/ vital, wouldn't it?

#+begin_quote
  I wish I could just hand you an iconography sampler. Is there a way to communicate this so you'll be coming up with the idea on your own, instead of following instructions? That'll help so much, if I can just...eh, nothing for it.
#+end_quote

So the dislike for teaching seems to e her own personal personality trait, not tied to an actual dislike of being taught by her master. Maybe the first distinctly independent trait I noticed. Interesting. If only it weren't such a sad and annoying one ;P

#+begin_quote
  “Try to remember you're not in church, Altar Boy.
#+end_quote

Wait, what? So all that forced 'Master' speech even when she didn't want to just required that she try a bit harder? That's definitely not how it seemed in the previous chapter.

#+begin_quote
  below (I thought, before, that the ship must have leveled out as we boarded, but no: we've been diving straight down the whole time, Lyra and I have just been standing on impossible artificial gravity rocks as we are now) us
#+end_quote

I would recommend against separating the phrase "below us" in the middle and in favor of instead putting the parenthesis after the "us". As an attachment to the "below" the "us" seems to lose its meaning in the flow when one has read so many other words in between.

#+begin_quote
  “That's waterfalls. From the back.”
#+end_quote

I have difficulty understanding what you're going for here It doesn't seem as simple as a waterfall flowing in the wrong direction.

#+begin_quote
  “Dont keep me...” Blech, pillow-stuff. God, so picky.
#+end_quote

So... did the censorship allow her to start the sentence and utter enough of it to be a demand of some kind but then somehow not finish it into a meaningful command?

All in all another fun chapter. I hope I didn't come over as too nitpicky. I pretty much just quoted and commented as I read through whenever something peaked interest or otherwise made me mull. Kind of neglected to point out the parts that simply made me go "wow!" or "cool!" or "hot!" but rest assured that those definitely existed.

I feel the need to word-of-god this because it seems like what's going on with the voice bondage stuff isn't clear: she could have easily said anything from "don't wanna" to "fuck no" to "Okay Master." here. "Maaaybe" was just what she calculated to be the SAMmiest thing she could do in the circumstance.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Word-of-god on what's going on: yes, she dislikes teaching her master even though as you say there's no reason a more experienced sub can't to say nothing of shouldn't teach good and safe technique whenever it makes sense (as it very does here). What this reveals (although its been a bit buried in the text) is that although she has quite a lot of book learning and knows the language, as we've seen just in the previous exposition-orgy she's been avoiding actually /playing/ very much and so is a well-educated but inexperienced submissive and didn't really believe all the people who told her what you just said about teaching.

#+begin_quote
  not tied to an actual dislike of being taught by her master.
#+end_quote

Did you mean "actual dislike of teaching her master" (which preference she's going to get mighty much opportunity to reconsider as things progress), or what you typed (in which case I've misunderstood something)?

#+begin_quote
  Wait, what? So all that forced 'Master' speech even when she didn't want to just required that she try a bit harder? That's definitely not how it seemed in the previous chapter.
#+end_quote

Word-of-god: it happens when she's not paying attention or actively working against it with concentration. This and the next hing you called out...

#+begin_quote
  So... did the censorship allow her to start the sentence and utter enough of it to be a demand of some kind but then somehow not finish it into a meaningful command?
#+end_quote

...may give some more idea of what's going on with her voice. Thus indicating that whatever is doing this isn't doing it at the level of rewriting her thoughts, but rather responding to her actions. She was talking fast here because of rattling off instructions, and so outran it for a moment.

And it's unfortunately not clear from the text whether she's responding to a powerful negative experience or something more like a somatically expressed surfacing of unconscious knowledge (see Blindsight by Peter Watts, which is itself excellent rational cosmic horror).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Seeing as I had a hard time imagining it too, I'm not surprised, especially since several impossible things are happening. What they're seeing is a freestanding airbubble submerged in the Sea, several miles along its longest dimension. There are some asteroids stuck on its boundary, and gravity is arranged paralell to the boundary so that where the water interfaces with the air bubble there's a net flow that creates the appearance of waterfalls from within the bubble. They're seeing all this from a viewpoint outside the bubble, submerged in the True Sea.

...that's not any clearer. Fuck.

/waves hands/ it's not how gravity works

#+begin_quote
  I hope I didn't come over as too nitpicky. I pretty much just quoted and commented as I read through whenever something peaked interest or otherwise made me mull.
#+end_quote

Not at all! I've already filed you under "useful mostly negative criticism" but /much more importantly/ you're asking the kinds of questions I'm trying to get people thinking about overall with this book and I really appreciate your attempt to take what's going on as an actual scene an actual dominant and submissive played out and not just a hot fantasy. I'm trying to write that - real BDSM with fantastic situations, toys, and characters with certain superpowers, but real play and real consequences (which we haven't had time in the story yet to see really, keep in mind they're still on day 0).

So I really, really value your commentary.
