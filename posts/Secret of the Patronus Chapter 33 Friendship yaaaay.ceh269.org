It's nice Harry has a friend, even if it is imaginary and also an actual troll.

** How Harry manages to bring up such amusement and frustration at the same time is beyond me. His attempts to rationalise have gone off the deep end, and "Science" isn't exactly helping with his denial either, the damn plot device.

It's been a while since we saw a Daphne and Neville scene. Incredibly fluffy (I keep on hearing the Smash Mouth version even though that canonically comes after fifth year), but I guess that's just what was needed to contrast Harry's mind melting either side of it.

I wanted to ask about the use of "Gemelo" last chapter; shouldn't that be the Gemini charm? Also in the first section Harry thinks

  stop eating lunch in the cafeteria,

and unless there's been some renovations at Hogwarts, I'm pretty sure this should be the Great Hall instead?

*** Ha ha, I always imagined Harry would royally suck at dealing with romantic feelings. He'd rationalize himself into an anxious mess, in part because he's paranoid about being vulnerable, not to mention emotions don't make any sense to him. They're like his Achilles' heel.

Also, this is kinda spoilers, but Science isn't just a plot device. We'll see more of her later. :)

Gemelo is the word for twin in Spanish, so I must have gotten them mixed up. Fixed it, and also the cafeteria thing. Thanks for pointing them out!

** Might want to redirect the ff.net link to chapter 1 instead of 34.
