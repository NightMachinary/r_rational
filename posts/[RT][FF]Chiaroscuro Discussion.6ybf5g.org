So I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro][Chiaroscuro]] and am all caught up on it. Was hoping to talk about it with people.

A bit confused on the technique Shikamaru is trying to learn from his dad. What does it do? Am I right in thinking that [[#s][spoiler CH 56]] or is the author implying he made something similar?


** that thought never crossed my mind. Black Zetsu is something that existed for centuries in canon I would believe the same applied here.

I consider chiaroscuro my favorite Naruto fanfic. Infireforged was a close second but it was discontinued as author finished university.

DO you know other Naruto fics on the same level?

**** Just a warning time braid has graphic child torture and rape and Team Anko.... takes a weird turn.

I wouldn't call geniuses of hard work rational but it is hilarious

Yes, generally the factors of quality are:

1. Execution of the page-to-page writing (the "juiciness", if you will - I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]] is an alright example of this).
2. Pacing.
3. Competent rationalist fiction.
4. Interesting premise.

Although #1 and #2 /might/ be the same thing, and #3 and #4 could likely be swapped (because not all good fiction is rationalist fiction - although non-rationalist fiction basically /requires/ #1 or #4). But that's something approaching the priorities of a decent author.

*** Team 8 is well done, I think, but on extended hiatus. It focuses a lot on Naruto, and especially Hinata, working through their isolated/abusive backgrounds. The Naruto-Hinata-Shino team dynamic works well, certainly better than canon's love-hate triangle. Team Anko has them too as I recall, [[#s][except]]

Lighting Up the Dark is fun, but will probably never be finished.

If you like seeing the true power of the Multiple Shadow Clone technique, I'd suggest either The Waves Arisen (complete) or A Drop of Poison (incomplete).

** I think it was a Black Zetsu is a shadow-"class" minion of Kaguya? I think so because Shikamaru did the shadow-bonding thingmajig it resonated with him? Any less rational and I would try to Unsong Metaphor it, but I'm not really sure.

** I'm not a fan of the Cerberus bit. The way this fanfic treats death and seeing loved ones again is positively empty.
