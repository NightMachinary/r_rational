First off, thanks everyone for clarifying the rules re: teleportation for me.

​

I'm finally caught up, and I'm a little sad I missed some of the live discussions for such a great work! I'm interested to see what predictions ya'll have, both positive and negative, since by the author's estimates we're in the last handful of chapters.

[High/Med/Low] = Confidence level

- [High] Zorian's going to use his one hundred telepathy relays to construct a city-wide illusion that he died for Zach. Zach won't believe it at first, but Haslhush will present Zach a letter from Zorian that spells out why it was necessary and that he went into the battle knowing he would die, that he'd rather die than Zach, etc. Only then will Zach fully believe it.
- [Med-High] They will not permanently kill QI. There's been very little discussion into finding his phylactery, other than "we have more important things to worry about." Plus, given that nobody103 has indicated that he may write a sequel, QI is a natural villain that ZZ could work against without the aid of time magics.
- [Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.
- [Med] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.
- [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.
- [Med] Kirielle will be kidnapped by RR at some point in the encounter - she may already have been. There's been more than one mention since Zorian exited the time loop about how dangerous it would be to have her in Cyoria.
- [Low-Med] There is another method to summoning Panaxeth that neither Zorian or Zach are aware of, but RR has been keeping a secret just in case ZZ save all the shifter children.
- [Low] Zorian will suffer some type of permanent magical disability from the fight, owing to the angels trying to curb some of their influence in the world. Mostly this prediction is predicated by Zorian's foreshadowing in one of the recent chapters about how convenient it'd be for the angels if he and Zach died.
- [Low] Both RR and Silverlake will survive the immediate battle, and one or both of them will enact some type of permanent long-lasting damage to Zach or Zorian before the month ends and Panaxeth kills them.

*** Great, thanks. Quick glancing over it seems like most people agree that Zorian mind magic on Zach is a certainty, though I think now we have more evidence to believe it's going to be an illusion of some kind. Also see that I'm not the only one who places a medium to high confidence that QI is going to survive.

  [High] Zorian's going to use his one hundred telepathy relays to construct a city-wide illusion that he died for Zach. Zach won't believe it at first, but Haslhush will present Zach a letter from Zorian that spells out why it was necessary and that he went into the battle knowing he would die, that he'd rather die than Zach, etc. Only then will Zach fully believe it.
#+end_quote

I had in mind that this has too much detail. Zorian can use his telepathy relays to construct something other than an illusion, or he may construct an illusion through other means. The illusion might not be city-wide. Someone else might construct the illusion. He may construct the illusion that he died for Zach, for Taiven, or that he simply died. Zach might believe it directly, or might have lingering doubts. Haslush might present Zach with a letter, or with a message, or might play no role because Zach saw it with his own eyes. Someone other than Haslhush might present Zach with a letter. The letter might contain something else other than what you hypothesize. Etc.

I'm thinking that something is likely to happen which falls into the broad class of scenarios which are somewhat similar to the one you describe, but that the specific one is not that likely in itself. This reminds me of the: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy]].

And yet I'm not really a hardcore fan of MoL but a casual reader (for example, I don't really remember who Haslhush is), so this is not the hill I'll die on. Anyways, I'll offer you a 10:10 (€) bet that at least one detail in your prediction doesn't happen, as judged by [[/u/DaystarEld]].

***** I understand and I'm happy to take this bet with a few caveats. Since I didn't write that prediction with putting my money where my mouth is, I'm going to offer a few gentle qualifiers which I hope you'll agree is reasonable.

- The letter may not be directed specifically at Zach, but WILL be engineered for the purpose of convincing Zach that it's the real deal.

- Hashlush may indeed deliver a message to Zach and not a letter, but the message he delivers WILL come from the letter.

Other than that, I'm fine with it. Zorian will construct an illusion, Zach will disbelieve it, and then the letters Hashlush has will be used to convince Zach. Sound fair?

EDIT: Oh, also, I didn't mean that the illusion will consume the entire city, but that it is designed to take place at any point in the city. My thinking is that Zorian cannot know where Zach will be when he needs to “die” but is prepared for it to be anywhere in Cyoria

******* Sure, let me try.

Zorian will use his 100 telepathy relays to construct an illusion of his death somewhere in Cyoria for Zach. The illusion will be localized to Zach's location, but will be in the city. Zach will initially disbelieve this. Hashlush will deliver a message to Zach from Zorian convincing Zach of Zorian's death. That information will come from the sealed letters, though may not directly be addressed to Zach. At this point, Zach will be entirely convinced. This will ultimately serve as a successful subversion of the divine contract.

I am very much a Zorian/Taiven shipper (even if only platonically), over any of the other possibilities. I really don't want her to die.

  - [Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.

Imo, the firedrake's already has its moment against Veyers. It probably won't have another one.

  - [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.

:/ Narratively, probably Xvim, but at the same time, he's more competent. But at the same time, he knows about the loop and is facing the upper tier mages. Eh.

With an author like nobody103, it's hard to predict what exactly is going to happen, though it will seem obvious in hindsight. Typically, there's always a spin the reader doesn't guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Great point re: Bryn. I hadn't thought about it like that, but you're right. I'd revise that to a [Low] confidence prediction.

I have a feeling they will destroy him during combat, the conclusion will roll out LoR style, and then right there at the very end there will be one last ominous paragraph on how IQ is still alive and makes plans to go after of Zach & Zorian.

I kinda doubt it, considering the scale of everything going on. I doubt very much he and the salamander could do much even with the right conditions. But that would be one hell of a moment.

#+end_quote

I would hate to be right, but I'm betting on Kirielle. During the time loop we found out a lot about her in bits and pieces and she was one of the characters that hanged the most with Zorian without having to do with the main plot. Zorian warmed up to her after finding why she always wanted to hang out with him, and we had one scene immediately after he came back about protecting her and one more when we find out RR&Co. were planning to ambush Zorian's family. If someone is gonna pull the feels strings, it's her.

  [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.

I'm betting on both.

See above.

  [Low-Med] There is another method to summoning Panaxeth that neither Zorian or Zach are aware of, but RR has been keeping a secret just in case ZZ save all the shifter children.

I'm very much waiting for the giant curveball that will sidestep all their preparations. Either that or a Xanatos Speed Chess Gambit Pileup.

#+end_quote

I'm thinking the moment that they win, the angels will try to tie the loose ends and Zarch & Zorian will have to find a way to stalemate them into a non aggression deal.

#+begin_quote
  [Low] Both RR and Silverlake will survive the immediate battle, and one or both of them will enact some type of permanent long-lasting damage to Zach or Zorian before the month ends and Panaxeth kills them.
