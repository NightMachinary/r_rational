Let's say you find out time travel exists, all you know is someone can time travel and they are possibly hostile towards you. you know paradoxes can not exist. how would you ensure your safety ?

And how would you Defeat someone who can time travel?

** How do you defend against a time traveler? Easy mode: the same way you defend against any lone attacker. Hard mode: exhaust their time-travel budget.

First, be hard to find for a while (go on vacation under a fake name, etc.), ideally without letting on that you know you're being hunted.

Then, pop up in an obvious way (register to attend a conference, send out a social media invite "Hey, I'm back!" to all your acquaintances, etc.).

When the enemy seizes the opportunity to go after you, it turns out you got someone else to play your body double. That's when your hidden friends or bodyguards jump out to grab the time assassin. (Make sure your "reappearance" is at an indoor conference or party, so an attacker has to get close to you to grab or shoot.)

To cover up the records in the future, get your friends to report your "death" in the papers, and go underground with a new name from then on.

It's easier if the traveler thinks the future can't be changed, that is, all records they have on you are trustworthy. Then a fake obituary will "force" the traveler to go after you then, since they "know" that's when they kill you.

Hard mode: the enemy may have (a) future technology or (b) information from past tries to kill you.

Now you need decoys. Body doubles, fake sightings, changed vacation plans, whatever. Get the enemy to waste attempts, waste lots of attempts. Get them to go after you in several different times and places, each time discovering you're not there, so that you can get an idea of their capabilities.

Because your best weapon against a time traveler... is their budget.

Time travel's expensive. Run down their budget.

No, really. You know time travel is hard. How do you know this? Because your world isn't already overrun with time travelers and poorly-explained jumps in technology.

So the traveler probably doesn't get that many attempts, nor to bring in that much future technology.

Ironically, this means your ideal strategy against a time traveler is to /run out the clock./

You just need clues what their particular limited clock is: tries to kill you, time spent in the past, amount of technology used.

Oh, you think they get infinite loops? Sure, that's a good movie. But rationally, your world doesn't look like a world where people time travel an infinite number of times, does it? So: run out the enemy's budget.

Now, there is another great weapon against a time traveler...

The other time travelers.

Did you think there was only one? That makes no sense. No technology has ever had only one user. So you can probably find traces of other travelers and make contact.

The only way there could be only one time traveler is if, somehow, you're super-duper important, and so the time-travel budget for your historical period is all being assigned to you.

But if you're that important, then you're worth negotiating with, not just senselessly attacking.

Either way, if someone is spending their time-travel opportunity on attacking you, you can pretty much guarantee that the person attacking you isn't the brains of the time travel operation.

Think about it. Suppose you had the chance to change 1930. How dumb would you have to be to put "shoot Hitler" as the /only/ change you tried to make? Pretty dumb, or at least pretty subordinate - either way, not the true authority.

Anyone who can work around paradox enough to kill you should be able to work around paradox enough to do better things than kill you.

So - set up body doubles. Run down the enemy budget. Try to provoke the idiot time traveler into talking about just why they want to hurt you.

And then set up negotiations - with the real bosses, who aren't the idiot that's after you.

** This needs a few more constraints. Is this just an otherwise normal non-magical/supernatural world? In general, you're fucked because time travel is super OP.

What alternative goals does the defender and time traveler have here? Just survive? The most reasonable way I can imagine though is if you can somehow hide your identity and location at all time. If the time travel has information, that's all they need to kill you. So the time traveler's antagonist couldn't let his real name/birth certificate or any information about where he is be easy knowledge to obtain.

*** I assumed the "no paradoxes" mean they can't change the the past, thus you just need to protect your information going forward, your birth certificate isn't that big a liability because they can't go back and kill you as a baby. You would still probably want to destroy it and the government records so they can't use it to track you going forward but it isn't an instant game over like it would be if paradoxes were possible.

** Paradoxes being impossible means that events have to play out the way they did originally? Assuming the hostile enemy is in the future, falsify information about the present so that they try to act on incorrect information when avoiding paradoxes and thus make mistakes. Also, erase information about yourself so that they can't look you up in the future. Even more cleverly, falsify information (that is in your future and their past) that you want to come true, such that in trying to avoid paradoxes, they make your information become true.

For example, make a memorable false obituary for yourself dated in the far future (or better yet if you have programming/social engineering skills, set it up to be automatically posted at a far future date), so that time travelers will believe you cannot die before that date without causing a paradox. To make it work well, you will also need to ensure that any actual information about your death is erased.

** Immediate thoughts, setting the interesting 'paradoxes can not exist' stipulation aside for the moment:

So, you've just learned that there's a person with time travel power who's (possibly) hostile towards you.

If you coincidentally already have a rock-solid past that they have no easy way of finding out about, then great! This presumably means that they already have no knowledge of your identifying details (since otherwise they could just go back a day or so to when you were clueless)--KEEP IT THAT WAY. Let them be hostile to you without ever allowing yourself to do anything that would let them gain information about who you are, no matter what.

What if they know who you are already, though? Then the moment they go through time is the moment you lose the initiative completely. Any ability to change the past is the ability to muck about with the world with you none the wiser as to what they want to do to you, since you've only just learned. DON'T LET THEM TIME TRAVEL.

Further 'don't let them time travel' thoughts: fake their future. In a book called 'Paradox', someone assassinated people who could see future memories by planting entire simulated futures into their minds first. Here, act as fast as you can to stop the possible enemy from having a chance to time travel to the past while *also* being prepared to spin a convincing alibi for them that they survived significantly longer. (Points for style if you can plant clues in the future that the person went undercover for a period of time and then popped up as a new identity, except for that other identity to actually be their own person. Failing that, just have them prepared for their own possible future death at a time and place completely different from when you actually strike.) Keep in mind that the normal-chronology police should not be underestimated when it comes to acts against others, depending how much normal-chronology social power (or other power) you can freely wield. Obtaining the ability to time travel for yourself could be helpful.

Paradox-aversion thoughts: As a starting point, consider the possibility that you're effectively already dead--there's a secret poison or other trick already planted inside you that only lacks immediacy for the sake of avoiding paradox. More generally: get an idea of what defines the limits of a paradox. Is this "I actually can't time travel at all, because a few grains of sand would shift and the gravitational waves would influence the particles that would later time travel and that would be a paradox", or is this a special locked-in state that isn't applied to all parts of the timeline consistently?

Keep in mind that even if everything is locked in, trying to change your subjective past through present actions is still reasonable, as with a deterministic-future perspective and Newcomb's problem. "Am I to be a puppet of fate without implanted poison who stops a time traveller who wants to plant it or am I to be a puppet of fate with implanted poison who doesn't even try to stop the time traveller who plants it?". Making your predetermined choices according to your own preferences is how you find out the predetermined shape of the future.

I'm afraid my thoughts about how to deal with a paradox-limited time traveller go straight to "Okay, what exactly are the time traveller's limitations? If I'm the time traveller, what are MY limitations? If I try to muck about with the past, how do I tell which actions violate causality and won't be allowed, and which actions are fine? I can think of lots of actions which obviously violate causality--surely I can think of lots of actions which don't obviously violate causality, but are mutually exclusive and so can have only one set not violate causality? How do I tell the difference, how does it get decided?". Determine /that/ and maybe there's quite a bit more to work with. (Really no easy way out other than the new-timeline resolution...)

Edit: More thoughts, backtracking. No paradoxes means that whatever you're about to do when you time travel already happened. Another way of looking at this is that you can predict what sort of time travel you will do by checking the state of the world--whatever time travel you do will already have left its effects, so it doesn't matter whether you know it or not. Everything suits you because of and to the degree of effort that you put into detecting and time-travel-implementing self-serving modifications in the future. For someone with a hostile time traveller, you could likewise check for actions taken against yourself to check whether the time traveller will successfully act against you, but realistically a time traveller who had the chance to not be defeated by you could already have killed you in the past and dropped off a coded message to their future self that they'd better kill that person to avoid unfortunate consequences. Worried about the original source of information for the time loop? Does the concept even have meaning for a paradox-free world in which the consequences of time travel have already happened? There is no 'there was a problem, so I changed the past, so the past was already changed'. There are only actions in the past which you're going to make anyway, and whatever reasons for your actions in the past you'll be satisfied with making them. If you're the sort of person who's happy acting as your own puppet, maybe you'll have a particularly happy existence. If you're the sort of person who isn't, maybe there won't be that many messages to yourself, or maybe they'll be really convincing ones.

I'm going in circles a bit--time to stop for the moment.

** Look up your future obituary. Looking at the future causes events to lock. Then plan to fake your death if your funeral is going to be too early.

I guess this presupposes that hostility means death. Instead dedicate a fair amount of money to a data time capsule that you log in acts of major aggression, retrieve it from a point sufficiently far in the future, and avoid the listed event, falsifying it for your future self to watch out for. With any luck you'll ensure a stable timeloop where you warn yourself of events that you never actually suffer through.

Fight foresight with foresight.

** Exactly what does it mean, that no paradoxes can exist?

Does that mean that:

- It is not possible to change the past
- It is possible to change the past, but not so much that it has much of an effect on the present
- It is possible to change the past, but not so much that it prevents you from being born and deciding to attempt those same changes to the past?

In the first case, you're (mostly) okay. You can't stop the time traveller from coming back and doing what he always would have done; defend yourself as against any lone attacker. (/He/ can't stop himself, either).

In the second case, your best defense is to publish (after the fact) every last thing you found out about time travel from this guy. That means that, by merely /revealing/ himself to you, he's triggering a long-lasting change in the timeline... so he can't reveal himself to you. Thus, he can't attack you in any way that allows you to figure out that you are being attacked by a time traveller.

The third case is a bit more tricky, because he /can/ make changes - he just can't retroactively prevent his own existence, and he probably /does/ have access to news footage of the time in question, which gives him a powerful informational advantage. This can be turned against him, if you can find some non-obvious way to base your future actions on his present actions (or his present location) - as he moves about, he will see the futures change and with no clear reason /why/. This will disorientate him, and hopefully allow you to achieve your aim(s) before he sorts it out.
