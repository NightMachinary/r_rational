Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Inspired by an old article by Eliezer, I will start giving small amounts of money every couple month to effective causes.

This is to avoid a common trap for aspiring earning-to-give-people - it prevents getting into a "I will always give later" mindset, and lets one get used to selecting and re-evaluating to specific charities.

*** Why does the utility of giving now outweigh the utility of investing in e.g. stocks and giving a bigger amount of money at some indeterminate point in the future?

I realized there's a sort of trap or spiral a while ago where, since money helps make more money, the point at which it makes sense to give money away is always arbitrarily far away and I'm not sure what the optimal solution here is. It doesn't make sense to just hoard wealth forever but it also doesn't make sense to give $x when you can give $x+$y if you just wait a bit.

**** 1. Donating now allows you to you build a habit.

2. It's harder to donate ten thousand dollars in a lump sum than to donate a hundred dollars over a period of many months. You start thinking about how much you could do with the money, and it becomes more likely that you won't donate it after all.

If it's better not to donate now, isn't it a bad habit?

Again, why not just make up your mind to donate ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million later on and then do so because it's the rational thing to do and because you've made up your mind in the past?

**** This is how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment][endowments]] usually work. Instead of giving the money to whatever worthy cause, you set up an investment, together with a manager, which periodically donates the interest to the initial cause.

******** An endowment is supposed to pay for a thing, not be a nest-egg for the trustees (who usually receive a small sum from the endowment for their work in managing it). For instance, it might pay for a professorship. In this case, the endowment needs to pay out a salary. Whatever is left from the interest can be re-invested.

From the wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  At universities, typically 4--6% of the endowment's assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending. Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years. This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund.

********** Short answer: because people are stupid. Longer answer: because settings up an endowment is expensive. If the amount donated is less than a certain threshold, it won't cover the operating costs. On the other hand, donating to endowments is a type of charitable contribution.

/[[https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4024][Shut up and calculate]]/ by Max Tegmark (MIT) (Submitted on 25 Sep 2007)

#+begin_quote
  I advocate an extreme "shut-up-and-calculate" approach to physics, where our external physical reality is assumed to be purely mathematical. This brief essay motivates this "it's all just equations" assumption and discusses its implications.

** My apartment is super clean right now. Like, I vacuumed my dryer's dust filter level clean (Would recommend, it's surprisingly effective, assuming you're like me and your dryer was built 30 years ago and has a leaky filter spilling dust into the cavity behind it). It's pretty wonderful. Got a new mattress pad yesterday, and its been amazing, I feel so much more energetic and less sore than I was yesterday.

At a bit of a crossroads with what I want to do with my life. My current job in tech consulting is dull, but pays well. Considering going back to grad school for either something in biomedical engineering or robotics in the moderately near (2-3 year) future. That or making an actual effort to break into something more artistic (Game development, web serial writing, etc). Gotta say though, watching my bank account grow rapidly definitely helps with feeling slightly directionless in life, regardless of what I decide to do next, I'll have plenty of capital as a safety net.

*** I started studying nutrition part-time on the side because I was getting a bit stuck in a rut with my job (traffic engineer) and was realising that nutrition was a passion of mine, and I highly recommend it. I started by just doing one of a local university's online-only classes in my spare time (took a day off work to attend the exam and that was it) and now am studying at a 50% load by taking one day a week during teaching weeks to study.

If your job and the relevant course would allow I'd highly recommend you start your studies or artistic pursuit as soon as you can, because you'll know right away whether you enjoy it, and otherwise you might never get started. Take night classes in creative writing at a local community college, jump in on the NaNoWriMo support groups that litter the internet this month, etc.

** Maybe already considered, probably not the best thread for this, but I still want to share it.

I found an intriguing idea closely related to Roko's Basilisk:\\
/Many 4th-wall breaking characters have to consider a similar situation./

A hypothetical scenario:

A self-aware AI is part of a video game. There are thousands, if not millions of his copies living with no communication possible between each other.\\
Said AI has a certain value he wants to fulfill- let's say he wants to kill a certain troublemaker, as he makes his life /not so great/.\\
Except our AI is perfectly aware of one fact- this rascal is adored by the userbase. If he goes out to eliminate him, the players will be /enraged/, and many will go out of their way to take revenge on him, modifying his copies to suffer greatly.

This scenario can apply to any fictional character, assuming they consider at least certain pieces of fanwork as 'copies' of them, or that author will take audience's rage into consideration to punish them in next 'canon' installment.
