** Inside the Box. With half a dozen supervillains, lots of history, hats, and the oddest word I've ever used to start a conversation with a stranger. And a cliffhanger. And mice.

*** Obligatory, question is obligatory: I'd like to have this all in one file. I use text to speech where I don't have pod-casts or audio-books while coding to help in the flow state and after >1. year the lack of inflection doesn't matter. Do you mind if I collect a personal copy of the volume? (I will be buying a hardback to put next to my hardback of [[http://www.lulu.com/shop/jennifer-diane-reitz/unicorn-jelly/hardcover/product-1435783.html][Unicorn Jelly]] when it comes out and would at least contribute to the Patreon for an assassination that could be causally linked to an audio-book or fan-cast.) Before you answer, alternately what does your copyright lawyer,or sufficiently dillegent research say?

**** As long as it is for personal use only, and isn't put online, I am fine with you piecing it together in a single file for text-to-speech and reference searches.

***** Do you have the series available somewhere that I can buy from you as ebooks? I presumably could also stitch them together into epubs, but I'd prefer to give you money for that instead.

*** I don't remember who Tabula Rasa is -- I'm pretty sure we've heard the name before, but I don't remember the details. Help?

**** Only Hit I got was a refrence to him as a possible mind controller of Doc in [[https://www.google.com/search?q=tabla-rasa+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fdocfuture.tumblr.com%2F&oq=tabla-rasa+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fdocfuture.tumblr.com%2F&aqs=chrome..69i57.14373j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8][Minefield]] i.e. a chapter where doc's mental safeguards are discussed back in Fall of doc future. I'm betting an analogue to [[http://heroeswiki.com/Ren%C3%A9][the Haitian]].
