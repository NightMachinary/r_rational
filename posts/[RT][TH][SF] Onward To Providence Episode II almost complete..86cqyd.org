In case you are not on the r/r discord I've been updating my little story every two days.

Each update is between 1k-2k words and contains a small illustration (or it's a sequential image update with fewer words but a lot more pictures).

It is a sci-fi romp via narratives that so far dip into xenofiction, transhumanism, alt history and alt physics.

Critique and praise appreciated, it helps feed my writing.


** This is really very good, and I recommend anyone thinking about giving it a go to do so - it seems like some very well thought out universe-building, from what's been shown so far.
