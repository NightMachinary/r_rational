Did anyone else read this? Not a deliberately rational/rationalist work by any means, but I found it interesting how they presented the North Korean leadership as rational actors acting on miscalibrated beliefs and confidence levels, contrasted with the less-than-rational decision process of their adversary. I also enjoyed the (non-fictional) explanation of the conflicting incentive structures between the deterrence value and actual utility of missile defence weapons.


** It's very good, and it seems like an important contribution to reducing the risk of an accidental nuclear war (or it would be if people in the Trump administration and the US nuclear missile forces would read it).

My one criticism is that the technique of using slightly re-edited first person accounts from other events breaks down in one section, because the tone and style just isn't right (I'm not going to say the section in case I only noticed this because I saw the sourcing in the footnotes. I'd recommend not looking at the footnotes until after you've read the whole book).

I get that the author used that technique to underline how the events he depicts are largely based on events that have already happened, but the sections where he invents details and dialogue more freely are just as plausible. He's a good enough writer that I think he should have edited the testimonies he uses a bit more for style.

It's definitely a rational work, in the sense that it depicts clearly how the chain of events arises from people acting within flawed systems and trying to do the best with the information and incentives they have (even if some are less than rational actors and make their decisions based on bad sources of information like Fox News).

I guess you would call the genre "systems fiction".

This book makes me wish that more rational fiction writers were trying to set stories in the real world, rather than writing fanfic or fantasy.

It seems like the success of HPMOR means a lot of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] writers see "fanfic of an existing media property" as almost the default choice for rational writing. Now, for Yudkowsky's goal of popularising general rationalist concepts to younger readers, it made sense to rewrite a hugely popular media YA series. But we're now at the point where I'm not sure we need yet another rationalist reimagining of Strawberry Panic or whatever (or maybe I just don't like the type of properties that most of the rational fanfic is based on).

Of course, I understand that it's way easier to deal with the rules of magic or quasi-magical SF technology than to do the huge amount of research you'd need for a book like this, so what I'm suggesting is probably unrealistic for unpaid writers.

**** Around half of the force stationed in South Korea during the exercises (~40000) is lost in the initial North Korean tactical nuclear attack, an unknown number (along with ~2 million civilians) in the nuclear attacks against the US mainland, and "hundreds" in the counterattack against North Korea.

*** I'm kind of wondering how a book by a random author would contribute meaningfully to reducing a risk that could be incurred by an organization with more resources, intel, and institutional knowledge than said author could ever hope to have. Rest assured, no country acts on information controlled and distributed by its own privately-owned civilian media companies, despite what social media comments might say.

There hasn't been any accidental nuclear war yet, and that is mostly due to the high levels of responsibility and rationality demonstrated by the nuclear-capable superpowers. Mutually Assured Destruction is a thing, a sort of extremely cold, lethal rationality cranked up to 11.

According to another reply in this thread by the OP, the conflict uses tactical nuclear attacks by the North on South Korea. This would /never/ happen in reality due to the cultures involved--neither Korea wants to /destroy/ the other, they both have the desire to re-unite as one Korea (though obviously under their own government, not the other's). While one side *MIGHT* consider retaliating if the other started it, neither would strike first with such weapons. North Korea nuking South Korea out of nowhere would be for them like Arizona nuking California by surprise would be for us.

These little details are probably why it's a *LOT* easier to go all Rational on a piece of well-known fiction than reality. If one overrides reality too much, one's work might as well start as fantasy anyway.

There have been lots of reports that the current President doesn't read the briefings prepared for him, and he certainly seems to respond to whatever issues are on Fox News with Tweets and sometimes policy pronouncements. See also how Reagan reacted to the TV movie "The Day After": he said it was "very effective" and left him "depressed", even though he should already have known the consequences of nuclear war from briefings he received.

The US President has complete nuclear launch authority with no formal checks or balances, by design. In the few minutes where a launch/don't launch decision would be made, the available resources, intel, knowledge could not be brought to bear.

There have been incidents where a nuclear war almost happened and was averted by individual judgement. You've heard of Stanislav Petrov, right?

In the book, the North comes to wrongly believe that a US invasion is under way, so it strikes the South to disrupt that. So it believes that it is retaliating. The scenario for how this happens seems very plausible and well-researched.

***** Also, note that the author is an academic who's an expert on arms control policy and North Korea's missile program, so he's probably more credible to the US military than a typical fiction author would be.

I might be remembering wrong here, but wasn't there something about how "Dr. Strangelove" actually highlighted some major flaws in the US nuclear defence system? I seem to remember there even was something like people freaked out because they thought Kubrick and the author of the original book had some whistleblower who passed them classified information about certain authorisation procedures whereas they had just guessed them and figured them out with logic.

Anyway I think they key issue is something that E.Y. discusses a lot in "Inadequate Equilibria". It's not that the experts don't know - they surely do - but that the system they're part of may be set in a way that discourages following the most rational course of action (for example, there are political factions which mean criticising someone on your side will be perceived as a slight, cost efficiency in the short term is rewarded over long term security, etc.). Just because a system is /supposedly/ about maximising US nuclear safety doesn't mean it will /actually/ maximise that before everything else. People be peoplein'.
