I enjoy rational fiction and I often see references to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality but I haven't read most of Harry Potter and I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter. Is HPMOR worth a read even though I haven't read the Harry Potter series?

** Readable? Yes. The most enjoyable way? No.

I would highly recommend reading the first book or watching some of the movies so you get the gist of the setting and characters. Without the background the story and mechanics is still solid, but you don't get the neat moments of understanding how EY has changed characters. Dumbledore specifically springs to mind, I don't think he would be nearly as hilarious without knowing the canon character.

*** HPMOR is, at least to some extent, fanfiction of Harry Potter fanfiction, rather than fanfiction of Harry Potter. There are a few places where you can see that the writing was influenced more by other works of Harry Potter fanfic than the actual Harry Potter itself, and some of the commentary that any fanfic necessarily gives on the original is, here, commentary on other works of fanfic.

***** Not any particular fanfics, though there are references to a lot of them. It's fanfic of the /entire genre/ of Harry Potter fanfic, or at least as much as the author had read (which I'm given to believe is a lot of them).

That is to say, any genre has its tropes, and any fanfic community will have its tropes, its fanon, its recurring characters, etc. (Blaise Zabini is one of the better-known examples.)

***** I'm going to assume you've read some fanfiction and can extrapolate what a given corpus of fanfiction is like from reading a Tvtropes page. You don't need to read any of the HP fanfiction, watch one of the movies, maybe five or six if you really want to get deep. HPMOR pointed me at a lot of fanfiction for things I hadn't watched or read, and eventually did watch or read. (E.G. I hadn't really watched Naruto more than any other non-shonen fan but I NOW do like it's rationalist fan-fiction; I think this is what got me to start Madoka, and I have a Pinkie-Pie and a Kyubei on top of my security monitor)

** as others have said, its beneficial, not mandatory. The more familiar you are with cannon, the more references you'll get and the more you'll be able to appreciate the changes that were made. Having said that a lot of people are recommending you read/watch the first book/movie, I think there's value in going beyond that. For example, demontors, patronuses and azkaban are pretty important to HPMOR but aren't introduced into harry potter until book 3.

The movies are a decent substitute for the books, so i'd recommend watching the first one for sure and if you find that you enjoyed it, maybe watch some of the others, otherwise, if you find it boring, just go straight to HPMOR.

*** Don't get too familiar though, there's a point where knowledge of canon gets good enough you just start to see all the flaws it does, which makes it looks even worse and more annoying. It's part of my problem, I know HP canon sufficiently well a lot of changes that some people wouldn't care about leap out at me which makes the whole thing appear worse, particularly as it progresses they basically just start rewriting all the rules to better push their specific views of rationality as the true way. Even early bad tropes rear their heads, but ones that are completely missable with low or medium knowledge of the series.

Won't lie, there's some stuff you aren't gonna get- the author doesn't waste time with exposition about stuff someone who's read the books would know.

** It's worth reading if you enjoy rational fiction, regardless of whether or not you're a fan of Harry Potter. HPMOR spawned the genre. I'm like 90% certain that not a single one of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've ever been written were it not for HPMOR.

You might want to at least read the first book, but don't watch the movie, that might imprint characterizations or performances too strongly in your head. At average reading speeds the book only takes like four or five hours to read, so it's a light snack compared to HPMOR which clocks in at around 40 hours (and I really would recommend handicapping your max reading speed to 250/300 wpm by subvocalizing, at least when reading a work of fiction for the first time, speed reading is for work; part of the pleasure of reading is chewing on the words in your head, and Yudkowsky really did do a better job than Rowling at writing sentences that "sound good").

/Probably/ self-labeled? Watching this subreddit for the last year or two, it seems like not everyone agrees on which works are or aren't considered "rational fiction," I remember noticing more than once in that period of time when a minor controversy would come up, with people disagreeing about a work that was currently being posted on a regular basis.

[[/u/LunarTulip][u/LunarTulip]] also responded to me about what I said there, and I'm bringing that over to this thread because if the conversation with them continues then it's going to continue as an argument about speed reading. If they want to chime in on /this/ conversation, I'm all ears.

What they said:

#+begin_quote
  There's plenty of rational fiction which was started by someone with no prior exposure to the rationalist community or its works, many instances of which were even written before HPMOR was started.
#+end_quote

I don't believe that many, if any, rat!fics have been written by people with literally zero exposure to the rationalist community. Some (maybe even /many/) writers were probably introduced to the idea via Worm or Luminosity or another fic which was inspired by HPMOR, and maybe they never read HPMOR before starting their own work, and perhaps still haven't. I seriously doubt that anything resembling a rat!fic was written before HPMOR, that's /the whole entire point/ of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction][that post Yudkowsky made like 10 years ago]] wherein he only found two authors who'd done it before him.

#+begin_quote
  I agree that rational, and especially rationalist, fiction would be much rarer if not for HPMOR, but I think you're overstating your case when you say that none of the other ratfics would exist.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I probably /did/ overstate my case. I'm rewording it now to "I'm like 80% certain that at least 90% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR, and like 97% certain that at least 85% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR, and like 99.5% certain that at least 80% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR."

Seriously reassess your assumptions; I'm fairly certain that Wildbow had never heard of HPMOR before Yudkowsky recommended Worm.

*** I think you may be overgeneralizing from your own experiences, when you recommend deliberately capping one's reading speed. For my part, I find dwelling on any given sentence of a work of fiction for longer than necessary /actively unpleasant/, and have a much lower-than-baseline rate of finishing those books whose prose necessitates doing so (e.g. by having a high density of unusual words or by using particularly hard-to-follow sentence structures). It's not a hard-and-fast rule---sometimes a story is good enough to remain worth reading despite those considerations, or uses them in a deliberate artistic fashion that I enjoy (as with, for example, stream-of-consciousness narration)---but it's a pretty strong trend nonetheless.

None of this precludes enjoying good prose; I share your experience of enjoying HPMOR a lot more than canon HP on the micro-level enjoyment-of-sentences axis, and there are various other stories which I similarly enjoy on that level. I just appreciate the prose /as it flies by/ rather than pausing to dwell on it. I suspect that many people inclined towards speed-reading share my psychology in this regard.

(Also, on a more pedantic note: there's plenty of rational fiction which was started by someone with no prior exposure to the rationalist community or its works, many instances of which were even written before HPMOR was started; I agree that rational, and especially rationalist, fiction would be much /rarer/ if not for HPMOR, but I think you're overstating your case when you say that /none/ of the other ratfics would exist.)

**** I never said to dwell on particular sentences or to pause or to linger any longer than necessary (though I think it's natural for that to happen, to pause for a few moments when thoughts arise like "what if this happens next" or "what if he'd said this instead of that" or "what if this entire conversation played out differently," or to pause and just /think about/ what's being said).

300wpm isn't unreasonable or even especially slow, it's twice as fast as speaking speed, it's not like you're plodding along word by word sounding things out like a kid learning to read.

In fact, 500wmp is probably as fast as it's physically possible to *read* (and that's *read* and not *skim*) because physically moving your eyes, fixating on a point, and then visually processing what your eyes are fixated on can't go much faster than that. It's like in The Lost World when the guy says that the neurotoxins in the dart act faster than the nerve conduction velocity so the animal dies before it even feels the prick of the dart, you're made out of meat and the meat is only as fast as it is, there are several physical bottlenecks between the page and your brain and it isn't physically possible to circumvent any of them.

Even though 500wpm is doable, it's too fast for nuance and feeling the cadence of the words (there's a lot of comprehension being lost with the loss of cadence, especially for dialogue).

"Speed reading" isn't real reading, it's skimming, you don't get to call it "reading" when it has a comprehension rate and retention rate of less than 50%.

I only mentioned purposefully subvocalizing in the first place because I've seen two posts in the last few days from people who said they read HPMOR in its entirety in less than 24 hours, and I'm pretty sure it was a first time readthrough for both commenters. It's not physically possible to read that quickly for that length of time while maintaining an appropriate level of comprehension and retention, if your eyes are looking at that many words per minute then your brain isn't absorbing all of them, which would only be amplified after having been awake for longer than your brain wants you to be.

And no, I don't care about anyone's personal protestations to the contrary, I'm not interested in anyone commenting at me with some "well I personally read six hundred words a minute so that proves you wrong."

Many people believe that it's physically possible to multitask; some people believe that they themselves multitask, and on top of that believe that they do it competently. Those people have been proven to be mistaken. There's no such thing as multitasking, it's an illusion, you're not paying attention to multiple tasks simultaneously, you're quickly switching your attention from task to task and doing each one more poorly than you'd do if you'd just do them sequentially and you don't realize you're doing every task more poorly because every brain is stupid no matter how intelligent its owner is.

In much the same way, some people believe that their skimming is "reading quickly," and on top of that believe that their reading comprehension is just as good as it'd be if they read at a slower rate. Those people been proven to be mistaken. People who "read" in the 500wmp to 800wpm are just skimming most of the text and occasionally slowing down a bit to read the important parts; people who read over 800wpm are just straight up skimming.

People are completely wrong about their own competence /all the time/, I don't care at all whatsoever about what people have to say about their own abilities, all I care about is the *FACT* that the relevant scientists who have spent the past several decades studying cognition and attention and visual perception all agree that the brain just doesn't work that way.

If you're not reading one word at a time then you're /skimming,/ not reading. You can say "I understood just as much and got just as much out of it as I would've if I'd actually read it instead of just skimming it," but I will /never/ believe you. Not because I'm generalizing from my own personal experience of reduced comprehension at higher speeds, but because the people who have spent the last 50 years studying this crap know us better than we know ourselves. You can /not/ trust yourself to be an accurate judge of your own competence, because you're made of meat.

***** I think possibly I may have introduced confusion by my use of 'speed-reading' in my post. To clarify: I'm not particularly interested in a binary distinction between speed-reading and slow careful reading; I'm interested in the gradient of faster versus slower reading and the curve of readers' utility as they move along that graph. So, to give a personal example: my default reading speed is about 320-400wpm, and if I'm reading anywhere in that space I'll probably be pretty happy with the speed. When a book's prose is sufficiently difficult that I need to go down to 300wpm to retain my usual level of absorption-of-the-material, it feels off to me. I can only think of a few works of prose fiction that I've needed to go down to 250wpm for, and my distinct recollection of those works is that I found the slow pace to be a slog actively detrimental to my reading experience.

So, sure, maybe reading at a slower speed improves comprehension. I have no quarrel with that point, and agree that the research is pretty definitive on the subject. But that point is also utterly tangential to the issue at hand, which is which reading speed will maximize a hypothetical reader's enjoyment of the work. If I were to deliberately slow my reading down to 250wpm, I'll grant that I'd probably pick up more detail on a per-sentence level, for the ten minutes I'd keep it up before giving up on the book in frustration at how slowly it's moving; but that's not a very strong argument in favor of going out of my way to read in that fashion when my goal is /enjoyment/ rather than ability to recite the book's contents in detail when quizzed.

In your original post, you made a comment to the effect that speed-reading is for work while slower reading is better for fun reading where your priority is to enjoy the work. But my experience is precisely the opposite: when I'm reading something due to an external obligation such as schoolwork, I'll read as slowly as it takes to absorb everything, in order to ensure that I retain whatever portion I need to fulfill the aforementioned obligation; but, when reading for fun, I can afford to deprioritize comprehension and prioritize /enjoyment/ instead, which means reading faster, maybe missing more details, and not taking six hours to get through a ninety-thousand-word book when I can do it in four.

More broadly, my point is that most people's hedonic sweet spots in terms of reading speed aren't necessarily going to line up with your own. You enjoy reading slowly and chewing on the individual words, and that's fine; I enjoy reading quickly and getting the higher per-second stimulation that results, at the cost of some degree of comprehension, and that's also fine; and I don't think you've presented much reason to think that I'm a bizarre psychological outlier in this regard. More likely there's a wide range of preferred reading speeds, with the two of us just sitting at different points on a larger bell curve; and my strong suspicion is that most people intuitively teach themselves to read at a speed reasonably close to the speed they enjoy most, such that if they deliberately intervene to slow their reading down it's going to move them /away/ from their optimal speed rather than towards it.

** You could read it, but you'd maybe get 70% of the experience.

A lot of the humor in the fic, especially early on, comes from looking askew at just how ridiculous some parts can be of a fantasy universe created for children to be the most important actors (e.g. quidditch, the general uselessness of adults, etc.) Also the increasingly out of character ways some characters act after having been shaped by HPMOR Harry's actions. It's a parody, and reading a parody without know what's being parodied and where the author is actually being affectionate with their teasing of the setting instead of malicious and skewering is a bit like trying to join in the in-jokes of a group you're not a member of.

Harry also makes some mistakes -- BIG ones -- that aren't apparent unless you have the "meta" knowledge of who some people are and their actual motives that Harry himself does not possess. There's sort of a creeping sense of dread that comes at times from reading his interactions with certain characters you might not get if (like him) you don't know the consequences of what he's saying to them.

That said, all such things are revealed in time, and the story has more than enough notes of humor and dramatic tension that stand on their own to make the experience enjoyable.
