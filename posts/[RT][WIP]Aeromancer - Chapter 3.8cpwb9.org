** I'm liking this story so far, good potential world and the characters seem interesting as a start, still more to find out about them, but it's a good start, I'm going to follow it.

** I guessed last chapter that the mysterious girl who hired the Dream Eater to ruin him - so he had to stay home - was his sister. This chapter has only further solidified that belief. She must be mad as hell that her awful plan has backfired so spectacularly.

** looks like this is going somewhere interesting. I'm going to be following to (at the very least) see if some of my guesses as to what is going on are accurate.

** They have the internet, cell phones, etc, which means that microprocessors have developed the same way they did in our reality, despite there being an entirely separate branch of physics that now exists differently from our world. Is this intentional (ie explicitly determined how/why this happened, even if not explained to the reader), or just an aspect of reality to be taken as given like the existence of magic in and of itself?

*** Good pick up, this is definitely intentional and not an aspect of reality; I do actually plan to go into it at a later time but it isn't relevant currently.

**** Sounds good. No need to shoehorn in random historical lessons if they don't fit the story, just wanted to see if this was something I should have noticed or not.

Feel free to ignore this next question as well, but I'm a bit curious about the direction the story is going in; is the goal to primarily be a pseudo-blind MC, or if is it just a setup for the rest of the story, similar to other superhero stories showing the characters having to deal with broken bones or something else?

I mostly ask because the tone thus far in the story seems to be treating his blindness as "temporary setback/annoyance" while the prominence of it being the culmination of the first chapter makes to seem like it should be treated as a character trait going forward.

If this will be resolved one way or another, either by the blindness being removed or by his attempts at a cure from a professional vivimancer spectacularly failing just as his first attempts did, within the next 2-3 chapters, definitely don't spoil it.

The world as described feels like blindness is being treated similar to broken bones, though, and the MC's actions at this time come across similar to someone breaking a leg, stopping at the school's nurse and getting a splint and some crutches, and then deciding that instead of going to a hospital to get x-rays and a cast, he decides to go visit Elon Musk's prosthetics lab.

***** Thank you for taking an interest in my story, warms my heart!

And it will be answered in the next 2-3 chapters, so I won't comment on the direction at this time; your thought process was fun to read x)

****** Good to know. I figured if nothing else, getting feedback on how the story thus far is being perceived would be useful to at least calibrate whether it's coming across how you wanted it to or not.

I will echo the previous chapter's discussion around approaching blindness in stories with some amount of caution if you yourself are not blind and don't have access to someone with that experience to consult with. Acknowledging the limitations in his magical air vision (surface only, probably strongly limited when outdoors, and hopefully acknowledging some sort of cognitive limitation on the "I can see everything in full detail everywhere around me") seems to me like it goes a decent way towards that, but erasure of lived experiences by real people with blindness is a definite concern, but handled well is an incoming explored perspective in this space, which is always a good thing.
