** Just a quick note of interest. There's little evidence to suggest that DNA samples suffice, even if you have /all/ of them. DNA is the program, but a program is useless without a computer for the language it's written in.

It's theoretically /possible/ that one might be able to go from DNA to everything else, but I'd bet that doing so is extremely hard. Chances are you need an at least somewhat sophisticated environment, in which I'm including both high level things like wombs and low level things like cellular machinery, to produce animals from DNA.

** Interesting take and I agree with a lot of what he said but I do think he was being a bit arrogant/presumptuous about what we can reasonably expect from an alien civilization. Reasonable explanations are all about context and we have almost none for alien races. Intelligence doesn't always equate to a human definition of reasonable.

Like antivirus software being obviously necessary. We haven't developed defenses against most possible threats, such as biological prion or viral weapons, and nuclear weapons. The defenses that we have developed have come about in response to virtual threats, which other civilizations may not have encountered due to their culture or biology.

**** Exactly. The video's host makes a few too many claims for my taste. If a ship with living aliens popped up in our solar system tomorrow, all we really know is that they have some way of traversing space. That's it. We don't know anything else about their tech, their values , etc.

Really, the host would've been better served pointing out that the odds of a human being becoming familiar enough with the aliens' software (or their equivalent) in that time to craft a virus is ridiculously unlikely. It's like someone being dropped into a Chinese airport and expected to become competent in spoken Mandarin by reading signs. Only even more unlikely than that. At least Chinese people are humans

***** You mean far too many claim?

I do agree with the author that it's stupid to invade our planet for the water and other resources, though. Even if they want our water, it might be better to just throw asteroids at our cities first rather than do a ground war.

** I read part of an ok erotic fiction once about a race of aliens that had bred themselves pacifists coming to earth to recruit them into an army because humans were in the sweet spot between how savage primitives are and how docile and bad-at-war advanced civs were. Didn't seem too stupid.
