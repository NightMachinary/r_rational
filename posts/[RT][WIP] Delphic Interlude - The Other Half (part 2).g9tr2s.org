** My writing has slowed down, a lot, but it hasn't stopped.

I have a handful of ongoing fanfics now that I also update sporadically, each of which includes rationalist characters and ideas:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ships-counsel-tng-other-insert-au.745996/#post-57029647][Ship's Counsel]] is Star Trek TNG, re-written by episode (and increasingly diverging from canon).

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/complete-detachment-star-wars-prequel-si.8977/][Complete Detachment]] is an author-insert for the Star Wars prequels. It has a romance-themed spin-off, because I'm truly that cheesy.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/snakes-seldom-bite-disneys-aladdin-rational-fic.833409/#post-65714586][Snakes Seldom Bite]] is an Aladdin fic I just found I couldn't help starting, despite "Rules for Wishing" being truly excellent.

*** Could you update the table of contents page for Delphic? It's missing the last couple chapters.

*** Welcome back to the land of rats.

I look forward to more of your food scenes and slice of life flourishes that really brings this alive.
