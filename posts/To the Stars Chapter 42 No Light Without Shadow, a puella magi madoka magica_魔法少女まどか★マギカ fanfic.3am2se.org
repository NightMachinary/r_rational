** The first arc (or two?) is a great transhumanist story with magical girls, before the plot thickens...

Well worth reading, if you don't panic at the length.

*** Spin Control. It's a novel and I read it a while ago so it might not hold up. ..

Also, rather oddly it's the second book in a trilogy, but much better they either the first or third. Which is not the usual pattern. Usually the second book is the weakest.

**** Here's the synopsis from Amazon (Warning - there may be spoilers, I have no idea):

#+begin_quote
  Call Arkady a clone with a conscience. Or call him a traitor. A member of the space-faring Syndicates, Arkady has defected to Israel with a hot commodity: a genetic weapon powerful enough to wipe out humanity. But Israel's not buying it. They're selling it--and Arkady--to the highest bidder.

  As the auction heats up, the Artificial Life Emancipation Front sends in Major Catherine Li. Drummed out of the Peacekeepers for executing Syndicate prisoners, Li has now literally hooked up with an AI who has lived many lifetimes and shunted through many bodies. But while they have their own conflicting loyalties to contend with, together they're just one player in a mysterious high-stakes game
#+end_quote

Sounds interesting to me. Paperbacks from $0.01. At least the price is right!

** BTW, at a glance I would say the Japanese there says Mahou shoujo madoka magika instead of puella magi whatever.

*** It does, but the official "English" title of the original series is Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Latin and all that.

*** If only your Latin were as good as your Japanese, you would have realized that they say the same thing ;)

(Well, they are supposed to).
