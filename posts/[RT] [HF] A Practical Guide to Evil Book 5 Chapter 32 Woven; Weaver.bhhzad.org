** [I have blatantly copy pasted this comment, but I wanted more people to read it]

Oh this chapter. This chapter. This was amazing. Just flat out amazing. But let me explain the highlights

First of all, kairos is a combo of traitorous and irritant reincarnated, mixed the spirit of goblin kind and just a /dash/ of kids show villainy, and then let loose on creation for belows eternal laughter

Second, looks like everyone was right, it is the dead king hijacking heirophant, personally I was expecting some sort of demon for now and then the dead king takes full control, but this is fine (insert dog in fire meme here)

Third, cat had that moment of satisfaction every great schemer has at one point or another. The satisfaction that your plan has come together even more perfectly than you expected

Fourth, I am /extremely/ curious as to what kairos planned to do with a hijacked half hell/half Arcadia shard, other than invade the hobbesian hellhole the dead king has cooked up, along with what the heirarch could do in the serenity, as frankly that many people learning the truth, plus his (most likely named) revolt aspect equals quite the interesting turn of events

Fifth And Finally, cat, the pilgrim, the rogue sorcerer, the saint, and kairos all in a heroic band will prove to be extremely interesting and fun to read. I expect betrayal, heroic charges, redemption, and of course typical antics that come with kairos being in the general area

Also the slight pause after the first story was perfect

Also also this killing a god thing is partially a reference to that old phrase "be they gods or kings or all the armies in creation" is it not?

I'm still on the fence about that one. Neshama infecting Zeze with jsut the right ideas and mysteries through his own memories echoing in Arcadia would be quite the amazing time paradox, for one. Or maybe it was a very long-term dormant trap, laid in wait for the right circumstances, in which case the Woe's visit North triggered the deads' invasion ?

I still think Mazego is aware of at least some of this, and has a plan of his own.

Additionally, all 4 principalities on that front are Hasenbachs, so if the drow reclaim it in the war and say "this is our land now" there are going to be no other princes demanding their lands back, and very few soldiers/refugees to put on public pressure.

** Prediction:

Cat's role in this is not as a member of a heroic band - she's in the running as the Below's Intercessor. Think about it. The Bard acts to keep stories on the rails - aka, under the guidance of the Gods (Above) - and Cat acts to break those stories, aka, returning that guidance to mortals, as the Gods Below desire. Which is the entire fight between the gods in the first place.

Instead, the Black Night restored is the fifth member of the heroic band.

*** Can we stop with this "Good is stoopid" interpretation? At its worst, Above is roughly as destructive as Below /on average/. The Good Gods may have given the mortals the guidelines to follow, but those guidelines also keep them from self-destructing. In contrast, the ethics we've seen the villains employ so far are almost entirely oriented towards empowering themselves.

Case in point, Below's position wasn't that mortals should be independent - it's to "guide them towards greater things", whatever those may be (where Above's influence is more beneficial towards the humanity /as it naturally is/, since they want to rule it as it is). Bard isn't Above's agent - she keeps the game going on both sides, as seen in the creation of Everdark. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one around who sees the word "Evil" in the title. How do you even miss the entire ending of the previous book?

***** There's a few problems with this interpretation. Firstly, the heroes are only "stupid" if you think Cat and Black are typical examples of villains, when in reality we know that they're UNPRECEDENTED, and they're success is in large part because they do not act like typical villains. It's unfair to say that the heroes are stupid because they aren't as good as two villains who completely changed the game.

If you want a more accurate idea of what a typical villain would be, you're better of looking at the various opening quotes of the chapters. The typical villain doesn't institute systemic military reforms or surrender their army to heroes in order to force a favorable truce, they throw people into pits of man-eating tapirs and try to steal the weather. They're people who are so crazy that they bend the world to fit their madness, and with this in mind not only do the heroes compare much more favorably, but their actions also make more sense. Of course they're going to have a hard time negotiating or compromising with Cat. She's a villain, and with those you don't typically have that option. Can you imagine any negotiation between a hero and, for example, Akua (pre-Second Liesse) that actually ends with the hero getting what they want? Best case scenario is it all amounts to nothing, worst case Akua lies and cheats the hero, taking advantage of their attempt to deal with her in good faith. They have little reason to see Cat as any different, and what signs they do have are outweighed by the risks if she does turn out the same as every other villain.

With regards to the whole "Above only wins because they give idiots a deus ex machina," I think this is a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the balance between Above and Below. Good doesn't always win because they cheat. In fact, Good doesn't always win, period. How many dozens of heroes has Black killed? No, it's not that Good always wins, it's that Evil always loses in the end, which is VERY different. Heroes age, villains don't. Heroes usually have a very specific goal, a villain to defeat or a wrong to right, while villains typically don't really have a win condition. There's usually nothing a villain can do that would make them say "Well, glad that's taken care of, now I can finally retire from this whole 'Dread Emperor' thing." A villain's story only ends when they lose, and so by definition they always lose in the end.

That's not to say that heroes don't tend to be favored in the matchup, but again, that's the balance between Above and Below. Below puts their finger on the scales to get the ball rolling. They empower a madman and give him a throne, and Above lets them, because that is their due. But Above then crafts a hero to end that villain and gets to nudge things to help make that happen, because that is /their/ due. Above is allowed favorable odds on the hero killing the Dread Emperor, because Below is allowed a Dread Emperor worth killing.

****** It's more like heroes only win due to deus ex machina, not due to using their brains. Now that they're facing someone who's genre savvy enough to block direct meddling by the Good gods, they're starting to lose badly because they're not used to having to think. IOW, evil stopped being stupid, good did not, therefore good is losing ground (or would be if Cat & co were actually Evil).
