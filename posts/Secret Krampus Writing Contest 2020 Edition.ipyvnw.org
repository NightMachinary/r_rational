*The signup deadline has passed! I will send out the prompts soon and then announce the participants.*

Some folks may recall the Secret Krampus contest [[/u/xamueljones]] hosted last year. The idea is that it's like a Secret Santa writing contest, but in the summer, although I guess it's actually fall now. With [[/u/xamueljones]]' blessing, I'm hosting a new one for 2020 (and borrowing heavily from the posts they made at the time).

*How it works:* Everyone who enters comes up with a story prompt, the prompts are randomly passed on to another participant, and each participant writes a story based on the prompt they receive.

After the submission deadline has passed, all prompts and stories will be published in two different threads and everyone will vote for their favorite prompt and their favorite story. Here's last year's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cxzttw/secret_krampus_story_voting/][story thread]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cxznzm/secret_krampus_prompts_voting/][prompt thread]]. (My personal favorites: [[/u/eniteris][u/eniteris]]'s prompt "A person has to plan a heist with multiple copies of themselves," and [[/u/ExiledQuixoticMage][u/ExiledQuixoticMage]]'s story "The /Grakian/ Choice.") The prompt and story contest winners each get Reddit platinum, plus bragging rights.

Rules:

- Story submissions must be at least 500 words, no maximum.

- No plagiarism, and please write a new story instead of using one you've already written whole cloth, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas that you've used in the past.

- Please send prompt and story submissions as a PM to me ([[/u/CeruleanTresses][u/CeruleanTresses]]). Send me your story as a link to Google Docs, a PDF, a hosting website, etc, and please include the word count and title in your message.

- To keep the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting contest threads to other places or asking outside people to upvote your submission until after the winner has been decided.

- Similarly, please don't make the prompt you submit public until I've posted it in the voting thread. This is in case someone writes their story in such a way that your prompt is a spoiler.

- Please avoid submitting a prompt that would require writing about a topic the recipient might not be comfortable with, e.g a prompt that is sexual, politically charged, or involves themes that people might have traumatic experiences with. I will ask you for a different prompt if needed. (It's okay for /story/ submissions to include these themes at the writer's discretion, within reasonable limits, e.g. nothing that promotes bigotry.)

- If you sign up, please do submit a story! Even if you think your story is bad, I promise that you're looking at it with a much more critical eye than anyone else will. I encourage you to submit whatever you have at the end of the month. The worst that can happen is that you get some constructive feedback, and you could get positive comments that will make you feel awesome.

- In that vein, only participants who follow through on submitting a story will be included in the voting thread for the best prompts.

*If you want to enter the contest, please PM me with a prompt before the entry deadline of Thursday, September 17th at 11:59PM EST, one week from now.* As a rule of thumb, prompts should be interesting, but not so detailed that they constrain the writer instead of inspiring them (see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts][here]] for advice on that front).

After the entry deadline, I will PM each participant one of the submitted prompts, assigned at random. Once all prompts have been handed out, everyone has one full month to PM me their story. After the submission deadline, I will post two threads in which the top-level comments will be the submitted prompts and stories respectively, and I'll request for them to be put in contest mode. Anyone can vote for as many as they want by upvoting their favorites, and after a week, the top comments in each thread will be the winners.

Good luck and have fun! I encourage anyone who's interested to participate, but I especially want to encourage folks who haven't submitted fiction here before. When I entered last year, I hadn't written anything creative for a long time, and the contest gave me an avenue to revisit that part of myself without the intimidation factor of posting my work as a standalone thing. I hope it can do the same for others!

Signups so far: *24*


** I'll definitely join in on this fun! It'd be too shameful, if as the originator of the first contest, I didn't write anything for this one!

Just need a /little/ time to think about my prompt ideas.

Thanks for picking up the torch and continuing the tradition. I wasn't ever going to get to it this year, so I'm glad [[https://www.reddit.com/user/CeruleanTresses/][u/CeruleanTresses]] decided to step up.
