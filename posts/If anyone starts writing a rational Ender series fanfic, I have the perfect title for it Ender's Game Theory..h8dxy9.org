I can think of a couple of things that a rational Ender fic could address:

- Why haven't humans/Formics tried communicating with each other through sign language.
- So Jane is just this anthropomorphic AI that doesn't want to hurt anybody, and people are trying to destroy her because they don't understand her, but Ender and his friends know that she's not a foe? But she's also so superintelligent she can alter reality with the power of her artificial mind.

  Why haven't humans/Formics tried communicating with each other through sign language.
#+end_quote

1) Initially, the Formics thought that any sapient would be capable of philotic communication (and tbh, I can see why they thought that and can't especially blame them for it).

2) The Formics probably never conceived of sign language, because they're all telepaths. Lots of other forms of communication which humans have historically used (e.g. semaphore flags) are likewise pointless for formics.

Also, tagging [[/u/tk17studios]], who no doubt will have a lot to say on the topic.

*** Wise-assery aside, if we're talking about improving on Orson Scott Card, there's a golden opportunity: the Gate trilogy. It's not super well-known as his works go, but the basic conceit is that there are these hidden communities of sorcerers descended from ancient "gods" hiding out around the world because their powers have degraded over many generations. Until one of them is born with the long-lost power to make teleportation gates.

The first book is actually pretty good. It's got some OSC weirdness, but mostly tolerable, and he does some fun things with the characters' powers. At the end of the first book, it seems like he's setting things up for something EPIC ... and then you get the second book, where he gets sidetracked by a sex-gives-you-the-devil plot (sadly, not kidding) that doesn't go anywhere very interesting. There's also a fair dose of creepy misogyny in there. It's readable, but barely. In the third book he basically ignores everything he set up before for some weird alien cosmology which I'm guessing comes from the Book of Mormon. It ends with the epic stuff shoved in a corner, the hero so OP he's literally impossible to kill, and so much misogyny it makes the second book look almost feminist.

The shame is that it started out pretty fun IMO. If you picked up the thread at the end of book one and took it somewhere fun, you could improve on OSC's work a great deal.

**** To be fair, he did have a stroke in there, and, IIRC, had some degree of "assistance" afterwards. Has he written anything good since the stroke? (Another casualty, as far as I know, was his Pathfinder series. I gave up on both of them after the stroke).

***** Was not aware of the stroke, but Pathfinder certainly followed a similar arc of declining quality, and around the same time. Mind you, he wrote some junk beforehand, but if a stroke was to blame that's really quite sad--Pathfinder and The Lost Gate both look like returns to form, in retrospect.

****** Yeah, the timeline is:

- 2010: Pathfinder published
- January 1, 2011: Card suffered a stroke
- 2011: The Lost Gate (Mithermages) published
- 2012: Ruins (Pathfinder) published
- 2013: The Gate Thief (Mithermages) published
- 2014: Visitors (Pathfinder) published
- 2015: Gatefather (Mithermages) published

Given the amount of time between completion of drafts and publication dates, I think that post-stroke work likely gets seen somewhere in the middle of Ruins and The Gate Thief (which may have already had pre-stroke drafts?) I don't really remember exactly, but at the time I remember at least feeling like there was a noticeable delay and subsequent drop in quality, which was really saddening. Could speculate more by looking at his bibliography, but I'm starting to feel a little morbid. Here's hoping that he has made a full recovery.

** I liked the title enough to give it some thought, but then I realized the reason no one has wanted to play in that universe is that it's pretty boring.

The only conceit really is that everyone is sooOOoO smart. There's no worldbuilding or exploitable mechanics really that make it an interesting place to be, and you'd basically be left either making the characters actually sooOOoO much smarter and rational just to make a point that the originals weren't, or inventing a whole new cosmology, in which case just make an OC universe.

**** "(relativistic) rocks fall, everybody dies" is a pretty boring story.

You could maybe stretch it out over 18 hours or so if they all have to come from the same direction and the formics want to preserve a biosphere (albeit without large-scale human industry)... each chapter a new group dealing with the shockwaves/emp/etc. of the previous impacts and coming to terms with the inevitable end. Can you get to a safe zone away from cities/water/infrastructure/faultlines? With enough supplies to survive the end of the world?

And, OK, there's an obvious sequel hook when the victorious Formics realise that individual humans are sentient /and it goes better than canon/.

Hmm. Alright, I guess there is a story there!

****** No? He was biologically a teenager and literally, what, 2? He was made of Ender's brain magic and based on the near-teenage Peter that he knew when he left for battle school.

Plus, she's almost as old as Ender, and not including the time dilation. Literally millenia old. Kissing a teenage boy.

Wait, sorry about that. I was thinking of Peter.

This was the oldest son of Ender's wife, the one who tried to fuck his sister. This one was most definitely under 18 both biologically and actually.

** One thing about Ender is that while he's supposed to be a tactical genius, he's not necessarily the smartest character. That's Bean. What Ender has are superhuman empathy skills that allow him to be a natural operator within the screwed-up society of Battle School.

** I love the idea of this. I do worry that any good Ender fic would have to be absolutely devastating: it seems like conflict between Ender and the government would have to be direct, meaning that they would either have to be malicious or bureaucratically nightmarish. I can't see a “satisfying” ending that isn't still tragic, and moreso than the original.

And I'd still probably read it 50 times.
