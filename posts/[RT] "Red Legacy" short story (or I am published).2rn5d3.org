Asimov's Science Fiction has purchased one of my stories!!! This is the first thing I've written to be published. I'm very proud. :)

It is “Red Legacy”, on page 48. In bookstores now, or there's links to get electronic copies [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/i-am-published/][at my blog]]. Unfortunately it isn't available free online anywhere. :( Very sorry. Asimov's has all print rights to it for a while. It appears in the February 2015 issue of Asimov's, which is actually out right now despite the "February" dating.

I'm not sure one can call it Rationalist Fiction, but it is IMHO at least rational. It follows a Soviet mad scientist during the Cold War era. If anyone here gets their hands on a copy and reads it, I'm really dying to know if you think it fits the "rational" category, or if it's just SF.

For those who'd like to know, I first submitted the story to Asimov's on 2/28/2014. Official publication date is 1/6/2015, so just slightly over 10 months to get a short story published via traditional dead-tree publishing. It's a long friggin wait. I dread ever trying to get a novel published.


** Congratulations!! Your pride is entirely justified. Traditional publication is still important and it's great to see so many digital options available.

** This is a phenomenal achievement. Asimov's is one of, if not /the/ biggest names in the field and very hard to get into. Their pages are mostly filled with established writers and a few up-and-comers -- to be in that latter category is a a real mark of accomplishment. Congratulations!

** You should probably post this again once it's actually available. I am happy for you but prepare to be buried, since all we have to go on is this post.

(Is it within your rights to PM me... dunno... watermarked screenshots or something? I'd love to read it. Bit of a disappointment to come here and not find anything consumable)

*** It is available, not for free, but it's easy to get an issue of Asimov's Science Fiction to read on an ereader (I subscribed through Amazon). It's kind of cool that he mentions Rationalist Fiction in the foreword of the story too :-)
