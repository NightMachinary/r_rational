** It's not even RT, tagging it as RSTish is a stretch of imagination. The story is plot railroaded, antagonists are always flanderized and juggle idiot balls, protagonist solve things mostly by convenient capabilities of its own powers and an intuition that heavily relies on author knowledge of canon plot.

It's very hard to find a character that's not an NPC all the time and rarely they do things off scene that matter.

I've read it up to chapter 14 and while it was interesting initially it quickly became the kind of wish fulfillment fixfic that gives fanfic a bad name.

*** Ahh, I misunderstood what rationalist fiction is. Scrolled down too far on the sidebar, so couldn't find the definition. Thought it was only:

#+begin_quote
  The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.
#+end_quote

My mistake.

** I'm by no means an expert in rational fiction--and I guess it could be considered [[#s][internally consistent]]--but, to me at least, the protagonist of this story felt too much like a Gary Stu. I stopped reading after [[#s][Chapter 19]].

******* I'm telling you right now you are wrong about how canon powers work and the only departure is your own beliefs about it.

Whether you want to read worm or not is off topic to whether [[#s][spoilers]] is possible in canon.

******** Point A: the Manton Effect limits most targeted powers to affecting either living or nonliving things, not both. The most relevant examples are Regent, Panacea, and Gallant, none of whom can affect Endbringers.

Point B: I have read Worm /several/ times.

Point C: While telepathy is possible in the Wormverse, /general/ telepathy is not. WoG states that specific, specialized shards would be needed to create a working "template" of a human mind, which would work with other shards to generate telepathy. The Entities would have to deliberately design a shard with the ability to read the Simurgh's mind, which they obviously wouldn't - and arguably couldn't, depending on how exactly they created the Endbringers.

EDIT: And, as a point of order, the Simurgh is not telepathic.

********* Point A: The only thing that matters in the context of this argument and endbringers is the question of whether powers have any affect on Endbringers. Which they do.

Point B: and what? you havn't found a single instance of [[#s][spoilers]]? Fine if your reading comprehension has failed you I guess Ill link you the chapter where [[#s][spoilers]] happens [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/interlude-28/][here]]

********** Point A: All powers are not the same. Clockblocker's power works on a a person as well as a sheet of paper, which is why is works on the Endbringers. A mind reading power would not work on the Simurgh any more than it would work on a rock.

Point B: /The Simurgh is not telepathic. The Simurgh is not telepathic./ Repeat it until it sinks in: omniscience is not the same thing as mind reading, any more than telekinesis is the same thing as having hands.

Point C: As I just said: WHILE TELEPATHY IS POSSIBLE IN THE WORMVERSE, GENERAL TELEPATHY IS NOT, as Wildbow explained [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wormverse-ideas-recs-and-fic-discussion-thread-40.311933/page-11#post-15208733][here]].

In order for a cape to read the Simurgh's mind, it would require a shard that contained a working model of the Simurgh's mind with which to interpret the brain she doesn't have. That would require the Entities intentionally /create/ such a model, which they wouldn't, ever, for about a billion reasons, starting with the fact that the Simurgh knows the truth about them and working towards the incredible danger of giving access to unrestricted omniscience to a random schmuck.

Moving on, we have issues with the fact that her mind is hosted entirely in her shard and therefore in another dimension, Manton limitations because she's inorganic, and the fact that she knows you're reading her mind and will probably kill you.

*********** Point A: You don't seem to get it. We arn't speculating on what would happen if telepathy was used on an endbringer. It's already written down to have worked. end of story.

Point B: I'm not going to argue about the simurghs abilities anymore. The fact that something else is telepathic validates my side of the argument.

Point C: [[#s][At this point I think you are trolling]] who new.

************ What Doctor Mother did is in no way remotely the same thing as the deep memory reading powers described in the post that precipitated this whole thing. The two are so dissimilar, there's no point in lumping them under the term "mind reading" as you've been doing. Scanner allows her to pick up an incredibly vague stream-of-consciousness that doesn't even account for a quarter of a percent of the Simurgh's /surface thoughts,/ let alone her memories, and he's actually probably just scraping data off her shards' black boxes rather than decrypting her mind. Besides that, it's almost guaranteed that the Simurgh was faking the whole thing, just like she faked being subject to Thinker interference, being bound by the Endbringer schedule, all the limitations on her microtelekinesis, being killed by Scion in Golden Morning, and every other "weakness" she's ever shown.

Which Doctor Mother /says outright in the update you linked,/ Mr. Reading Comprehension:

#+begin_quote
  /Need to take notes. The Simurgh... I could read her. Better than I should be able to. She's trying something./
#+end_quote

Obviously, this isn't the point I'd been arguing before. Up until now, I had thought you were referring to a hypothetical chapter in the fanfiction (which I haven't read) in which Doctor Mother reads the Simurgh's mind, and arguing from the position that the /Simurgh's/ ability to read minds justified the ability laid out in the fic, it having not occurred to me that you might make the absurdly tenuous connection between it and Scanner's power. And so, I'm forced to admit, you're right about one thing: while running completely contrary to the themes, principles, and patterns of Worm powers, and not making any sense whatsoever in the context of the Cycle, the mind reading you described isn't technically impossible in canon. It's just fucking stupid.

That power being allowed to come within ten thousand miles of Eidolon, on the other hand, is impossible.

** Featured themes:

- How to think rationally when one's own mind can't be trusted?

- Precise setting of goals in order to effectively satisfy one's values.

- Munchkinning.

Re: ToaKraka's concern and complaint - an argument could be made for it being rational fiction, but I won't make it. I found its rationalist themes most compelling and of potential interest to the subreddit. The development in Chapter 19 is sufficiently explained in the story. [[#s][However, if you're concerned,]]
