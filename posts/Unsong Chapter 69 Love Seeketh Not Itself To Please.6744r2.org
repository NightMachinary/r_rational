** So, Sohu knew immediately that Uriel had been killed. I've had a theory for a while that they're kabbalistically married, since Sohu implied having experience with the technique, and keeping in contact that way would have mitigated his sadness at their separation. So it's possible that she actually felt him die. Ouch.

*** I believe it was already confirmed that this was the case.

I believe that it was also shown that after Erica and Dylan died (I think?), Ana recursively inherited some subsection of their minds via their links.

This, along with evidence this chapter that Sohu is now stronger than she was before, suggests that a significant fraction of Uriel remains in her mind.

If TCK is TOK, this might have even been intended.

**** Oh, was it confirmed? I've been looking out for confirmation ever since Sohu originally hinted at it, but never noticed anything definitive. If I missed it, I'd like to go back and look. I definitely /want/ it to be canon, because their friendship has been the main emotional hook of the story for me, and it would be nice if they were able to keep in touch for all that time.

****** If it's true, I suppose we may eventually see the flashback chapter where it happens. It would have to have happened on the final day of Sohu's apprenticeship with him, right after the chapter we saw where she announced she was leaving.

  “Black mast, this amulet contains the blood of Malia Ngo. She's the daughter of Thamiel and Robin West. His blood runs in her veins. Just like on the Comet King's sword. This is the blood of Thamiel, and I call you to our aid.”

****** That was Erica's knowledge. Erica witnessed Dylan stating that the amulets he was handing out would each have a drop of Malia's blood on them, and she later witnessed Malia revealing her parentage. Therefore, Erica knew that the blood of Thamiel's line was on Mark's amulet.

******* Agreed. However, Dylan died before Erica, suggesting that he should have SKABMOM'ed into her. While it is unclear how much transfers, it is within possibility that whatever Erica got of Dylan would have been passed along with her to Ana.

Nonetheless, the question was about post-death SKABMOM, and that is all but unquestionable.

** For your convenience, here are the lyrics to HaMephorash, as written by the fictional Leonard Cohen. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/HaMephorash.mp3][Link to the song performed by the Bayesian Choir.]]

 

Now I've heard there was a sacred word

That Jala said, and it named the Lord

But you don't really know of magic, or us

It goes like this - a tav, a resh

A fearsome joy, a fervent wish

The Comet King incanting haMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

Your faith was strong but you needed proof

Hay hay yud tav mem tav vav kuf

A ship on which another sailed before us

She saw his flag on the highest mast

She saw a dream that couldn't last

The Comet King receiving haMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

You say I took the Name in vain

And after that I lost the Name

I gave it back to Him who holds it for us

But echoes sound in every word

It doesn't matter what occurred

You never really lose the HaMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

Somebody had to, no one would

I tried to do the best I could

And now it's done, and now they can't ignore us

And even though it all went wrong

I'll stand against the whole unsong

With nothing on my tongue but HaMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

** u/Zephyr1011:
#+begin_quote
  “Sohu showed you the library? Go get me all the books you can find on Elisha ben Abuyah. It's time to learn everything we can about the Other King.”
#+end_quote

+This ending doesn't seem to make any sense. If they truly knew TOK's identity, and had books on him, as one of the most important foes they faced, surely they'd have researched him already? And well before the current crisis. More importantly, if they think Thamiel and his demons will be upon them imminently, let along TOK, then that leaves absolutely no time for research.+

+The most reasonable explanation thus seems to get Aaron out of the way and keep him busy? Can't see why they'd really care though+

I misremembered, as [[/u/Fredlage]] says they figured out TOK's identity very recently in story, in chapter 50, so this in fact makes perfect sense.
