** Reaction:

After reading this, I tip my hat to your skills as a writer. You have managed to come up with something truly original in the superhero genre which have had so many different stories written for it. Yet without knowing about all possible superhero stories, I am confident that no one else came up with anything quite like your story.

Confusion:

[[#s][I was fairly confused about]]

Typo:

"One of the last places on Earth that man has NEVER explored." => "One of the last places on Earth that man has EVER explored."

*** I think what he was saying was that 1) Neanderthals were older as a species than Homo Sapiens, 2) He was a Neanderthal made into a Kwizatz Haderach demigod by a lightning strike, 3) He had to ensure his species went extinct.

And the Never to Ever thing is actually right as it originally was - it's never explored because they're going to die before it can be explored.

*** I'll take a look at the confusing sections and see if I can clear them up a bit. Dense data is hard to make clear.

*EDIT* Some changes have been made to clarify things. Please let me know if they are clearer.

*** I know of at least one story where a lightning-enhanced Homo Neanderthalensis teaches humanity skills. In that story he "just" became immortal and has a lame foot; the greek god Hephaistos, bringer of iron and smithing is that mans legend.

SEMI-EDIT: well that was easy. <30sec googling brought me to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthals_in_popular_culture]] , which features [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gnarly_Man]]

*** I write quite a bit. I'll provide one link to my 'About the Author' page on my current project. It has links to other things. [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/author-info/][Set In Stone: Follower]]

That being said, most of what I write is not rational, though my current book project is.

Warning - Set In Stone: Follower (my current project) is a serial webfiction and is not complete. The rest of the stories on my about page are complete.

I have not yet gotten around to cleaning up my oldest stories - the writing quality isn't quite as good in my older works, but it's not terrible either.

** Really excellent short story, loved it! I had read most of symbiote and enjoyed most of it but didn't realize you had written or were writing anything else. I had even seen Set in Stone mentioned a few times but its not really my bailiwick but I will give it a try.

** This story is amazing with a very Arthur C. Clarke vibe to it. I actually teared up a little at the end when I considered what the benefcator had given up to protect homosapiens.

I do not mean to imply that the work is derivative, but it has strong echoes of Larry Niven's 'Protector' and Robert Metzger's 'Picoverse' both of which are amazing reads.

*** I just wish I had some sort of clue how to get an 'in' into the writing market. I've been doing web serial stuff, which is 100% solo. I'm leery of the agent/publisher thing because I have zero experience with it. Benefactor was actually turned down with no explanation as to why from one anthology editor. I knew it was good, and I'm glad many of you agree with my belief :)

I may just stick to self-publishing after this. It was my original plan, but one doesn't learn without trying new things. Unfortunately what I learned was that editors can be damn opaque, and rejection for no given reason is both horribly annoying and painful to the ego.

**** If it is any consolation my experience with the magazine publishing world has been the same as yours. Although you are a better writer than I currently am.

Rather than go through years of rejection as many traditional authors have done, I have decided to keep writing off line and intend to put it up (for free) on Smashwords or Amazon when I have a novella in decent shape. What works for you may be different. Have you considered going on Patreon assuming you can commit to a web serial schedule ?

***** I don't do schedules well :) I am fairly established as a serial webfiction writer though. The people that have been reading me for a while know I can be irregular. I have written 20k words in a day, and gone two or three weeks between chapters. I have yet to accept any income for my work. I figure that my best route will be to serially publish online, then distribute E-books. That will give people a method to donate to me (by buying e-books) and a way for people who don't know anything about me to find me (through E-books)

I might, one day, try to go the typical route to publishing, but that's for the future.
