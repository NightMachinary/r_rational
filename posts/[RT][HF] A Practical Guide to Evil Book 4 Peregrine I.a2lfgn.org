  “I could not,” Tariq said. “And I dislike unnecessary suffering.”

This seems like an analogy for the Procer situation. He's going to work with the Saint and let Procer burn, because he thinks it's dying/broken and can't be saved.

*** This quote shows The Pilgrim's--and by extension--Good's hubris: /he/ could not heal the creature, so it must be put down; /he/ cannot cure the corruption in Procer, thus it must be destroyed. It's very self-centered in a way. Maybe the wyvern would have liked to continue living, despite the pain, just as like the people of Procer would probably like to continue existing despite the corruption, but their wishes don't matter because Tariq knows better.

It really seems like you are just looking for a way to criticize the moral attitude of the Pilgrim and the Heroic mindset in general rather than actually analyzing their actions.

***** I see these comments all the time but don't agree with the position at all. Below/evil seem to like domination and power and cruelty and chaos (demons anyone?) which seem more connected with letting people do mostly what they please. With a few small nudges here and there, narrative twists and pacts and comprimises with evil.

Meanwhile Good isn't only good but is focused on healing and destroying evil. Yes they want to beat Evil, but in their minds overwhelming people with virtue is okay. They aren't really utilitarians, but more focused on virtues. And that doesn't make them bad.

****** Good is focused on ruling and securing power, when considering the game of the Gods in Creation, you always, /always/, need to consider that first paragraph in the prologue to book 1.

#+begin_quote
  In the beginning, there were only the Gods. Aeons untold passed as they drifted aimlessly through the Void, until they grew bored with this state of affairs. In their infinite wisdom they brought into existence Creation, but with Creation came discord. The Gods disagreed on the nature of things: some believed their children should be guided to greater things, while others believed that they must rule over the creatures they had made
#+end_quote

/This/ gives you the mission statement for both Above and Below.

'Guided to greater things' is below, which is always pressing it's Named and followers to advance and create, to skirt the edges of the rules and push beyond them, this is rarely good for those named, and often ends in disaster. Which is very interesting, and gives these gods great amusement.

'Rule over the creatures' is above, who has forced an arbitrary and contradictory form of morality onto the world, this morality only exists to keep above in power, it /may/ in some circumstances, be beneficial, but would you say that Procer is any better a place to live than Praes? With its greedy nobles and war mongering ways?

In the end Above and Below are different and the same, one is in it for power the other entertainment. Neither of them gives a rat's ass about mortals, all they care about is their eternal pissing contest and their own amusement, the ones who should be determining morality for mortals are /mortals/, the gods can fuck off.

******* I don't think it's fair to say that Below is looking for entertainment. It's the age old argument between parents that want their kids to obey them and parents that want their kids to surpass them, or at least grow self-sufficient. By being awful, Below forces its followers to rely on themselves. Heroes look to angels for help all the goddamn time. Villains only summon demons from a position of control.

​

Objectively, right now Below is worse, but in the long run, who knows? It's worth pointing out that Summer and Winter fae were both awful, almost equally so. You can see a focus on the long run is the way Below uses hunger/ambition as a way to shape its tools. The ratlings are one of their poorer efforts, hungry all the time. The orcs have massive caloric requirements. The goblins were weaker than other races. Praes has the Wasteland. The Gods below created their followers in a position of needing to strive, but the Gods above keep them there. The only logical conclusion for followers of below is that they need to break the rules and wreck the game for any sort of justice; which is probably what the Gods below wanted in the first place.

******** I completely agree, though I feel like entertainment is definitely part of it, it was pretty late for me when I made the comment and I haven't been keeping up with the series lately. This is more or less what I think about Below aswell, they are the tough love kind of gods, they push their followers into improvement through sheer need to survive, this makes them stronger and usually more fitting for the roles they are cast in, it however also tends to drive them a tad bonkers, not that all named aren't some level of mad, but the bad guys tend to take it to another level.

**** Above uses its power to reduce the pain of others but also keeps the game going. The only way to actually change things is to go "practical" because it's the only way to get away from the game and stop the endless slaughter and pain that both above and below keeps going. The difference between Above and Below, is that you can't have a "practical guide to good" because Above keeps their pieces locked down while Below grants agency.

Look at the most prominent champions of "good", Pilgrim the utilitarian who won't deviate from the path of zealotry even when it would help people. Hanno who judges all people solely based on the word of Above. Saint who would burn the innocent if she thought the ashes would work provide fertile land for more "Good". And the Bard, who literally manipulates stories to keep the game going forever.

Evil tinges it's champions so that most changes they make don't improve things, but Good doesn't change. Note that the Dwarves are the only force in Calernia who actually manage to improve upon their nation in a functional way over the centuries, and they don't seem to put much stock in either side, "You surface people quibble over devils and books".

**** Agreed. People going on about how evil the Pilgrim is are simply being hypocritical.

What he did to stop Black was undeniably horrible, but let's face it, Black is a mass-murdering monster who was in the middle of a campaign to sack cities and cause mass starvation. What the Pilgrim did likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives in that campaign alone, not to mention all the people he would have killed if he had escaped Procer afterwards.

The Pilgrim's plague was an ugly deed, but it's no worse than many of the things Catherine has done in the name of the greater good, and frankly, it was for a much more clear cut greater good.

And no, Above and Below are not the same. Above promotes ideals of justice, mercy and honour. Good nations and heroes don't always live up to that but at least they try. Below on the other hand encourages betrayal, murder and human sacrifice. Even the best, most reasonable and rational villains in history - Malicia and Black - still conquered a neighbouring Kingdom and practiced suppression and institutionalised murder.

Above has Choirs, which are inhuman forces capable of extreme, horrific deeds. But what powers do they grant? Healing. Knowledge. The ability to stand against dark sorcery, demons and devils, and all powerful madmen like the Dread Emperors. Below has the Hells. What do they bring to the world? Death. Destruction. Corruption. Devils can only be brought into the world by sorcery, often with a helping of human sacrifice, and are invariably used to kill. Demons are likewise only used by villains, and fundamentally damage reality simply by existing in Creation. The difference is rather clear.

What about Light and Night? One of them heals and protects against sorcery, and is obtained through faith and the swearing of vows. The other is used almost solely for violence and is obtained through murder and betrayal. Guess which is which.

Okay, but if you step a layer back from that Black is the least monomaniacal or at least the most compromise inclined villain in hundreds of years, much more inclined than almost all other villains towards trying to work towards lasting international peace. This war continuing will cause /millions/ more people to die than just those who die in Procer from Black's campaign. So the only way this seems even remotely ethical is Good Named constantly reframing the story such that any cost paid to kill Evil Named is worth it.

Blacks killing is apparently so bad it's worth killing way, way more people in order to get rid of him.

'Every former Trueblood not currently aligned with these so-called ‘Moderates' would have to be killed and their entire family line ripped out root and stem'

'Using the Calamities to destroy the capital of the Principate, for a start, should incapacitate its ruling infrastructure. Using a surprise strike to torch and poison the central principalities, the main farmlands of Procer, would lead to widespread starvation come winter'

-Villainous Interlude: Decorum.

Yes. So very compromise inclined and moderate.

Edit: More to the point though I'm not really sure what your argument is. Killing Black will somehow lead to the war becoming much bigger and kill millions? How? The war has already gotten to the stage of mass civilian casualties with the involvement of the Dead King, and Black has no connection there. The Pilgrim already knows Cat is willing to negotiate with the Crusade, so his influence isn't needed there. Malicia will never negotiate on even terms with the Crusade since one of their central goals is to depose her.

Black is an enemy combatant currently engaged in a campaign to cause mass starvation in the Principate. Stopping him undoubtedly saved tens of thousands of lives. You could definitely argue that that didn't justify using a plague or killing a town full of civilians, that the Pilgrim should have found another way, but I don't see how you could think that killing his soldiers and capturing Black somehow leads to millions of deaths.

**** I think there's a point to be made that, whatever the differences between Above and Below are, they've been pretty ambiguous so far, while the similarities have received a lot of emphasis.

The author can say that "Good and Evil map to lowercase good and evil" all he wants, it's kind of hard to see it when the Saint is complicit in undermining her country in the face of total invasion for petty reasons, and Good leaders consistently screw each other over for selfish political gains (and that's without going into the Elves and the Golden Bloom). The only difference we've seen between Proceran politics and Praesi politics is that Proceran prefer conscript armies where Praesi prefer brutal assassinations and private militias; both practice deception and consider it as a valuable trait for politicians (eg Procerans can't shut up about the "Ebb and Flow", usually while gloating about their latest treachery).
