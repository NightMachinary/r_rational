So this is a question inspired by the recent post related to Worm/Practical Guide to Evil. I put it in that thread as a comment but I arrived days late and that thread seems fairly dead, so I'm reposting:

I've seen a lot of people talking about how Taylor escalated and her decisions weren't healthy. And maybe it's the rose colored glasses of nostalgia (it's been over two years since I read Worm in full) but I don't really understand why this is such a popular opinion.

As far as I can tell, Taylor made the sort of ruthless decisions she made because she had to. I don't recall her ever using excessive force for no good reason and escalating when a calmer, more peaceful solution would have worked.

However, it has been some time, and I've seen enough people talk about how she's mentally unstable (which she definitely is) and prone to escalation that I'm just curious; anyone want to give me a quick concise summary on why so many people regard Taylor's choices as irrational/too escalation filled? Her choices, for the most part, seemed very rational to me.


** Taylor seems rational to you because you took her internal monologue at face value.

She's a good example of a person who desperately needs to believe that she was right justified in what she does, and so tells herself whatever she needs to to achieve that.

Her actions are not rational, but she persistently rationalizes them to herself.

Wildbow is about as clear as he can be about this while writing the story from her POV - there are times that she begins to see herself as what she is, usually when she compares herself to others, and she very quickly retreats from that, focuses on something closer at hand, and rationalizes to herself why she has to do something foolish and/or needlessly assholish because of that. That's not a one-time thing, either, it happens again and again and again throughout the story. and when she's depicted as others see her, she's pretty consistently described a lot differently than the way she sees herself - that difference is not just because nobody understands the real her, it's because she also doesn't understand herself because she's constantly talking herself into seeing herself however is convenient to her current impulses and issues.

The actual Taylor is a well-meaning but delusional hypocrite.

*** Love this answer.

It's also important to note that pointing out flaws in Taylor's character, is NOT an attack on the work itself.

I actually think Worm is more interesting precisely /because/ Taylor's a very flawed protagonist. But regardless, it's important not to get defensive, or see criticisms of her choices as insults to a work you enjoy.

(not saying OP's doing that here, but many people /were/ doing that in the original thread, and I see in constantly on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] )

*** This is not a good answer as it is now. It provides no examples. When does she compare herself to others and shrink back? What moves did she make that were assholish that weren't justified?

I think your analysis is spot on, but I've read so much fanfic, I can't remember which events happened in Canon and which didn't. The OP hasn't read the serial in two years. Your point would be much stronger with examples.

*** This answer seems very likely (and it's strongly favoured by the community clearly) so I'm tempted to accept your viewpoint here. Can you give me some clear examples of actions she's taken in that vein? Actions that, from a clear, rational standpoint were compromised heavily by her emotional neuroses and biases.

**** Right off the bat, her decision to take on Lung herself is not rational. She tells herself that she has to do it because otherwise he'd kill kids, but she has no way of knowing how long she has before he reaches his target, has no way of stopping him on her own, and quickly dismisses the idea of getting help, when the fight then accidentally goes on to signal both the undersiders and the protectorate, who come and win it for her. It's also a good example of her fixating on something and using it to talk herself out of doing something sane. ("He'll kill kids! I don't have a phone, so I can't call anyone! Improvising a way to put down a flaming regenerator, the limits of whose powers I have no idea about, all by myself, has got to be way more doable than improvising a way to call someone who knows how to fight him!")

She went out looking for a superhero fight and she talked herself into the first one she found even though it was a terrible idea, because she pretended that the alternatives did not exist. The most likely outcome is that she dies before saving anyone, but because she's ambivalent about living without superheroing at this point, she invents a sense of desperation to justify the course of action she wants to take anyway.

Her follow up of "I'm going to join villains... as an untrained undercover agent. And commit bank robberies" is pretty much her just latching on to the first kids of vaguely her age that are nice to her. She wants to hang out with them and have friends, and so she invents a reason to do so. Someone who actually has experience, without even knowing the details, lays it out to her that having any real emotional connection with the people you're going undercover with is exactly what you do not want at all in an undercover agent because it makes it likely they can't do their job, and that real agents have handlers to oversee them just for things like this and that it'd be better for her to just join up officially now. She ignores all that, and her reason is basically because the guy who told her was rude. Even when the risk of being turned to the enemy is brought up, she ignores it and goes to get turned to the enemy, because ultimately she wants to be turned as the enemy has gotten an emotional hook into her already, she just doesn't want to admit it. The entire undercover operation is a flimsy pretense, which is why when her cover is blown publicly, she decides it's more worth her time to openly join the group she was pretending to pretend to join rather than actually join the protectorate now that even the people in it she respects has heard her story and has reason to believe it, and her rationalization there is, again, that people were mean to her and that must mean the whole thing is rotten. (The fact that the whole thing is kind of rotten is irrelevant, especially since she leaves to go serve the even-more-rotten branch of the same conspiracy.)

Actually, on the subject of people who are mean to her - she repeatedly uses the fact that the powers-that-be harbor Emma, a girl who psychologically tormented her at every turn because making her feel worse makes her feel better, and Sofia, a girl who physically assaulted her repeatedly because she has a power that messes with her ability to relate to humans in a healthy way, as an explanation for why the authorities are terrible people and she can't work with them.

So, instead she works with the undersiders, where her best friends are Sarah/Lisa, a girl who psychologically torments pretty much anyone and everyone who stands against her and meets her face to face, because making them feel helpless and stupid makes her feel powerful and smart, and Rachel, a girl who repeatedly physically assaults people with the help of monstrous trained animals because she has a power that messes with her ability to relate to humans in a healthy way. And this way she gets to work with a bunch of additional rapists and murderers and people who kidnap and drug out children under a guy who tortures his own subordinates for fun as long as they don't learn about it (because it happens in a timeline he'll discard).

Oh, and that drugged out child? After Taylor goes to all that trouble to rescue her, justifying a litany of sins with the warm fuzzies of getting the poor girl back to her family, she starts thinking about how actually, it would be better for both of them if she kept the girl - now that she doesn't need to bleeding heart story to justify her actions, pragmatic self-interest and a story about how it's better for the person she's going to keep as a tool to be kept as a tool by her takes over. It takes the precog seeing exactly where this is going and pre-calling her out on it to guilt her into sticking to the original plan, and she spends much of the rest of the time kicking herself for sticking to her original plan, because keeping the girl would have been the smart thing to do. (Of course, she'd never have been willing to undertake everything it took to get to this point if she was telling herself about how she'd imprison poor Dinah herself for the greater good from the get go, even though that's what she turns to within minutes once it's close enough at hand that all the other stupid, selfish, unnecessarily cruel things have already been done with the justification of saving Dinah from almost the exact same fate.)

This isn't even a tenth of a percent of the examples, even. Actually, that podcast on worm, "We've got worm" seems to do a pretty good job of drawing attention to it when Taylor does this, and when wildbow specifically draws attention to it using other viewpoints and Taylor visibly shrinking back from admitting it, so if you want it in long form, there's dozens of hours of examples there.

***** Thanks for typing this all out. I've heard these arguments before, but I never really realized the extent of it.

I think maybe you're being a bit hard on Taylor about the Dinah thing. If I recall correctly Dinah herself started freaking out about the possibility of her parents not wanting her back, and other fears. And I think that's likely what would have lead Taylor to think "She'd be better off staying with us" if Dinah hadn't given her that probability. Also I sincerely doubt Taylor would have kept Dinah against her will. At worst she would have subtly manipulated her into also thinking that staying with the Undersiders was in her best interests... which is bad yes. But Taylor would have actually believed that (in part because she's so good at justifying things to herself).

But other than that... yeah. She made a lot of very questionable decisions for reasons that don't make any sense if her goals were altruistic.

****** Well, Taylor would certainly have been a kinder jailer to Dinah than Coil. She would not have kidnapped her from her family during relatively good times, for starters. She would not have intentionally addicted her to drugs to keep her under control. She would, as long as you didn't get her time to prepare her counter-arguments preemptively, never keep the girl if the girl begged her to be released.

Would she keep her on the drugs, though? I wouldn't be surprised at all if she would look at the poor kid suffering through withdrawal and decide it's better to wean her off slowly, and conveniently, hey, Taylor is in a great place to keep supplying her with the drugs while she gets off of them and keep her safe in the interim! Except that you can't have a stable environment around Taylor. She's always picking fights with dangerous people. Dinah might miss a dose here and there because Taylor's out fighting someone, or their supplies got destroyed in a raid or something. She might take extra when she figures out where the drugs are stashed, since she's addicted. The whole weaning off thing may never happen. It wouldn't be because Taylor's trying to hurt her, but she'd get hurt, and as long as they're still working on it, she might as well provide Taylor with all those predictions. After all, it's to help everyone.

End result, she winds up hiding out in a supervillain's bunker, serving as a causality radar, wishing she went home months ago but unable to due to a combination of fear and dependency. But you know, at least Taylor will feel kind of bad about it and feel the need to reiterate to both of them that it's really for the best.

******* I can't say all that isn't possible.

Though I think it more likely that Taylor would try to detox her off the drugs than keep supplying her with them. The only thing that stopped her from doing that in cannon was Dinah herself giving a prediction that stopping that way without going through heavy withdraw would make her more likely to relapse.

Taylor was never a fan of drugs, so I doubt she'd be an enabler even in this situation.

Everything else about constantly exposing her to a dangerous situation while acting as if that were the best possible choice for everyone involved sounds exactly like something she'd do though.

**** Krixwell's liveblog is only up to arc 8, but he does point out a few rationalizations from that period of time:

#+begin_quote
  “He'll heal,” I pointed out, “Eventually.”

  “You blinded someone who was helpless to fight back. That's kind of fucked up.”

  I couldn't say much to that. Fucked up or not, it had been necessary. I couldn't have dealt with it if I'd known we left him there and he got back to business as usual by the end of the day. I'd stopped him, best as I was able.
#+end_quote

Lung was already on the ground, defeated by this point - carving out his eyes was excessive, especially because she knew the most it would do is stall his recovery.

#+begin_quote
  But, strange as it sounded, I would feel worse about handing their information to the Protectorate if this sort of negativity was what I was leaving behind when I did it. I knew it made no sense, but I wanted to be able to tell myself I'd had one successful set of friendships, before I severed ties for the sake of doing the right thing.
#+end_quote

Justification for staying with the Undersiders when she'd already had the information to turn them in.

#+begin_quote
  I felt good. Better than I'd felt for a long, long while. Admittedly, there were painful stabs of conscience when I thought too much about the fact that I'd actually participated in a felony, or the way I'd terrorized the hostages. Could I be blamed if I went out of my way not to dwell on it?
#+end_quote

Quotes that I couldn't find from his blog and can't be bothered to find in the text itself: she hurts both Velocity and Clockblocker and promised to make it up to them later, as justification. She resolves to write her letter to Miss Militia instead of Armsmaster because she thinks Armsmaster will be tough to convince, but this is really just one step towards not writing the letter at all. She starts using tactics of excessive force, /inspired by Lung and Bakuda/ because she needs to establish her authority over the criminals in her territory. She stays with the Undersiders well past saving Dinah because she feels like it, etc.

If you think that Worm is bad, don't read Twig. (I'm saying that facetiously, of course. Go read Twig.) The characters in Twig are, in my opinion, far stronger and better written than the characters in Worm or Pact. You'll go straight from hating Sy, to loving Sy, to feeling bad for him, to feeling REALLY bad for him, just to go back to hating him.

What do you like so much about the world building? For me, it turned me off more, because I didn't feel it made sense. Especially now that I have read spoilers, the explanation for much of it is just "It was a Cauldron plot."

"We need more parahumans." → Replace death penalty with caging.

"We think Feudalism is the way to go." → Introduce medieval three-strikes rule to justice system.

"Only parahumans can help against Scion." → Globally induce learned helplessness of muggles when fighting parahumans.

Regarding three strikes: It was about how often they were caught, I think, not how often they committed felonies. However, even then it was applied very irregularly, like all of the rules.

** The main problem with Taylor is that she never, ever, asks for or accepts help. She could have gone to the administration every single time the Trio did anything to her, forcing them to eventually do something about it just to make her shut up and go away. Instead, she bore it for a year and a half with almost no protest. /Sophia,/ of all people, is the one to point this out. The Protectorate would have bent over backwards to have someone as powerful and versatile as her. If she'd been with them the whole time, they would have dropped Sophia in a second the moment Taylor learned who she was, just to keep her on. She completely ignored the advice of anyone around her in that regard. She fought Lung instead of calling for help. She joined the Undersiders planning to betray them without asking anyone if that was even a good idea first. She took it entirely upon herself to take down Coil and barely acknowledged the fact that it only worked because Lisa had done all of the work in the background. She turned herself in to the PRT without telling anyone on her team what she was planning. Without even coordinating with Lisa, who could have told her how to actually get what she wanted.

She takes on Scion, alone, after asking Amy to mutilate her brain. Sure, she recruited the help of literally everyone else, but she never even noticed Imp keeping her company despite having access to probably dozens of parahumans who could have identified her. The only time she accepts anyone's help is when she is literally bodyjacking the universe, and even then she only accepts that help dispassionately.

The list goes on. Taylor is allergic to even thinking about depending on others. She always keeps everything close to her chest, even and especially when that is detrimental to her. It's this attitude which makes her so desperately lonely the entire story, and she never once realizes why. If she'd put even an ounce of effort into it, she could probably have had a healthy relationship with Theo, but she couldn't see that possibility floating in front of her face because she had to face the Nine and the end of the world alone, alongside Theo. It's madness!

But it's fascinating madness, and it's so well done that we don't even notice it's happening on the first pass. She looks like she's being reasonable. Her distrust of everyone else seems justified because she always remembers the times people screwed her over and never remembers the little kindnesses. How many times does someone save her life, with her barely acknowledging it after? How many times does she sieze on betrayals great and small and use those to confirm her preconceived notions?

Too many to count.

*** Her second relevant trait here is her ready acceptance of suffering/responsibility. She doesn't fully trust anyone and assumes she alone has to do everything.

When her mother dies she just accepts that her father is useless forever. Over years she just considers him an inanimate fixture standing in the back-ground that has to be worked around.

Did you notice that even as a motormouth, bright-eyed child she only had one single actual friend? And when she turns on her, she asks herself why that happens, but soon accepts that Emma has just one day become evil and will forever be her nemesis. No attempt to investigate, never talking to Emma's parents (as far as I can tell), never talking to her own parent. The world has just changed and Taylor will have to suffer forever.

There are more examples, but they mix together with her accepting no help. In sum, she acts as if the rest of the world were a game and she the PC. She is the only actor, she is responsible for all problems in the world, the world is often out to get her and everyone else are either obstacles or have to follow her commands.

*** I'm not arguing that she was an uber-rationalist, but she was unusually rational for a bullied teenager. Edit: her shard is also egging her on

1) Her bully was on the wards. She could have told the Protectorate about Sophia's habits, but it would be Taylor's word against Sophia's. She had know way of knowing that Sophia wasn't a well liked and respected member of the team. The second time she tried to Armsmaster he burned her, so she would've had to start with a criminal record. It became sink or swim.

2) She went hoping that she could prevent someone from getting hurt because the team did not have any powers capable of subduing a crowd without hurting them.

3) She didn't know about the girl before deciding to rob the bank. That course of action was fueled by personal guilt. She knew that turning Coil down might bring reprisal, so she was trying to release his hostage which is a step in the direction of bringing him down. By the time she decided to be a "warlord" Brockton Bay was in chaos and she was providing aid and law enforcement.

** Pretty much every Taylor escalation is an example of the HPMOR 'you need to learn how to lose' lesson. She always escalates instead, which has long term consequences - both socially (her struggles with the heroes) and directly - her shard/passenger feeds on the escalation, encourages more, until she loses a part of herself to it. Which is almost the scariest and most direct example of value drift possible.

If the spectres of Cauldron/Contessa/Zion weren't around to retroactively justify it, she'd be in a much worse spot in life as a result of it all, I'd think. Alexandria or someone would have just ended the little feudal lord thing they had going, and that'd be it.

*** I don't recall her having that much choice in the matter though (although I'm not saying you're wrong; I'm saying I don't recall it)

Here are some of the escalation examples off the top of my head (these are not in any particular order):

- Lung - Rots crotch off (since you know, it's /Lung/ and all she has are bugs)

- Alexandria - Drowns with bugs (well, Alexandria deliberately deceived her into thinking she was killing her friends, the reason why escapes me, but considering there was no way to otherwise harm/incapacitate her, I don't see what choice she had)

- Aster - Shoots the kid (Can't fully remember her reasoning here but all signs did point to Aster being what allowed Jack to end the world, especially considering Scion had been an unequivocal (if silent and inefficient) force for good for decades at this point. I doubt Taylor could even conceive of Scion as a threat; he was like a force of nature more than a thing that could be controlled by Jack)

- Bank heist situation - Black widow threat/hitting Amy (Taylor did this to avoid casualties as best she could, IIRC. This was at the time when she was still planning to turn the Undersiders over thanks to Armsmaster's shitty, vague advice)

I can't think of any more right now (though I'm sure they're a lot more) but in those situations listed, I can see why Taylor logically made the choices she did. Learning how to lose is all well and good when what you have to lose isn't close to comparatively worth the cost you incur to win but in these situations, a cursory cost-benefit analysis seems to check out.

She could have opted out, said she wasn't comfortable with it, whatever, and the Undersiders would have likely listened. But she didn't. Instead she /robbed a fucking bank/. In the scenario in which you find yourself doing something as obviously villainous as /robbing a bank/, you have to ask yourself - could I have forseen this? Did I seriously expect to do this with no complications? Is this worth it? Yes, no, and no, in most cases. But Taylor wanted to take out her anger on something, to feel wanted and competent.

Etc, etc.

She compartmentalizes things with a vague 'moral code' justification - The entire saga with Dinah/Coil is the obvious example - and instead of taking relatively minor losses, she escalates. Rather than be a Ward, she joins the Undersiders. Instead of accepting fault for her earliest crimes and joining the heroes again, she fights against them and accepts being Coil's minion. Rather than report the Dinah situation to the heroes and working something out with Lisa, she kills him herself and becomes a full on warlord. Etc, etc.

Specifically administrations that claim to only try and protect people while failing at doing just that.

Of course, this isn't exactly rational as one bad administration isn't evidence of them all being bad but I can see why due to her age, her experience with her school's administration and her experience with the Undersiders (both in seeing that people on the "other" side aren't simply evil and that administrations like the government fail hard, such as with Brian's situation with Aisha, Lisa's (Tattletale) situation with her family, Rachel's (Bitch) situation with the overall government (specifically the foster care situation) ) that Taylor would have an innate distrust of administration. Which is then exacerbated by her experience with Brockton Bay's particularly bad administrative system such as her dealings with Armsmaster, Piggot and then Piggot's replacement (can't recall his name)

I'm not saying that Taylor stayed with her street gang specifically because she felt as if it was the best way to combat said bad administration. But I can see why she's more than inclined to distrust the administration and rely on the street gang that's demonstrated that it has her back time and again.

And I can definitely agree that Taylor rationalized her way into staying with the Undersiders to some degree. Someone that lonely and emotionally damaged would obviously latch on to the first people to give a fuck while not necessarily realizing that's what she was doing. Although I do think Armsmaster rubbing her the wrong way (especially considering her stated distrust of authority) had a lot to do with it as well. Not necessarily blaming Armsmaster for it but cause and effect you know?

Overall her decision to stay with them wasn't that smart but I could see an intelligent person at her level (with no LE training or anything even close to it) thinking that her plan was the way to do the most good.

** I recommend listening to the podcast We've Got WORM. They go into great detail on how she self-justifies and compartmentalizes throughout the story, and it makes it very clear how much of an unreliable narrator she is.

Arc 1: She decides to attack Lung and his gang members instead of attempting to call the Protectorate. She justifies it by thinking that it would be difficult to find a phone to do so, but there are a ton of different ways she could have gone about it (knocked on someone's door, break into an empty house, find a police officer). Her real reason for attacking them is that she came out in costume looking for a fight. Not joining the Wards in the first place is escalation.

Arc 2: Bitch attacks her with her dogs, and she immediately responds aggressively to this. It works for her, but it could have just as easily escalated further.

Arc 3: Instead of listening to Armsmaster and just telling him what she already knows, she decides to rob a bank in the hope that she'll get more information about the Undersiders. During this, she threatens hostages with black widow bites, and attacks multiple heroes by forcing bugs down their throats or beneath their eyelids.

Arc 4: Emma insults Taylor, and her response is to say something along the lines of "You don't know anything", laugh and leave school. She doesn't do this because of true self-confidence, she does it because she just robbed a bank and is still high off it.

Arc 5: Taylor punches Emma at the mall because she smiled, throws papers onto the floor during a meeting at school, leaves to go fight the ABB even though she's still recovering from a head injury and was explicitly told she doesn't have to join the fight. While fighting, she cuts out Lung's eyes, justifying it by saying that she had to put him out of the fight and that he'll heal from it anyways---even though he's already out of the fight, and he's been shown before to have really good hearing when empowered.

I could keep going for more and more arcs, but I think the point is kind of made. Even in the first five arcs, she's more violent than she needs to be, and confronts situations that she doesn't need to when she could just as easily back down and get her comeuppance later.

This isn't me trying to put a character down, it's me trying to understand a character.

My model of Taylor has her containing flaws; I think that this model gives the most meaning to the work in terms of what it might be trying to say, and fits the available evidence better than a model where she is consistently acting out of necessity and optimizing for her situations without bias.

Or perhaps this is just a question of what we're calling a flaw? Maybe you see all the same motivating factors behind what Taylor does (bullying, abusive authority figures, etc.) and think to yourself, "Taylor is properly calibrated to the world she finds herself in, regardless of where these parts of her personality come from"?

Alright, you're on. I will go to the chapter where Lung first appears, which I think most people critical of Taylor would mark as her first really irrational move, and look through the comments to see what people thought. When I get back, I'll report on my findings.

--------------

There are 21 comments in total, including replies.

Of those, I count 8 whose comments seem to imply that they are reading the story for the first time.

I count two comments which seem to accept her course of action at face value:

#+begin_quote
  As well, I really enjoyed the fact that Worm didn't really know what she was getting herself into. Even with online research, sometimes the bad guy might have a super power you just don't know about.
#+end_quote

To me this seems to indicate that this reader isn't considering about not fighting as an option.

#+begin_quote
  This chapter works as a great way to compel the protagonist to action, giving her a clear enemy, a compelling reason to fight him despite her reserved and cautious nature, and establishing the danger of the situation.
#+end_quote

This person seems to consider what's happened so far to be "a compelling reason to fight".

And I count two comments suggesting that she is unprepared for this fight and unlikely to succeed:

#+begin_quote
  Taylor sounds really precocious. If Lung's beaten whole teams of heroes, then why does she, a neophyte, suppose that she can take him down?

  So, she can just start fighting crime without any formal training? You'd think there would be some kind of training program for aspiring heroes.
#+end_quote

Now, obviously this is an admittedly minuscule sample size, and the test should probably be repeated for a few other key scenes, such as when Taylor tells Armsmaster that she's going undercover. But even so, half of the people who commented on her decision to fight Lung pointed out that it was a bad idea. Nobody chose to offer suggestions of alternate choices she could have made, which is unsurprising given the small number of comments in early chapters, but it wouldn't be hard to think of some alternatives once the decision to not fight Lung has been made. Despite the fact that I have an information advantage over the character due to knowing what happens further in the story, I don't think it's impossible for her to have considered using her bugs to get someone's attention as a means of calling for help.

After writing the above, I went back to check the comments on the next chapter, where the fight actually begins, and found this comment:

  Decided to go back and re-read this. Gee Taylor if you can't make a phone call, why not have lightning bugs spell out “Lung Here” in the sky? What do you mean this isn't the Silver Age?
#+end_quote

Granted, that is an admitted reread, but it further demonstrates that I'm not being particularly clever by thinking of this. It is very much something anyone could come up with, and is a much better solution to the problem. The reason Taylor didn't think of it is that she didn't make any honest effort to try thinking of alternatives to fighting. At most, she thought of calling for help and then dismissed it almost immediately. This is something that people reading along with her story were at least in some cases aware of, even while limited to working with the same amount of information as Taylor.

Whatever her merits as a character, despite her courage and determination, despite even the creativity and intelligence that she demonstrates at other times, she is a profoundly flawed character and one of the most glaring of those flaws is that she's very prone to rationalization rather than rationalism. She makes very bad decisions frequently, and she doubles down on those decisions rather than admit defeat, because she consistently convinces herself that what she's doing is right rather than honestly considering whether or not she's in the right. She is not an especially rational person, nor was she ever intended to be. She is an emotionally vulnerable, emotionally unstable young woman with no relevant training that would allow her to make good decisions in the situations she chooses to involve herself in. It is not a criticism of the quality of the character to point this out, nor is it an attempt to seem superior by bringing low a well respected character. Her decision making skills are not something she is well respected for, and criticizing them does not undermine the things she is respected for.

*** That's harsh. "Explain how an entire category of opinions is baseless because the people having these opinions have cognitive/psychological biases that are below me" is also a popular status game on the Internet.

I don't think you're status blind. I think you see status differently, and you have little regard for how most people attribute status, but aside from that you play status games too. You've used the "people disagree with me because they're limited by their perception of status" card before, for one thing.

Aside from that, I thought that some of Taylor's decisions were weird or suboptimal during my first readthrough, mostly in the early story. Namely, trying to go undercover in a criminal group without government backing (especially after a government agent explained to her why this was a stupid idea), staying on that course after she learned there was a powerful thinker in said group, and going back to that group after she basically got a pardon from the authorities.

Maybe I would have made the same mistakes in that situation; I would probably have made other mistakes. And she has in-character reasons for doing those things (distrust for authority, etc). But I definitely noticed these things on my first reading, so it's not just hindsight bias. Also, Wildbow has talked about Taylor character's before as being self-deceiving and semi-suicidal and stuff on occasion, so that's another data point.

I know that people like to talk about death of the author /a lot/, but this seems like one of those areas where, when we have an argument over how to model a character and their behavior, we can look to the author and get some insight into the model they used to generate those thoughts and behavior. Here are a few pieces of WoG, mostly pulled from the wiki page:

#+begin_quote
  <@Wildbow> She compartmentalizes things, but she's very prone to having her perspective skew like crazy.

    Taylor isn't suicidal but would have dropped out of school.
  #+end_quote

  Depends on your definition of suicidal. I've fairly sure I've dropped WoG (That's noted in the archives) that states Taylor would not live in a lot of AUs because she was liable to tailspin into self destruction (the thought 'I want to die' not crossing her mind even as she put herself into dangerous situations) in a lot of scenarios where she didn't have the same outside influence.

That said, one of the fun things about analysis is that you can read whatever you want into the work, regardless of what the author intended when they wrote it, and I don't want to take that away from anyone.

#+end_quote

That's really over-dramatic and also not what literary criticism is about at all.

The characters being discussed aren't real people. Pointing out character flaws as a step of critically analyzing a novel shouldn't make anyone feel superior to them. The actual reason people dissect characters on a deeper level than the superficial is because it enhances their enjoyment of the novel.

#+begin_quote
  Talking about how superior you are to a person or character that others dare to admire is a very popular pasttime on the Internet, and it seems to propagate virulently and drive out admiration.

It's amazing how you can contribute nothing of substance except to brag about how you're immune to cognitive bias and then accuse everyone else of trying to seem superior. This is far below the standard of discourse usually found around here. Are you new?

If so, there are some lovely links in the sidebar you should check out, to learn more about the study and application of rationality. I especially recommend the writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky.

** When she surrendered to the PRT, the conversation went like this:

Taylor: I'm a criminal warlord with a list of charges pages long that literally includes treason. I'll plea out, you leave my supervillain friends alone to run their criminal empires, the local PRT Director [Tagg, who is too military-minded and uncompromising] retires, Miss Militia [well-respected cape with great integrity and ability to listen and negotiate] gets installed as new Director, and you use me as a resource to do good. If you don't agree to these terms then in a few hours my friends, who are known murderers with superpowers, will declare war on the PRT. Oh, and I'll bend on the "use my powers for good" part -- you can just send me to your hell-prison if you want.

Alexandria: I'm one of the three most powerful heroes in the world and a critical element in the frequent fights against the giant kaiju that are slowly destroying civilization. I'm not accepting your terms. I'm going to go capture or kill your friends, one by one. [does so twice, tranquilizing one target and breaking limbs of body-puppeting sociopathic rapist in the process] Okay, now that you see I can do it, here are my terms. Your friends don't get amnesty and can still be targeted by cops. I release the ones I just captured, with all necessary medical care. You get two years probation. Tagg stays in charge. Miss Militia is promoted elsewhere.

Taylor: No. and if you hurt my friends anymore I will kill you.

Alexandria: [goes out, comes back with a body bag. Taylor does not know who is in the bag]

Taylor: [suffocates Alexandria with bugs, gives Tagg a fatal number of venomous bug bites]

I'd say that was some over-the-top escalation.

*** Rationally speaking, taking out Alexandria was a move Taylor shouldn't have taken because of her importance to the world, true. But if someone tells you they will capture/kill your friends and then returns with a body bag, can you reasonably be expected to think "Maybe they're bluffing and that's some unrelated mook in the bag" as opposed to thinking "Oh fuck, she killed one of the only people that accepted me."

Especially considering that, right before that, she went out and brought back two targets that you knew (or as good as knew) were said friends she threatened?

Taylor had three chances to take what was, frankly, a very reasonable deal. She had killed lots of people, committed huge numbers of well-documented crimes, and Alexandria was telling her "no prison time, only two years of probation." Taylor's choice was "kill one of the literally most important people in the world" or "give up on a set of demands that I have admitted are unlikely to be granted."

Seriously, how is this remotely defensible?

***** Weren't most (possibly all?) of the people she killed done so in self defense or because they were an active threat to BB? Even so, at this point in the story, I don't think Taylor had killed /that/ many people. Though I could be wrong there, for certain.

Taylor did have chances, yes. But she didn't want to compromise and risk both her friends and the people in her territory. BB's administration had demonstrably failed them, particularly after the Leviathan attack (not really blaming them since, ya know, /water kaiju in a fucking bay/) so she wasn't inclined to trust them.

The deal was certainly reasonable. But Tagg had demonstrated that he was a massive asshole. And Alexandria were threatening (and seemingly carrying out) her friends with death. I think Taylor's actions in that context were emotionally charged, hasty and somewhat self serving. But I wouldn't call them irrational.

P.S Any chance you recall what chapter that took place in? If not, that's fine, I'll track it down myself. Was just curious because this discussion has made me want to re-read that particular exchange.
