** I was wondering what Bionicle had to do with Star Trek, and I am vaguely disappointed that it is just a profile image.

** Love these. Not sure if they're rational precisely, aside from some trans humanism later on or some silly stuff like seatbelts.

** This is an SI fic where the main character has meta-awareness of the series and goes around making "improvements", pulling practical jokes, and subverting the episodes where the cast make bad decisions.

Like a lot of SIs Data comes across as overly competent and isn't challenged often, and in a lot of ways the plot revolves around him already knowing the right answer, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and it has some funny scenes.

** For those who don't know their forum system: starting with the first chapter on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/33296179/][this post]] puts a "Threadmarks" tag on the top and bottom, making it easy to click forward to the next chapter without returning to the table of contents. Bookmarking the story if you stop reading partway through allows you to keep the threadmarks when you return.
