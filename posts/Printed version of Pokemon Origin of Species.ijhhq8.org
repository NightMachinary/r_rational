** I got the entire Pokemon: Origin of Species story up until the current chapter printed as 5 500-ish page books.

I'm really pleased with how they came out and wanted to show them off here. I hope that's ok, I know it's a little different from the usual content on this subreddit.

**** It comes out to chapters 25, 42, 55, 71 and then 83 of course. I wanted to split them by story arc first, but I was kind of forced into this split by the page limit on the books. Splitting them any other way would have resulted in 6 books.

It doesn't work out too badly, it helps that basically all your chapters are fairly self contained and end on a meaningfull-ish final line/cliffhanger to set you up for the next book.

Just to check, I know you're not commercially spreading these around, but did you get the artist's permission to use their images? (I'm imagining no, but it would be pretty cool if you did and they said yes).

Have you considered posting the pdf files somewhere? Possibly on git if you use that? I know that some people on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]] do that and there are others who then use those files to print out their own versions even years later.

*** Aside from the fact that pdfs/epubs are apparently made available to patreon subscribers, which I wasn't aware of (and which incidentally could have saved me a bunch of effort), I wouldn't want to distribute these in the shape they are in now anyway. I was under a bit of time pressure when making these, so they're pretty rough (eg. all the chapters still end on the '/If you have found a spelling error, please notify me.../' message).

Also, if I did that, I would first want to get permission from the artist that made the art for the cover as well as Daystar, because making this stuff for myself is one thing, distributing it like that is quite another.

*** I don't know if I would want such a service to exist. Yes, it'd help to print things like HPMoR and Origin of Species that otherwise wouldn't be printable commercially, but it would also allow you to pirate physical books from authors that are/might in the future be able to sell them commercially.

*** Anyone can print stuff like this for their own use because, even though it has copyrighted elements like names, it falls under fair use since it's fanfiction. It's not illegal as long it's just for their own personal use.

And it's not illegal to use a printing store to print the book for your own personal use. So... It becomes kind of redundant. If people are interested, they can print for themselves. There are even HPMOR ebooks out there already ready that people can just print if they are interested, for example.

**** Fanfiction is probably not fair use, it just typically falls under the "way too much effort/PR damage for companies to do something about" category. The Pokemon Company would be entirely in their rights to tell Daystar to stop making OoS, they just won't because it's not harming their bottom line and doing something about it would make them look bad.

Printing books for your own personal use is definitely not fair use. By printing these books I'm violating the copyrights of Daystar, Arvalis (the guy that made the images on the covers) and the Pokemon Company. It's just that I don't think any of them care.

Finally, printing companies absolutely have to (pretend to) care about not printing copyrighted works as they could get into a shitload of trouble if they got found knowingly doing that. Now, most of the time the policies used to prevent you from printing copyrighted material are easily circumvented (as well as exceptionally poorly enforced), but I've gotten prints rejected before for using copyrighted mtg art.

***** I'll explain it a bit better.

Fair use is always decided on a case by case basis. So, technically, we can't really say that fanfiction, in general, is fair use or not, we would have to look at it case by case.

Nonetheless, when deciding if it's fair use, there are several criteria used, including if it's meant for nonprofit purposes (like educational, parody and criticism purposes), if it affects the market value of the copyrighted work, the amount of what is used in regards to the copyright work and the nature of the copyright work.

Based on that, a fanfiction will have a high chance of being considered fair use if it's transformative compared to the copyrighted work, if it's nonprofit, if it uses relatively little of the copyrighted work, and if it doesn't effect negatively the market value of the copyright work.

The issue is that the vast majority of fanfiction meets that criteria. Their use of the copyrighted work is limited to the setting and the characters (being highly transformative in comparison), they are nonprofit and they certainly don't really affect the market value of the copyrighted work.

In conclusion, if taken to court, based purely on merits, the vast majority of fanfiction has a high degree chance of being considered fair use, which is why I stated that it was fair use since I considered it the most likely scenario for the majority of cases, and most countries have fair use in a way or another.

As for the copyright holders taking people to court, that's the thing: literally anyone can take anyone to court. I don't have to be minimally right about my arguments to take someone else to court, I just need the will and money to put them there. Who's right and who's wrong only really comes up later when the court decides.

So, copyright holders, who have lots of money, will take people to court, regardless of being right or completely wrong if they feel that the outcome might be beneficial in some way, even in indirect ways.

Often, big companies even try to win just by putting economic pressure on the opponent, meaning that it ends up not being about who is right but who has more resources because they just try to make it so that fighting them in court is too expensive and too demanding, which grants them an automatic win because the opponent just folds in that case.

All this means that the ability of the copyright holders to take someone to court means basically nothing in terms of who is right and who is not. And in terms of whether its fair use or not, following the criteria for that, most fanfiction would have a high degree of chance of being fair use.

As for the printing companies, once again, it's not about who is actually right. They just want to protect themselves and thus many just don't want to draw any kind of attention from the copyright holders, even if the printing companies are right. It's way easier to simply refuse a few orders.

EDIT: Btw, there's not much of a real difference, even legally, between me accessing a place online to get a digital copy of a fanfiction and me accessing a place online to print a physical copy of the same fanfiction (without distributing it to anyone).
