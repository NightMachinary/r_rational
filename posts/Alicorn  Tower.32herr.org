** I could see myself giving several different answers to this sort of test, depending on many factors down to even things affecting my mood like the time of day and when I last had a meal; I don't think I'd like to be classified by something so... arbitrary.

Consider Chris Anvil's story Test Ultimate short story (go read it if you haven't*): a jump into a pool of predatory fish, encouraged by an authority figure, seems pretty similar. I would be far more likely to jump into that pool than I would to jump from the tower, simply because I am irrationally extra afraid of heights but I am not extra afraid of piranha...

Also, I for one enjoy the company of those who approach things differently from myself at least as much as those who are similar...

An interesting and thought-provoking story, though.

* You can snag a lot of Chris Anvil's stuff from the 1635 Baen CD released with full allowance for free copying/redistribution of the CD's contents, from [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/]] . Test ultimate shows up in one of the two Interstellar Patrol books there.

** Green goes east, blue goes north, brown goes west, white goes south, grey goes down...

The pattern's missing one. What about up?

(P.S. White is clearly the best colour.)

** Hmm. My actual reaction would probably be some mixture of white and gray, with a very strong tendency to signal blue-robedness because I'm not-so-secretly paranoid about people using my open-secret idealist tendencies against me. The brown-robers are the ones I admire most and want to be like.

Is there another robe color for being a fucked-up person?

*** "- leap from this tower," said the gray-robed figure.

The dizzying drop loomed before them. After all this effort, after all these trials, after being pushed to the limits of his mind, it all came to this. What a joke.

Jad grinned, his lips parting wider and wider until his polished teeth were fully revealed, his smile reaching up to his cheeks, then his eyes, then his eyebrows. He put his hand on the gray-robed figure's shoulder. Jad was a picture of joy. The laughter that shook him soon erupted into audibility, and he screamed his ecstasy from the top of the tower that all the world might know his sublime pleasure.

He stopped laughing, and for a moment the chamber echoed with his aborted mirth. It was pleasant, to have an audience that appreciated him. He turned to look at the gray-robed figure.

"I get it! I got the joke, mentor. That's what this is, right? A sick joke?"

Silence from the gray-robed figure, except for a grunt and a slap. Unperturbed, Jad continued.

"That's the right answer, isn't it? This is all some kind of fucked-up game for you, isn't it? Answer me!"

Jad shook the grey-robed figure violently, but still no reply. Not even a grunt any more.

"Why won't you ANSWER ME?"

Finally, he let go of the gray-robed figure's neck and the man fell limply to the floor. Jad was alone at the top of the tower, now, with only echoes his companions. He laughed, and the world laughed with him.

** What other things might you do?

Jump off before they tell you to. Push the guy in the grey robe off. Steal his robe and run down to the bottom and claim you're him. Drop something. Go back down the tower while resetting all the puzzles on your way. Jump off the tower, then climb back up and do it again until you get it right. Jump from the bottom floor of the tower. Rappel down the tower. Go down the stairs, and claim that you jumped despite all evidence to the contrary. Leave the tower, and say that you got bored. Go down the stairs, and claim that you're the guy in the robe and the other guy stole your robe. Pull out a gun and threaten the guy in the cloak if he doesn't say you passed. Any others?

*** "Now the final test --"

Jimmy ran forwards to the edge and jumped into a perfect sky-dive. He knew magical safety mechanisms to break high falls when he saw them.

He was handed a black robe.

"-- jump."

"You first," Emma said.

The grey-robed man smiled under his hood, and jumped.

"Schmuck," Emma said, and stayed behind.

Ten minutes later, the teacher found Emma napping at the top. She received a Yellow robe.

The gray robed figure nods grimly, slowly and deliberately reaching into her pouch and pulling out a cloak of blood-red.

**** The last person tested in the story receives gray robes like the testers and is not led away from the tower.

edit: On second thought gray might just be the "testing/administration caste" so there probably is no right answer. Then the laugh is propably not an indication of a true pass but welcoming of a coworker.
