I was listening to the Rationally Writing podcast when Daystar (I think) mentioned that there were so many ways to use even a peanut's worth of unbreakable material - but he didn't mention any. So, what are the ways to munchkin something like?

** Break the laws of physics, utterly.

Let's say you have a platonic solid - a cube - that is the literal ideal "rigid body", just a bit of volume that can't be deformed or broken, it only possesses mass and a moment of inertia.

Such an object will allow you to fundamentally violate relativity.

Push it on one end, the other end will move /instantly/, because it can't deform. That means it allows FTL signalling.

If it /can/ deform, it must have an elastic modulus to do so, but I guess then you could exploit the fact that it can accumulate literally infinite elastic energy because it never breaks. And I'm not even sure how /that/ would work because where is that energy stored? The object doesn't have any individual atoms, it can't be in the potential of the electromagnetic field that keeps them together. So does that energy just go somewhere else? Does it even contribute to the local stress-energy tensor? Everything basically stops making sense.

**** Well, you couldn't use it to send FTL messages to Mars that way if it's just peanut-sized of course. But it still breaks physics. I mean, basically, if any part of it can move FTL, it can /all/ move FTL. So maybe you can just slam it into a railgun and keep accelerating it to infinity?

It's hard to figure out how it would work because /it should not work/, so all bets are off. I'm also trying to think if there's some clever experimental setup with subatomic particles or photons where you exploit its FTL movement qualities. It should be an infinite potential barrier, so it should completely bar quantum particles from tunnelling or even having a vanishing wavefunction in it, and combined with the FTL stuff that means if you just used it as a piston in a cylinder full of some kind of gas or plasma, and one of those particles happened to be colliding with it when suddenly you push it a bit inside... I have /no idea/ WTF would happen, that sounds like it ought to transfer infinite energy to that particle. Oh, and anything that's FTL is basically travelling backwards in time in certain frames of reference, to make things more complicated. Easy stuff.

As for the deformable version, it's less outrageous, but still outrageous. At a basic level it's the perfect energy storage. No losses, 100% efficiency, infinite capacity. Can you break the first principle and create free energy with it? I don't think so, not in an obvious way I can think of, though the fact that this ought to be a /classical/ object in a quantum world might still give rise to some serious mindfucky consequences which may or may not break thermodynamics. But due to 100% efficiency it's basically already breaking the /second/ principle. Or... skirting the limit, really, since that's just zero entropy creation, not negative entropy. But perhaps you can use it also to extract energy from a colder body, and thus reduce entropy. Suppose for example it's perfectly reflective (it ought to be, it's not like it has individual atoms to absorb light!). Then I think you could use this setup: put it in a chamber with a gas at T > 0 and shine a laser on it at an angle, then collect that laser with a photoelectric cell and turn it back into electrical energy. The molecules of the gas hit it and make it oscillate, and that oscillation modulates the laser's frequency, thus transmitting some of its energy to it. I /think/ you could use some variation on this theme to extract energy out of the gas, making use of the fact that the cube doesn't have thermal radiation, doesn't have a temperature, and is perfectly reflective. But I should try and run the numbers to be sure, and it's likely that it wouldn't be very useful regardless due to the losses in the laser + photovoltaic cell apparatus.

** Worst case scenario it's slightly deformable so you can't violate the speed of light but you still can't deform it enough to really change its shape much. You can't use it for infinite thermal energy storage because at some point it will simply radiate the energy back as fast as you're adding it. With these limitations I can't think of much you could do with it.

If what you get back is black-body radiation and you can get it hot enough then I suppose it would work as a "any kind of radiation to gamma ray converter" but what would you do with that? If you're in a "close to modern day tech but without the nuclear bomb"-scenario it could be a weapon?

You might be able to find a way to store an infinite amount of kinetic energy by spinning it while suspended in a vacuum, but getting that energy back in a controlled manner wouldn't be easy. Getting it back in an uncontrolled manner gets you a bomb with an insanely high upper limit on the energy output. You might end up having a problem before then since the mass of the object will increase at relativistic speeds, but if you accelerate it while it's far enough away from any gravity wells (e.g. by pelting it with a particle accelerator) then you have a "variable-mass point-source" which I guess could be useful but doesn't seem terrible world-breaking given the time required to add or remove mass. Back of the napkin math says turning it into a black hole would take on the order of gigayears even if you could direct the entire energy output of the sun into it.

Of course it might again just radiate the energy away somehow when you try to store kinetic energy, depending on how intent the DM is on preventing your world-breaking.

I suppose you could use a large enough explosion to launch it into space from sea level, but you couldn't attach anything to it so the only benefit would be shooting down a single satellite with very low technology. Or with very high technology it could potentially be used as a planet-killing bullet, but I'm not sure how you'd accelerate it that much. Get it into orbit around a black hole and keep increasing its speed with particle accelerators while nudging it closer and close to the event horizon, then nudging it out of orbit? If someone can travel to black holes then they probably have better ways of destroying planets, but maybe the scenario includes a race of beings who just happen to live near one.

*** Would it actually destroy a planet though? I think if you got it going fast enough, it would just pass straight through the planet without much commotion, dragging a peanut sized column of mass out the other side. And if it was slow enough to dump a decent amount of energy into the particles it's hitting without just sending them out the other side, it wouldn't have enough energy to destroy the planet.

Most kinetic near c impacters rely on the concept of the imacter expending the majority of its energy into the planet, often by breaking apart and spreading out when it hits things. An unbreakable object wouldn't do that.

** Hmm. Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is if you had an unbreakable material, that means you could use it to put something under incredible pressure inside of it without it breaking. If you could do that with water you could store an incredible amount of energy in a small area by compressing water until it becomes solid at high temperatures. If you did that with an isotope of hydrogen then I guess you could create fusion?

Of course it depends what "unbreakable" means; after a certain amount of energy is put in, pressure or force applied becomes heat, so is the "unbreakable" object something that can melt or boil, or is it really indestructible?

But seriously, I'm not sure that you could do much with a small chunk of unbreakable material, unless you had some way to shape it or sharpen it. If that is not possible, then the only thing I can think of is to load it into a very high velocity gun and use it as the ultimate armor piercing round.

But again, a single peanut? It won't change the industry! You'll need a contraption that even a single one of it can change the world. Do death ray make use unbreakable peanut?

  what makes a projectile armor piercing?
#+end_quote

It should be hard (does not deform) and tough (does not crack). The distinction between those qualities loses meaning for an unbreakable object, since it would be infinitely hard and tough.

Beyond that, the kinetic energy of the projectile should be transferred to as small an area of the armor as possible, and the projectile should have high velocity on impact and as much kinetic energy as possible. But a peanut is already fairly small compared to the size of a projectile intended to pierce armor on a tank or warship. With an unbreakable peanut, you do not have to worry about the tradeoff of making the projectile sharper versus losing structural integrity on impact. You would want to encase the peanut in something to make it aerodynamic and to put the peanut's sharpest edge or point forward. Put the peanut in the tip of a long, sharpened tungsten cylinder so there is a lot of kinetic energy behind it, and aerodynamic drag is minimized. Launch it at the highest possible velocity towards the target.

** An unbreakable material cannot melt, because melting really means breaking apart on the molecular level. Thus you can use it to build containers for ridiculously hot materials, like molten tungsten.

An unbreakable material is immune to most chemical reactions. It's atomic bonds cannot be broken, so at best only layers of new atoms can be created. Thus it should be a completely safe container for pretty much every chemical, no matter how reactive.

Though it's not clear how you would forge the unbreakable material into containers in the first place...

If that works in reverse, you could potentially surround it with objects much, much colder than it and have infinite energy flow out of it and into the surroundings.

I have more thoughts about potential uses for it, but those all depend on the nature of the object. For example, the object could be unbreakable while still retaining elasticity, making it a way to store incredible amounts of kinetic energy. I'm sure there's a way to munchkin that further into infinite energy, but I can't think of it at the moment. There's just too many unknowns to delve into it too far.

***** You have a good point. If an object that was an "infinite heat sink" existed, you could obtain energy even in environments where the temperature is the same everywhere.

​

Why would an unbreakable material be an infinite heat sink? Because as materials heat up, the molecules move faster and faster. A hot solid transfers energy in both directions if you put it in contact with some other liquid or gas.

An "unbreakable" material can't really have it's atoms moving around above a certain velocity, or the material will turn to gas.

** So lets use the senario where you only get a peanuts worth. Assuming: Its indestructible (chemically non-reactive, never changes temperture, weighs roughly the same as its equivalent weight in iron and is non-magnetic, and of course its volume and shape is equal to that of a average peanut.

Assuming all that, the peanut size piece would be pretty much useless. Like, you could probably sell it for a bunch to a rich dude/scientist or try to find a break-anything material and try to use the two of them together to crash the universe, but it would have no practical use.

If you could make it (or found enough of it in a convenient enough shape) you could find quite a few uses for it (eg. armor, weapons, in construction, for tools like drills or axes, as the main part of a space elevator), although none of them would be really "exploits" and would simply be relying on its extraordinary material properties.

some of the obvious uses are as traps, ways to wedge things open or shut, and as climbing aids. an unbreakable arrow could help wedge the moving wall or ceiling in place, and arrows tend to be a couple feet long. you would likely need more than one however, as the PSI on an arrowhead may just make a hole in the material its holding back.

unbreakable also implies that it wont take damage from other sources, like fire or acid. it would be nasty for a dragon to have one shot into its throat. could be very useful for some types of alchemy.

*** Sounds similar to the molecular stiletto in the Timothy Zahn Star Wars novels, or the monomolecular cutter in Full Metal Panic. More generally: "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomolecular_wire][monomolecular wire]] is often used as a weapon in fiction. It has applications in cutting objects and severing adjacent molecules. A similar or identical concept may be called a microfilament wire or, as a weapon, a microfilament whip."

As a real-world analog, obsidian can be sharpened to the point where its edge can literally be measured in nanometers across the cutting edge). They were frequently used in arrowheads and they are even used in modern medical contexts (for example, see [[https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/health/surgery-scalpels-obsidian/index.html][this article]] about the use of obsidian scalpels in modern surgery).

The downside of obsidian is that it shatters easily; it is literally volcanic glass, and much like you would expect from glass, it can shatter just as easily as it can be made into a sharp point that can cut. Most fictional depictions feature this as well; as is the case with the monomolecular knives in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash: they can easily cut through body armor, but are prone to shattering at inopportune moments. Having a blade made from unbreakable material would give you all of the upside with none of the downside. Though I'm unsure whether this would be the optimal use of such a material, you certainly could do worse than making a monomolecular cutter.

You can't make it too thin or light because without any weight it would be useless against even basic armor and would be too light to effectively use defensively, so it would end up being roughly a regular sword but unbreakable.

***** With a bullet it's again a function of size. The energy lost through bullet deformation is relatively small, and deformation is actually desirable in anti personnel round as they cause more damage. A tiny super hard bullet would actually just pass right through and actually do less damage than a normal bullet. Against armor the lack of deformation actually does help, but since KE =1/2 MV^{2,} and we can only propel a bullet so fast, you want a really heavy bullet.

But what is the limiting factor? I think it may be avoiding damage to the projectile before it is even in the air. If you had an unbreakable projectile, it may be possible to launch it much faster than a breakable projectile. But then the problem becomes making it aerodynamic so it does not slow down too much before hitting the target. Unless the unbreakable peanut can be shaped, that would mean using some breakable material around the unbreakable. And then you would have problems with ultra-high velocity launching since you would break the shell.

I suppose the solution to that would be to build the ultra-high velocity launcher into a super-projectile. You launch the super-projectile as fast as is feasible, and when the tip impacts the armor, the embedded launcher fires, launching the embedded unbreakable peanut at ultra-high velocity into the armor.

******* The reason we can only launch a projectile so fast has nothing to do with the material. It's a combination of drag, although that can be minimized, and more importantly the expansion speed of the combusting gas. You can't make something move faster than the throwing mechanism. To make a bullet go faster you'd need to use a more energetic reaction, which means a much beefier gun to withstand the forces, etc. Modern Smokeless powders max out at about 5000FPS, which certain modern rounds already approach in niche uses.

I don't think that is true. As you increase the acceleration applied to a breakable projectile, at some point the projectile will break (deform or have pieces crack off).

Also, you seem to be assuming that the projectile will be launched by expanding gas from combustion. But that is not the only way to launch a projectile, especially if you have an unbreakable projectile.

********** I agree, however we are simply trying to find a rational use for an in breakable object. If it is truly unbreakable and is shaped where it has a small diameter and given great energy it would be an extremely powerful kinetic weapon. Most modern APDSFS (sabot tank ammunition) requires some diameter to not simply shatter on target. It utilizes a thin and strong core (tungsten or DU as an example) this unbreakable material could be made even thinner meaning that even fired at similar speeds it's penetration would be greater as it concentrates more energy into a single place. This would be useful as there are some targets that can't be penetrated by any current kinetic rounds. Yes you could just use a large bomb or nuke or even larger more powerful cannon. However the strength of an unbreakable penetration core and the improved shape it can provide would be an improvement to smaller weapons systems. Its not about it being a stronger effect per say it's about how such ammunition would improve current weapon's effectiveness not creating a whole new class of weapon. I think that a projectile with enough force only a few mm thick could cause damage to even the largest armored vehicles if it penetrated in the right place so now it's more a problem of accuracy instead of power or size. Either way an unbreakable projectile certainly has benefits in chemical or alternative powered kinetic weapons systems.

Uses from there are pretty straightforward, for example super thin and strong armour or weapons, assuming the material is light enough.

**** Using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity][relativity of simultaneity]]. Say you have one unbreakable rod that's at rest, and another one moving towards you at relativistic speeds. You tap on the rod moving towards you, and the other end moves instantly from its frame of reference, which happens to be in the past from your reference frame. Then someone on the other end taps on the rod that's at rest from your frame, reaching you instantly, and the message arrives before you send the first one.

******* I don't think so. There is an assumption that the two rods are linked such that tapping one causes the other to move instantaneously. That premise is valid for an unbreakable object that cannot distort as any movement would have to transfer through the entire object instantaneously. But why would that hold true for two separate instances of unconnected immovable object? Maybe if it were one single object rotating such that one end is moving relatavistically while the other end is not but that would have its own problems and is also not as described.

In the description as given. At least, that was how I interpreted the fact that information reaches you instantly from the rod at rest. I could be interpreting incorrectly.

Yeah, no; I'm */not/* doing that. /You/ go touch an object moving at relativistic speeds. Preferably somewhere in space, so that the energy release caused when an indestructible object touches you at a noteworthy fraction of c doesn't wreck the planet.

** I think that someone need to define unbreakable. Can it be altered chemically or physically? If they do, then the very same method altering it can also be used to get past it. If they don't, I'm sure it's not that useful. Unless you have more than a peanut worth of it.

** I assume it can't bend or compress, which means that sound has to travel through it instantly (maybe just at c?). If it took time, the energy from the wave would have to actually be somewhere in the interim.

Heat and electricity need to either be transmitted or stored in the material. The storage side is potentially useful since the material doesn't melt, which could mean higher capacity than real-world options. So if we want to assume the unbreakable material is as useless as possible, it should be a good conductor (but not a superconductor or anything).

** Late comer, but again depending on the specific properties of our object, if it's unable to absorb any energy it would be a perfect reflector.

Such a perfect reflector could be used to turn almost anything into a nuclear explosion, assuming your peanut can be shaped into a bottle.

A perfect reflector would be opaque to neutrinos. so you could gather a bottle of neutrinos. No one knows what that would be good for.
