My own interpretation was that the creatures were made out of real materials held in the shape of some creature or other via magic. The knights warded armor disrupted the spells maintaining the spirits bodies, turning them back into regular clumps of snow and dirt.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, I think this is the case. It's quite possible that Callowan knights have never before been on the opposite side of a battlefield from a Levantine binder, given that they're both Good nations with no shared borders.

***** It seems sensible enough to me - these are callowan knights after all, they are the military elites sharpened by centuries of charging into the worst, craziest magic the praesi throw around on the battlefield.

I don't think anyone on the side of callow was all that surprised by this, while Abilgail's internal decision-making is somewhat warped, it is a reasonable base idea - enemy employing weird indestructible sorcery, throw the knights at it, just like callowans have dealt with that shit for centuries. I think her surprise was that she actually did *get* the troops she asked for, as her approach was to request a strategic asset, for tactically sound reasons, assuming she'd be denied because of seniority/lack of trust. That way she'd have her ass covered but would still fail.

******* I dunno. it sure seems like the hellhound wasn't surprised at all about the tactical choice, only about the low amounts of knights she had requested. Why do you think everyone on this side of the cavalry charge should be so surprised? because Abigail's Tribune is so awed? That seems a rather small sample size to me, and as an orc, he wouldn't have that much knowledge about anti-mage cavalry, necessarily... or, well, he might just be a little bit enthusiastic about his boss. What am I missing?

******** My problem is that Abigail basically thinks "I'll ask for knights, no way she'll give them to me" despite them being the perfect counter to the particular enemy she's facing, and Hellhound wasn't surprised by the small amount she requested, if I recall correctly. It adds a sense of "haha, she bumbled into looking like a strategic genius, isn't that funny?" but... meh.

********* I got the sense that Abby wanted to look like she tried, which meant going by the book (i. e. requesting knights in response to weird magical shit going on) and then just kind of awkwardly sitting around with a thousand horsemen 'cause there would be no opening to actually deploy them without getting bogged down in the enemy ranks.

Then Tanja ordered the binders to leave those ranks to keep disarming traps and sent only a force of two thousand infantry to cover them - a force that the cavalry could actually disengage from. After that it was a matter of an excuse to send out the knights, which Robber gleefully provided.
