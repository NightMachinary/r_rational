Hi, I am working on a societal what-if fic about the ability to travel between alternate universes, initially RED and BLUE, which are very 'similar' to each other.

Assume the following parameters:

1) Travel is initially granted to a person who now possess the capability to create a portal to an alternate universe, which we called blue. Said person can open a portal to a location twice in a 24 hours period, and only 30 minutes at a time. Note that a portal will open up to an alternate version of the location that the person is in. It is not possible to create shortcuts or wormholes between two locations. A portal in NY will go to NY, not to London or Los Angeles. EDIT: The time limit and the number of portals that can be created is a limitation of the person's power, not a limit on TD portals in general.

2) For some reason, transdimensional physic prohibit travel to very similar universe except blue.

3) TD physics eventually discovered and unlocked after a few years of intense research. A gateway prototype is engineered.

4) TD gateways are eventually built, but are extremely expensive. The first prototype required the cooperation and funding of several nations on both side.

5) Teching will reduce the expense of building TD gateways to transport infrastructural pieces in 2 decades. After that, a constant slow descent.

6) Years of research in TD physics and mathematics is required to travel to a new universe. R&D must start anew again for the next destination, though building on the previous TD theory. Physicists wished to find the holy grail of TD theory that will allow them to travel to any universes, no many how similar or different that is as well reducing the cost of constructing TD gates to nothingness.

7) TD gateway portals stay open as long maintenance is done and is continuously powered.

I want to hear your thought about the potential impact on societies and what the different actors[Religions, Governments, Individuals, Corporations, Scientists, ETC] will do.

I already wrote 1K words of note and 1K words of a prologue. It's terribly written, but it's a start. Your thoughts will be really helpful in forming a rational universe for my fic, and hopefully a series of novels.


** Any sort of intellectual property only has to be made once to be used in both universes. Basically, once you get a gate working, you can eliminate the cost of an entire planet's worth of software, movies, drug research, material science research, etc.

This would require a change in economics. Competition in these fields will instantly double. A lot of people will lose their jobs. But everything will become a little cheaper and a little higher quality.

Even without a universal TD theory, the growth will increase exponentially. You'll have to do just as much work, but you'll have twice as many universes working on it. Suppose it takes five years to build a gate. Two universes are connected. After ten years, it's four. After 50 years, it's a thousand. After a 165 years, there will be more worlds connected than there are people on each world. Entire worlds will use their whole economy just to create one move, one piece of software, one technology so amazing that they might be remembered. Few worlds will succeed.

Exactly how similar are the universes? Do they have the same people? The same countries?

It sounds like your gateway sends physical objects, which seems like overkill. Could cheaper ones be made to send only information?

That seems implausible. Even assuming that people get themselves so worked up over fame, wouldn't people be capable of doing work over TD lines?

**** You mean like have a hundred Californias working together instead of one Earth? I imagine both would happen. I don't know what would be more common. On the one hand, Californias are culturally similar and all speak the same language, which would make working together easy. On the other hand, I suspect finding identical copies of Earth would make people want to make their Earth stand apart.

The portal isn't terribly great for transporting goods. Even if you set up a rail system pointed at where the portal is going to be, you're still going to run into cost issues pretty fast. The single portal-hour is, however, great for transporting people, especially if you can get them lined up and passing through at sixty miles per hour (which would get you thirty miles worth of people per opening).

There would be an initial glut of intellectual property from the other side. Red has a full history of radio, movies, television, etc. which they can trade to Blue. The countries would have to decide whether to honor each others copyright laws, and how their legal interface is going to work, and who has jurisdiction over what, but it seems likely that this would end up spiraling out of control (and fighting hard against smugglers). What would mostly end up happening is a glut of content, followed by a reorganization of the entertainment industry as lots of people lost their jobs. Movie budgets would go up, and marketing budgets would go up, but the number of blockbusters would probably stay the same.

** Politics
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: politics
   :END:
It's not actually Red and Blue. It's all the Red countries, and all the Blue countries. Most likely, there would be some new legal framework with a bunch of signatories. Depending on how free travel between the sides is, there would have to be some determinations about immigration/emigration, intellectual property, jurisdiction for transdimensional crime, extradition, taxation of trade ... basically every single thing that modern countries have to deal with when dealing with other countries, except sprung on them with hundreds of new actors all at once. This is going to be especially tough where territory doesn't overlap entirely - where the Accord of 1873 never happened, and France is missing half of its land.

(If any politicians are duplicated, expect attack ads to focus on what their parallel counterpart did in the other universe.)

** Religion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: religion
   :END:
Here you get into a problem - there are now two popes. There were, presumably, two of Jesus. There are two Meccas. This duplication shoots a lot of theology squarely in the foot. It raises questions of free will, if there are any people who followed different life paths (if any of the people are duplicated at all).

** Science
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: science
   :END:
Science works through collaboration and open communication. You're doubling the population of scientists and engineers in all specialties. This does /not/ mean that half of them are out of a job - it means that they'll increase specialization. Information travels freely through the portals (with any format or hardware standardization differences probably figured out pretty quickly) but it seems likely that scientists would be the first to cross the portal in order to set up shop with their counterparts. This will quickly lead to specialization - say, with Red being better at certain areas of biological science and Blue being better at certain areas of semiconductor manufacturing.

*** Politically, since RED and BLUES are pretty damn similar, I am thinking countries will instead unites with their counterpart rather than remains apart.

Those that don't merge will have a harder time competing.

The rich countries are able to afford more gateways, thus they are more connected to their counterpart, which amplify their powers.

*** It seems highly unlikely there were two Jesuses. Even a slight change will quickly result in completely different children being born. In order for there to be two, the universes would have to split during his lifetime. If the split was after, there was only one universe to have a Jesus. If it was before, only one of the two universes would have a Jesus.

"This does not mean that half of them are out of a job"

No, but it means some of them are out of a job, and the way economics is, the rest get a pay cut. The pure sciences seem to be more signalling than anything, and I suspect would actually increase now that countries have doppelgangers to compete with. But the rest of the have to face the law of diminishing returns. Twice as many scientists is not twice as good.

One universe not having Jesus /at all/ is actually even more theologically troubling. An entire planet full of people who never experienced salvation is a big problem for Christianity, and would necessitate a shift in thinking that the Christians who believe in aliens have long been preparing for. And the Evangelicals would probably pitch a fit. But since OP stated that Red and Blue were pretty damned close to each other, I think something like a major world religion that's been around for two thousand years is probably the same between the two of them - maybe with some differences in the Bible - because you can't get modern America without Christianity playing a role.

***** I can see why finding a new world that never heard of Jesus might be theologically troubling, and I'm sure some people were troubled when they found out the inhabitants of the New World didn't know about Him. But now that that's established, why would this happening with a different reality be a problem?

#+end_quote

Differences grow exponentially. If you have modern America, Christianity isn't just similar. It's identical. There was one universe with one Christ, and then the universe split into two. Though that does create interesting theological implications for whoever was alive during the split.

****** The divergence didn't occur thousand of years early. RED and BLUE is for the most part basically identical to each other up until recently until things slightly went off into different directions.

But there's no guarantee that the next world they're going to find is going to have Jesus.

** If the research in TD physics and mathematics required to travel to a new universe is completely parallelizable, making a connection from a pair of universes to another pair would take at most half the time it took the first time, and then connecting two quartets would take half that, and the number of universes accessible after twice the initial research time diverges.

There is also no way to predict how many years it to take to reach a new destination. It might be a year, 23 years, or hundred of years. Nobody knows.

However, roughly speaking, the research time would decrease as each new world double the amount of population that can be devoted to this effort.

Then they find out that the new theory not 'universal' as physicists hope. So they began the cycle again to try to generalize the theory.
