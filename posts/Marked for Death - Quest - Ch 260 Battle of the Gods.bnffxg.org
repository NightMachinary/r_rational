** How is this story in general? I'm generally put off by stories that are written by a group since (in my experience) there can be a jarring change in tone and style between authors, so I never gave this one a shot.

*** It's difficult to tell the difference between the authors' writing styles if you aren't eminently familiar with them. Also they're both exceptional authors.

*** There's a pretty limited number of authors (two or three iirc), although anyone can vote on the actions for the protagonist to take.

It's decent if you want an intellectually engaging look at the Narutoverse, with a lot of obstacles, setbacks, and explosions.
