This WN seems to be a rational story.

When attending a physics conference for one of his friends, eccentric biologist Alvin Walton along with the rest of the attending guests are teleported to another world called Selingrod by its inhabitants.

The MC studies his surroundings and uses his new knowlege to solve his problems.

** I kind of stopped reading at "his finely toned leg muscles bulged"

This is unfortunate, because I like the premise, but certain flavours of writing are pretty much a deal-breaker for me.

Does anyone know if it gets better?

**** If you squint really hard and kinda power through it, sometimes harem can be acceptable. Sometimes.

***** The main problem with harem is that the main character is always either wish fulfillment or completely blank. If this is fixed, the harem consists of three-dimensional characters and there's an actual plot harem stories could be great....and maybe hamsters will sprout wings and barf candy.

** I'm on chapter 6 so far, and while it hasn't shown any signs of being rational, it does fill the first 2 rationalists requisites, lots of science and cataloging as well as makeshift experimentation and resource gathering.

As for characterization the MC is a mad scientist type with and asshole -ish attitude, and I mean actually mad for science, sometimes chosing to learn about the new world instead of focusign on people around him.
