Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** So recently I saw a post on [[/r/science]] which really helped me get my shit together. As a result, I've constructed artificial general intelligence, and am now immortal. With all of this free time that I have now, I've been reading nonfiction books and figuring out how to munchkin this D&D campaign I've got going. So yeah, things are going pretty well for me I would say.

**** It was called "Self-help with generative adversarial networks." About how to train them to generate your tax forms, your emails, your blackmails, etc. It's a real time-saver, and got me thinking about AGI too. So it turns out that GANs alone aren't enough by themselves to make AGI - to do that, you need to realize that substance dualism is true, and that ghosts really do exist. To make an AGI you basically have to capture a ghost and inject it into the computer. Easiest way is to just make the computer a horcrux. Hope this is useful!

** Can anyone recommend a good [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWeird][New Weird]] (Tropes Link) and Rational LitRPG? I know, it's a very specific request.

I'm currently reading [[https://www.parahumans.net][Worm 2]], and I just got to the front of [[https://thegam3.com/][The Gam3]] and [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][Wandering Inn]]. I'm craving for more.

*** Since you are asking for some LitRPGs, I'll post every one that I read/follow. But be warned that I make no promises on the rationality. They are more like candy-stories; very enjoyable, but not healthy/rational.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]] - is about a teddy bear golem born into an RPG world and the story does an amazing job avoiding the common cliches.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8463/the-arcane-emperor][The Arcane Emperor]] - it's as if the writer took the very concept of LitRPG and distilled into a concentrated form. It's focused on increasing the protagonist's power and exploring an interesting new world, but the twist that the author does an amazing job of keeping the danger coming without it getting repetitive or a slog to read. Plus the magic experimentation and rule testing is fun too.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] - Great story with a sociopathic monster as a protagonist. It's not rational in the least, but the comedy is to die for.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] - If you haven't read this, then you haven't been spending very much time on this subreddit.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] - it's a ridiculous story about a tiny snake just bumbling his way through life, but it really works with how cute the story is.

Personally, I found this less appealing than the other two comics in the "series" (probably the wrong word, but whatever). I think [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergod][/Supergod/]] was probably the best, with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackSummer][/Black Summer/]] coming in second.
