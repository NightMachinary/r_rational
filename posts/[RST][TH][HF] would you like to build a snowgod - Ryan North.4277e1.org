** Reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][A Bluer Shade of White]], a Frozen fanfic by [[/u/alexanderwales]].

*** That story bothered me because it ignored the effects of extremely cold temperatures on human flesh. "ice [..] fused directly with the old man's arm joined with a collar of snow" and "a sliver of ice in his brain" should cause frostbite of the arm and frostbite of the brain, respectively.

Now you can say, "it's magic, I ain't got to explain shit," but A) the other effects of Elsa's ice magic have been handled realistically (e.g. ships made out of sawdust and ice because regular ice wouldn't be strong enough), and B) at no point was that lampshade hung. ("How did you avoid frostbite?" "It's magic." "Fair enough.")

**** I did have explanations, but didn't include them because it's magic and I ain't gotta explain shit (also because it wasn't a mystery that was central to the plot, didn't reveal any characterization, wouldn't have been known to the protagonist, and would have to come at the wrong moment).

Elsa has a required secondary power of being able to unfreeze things. She does this at the end of the movie when she unfreezes the lake and the whole town, which would have taken ages to happen just from the heat of the sun. So frostbite isn't really a problem if it can be permanently maintained from a distance, since unfreezing is part of the powerset.

Edit: Alternate explanation was that it was one of the phases of ice available at higher pressures and room temperature, but I wasn't sure about the physics of that and it's a little less canonically sound.

**** I had the idea that "living ice" worked differently than "dead ice". The pykrete ships were formed /using/ ice magic, but the ships themselves were mundane. So: they acted like normal ice.

The automatons, arms, control things, and so on, weren't made out of mundane ice but were made out of magic ice, which has different properties. For example, thinking creatures made out of the magic ice don't melt.
