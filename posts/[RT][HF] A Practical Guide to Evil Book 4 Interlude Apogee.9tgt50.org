** Oh damn, things are coming to a head. If Tikoloshe is wrong about this, both of them will lose Masego's trust forever.

How likely is it that Tikoloshe is actually the dead king's /in/? He was there, he had direct contact with him, what if his decision here is not driven by emotion but something more sinister?

*** I have been thinking the same thing. Wouldn't it be interesting if the dark ritual to remove Heriophant's memories instead delivers up Warlock to the dead king?

** To make sure I understand what Wekesa and Tikoloshe are worried about, it's primarily two things, right?

1. That Masego will try a ritual for apotheosis. They consider this to be a bad thing because dying permanently destroys an individual in some way, and whatever is left after is changed and basically just a close copy. Masego fundamentally disagrees with this idea, noting people change all the time, and so that's no real argument at all.
2. That Masego will copy TDK's ritual, which is actually a trap that involves TDK taking over the body of the caster.

I think point 1 is just a fundamental question of value differences. But if point 2 is a true concern, why would they not warn Masego so he could prepare or investigate it? Tikoloshe calls knowledge of the Kabbalis Book of Darkness "an infection," which implies infohazard, but the text glosses over how or if Masego justifies continuing his research. I really wish EE had raised his counterarguments there... but even later on, Masego should really know what he could be facing, so he can keep a (glass) eye out for it.

  “Never the complete book, because then they might realize the purpose of it,” Warlock murmured. “There'd be risks, ‘Loshe. *If Amadeus is right about the Wandering Bard*-”

  “Black isn't even a /hundred years old/,” his husband hissed. “And he thinks he can grasp the nature something like the Bard? Last time he followed that conceit Sabah was killed. Do we need to lose our son to his pride as well?”
#+end_quote

What does the section I bolded here mean? If Amadeus is right about /what/ concerning Bard?

  “Hakram,” he said. “Before Catherine left...”

  He trailed off.

  “Yes?” the orc encouraged.

  The mage folded his arms together.

  “No,” he finally said. “It doesn't matter.”
#+end_quote

Refresh my memory, do we know what Masego was about to reference here? Final instructions he was given?

*** u/Zayits:
#+begin_quote
  If Amadeus is right about what concerning Bard?
#+end_quote

Whatever Amadeus' teory is, following it would apparently mean not taking Masego's memories. The phrase "There'd be risks" directly after the description of the scheme means the risks are applying to Neshamah in spreading his influence that way.

Maybe Amadeus has figured out the same thing Vivienne and Kairos did - that Bard's non-intervention policy means she can only be harmed by the direct consequences of her actions - and came up with some plan? The plan itself he didn't tell anyone (otherwise Wekesa wouldn't be worried), but perhaps this is the reason he was marching around Procer, waiting to be captured?

  “You could say that,” Vivienne grimaced. “The Empress' envoy sung us a pretty song, and we need to pick your brains over it.”

  “I do not know much of singing,” he admitted.
#+end_quote

I am increasingly convinced that nothing could go over Masego's head. His reflexes would simply be too fast.

*** Second Liesse, with its necromantic slaughter, demon rifts, soul-powered superweapon and fae ascension is definitely the kind of thing to leave an impression on the Arcadian side.

*** "Dangerous information" is not the same thing as infohazard, for all that the latter is an entirely invented term. I'd expect, if Tikoloshe is correct, that it's more that using things found in the Book of Darkness for magical power opens you up to possession.

*** Well, Madness seems to work the same way, and keeping notes on demons tends to warp reality and minds. Plus there's whatever Bard is doing to erase records of herself.

** The situation with Tikoloshe reminded me of [[http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?58227-Tales-of-Wyre][Lady Despina's Virtue]], so I've posted it here as some readers of PGtE who appreciate the FRPG aspect may find it also an interesting read. It's a D&D3.5 campaign journal, and the premise of the story is the redeemability of a succubus demon.
