Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I'm attempting an industrial revolution-era alt-universe work wherein pregnant mothers can consume a kind of plant which depending on method of consumption, can grant an array of different abilities (so far things like mixed with water grants a form of hydrokinesis, blood of an animal allows partial transformation into that animal, and a few others - street level abilities, mainly).

The plant only grows on an island chain that has recently been discovered by two different countries - one is aristocratic in nature, with nobility having essentially all the power, and a weakened royal family, the other is authoritarian in nature but strongly influenced by a wealthy corporation.

So far, the idea is that the aristocratic country secured a source of the plant first, but it has been seized by a few different noble families, who are now keeping it strictly under their control. A few black market cuttings have been sold, but it is largely being used to grant the next generation of nobility superpowers.

In the authoritarian country, the plant has been controlled even more strictly, and is cultivated only by the wealthy corporation, who is carrying out extensive testing on the plant's capabilities.

Assuming that both countries manage to keep control of the plant, if not news of its existence, what would be some expected societal changes in the following generations? Jealousy/fear of this new superpowered ruling class? General uproar over a lack of public availability? I was thinking of some kind of 'lottery' system where they would permit a few 'peasants' the chance to give their child superpowers and a better life, adoption into that noble family perhaps?

*** This seems like it would solidify the power of the current ruling class even more, in direct opposition to your proposal of a lottery for powers. Backing social and political power up with literal superpowers means that violent revolts are extremely unlikely to work. Especially if there aren't guns in your setting, a noble house could treat the majority of the population like absolute garbage and never have to fear any form of uprising. A small group of superpowered guards would make a noble house impregnable to assault from anything less than an opposing army.

If you want to go for something mildly more egalitarian, mothers could pay some fee to give their children economically useful powers in the hopes that the child can raise the family up from their current social status. But this would be incompatible with entrenched noble houses, because it would be giving non-nobles the tools that the nobles use to solidify their power. Pretty similar situation for the authoritarian country, where the powers would only be available to the rich and powerful.

The military applications are pretty obvious, so in a generation or two you would have military families with favored abilities and techniques passed down to their children. Partial transformation into an animal seems pretty weak, but a handful of sailors with hydrokinesis would do quite a lot for a warship.

*** Especially if the powers granted tend to be street-level, there may not be very large societal shifts in the first few generations, since the superpowers themselves only represent one form of wealth/privilege/power, which doesn't necessarily represent a qualitatively different form of inequality than say, food insecurity or lack of educational opportunity.

I'd expect bigger divergences from the sorts of societies we've seen in our version of reality to crop up over time, as people have time to develop techniques and institutions that extract value from these powers, but what is expect to see depends a lot on what constraints there are on the functioning of the powers.

*** Given that the corporate country is basically giving powers to the lowest of the low (company owned and raised experiments) while the aristocractic country is trying to reserve these powers for the upper crust, I expect there to be sharp class divides in terms of which powers are 'proper' to give to a young aristocrat. Specifically, anything which ends up in common use by factory workers will end up being declared too low-class for a noble to use or admit to possessing. I can imagine the animal blood variation being popular among the nobility, for example, with more prestigious animals or animals associated with one's traditional heraldry being a mark of special distinction.

After a few generations though, the middle class in the aristocratic nation are going to start agitating to have whatever economically important applications end up getting discovered rolled out among the working class, in order to successfully compete. That's probably the origins of your lottery right there - a family with a child on the way can apply to a company to have their child augmented, in exchange for a guaranteed place with the company and a large debt that needs paid off. There would probably be some pretense of this being non-exploitative, but only the pretense.

Conversely, I expect a decided lack of (visible) augmentation by the ruling class in the corporatist society, as being augmented would generally be connoted with either slavery or loyalty to a foreign power - not the sorts of things you'd want to display if you want a high corporate posting or a military rank. Instead, it would be the middle ranks who would go in for voluntary augmentation, wanting something that will cancel out any power-based intimidation tactics that their exploited underlings might try.
