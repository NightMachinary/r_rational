Turns out the "so much" depending on the barrow was the entire southern hemisphere.

**** It's an image poem. They're minimalistic and just meant to evoke a single emotion or picture in the mind's eye.

Even the title is too much context for purists. Most prefer to call it XXII, for its page number in the original printing.

** Well then. This more or less confirms that Robin is the Other King. She's the only person we know of who might be kind enough to apologize for decoalescing Uriel and has the capacity and motive to do horrible things for possibly good reasons.

She probably corrupted Vihaan years ago, maybe implanting a trigger in his mind to act on her command at a designated moment. She had the opportunity to do so, after all.

The real question here is /why/ she's taking out Uriel. The Wrathful Name won't permanently destroy him, only Thamiel's Bident does that. So she needed him and his constant monitoring of reality out of the way. Perhaps she predicts that, with the machinery of the world grinding to a halt, the doors to Hell will cease to function properly and a missile bearing a scroll of the HaShem Mephorash will be able to get through?

*** But oh god did you read the site comments? Apparently it was Sohu! Despite, you know, the previous chapter establishing ToK releasing a missile that conspicuously was not heading for Colorado. I cannot comprehend how poor general internet audiences are at reading.

Bitching out of the way, I'm not sure I agree about Robin. I could see a successfully en-evilled Comet King (or even a Comet King trying to do evil to bring back Robin from Hell rather than to achieve any greater good) playing the part, as per Robin's unstated plan back in 2001-ish.

*** In this chapter, we were given a glimpse into the daily life of Uriel for only a few minutes and he was actively monitoring three imminent apocalyptic threats that might require his intervention at any moment. I think every time we've seen him he's been putting out one fire or another.

I'm not sanguine about the chances of the world's survival for however long it takes him to pull himself back together.

**** That does suck, but that's why Sohu was training with him, right? She'll just have to sub for him. Assuming she's capable of putting together some kind of slapdash replacement machinery, and wasn't totally depending on just taking the controls Uriel built.

The world can't be destroyed in the very near future or there wouldn't be a story, so on a narrative level I'm more worried about Uriel than I am about the world.

***** Is TOK's plan to get Uriel out of the way so Sohu can sub in for him? If so, who do we know who would want that? Possibly Acher, possibly TCK or Robin, and the /sorry/ makes the latter two more likely.

And if they do sub Sohu in, what would that accomplish? It'd get a Cometspawn out of the way when they're trying to take Colorado, but that's too simple. It'd get her in charge of Uriel's machine, at which point maybe they can convince her to follow along with their plans?

** For such a short chapter, that was... surprisingly moving. I think this is the part that gets to me the most:

#+begin_quote
  Uriel turned his gaze east. In Cuba, a farmer's only goat had just had a kid. Uriel's threat-assessment algorithm placed him at 2.9% risk of boiling the kid in its mother's milk within the next week. Years ago, he would have smitten the farmer, just in case, and never worried about it again. Sohu had put an end to that. Now he tweaked the parameters of his algorithm, told it to alert him if the probability increased further, and moved along.
