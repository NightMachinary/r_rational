So Batman in the 2017 Justice League movie is pretty useless. Cyborg is a way better hacker and pilot (/somehow/ he is able to increase the speed of Batman's plane just by sticking his hand in the console), Aquaman and Wonder Woman are vastly superior brawlers, the Flash is basically unhittable when he's running at speed, and Super man is utterly overpowered and single-handedly wins the fight against Steppenwolf at the end.

So my question to you all is this: How do you optimize Batman so he at least feels like he deserves to be on the team, rather than looking utterly out classed?

I've been thinking about this for the past few days, and have some ideas. First let's delve a bit deeper into why Batman is quite so useless in this movie and then I'll describe my proposed solutions:

The minimum amount of people a real life commissioned officer typically commands is a platoon (15-45 men). When it's just 6 guys you don't really need a person whose entire job is coordination, tactics, logistics, etc., - it's probably better to just have another rifleman. But once the numbers increase that job becomes utterly essential. Wars have been won or lost due to the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of a given army's officer corps. Yet the Justice League is just six guys (well 4 guys, a dead guy, and a girl), and so someone like Batman - whose greatest strength is an extremely sharp tactical mind - is kind of overkill and fairly redundant.

This is compounded by the fact that the five non-Batman members of the Justice League mostly just charge and punch, charge and punch in an insane chaotic free for all. A real life soldier needs to know when to suppress the enemy, when to take aimed shots, when to fall back, when to advance, when to flank, know when /he/ is getting flanked, know if he's being targeted, know how long he can stay in the fight before he needs to retreat or get resupplied, know were his allies are - in short, his job is way, way more complicated. And so it makes sense that a real life soldier benefits from having someone standing around who he can offload some of that mental burden onto who has a higher level view of the battlefield. In an ideal world, the officers are so effective the enlisted men think the logistics fairy just flies around the battlefield and sprinkles bullets onto all the good little boys and girls whenever they're running low.

So how do you address both of these issues? Simple: Bruce Wayne hires an army. Batman's the peak of human physical perfection, but he's just a mortal man at the end of the day and we can't really get around that limitation short of implausible SUPER TECH like Tony Stark's power armor. But imagine an army of former special forces soldiers trained by Batman, dozens and dozens of them, all being fed constant tactical information during combat? Now we're actually taking full advantage of Batman's genius level brain. Against Steppenwolf maybe these guys get knocked around, but the primary thing the Justice League fights in the film are the winged humanoid bug-people things. And against those, a few dozen Navy SEALs would work wonders - they could clear the skies and keep the bug-troops suppressed while the Justice League's members who are good in a super human fist fight all gang up on Steppenwolf.

The next issue is Batman's insistence on trying to punch things. Batman is not a demigod, his skin is not bullet proof, his bones are not made of unobtanium, he doesn't have superhuman healing powers. When Superman knocks him into a police car, his whole back is one big bruise and it hurts him to move around for the rest of the day. So when he tries to go into hand to hand combat against foes that the superhuman members of the justice league are struggling with - it's just asking to get flattened. In fact the movie is probably a bit too kind to Batman, realistically if these creatures can punch Wonder woman so hard it hurts her they'd kill a mortal man.

The solution? Stop trying to punch out grizzly bears, you lunatic! Normal people lose, badly, if they try to fight a grizzly bear in melee. So we don't, and instead carry high powered rifles or shotguns loaded with slugs. And this not only prevents us getting our faces eaten, it /completely/ turns the tables. Humans exist at the tip top of the food chain thanks to our projectile weapons. So if Batman knows he's going to be facing super strong super tough monsters that will rip a human being in half in close quarters, he needs to stop trying to pretend he's something he's not and use standard human response to such a situation. That is to say, bring a gun. During the final fight scene we do actually see Batman steal one of the bug-creature's laser guns and starts using it himself, so clearly he's alright with killing these things. And he also frequently pilots a tank equipped with rockets and miniguns so he isn't opposed to the idea of bringing in heavy firepower to a fight. All he needs to do to equip himself with projectile weapons from the very start of the battle, and operate a bit more like Hawkeye as a sort of sniper who picks off the bug people at range. Except way, way more effective because high explosive 20mm anti tank rifle >> bow and arrow. This also rewards Batman's clever mind, as now the question becomes: What kind of gun does he bring? What kind of ammo is in it? What attachments does he include? It adds a whole other dimension of planning. For example when he revives Superman and isn't sure if Supes will come back evil, his backup plan could be a dozen drones armed with guns full of kryptonite. Superman may destroy most of them with his super human reflexes, but just /one/ of the swarm needs to get a chance to fire.

More-over, bullet proof skin doesn't mean guns stop working. A 50 BMG round packs about 40 times the kinetic energy of Mike Tyson's punches in his prime, and that energy isn't going to just disappear because "Well bullet proof I guess". Even if you're wearing a bullet proof vest that stops the penetration of the round, the sheer force of the collision would still probably shatter your sternum and kill you through blunt trauma (or perhaps the sharp energy transfer is mostly responsible, [[/u/zergling_lester]] disagrees with me on the exact cause :D). Far from guns being ineffective against super powered foes, they should be the only way a normal person can even stand a chance of hurting them. Batman with a M82A1 is hitting Steppenwolf probably at the level of a Superman punch, while Batman with his fists is not even an annoyance to Steppenwoflie.

Finally, although this isn't a solution to a specific problem, Batman should make more use of vehicles. In older iterations of the character, self-driving or remote-piloted cars were non-existent or very unreliable (e.g. autopilot on a plane) so it made sense Batman only ever deployed precisely one cool vehicle at a time. Yet in this film we constantly see Alfred take remote control over the batplane, batcar, bat....tick tank?, which implies there is no reason Batman can't have dozens of these things on station. Instead of rolling into Fictionstan to stop Steppenwolf with one plane and one armored car, imagine instead if he filled the sky with a dozen Bat Attack Helicopters loaded with 30mm chain guns and hellfire rockets. Sorry, 30mm Bat guns and HellBat Rockets. Or even just a few hundred DJI phantoms rigged with C4. Batman really needs to take more advantage of the fact that 1) He is insanely rich and 2) Semi-autonomous vehicles are a thing now.

Anyway, that's my potential solutions to the Bat-optimization problem. What does this fine community think?


** I think that everything you said, mostly, makes sense, but the problem itself needs to kinda be re-defined before we can do anything.

Honestly, the best thing anyone in the DC universe could do is explain to the Flash that he can win every single battle by himself and fix the entire world, if he felt like it.

The amount of speed he gets up to, no one else would be moving, like, at all. The guy is recorded going faster than light, so it would literally be impossible to see him. In the face of that, well, batman would be infinitely more effective if he just made the Flash happy with food or something.

But that's the thing about all of this. You are taking a very reasonable approach with some good thinking and applying it to a world/universe where absolutely nothing makes sense.

Steppenwolf, if he did actually punch batman, probably should have blown through his torso, if he can at all trade blows with Superman. Like, the main problem is nothing in the DC universe really makes sense, if you take it at face value, so unfortunately, while I agree with most of what you said, the first question should probably be: "How do we make the DC universe make any kind of sense, and then, once that is established, what could Batman do in that universe to be most effective?"

Anyway, just my 2 cents, and hopefully my frustration with superhero comics hasn't overwhelmed my response, although I think it has definitely bled through.

Bruce Wayne has figured this out, and knows that simply pointing out the obvious to super beings doesn't work. He created the Batman persona as a way of getting close enough to the Justice League to study the details of this phenomenon, and slowly guide them towards rationality.

Maybe Steppenwolf's punch is so much weaker against Batman because Steppenwolf /expects/ a superhero to be able to take his punch.

**** I agree with this, but the bigger problem isn't having a character that is rational, and then trying to figure out the other characters, its how you rationalize the powersets everyone has: here is a excerpt from a comic that has the Flash outrun death and time and some other concepts - [[https://imgur.com/a/pdgj1]]

So, like, I get what you are saying, but what world are you creating with what physics that also has this iteration of the flash? And if you dont have this iteration of the flash which one? Can he still outrun light? Time? Where are the lines, and if he can ONLY run to near lightspeed, well, how does anyone ever stop that? If you literally do anything to endanger anything in the world he could speed up so much that he is unlimited possibilities.

I don't know, I always find this stuff frustrating because trying to think through any of it feels impossible in a rational way. And the Flash is just one example, right? There are people like Dr Fate where, like, what's the rational version of that? How does Fate work? Or Constantine, and the fact that there is literally the One Above All, who is God, like God in the sense of unlimited and total power - [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/One-Above-All_(Multiverse)]]

However, if you all want to just have fun and talk about Batman and stuff, sorry to be a wet blanket.

The DCAU is pretty good for this. The heroes are nerfed big time relative to their ridiculous comic book feats, while still remaining true to the spirit of the characters and their powers. For example, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a0pwb9NvFE][this]] is the fastest the Flash ever goes in /JLU/; it takes him 10 seconds to run around the earth, putting his top speed at 4,000 km/s. Which is fast, but way below light speed (300,000 km/s). And that was a one-time thing.

Now that I think about it, this could also help explain the secret identity phenomenon; superpeople tend to cope with the subtle cognitive dissonance by creating two separate identities, one powered and one not.

One way this could go would be like the Inderdict of Merlin from HPMOR: The Being that created superpowers set them up this way to prevent creative rationalists from accidentally destroying the universe by unlocking their full potential.

But, let's be clear, if any superhero or villain's goal was money; they could easily make it hand over foot. Pretty much every villain in existence has a power that would allow them to vastly improve either the US military, which has a spending budget of trillions, or some corporation looking to sell their device/power/etc (e.g. Mr Freeze could possibly make cold fusion or cryogenics work).

It isn't so much that I am disagreeing with you (except maybe the Flash thing) but that there is an innate problem to solve first. Cause, like, lots of villains have money or superheroes (they built the watch tower in space), and we've seen plenty of robot armies get destroyed, simply because robots aren't interesting, so of course they lose to the lone hero.

** The Bat-Army plan has been tried in various forms, though never quite to the degree you imply. First-off, the various Robins and other 'Bat-Family' characters essentially function as a well-trained army, of a sort. Second, the /Batman Incorporated/ story-arc, where Bruce recruits various other Bat-types, including a number of foreign knockoffs, to help deal with international threats and that sort of thing. Finally, in a relatively recent story-arc, a villainous vaguely-government-affilliated group called the Colony tries to extend that concept out to an entire group, with surprisingly competent results, a large group fo them managing to swarm and incapacitate Batman, though predictably they get turned into low-level mooks who crumple after a single punch once there's no need to make them seem intimidating.

I know these are comic examples and you're talking movies, where Batman is shown as explicitly okay with shooting and killing people, but the 'just give Batman a gun' solution still irks me somewhat. I think it would add an interesting challenge to the proposed problem to not be able to use guns or kill people. Bat-bombing people with his bat-drones isn't really Bruce's /style,/ y'know?

** If you do this, you are killing Batman and replacing him with yourself in a batsuit.

The whole point of Batman as a character is that he is nuts, but manages to channel it in a more acceptable way than his villains. Going out and punching people isn't the most efficient way to stop crime, but Batman does it anyway. Unless there's a supervillain involved, beating up and arresting a single criminal is maybe one of the worst ways to stop crime!

Batman comics/movies have dealt with this before; it's one of the most defining aspects of his character. A Batman that doesn't get personally involved is a Batman that dealt with orphanhood/trauma much better, and if that's the case what you probably get is Bruce Wayne, billionaire philanthropist, instead of a billionaire playboy with a secret life.

Fair point, but I was trying to optimize Batman to be a valuable member of the justice league. And generally the league only gets together for supervillain-type crimes.

Why? Because he does not have personal, unshareable superpowers. He has training and a high-tech costume. In a universe where quality wins over quantity, a much better course of action for him would be spending time in the lab making custom costumes for other heroes, who do have a superpoower, cooperate with police, and maybe maintain a couple of Robins for emergencies. There shouldn't be a Batman.

As a superhero character Batman makes no sense at all (and was never meant to make sense anyway). To begin with, the fact that his combat suit is not remote-controlled, especially considering that we're frequently shown that all his vehicles are, is utterly ridiculous. His personal income compares favorably with small nations' GDP, FFS, but he can't recruit and form even an elite combat squad of his own, and has to do everything himself ? I know, I know, demigod mythology tropes etc.

That's just not how you use the superpower of megawealth. But then if the writers knew anything about making vast amounts of money, growing huge businesses, and using it all for for good, they wouldn't be writing comics I guess.

***** Again you are not understanding the scale of what I am saying. If Flash is truly thousands of times faster than light, he can constantly comb through Earth's every nook and cranny multiple times over in his free time (whenever he doesn't need to sleep/eat/spend time with his family whatever) and stop almost all crimes happening on the planet at any given time in a millisecond (except maybe other Speedsters but none of them match his top speed). After some days or weeks of this, crime rates would pretty much go to 0 worldwide due to their ineffectiveness against a literal god. You're thinking of this in terms of Batman directing the Flash to go stop X crime or defeat Y person, but the Flash is more than fast enough to defeat literally every person and stop all crimes on the Earth in a second or so - he doesn't need to stop to solve any particular one of them when he can solve all at once. Like if he spends one or two hours per day "patrolling" as a superhero, then in that time he can check up on any plans any person in the world might be going over to commit a future crime and stop them right before they happen. Heck give him some more time and he can probably be an universal enforcer who very few people can stop.\\
Similarly while Supes top speed is not that high, his base speed is still high enough to cross to any part of the Earth in a couple of seconds BUT he can hear and process everything happening on Earth at the same time, so he too can stop any crime right before it's gonna happen worldwide. No need to wait for a crime to happen and for Batman to then direct them towards the culprit when you can hear (Supes) or see (Flash) it happening in slow motion real-time and stop it right then and there.

******* Even that panel dismisses Flash's top speed though. He can get rid of literally all guns on Earth (assuming that particular example), not just "most" in a second or so and nobody would even know that it was the Flash who got rid of them. There would be nobody in the "know" to resent him at all. I'll take a decent human like the human Flash as the sole arbitrator of humanity, over the current Earth any day. Obviously a rational character like Lex Luthor might never believe that Flash will always act in humanity's interests, but we know that being meta-characters in a sense.

*********** Yeah but my initial discussion wasn't to stop death permanently. It was just to stop CRIMES for happening - at least the ones that take away people's choice and agency about what's happening to them. Puffing cigarettes isn't a crime in most countries, and even if it was then it still is the drinker's own choice. If you accept Flash's top shown speeds as something he chooses to use daily then the whole premise is that Batman and the rest of the JL are completely useless, and that the Flash can effectively accomplish what the rest of Earth's population can't in a matter of seconds. What he chooses to do then I can't really say as I'm not a writer, but I definitely do not agree with the panel you showed me. Main reason why I prefer to read original popular standard fiction just to read their rational fanfiction later on as the latter interests me more.

************ Okay, let's consider what happens if the Flash tries to stop crimes permanently.

Lex Luthor is currently buying shares on the stock exchange. Does he have inside information on the company in question? If so, then he is doing insider trading, which is illegal. If he does not, then his transaction is perfectly legal. The Flash has no way of knowing which is the case - Luthor's smart enough not to leave any damning paperwork lying around. Does he stop the transaction?

--------------

There is a locked and sealed soundproof room. The key is in the lock, on the inside, and there is a ventilation shaft for air. The Flash has previously seen three people walk into the room, of their own volition. Was one of them tricked into entering the room under false pretenses by the other two? Is there some violent crime going on in there? How can the Flash tell, short of breaking down the door?

--------------

Two large people (in trenchcoats and fedoras) are asking one small fellow where the money he promised them is. The small fellow is nervous, the big guy are looming a bit in order to look intimidating but not laying a hand on him. The big guys are telling the little guy that he needs to pay "what he owes" or "he knows what will happen". Is this a legitimate debt, and if the little guy doesn't pay he gets hit with contractually agreed penalties, or is this a criminal gang shaking down an innocent shopkeeper?

************* Again you're underestimating the speed of what I am talking about. The Flash can literally keep tabs on every place, every person, every animal and every insect on Earth at the same time (relative to us). He can phase through things and come out with the same speed, or travel through space's vacuum - he doesn't need to break down home security to enter anywhere. Your first example is moot as Flash already would have tabs on every single person due to his sheer speed and relative thinking (so it's not even that he can't process so much information, which he has shown to do in the past). He would know every word spoken by every person aloud, every action taken by them etc since he started doing this enforcer job. Your second example is already solved because Flash already has tabs on every person as I previously said, so he will already know if a crime is going to happen or someone is being coerced etc. The third example - same thing, Flash already knows about the situation beforehand, and even if he doesn't - as soon (assuming it's a criminal gang) as they start to actually physically threaten that guy the Flash will instantly put them somewhere on the other side of Earth with them being none the wiser. With the speed he has, he literally becomes an omnipresent god on Earth.\\
You can't hide anything from the Flash, because he will know literally everything. Even a smart man like Lex working through intermediaries won't be able to hide anything from a man who is on every place in the world at the same time and can't be checked for or warded off beforehand. Yeah you could say he is disrupting privacy or he is breaking many laws, but if such a character existed then what are human laws compared to a God who can solve all of Earth's real problems at once. I'd take a dictator like that any day.

Also even if he can't do this 24/7, solving ALL CRIME even for one hour per day (especially if he chooses the best time statistically after going through some research on time zones and population centers etc) is still better than the nothing we have right now. And he can keep shifting his hours around every day so that criminals can't just concentrate in other times of the day, and after some days/weeks/months of this most of the highest tier terrorists, gang members, serial killers will already be in jail/dead/whatever he decides to do with them, and the rest will be forced to go back to a better life in fear of the Flash.\\
Your previous comment assumed I was talking about the DC Flash, who probably won't choose to do any of this (because of the cigarettes thing). I was mostly talking about any random real life morally decent human who had the DC Flash's powers instead, who could solve any problem or do anything he chooses to do on his whim. He is literally one of the most overpowered characters I've ever seen, at least out of the ones who are kept at a lower level (most other "God"-like characters have Godly matters to deal with and similar level enemies, but Barry fucking Allen keeps fighting shit like street mobs on a daily basis with no effect).

On the contrary, it's not difficult - unless the Flash speaks every single language, /and/ has some means of bypassing encryption. But yeah, Lex's criminal enterprises will be /heavily/ constrained, and probably no-one else will be able to get anything that the Flash doesn't like done.

But that's the important point, isn't it? It's a matter of what this Flash likes or doesn't like. That's suddenly the only thing that counts anymore. What rules is he going to enforce?

You stated earlier in this thread that you would like him to stop crimes - specifically, "the ones that take away people's choice and agency about what's happening to them". And your proposed solution, in order to reach this state, is to take away all agency and choice from anyone except one man?

What religion does he follow? This is important, because it might mean that everyone finds themselves in church every Sunday. Or it might mean that every woman finds herself wearing a burqa every time she's in public. Or that suddenly there's no blood transfusions in hospitals.

Again you're not understanding the scope of what I'm saying. If Lex or one of his intermediaries even "type" anything, the Flash will know instantly what they typed even though the data will go encrypted to the second party. He can just read the keyboard strokes right as they're happening, while still keeping tab on every other place on Earth at the same time like a proper God. He has shown to be able to pick up new skills at the same pace he does everything else, so give him a millisecond or less and he instantly knows every spoken language of the universe, or all known encryption techniques on Earth. Heck he thinks and can even decrypt way faster than any known computer system in 2018. And yeah he can phase through stuff easily, and that's not even one of his "high end" powers like the scenario I'm describing - even the CW Flash show has him learn phasing in early S2 (in S5 currently) which he uses every couple of episodes. If such a character ever existed then the life of every organism on Earth would get constrained to whatever he decides them to do, even other theoretical superpowered beings like Wonder Woman or Martian Manhunter who can't do anything to him. But this is why I was saying I would take a theoretical beneficial Barry Allen over the current system. But obviously if I had the option of giving supreme power to anyone it won't be a random person off the street or even me personally.

Also this is all considering his "present" day powers - he travels in time constantly and that's one of his lower end powers. Any time he fucks up (which is not possible if he uses his power at 100% constantly like I'm describing) he can just go back in time and repeat the scenario.

Let's say that the Flash was truly as unstoppable as you claim. (Personally, I doubt it, but let's ignore that for the moment). Let's say that, for whatever reason, he decides to remove all agency and choice from every other person in the world by the means that you describe. Let's say that he decides to prevent anyone, ever, from acting in any way that he personally disagrees with.

Why do you seem to think that that would be a good idea?

** But at this point wouldn't you have just changed Batman into Generalman? He's got the powers of an army General! He commands the strength of a thousand men! He's neither a bird nor a plane, but has a squadron of the latter ready to scramble at a moment's notice!

I mean, the fundamental problem is that if you try to make a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals realistic, you stop having a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals. Superheroes aren't very realistic already, pretty much anyone outside of someone with Superman-level powers just wouldn't be that much of a force on their own. If they're vulnerable to bullets all their superpowers count for shit, they'll get killed. So we need to at least assume some kind of suspension of disbelief to make the concept of superheroes even remotely viable.

Otherwise, a truly "realistic" superhero story IMHO would need to make them work in cooperation with the police, and mostly exist as heroes for a PR boost (flashy, recognisable guys in costumes with superpowers would do wonders to both enhance the good guys' morale and scare the shit out of their enemies). My Hero Academia is probably on the right track there, though it still is very unrealistic with how the battles actually pan out (since most of its heroes have only /one/ power, often not even a defensive one, but somehow manage to withstand stuff that'd kill a normal human multiple times over).

batman solves problems by thinking. not by fighting, the fighting is just him helping when and where he can. his psychology skills help keep the team together and working for a common goal.

if you have a problem with how a specific version of batman isnt good enough, then your problem is with the writing, not with batman. lets look at the movie: he assembled the team, he helped motivate flash with 'save one person', and he had the plan to get superman back. without batman there is no team, just a random assortment of superheroes with no plan.

Batman and the Joker are strikingly similar concepts; the difference is just that one of them /mistakenly believes/ that they're acting for Lawful Good while the other one /correctly believes/ that they're acting for Chaotic Evil.
