** Just for those who are not aware: If you enjoyed this story, go read all of Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Hofstadter. His book, in addition to focusing on ideas like the infinite regress illustrated by Carroll, also uses a similar style and characters in dialogues to illustrate things (though he also explains things with rather more mathematical precision as well).

  You know, there might be some other things that I admire highly besides Gödel, Escher, Bach, and I might or might not disagree with some things Douglas Hofstadter once said, but I'm not even going to list them, because GEB doesn't need that kind of moderation. It is okay for GEB to be awesome. In this world there are people who have created awesome things and it is okay to admire them highly! Let this Earth have at least a little of its pride!
