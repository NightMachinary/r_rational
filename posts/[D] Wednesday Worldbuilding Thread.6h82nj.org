Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** 50 years ago, an alien empire established a new colony at Alpha Centauri that quickly became a major trade route. The colonists decided little would be gained from first contact with Earth so they decided to leave it be, but 30 years ago pirates decided our solar system would be of use to them. Being the morally upstanding people they were, they began abducting and terrorizing humans for recreation. They had no interest in invasion because we had little of value to take.

The governments of Earth soon figured out what was going on and banded together to stop the threat, but decided not to tell the public since there was no strategic advantage to saying UFOs were randomly attacking people. A new military-industrial complex was build with the goal of inventing and building new technologies with the largest R&D grant program in history. No idea was too insane so long as it would help, even social scientists received funding to examine unusual scenarios.

The war was long and victories came slowly, but 5 years ago humanity finally forced the pirates out. Surprised by our resourcefulness, the colonists opened diplomatic relations and the truth was revealed to the word. The colonists turned out to be far more technologically advanced than anything reverse-engineered from the pirates ramshackle ships, which placed the fabulously wealthy corporations firmly against any trade. However, they found themselves astronomically outbid.

The announcement that trade was even being negotiated with the colonists had a detrimental effect on the economy. No one wanted to invent new tech that would soon become obsolete, so millions of engineers and scientists were laid off. Those that stayed were given high-risk projects with minimal funding by morally unscrupulous people desperate to stay relevant. Trade negotiations have stalled over tariffs, which will be needed to pay off the war debt, but the damage will not be undone.

This is a world where geniuses had to take their work home or on the street, espionage and sabotage of businesses has became commonplace, mad science experiments frequently escape or go haywire, robots and mutants are running loose, aliens and AI have civil rights but morally dubious goals, and there's a global army of special forces cyborgs ready to swoop in on any terrorist who advertises themselves. You've seen urban fantasy, now I give you urban science fiction!

My explicit intention with this setting was to create a sci-fi analogue to The Dresden Files. Wizards are STEM majors, human-like creatures are mutants, inhuman creatures are robots, The Fair Folk are aliens, and gods are AIs with cyborg servants. This setting could used for pulp adventure, mystery, or intrigue with an eclectic cast of characters. Criminals have hi-tech gadgets, illegal experiments are escaping, dangerous projects are being stolen, and sinister conspiracies are afoot.

*** I like it.

A big part of the appeal of urban fantasy is that it empowers extremely relatable characters in extremely familiar settings. If you met Harry Dresden or Sookie Stackhouse in reality, you probably wouldn't notice anything unusual about them- and that also suggests that you yourself and people you know could exist in these worlds without any significant changes.

There's a lot to be said of awe-inspiring settings, larger-than-life character archetypes, and fascinatingly alien cultures- and those can all work to some degree in urban fantasy, but what the genre does best isn't the sort of escapism that transports the reader to another world. It's escapism that works by recontextualizing the reader's own life and experiences as something more fantastic.

So, if you want this setting to be distinct from cyberpunk with aliens or pulpy quasi-retro-futurism, my advice would be to design the setting so that the most radical departures from our reality haven't significantly altered the lives of ordinary humans. Maybe the economy has taken a hit, corporations are releasing some strange products, and everyone is mildly obsessed with the videos from Alpha Centauri, but if you were transported to this world, you wouldn't immediately notice anything out of place, or seem out of place yourself. The really interesting stuff would be just below the surface.

Going that route would put some serious restrictions on the world-building, but it could also give the setting a type of appeal that you don't often see in sci-fi.

Thanks, that's exactly what I was going for. I was originally inspired by the show Gargoyles, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dioeue3][as explained in the second half of this comment]], but think I ended up with something closer to Fringe. I like the idea that this setting has the potential for such a wide range of stories.

Engineers and scientists are going to be massively in demand to figure out how to make the new stuff themselves and incorporate it into our world. For example, the super-alien-computer might have a holographic screen and more storage space than Google, but someone is going to have to teach it how to understand Earth's data transfer protocols and interface with the internet (along with the GalacticNet, of course, which it presumably handles by default).

And /somebody/ is going to be doing a lot of frustrated screaming when it comes to trying to get the alien tech to communicate with a user in /English/.

Actually inventing new tech is only a tiny part of the production cycle...

**** That would be the case, except all of the alien companies want us to be dependent upon them. We are a new customer base that they're out to squeeze as much profit from as possible, and the people in power are willing to let them do that because the technology they offer is so advanced. So the aliens don't want humans to build any of their products, they want to drive all our industries out of business with imports. Even if they needed humans to help adapt their products to us, they'd still do it at minimal cost.

Not only are the aliens so rich they can easily outbid every human on Earth, the politicians who give their constituents post-scarcity tech are guaranteed job security forever. The corporations definitely want to reverse engineer the tech so they don't all go out of business, but the aliens aren't handing it over and the government won't compel them to so the research is illegal. That makes it a story hook.

************ Well, if the colonists wanted to invade we really couldn't stop them. It took decades to fight off undisciplined pirates with poorly-maintained tech who just wanted to screw around with the primitive locals for recreation in between the real work. The colonists are from a galaxy-spanning imperialist power who never cared about us until we subverted their expectations, so now they think we're worth to time to exploit economically.

These aliens are not altruistic, they knew what the pirates were doing and decided to do nothing about it. I didn't say they were analogous to The Fair Folk for nothing, they are cosmically powerful and do not care about humans except for what we can do for them. The only reason they're allowing our planet to, in effect, join their empire is because the return on their investment for taking it by force would be too low.

The world government knows all of this and probably could tell the aliens to leave without risking much, but there are too many ways humans could benefit from trading with a civilization over a century ahead of ours. Not only that, but this is an opportunity to pay off all the public debt the war accumulated without austerity measures that would conveniently have forced people to rely on the companies made rich by the war.

While many politicians see this as a way to enrich themselves, alien lobbyists have very deep pockets, others see this as a way to finally create the utopia they've always dreamed of without sucking up to the rich humans they always have. Things these aliens see as a passing fancy are miraculous to us, why not take them up on the offer? Even if we get annexed, their standard of living is so much higher than ours it might be worth it.

This puts Earth in pretty much the same place (militarily speaking) vis-a-vis the aliens as Mauritius is relative to America.

So, here's the question; how /exactly/ are they "exploiting" us economically?

They can get cheap raw materials by mining more conveniently-located asteroids, so it's not that. Our technology is laughably primitive next to theirs, so it's not that. If they're trying to deny us access to their technology, then they're clearly not looking for skilled engineers.

Honestly, the only thing that we've got here that can't be easily found on Mars and other empty worlds is organics and the results of processes that start with organics (e.g. fossil fuels). Are they really that interested in complex organic molecules?

(I guess it's not impossible. I do remember reading a very good short story once, in which it turned out that corncobs were the raw material for a nastily addictive alien drug; and all the flying saucers seen around Earth were either drug smugglers or police)

#+end_quote

That's reasonable. I'm just having trouble seeing what the aliens get out of the deal. Allowing our planet to join their empire means a bunch of extra paperwork (and, apparently, going to the trouble to make Earth-compatible tech) - what return are the aliens getting on /that/ investment?

Trading, yes. Subjugating ourselves to the point of not having some top-secret lab working on reverse-engineering the tech?

************** I didn't think all that much about out what the colonists get out of this deal. My working assumption was that the one thing Earth has that they want is a species that's demonstrated surprising ingenuity and ability to cooperate. If they can make humans economically dependent upon them, we could make intelligent laborers who work for cheap due to our lower standard of living. They basically want us to become what third-world immigrants are to America, probably leaving the Earth as a banana republic.

*************** [[/hmmm][]] If they're surprised by our ability to cooperate, then that implies that they don't have it; that they're individualistic and competitive, far more so than us. If they're surprised by our ingenuity, then they're going to be blindsided by it again a few more times, in all probability... it's quite possible that they took thousands of years to get as much technological progress as we did in a mere hundred years, for example, which means they are /not/ going to expect humanity's tech to catch up to theirs as quickly as it will.

As for cheap labour - simple, repetitive tasks will be cheaper given to robots. (The aliens do have industrial robots, right?) And anything else will require the aliens to provide a certain amount of education to their new workers (in a "this is how you build a warp beacon" kind of way) - which will result in said lessons being leaked back on Earth...

***** One way to do that is to accelerate (and slow, stop, or reverse) time in a very local area; in the case of reversal, all subatomic particles in the area flip and run precisely in reverse (including those inside the brain), only to flip back when the power is cancelled.
