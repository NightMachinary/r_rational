I'm feeling like writing a superhero story. (Once I finish everything ELSE on my plate, anyway.) Writing flying bricks and winners of the superpower lottery is boring, I'd rather write someone who gets creative with an apparently lame power.

What is the absolutely stupidest, most useless power you can think of?

A person eats about 2.1 kg of food a day, which is roughly the mass of a dove (according to Google). There are 86400 seconds in a day, and 4 doves per second means that you can feed 345600 people per day at max rate.

**** I'm going to assume the dove fully fits into the space that you sweep through with your hands, so you can only force matter into existence where you can already push your hands through.

Actually, mechanically, let's make it be that the inside surfaces of your hands become an air-tight, dove-cross-section-shaped portal, wrapped around a dove, somewhere. As you pull your hands apart, you move the portal so two ends of the dove are somewhere, and the middle is between your hands. If you try to move your hands in a way that does not fit a dove, you encounter as much resistance as it would normally take to bend the dove that way (if you're strong you can use this to summon a dead dove).

This does mean that if you're in a closed room, each dove summoned will slightly increase the air pressure. I'm pretty sure the equivalent underwater does not actually cause a shockwave any more than it does for someone without this super power, but I could be wrong.

First use: Perfect lie detector. When someone tells you what happened in a situation, you can instantly tell that they are making up the story if your power triggers off of it.

Second use: unbreakable cryptographic communication, although the bandwidth varies with the specifics of the power. Get someone to send the necessary fraction of a purpose-made story to you, along with a key to interpret the results. For example: "the butler did it" means attack now, "the maid did it" means wait until morning, "the wife did it" means that reinforcements are incoming and so on. Alternatively, "your orders are what the last page of this story says."

How transitive is this, and what is the threshold? Assuming very permissive limits, you could pull stunts like "I have no money bet right now. That roulette wheel will turn up a 12. I guess I should bet now." or compound many small things together. "The home team will not score between 0:00 and 0:05 of the first quarter of the basketball game. The home team will not score between 0:05 and 0:10 of the first quarter of the basketball game..." and so on for every 5 seconds of the game. No one interval that size matters, so no one prediction fails.

This seems like it would need to act as the opposite effect in order to make sense: You have the ability to look appropriate for any /situation/, as fashion is defined by where you currently are and what you are currently doing.

*** "The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content"

Write the ending of the story based on some future event. Now you can predict the future by predicting the course of your own story.

"The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it)"

Suppose you have to be 99% certain it's inconsequential. Someone asks you what the answer to the question they wrote down in this envelope is. 99% of the time it's inconsequential. The other 1% of the time it's not.

"Constant, can't-be-turned-off, X-Ray vision"

Can you just see X-Rays, or is this something where you're projecting so many of them that you can make out objects from the backscatter? If it's the second one, you could tune solar panels to that frequency and get electricity from it.

"The ability to always insert a USB drive correctly on the first try"

Fix the computer in place. Attach the USB upside-down to a turbine. In order to insert the USB drive correctly, you have to spin the turbine, generating large amounts of power. You're superpower must allow you to do this.

#+end_quote

It is, though I'd probably make the power more limited than this- people don't actively live, they breathe and such. Also, you have no control over autonomous functions-people will breathe and be hungry regardless of what your powers do. I'd imagine the story would have a lot of exploration of what boredom worked well to stop a person and have a lot of exploration of motivation and reasons people do things.

Suppose there was a religious extremist and you made them bored of religion to stop them. You then find out that actually what really motivated them was pleasing their companions.

  This test has a time limit of five minutes, and consists of one essay prompt. Drawings and schematics are encouraged. The prompt is, "outline, in detail sufficient to build a working model, plans for a stable cold fusion reactor, which can be built from under $1,000 worth of parts at an average Super Wal-Mart."
#+end_quote

I'd probably use a different definition of ace- they perform better than the majority of testers around them, or they perform to the expectations of the tester. A test with an imprecise mark scheme like 'A working cold fusion machine' wouldn't be enough- suppose the machine actually worked via quantum bullshit, how would the tester evaluate this?

So it needs some comparative measurement criteria. If no one can succeed you can't measure it. It's off the scale.

Suppose the test was 'lift the planet'.

You're not really measuring strength in most people since they can't really do much to lift it. It's not a measurable power. You can't do better than anyone else. You'll always fail.

So the power would go 'fake test, not helping you, kthxbye'.

Or 'construct a friendly AI'

Ok, what are you measuring. Friendly AI construction abilities? How do you confirm that this is a real friendly AI? What are other candidates evaluated on? What would be a B grade mark, an A grade, a C grade?

If your answer is 'you decide' then the answer will be 'no'.

Although, there's some really cool one, like these:

  Always have the correct amount of change in pocket

  I can close any door at will.

  The ability to unwrinkle or straighten anything.

We currently have a shortage of fresh water throughout the world and the problem with salt water is that the salt concentration is so high it's really hard to remove all of the salt from it. Sweat on the other hand is much easier to use for Osmosis to extract fresh water from.

**** Yup. It can be used as a very effective disguise, but also carries all of the downsides of old age, like being weaker and such. Some of them aren't quite as useless as the others. Specifically: Mass (breaks conservation of momentum), losing calories (instant diet pill), dulling senses (painkiller), removing memories (eyebleach, operational security), reduced muscle mass/old age (disguises and deception. Also breaks conservation of momentum and mass).

They're more like super-strength-without-super-ligaments or super-speed-without-super-reflexes tier powers than truly useless ones.

As for wearing off, that isn't quite it. You need to actively store the attribute in order to lose it, and you go back to normal the second that you want to. Storing memories is the exception to this rule, as it is permanent once you decide which memories to store.

** - The ability to cause any one effect that is physically possible and expends no more than 1 millijoule of energy per second.

(that is, you can switch effects -- and any knock-on effects that have been caused wont be wiped out -- but only one effect may be active at once. 1 Millijoule/sec was a rough estimate -- it should be possible to tweak the threshold to make the power both sufficiently difficult to effectively use and sufficiently munchkinable) )

Also,

- The ability to forget anything that you don't want to forget.

Sakaki (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya)'s power, as interpreted by Kyon: Big Damn Hero, is also a candidate -- possibly TOO lame:

- The ability to witness only things which you can explain with your current understanding of the universe. If that sounds confusing, you can imagine an 'absolute normality field' projected around you, where 'normality' is defined by your current understanding of what is possible in the universe. Inside that field, your sense of normality is never contradicted; events which are possible under actual physics but not under your understanding of it simply cannot occur.

(It's about the only power I can think of that is useless in a horrifying way. Any munchkining would, AFAICS, have to be done via someone else. And is likely to involve brainwashing.)

EDIT: /This third item may require more explanation/. It's essentially /absolute anti-falsification/. Here's an example. Supposing you are a bigot who genuinely believes that gay and bi people don't really exist, and someone bi enters your sphere of influence... then they will be unable to perform any act which would classify them as genuinely gay or bi to you. Which could be as little as a mannerism, or as much as having sex, according to your particular interpretation. Your AoE is 'anywhere you are currently perceiving', so if they are in another room then your power would probably have no effect on them.

Or here's another example: You believe that quantum mechanics doesn't work. Most likely, this has no effect, because if you believe quantum mechanics doesn't work, you probably don't have any idea of what it working would be like. (AFAICS, if you both understand quantum mechanics and believe it doesn't work, I think this would prevent anything at all from happening in your AoE ever.)

Now, if you believed something smaller -- like 'USB keys don't work', then they indeed would not be able to work in your vicinity. Not through any modification of their functionality, but physical prevention of any event that would prove that they did work. Again, your AoE covers only what you are currently perceiving, so people could use USB keys in your vicinity as long as it wouldn't lead to you discovering that USB keys do in fact work.

In other words, the effect does not alter the rules of physics to suit your preconceptions; rather, it prevents you from witnessing anything that is contrary to those preconceptions; it suppresses possible evidence.

So, a final example: 'No-one is strong enough to pull a train'. This wouldn't prevent anyone from actually being strong enough to pull a train. It would prevent them from using enough of that strength in your AoE to actually pull a train. If you thought that one type of train, a heavier type, was pullable and another, lighter, was not, and they in fact had the strength to pull either, then they could only pull the heavier type in your AoE.

We need to look at what they actually do to see what they believe will really happen.

There's probably a way to abuse it, all right, but since the power denies the non-'normal' rather than creating the 'normal', it seems surprisingly difficult to achieve any great effect with it. The most interesting effect I've thought of so far that could be done with it, is a field of truthfulness (via brainwashing that 'people claims always match what they believe to be most true').

Just say milliwatt. What do you mean by "physically possible"? Superpowers are generally defined by how they disobey physics. If you have to attach a battery and resistor to a wire to make sure that it's physically possible for a milliwatt of electricity to move through it, then the power didn't do anything at all. On the other hand, if we go into quantum physics, everything possible happens, and everything impossible happens for a short amount of time. You didn't narrow it down at all by saying "physically possible".

I was thinking reactionless drive, where from your point of reference a milliwatt does a lot more than from the point of reference of the Sun, but then I realized that from you point of reference it actually takes no power.

Well, given the electricity example, the kind of thing I was talking about would be just /making/ that 1mw of electricity flow through the wire. That violates physics because you have conjured free energy, but once that energy is in the world it must behave in accordance with the rules of physics. Another example usage might be for starting fires. Or of course, you might be able to charge a battery.. very slowly.

Yeah, Sakaki's power is pretty broken, just awkward and anti-scientific enough that it's a bit difficult to work out how to usefully exploit.

** You can conjure a live animal, uniformly randomly chosen from a currently living specimen of the family [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muridae][/Muridae/]], at the approximate range, relative momentum, and precision of anywhere you can throw an object of the same mass and shape within your line of sight.

- You can do this about every three or four minutes, but it gets gradually harder and more exhausting without rest.
- The mice/rats/whatever are not under your control or direction any more than you can mundanely accomplish.
- The conjured animal does not 'dismiss' itself after a period of time.
- The specimen is selected from the world's current population of murids, and teleported to location you conjure it. You cannot choose a specific organism. It carries its natural flora, gases, pathogens, dirt, digested food, etc. with it, but does not transport any non-food items intentionally attached or fed to it. It arrives in the same condition it was, though momentum from the conjuration or pressure differentials could kill it.
- You will get something reasonably mouse-shaped; immortal cell lines, individual cells, cancers, teratomas, etc. don't count. You will not get unborn embryos on their own. Pregnant creatures take their babies with them.
- You can only conjure specimens on Earth, and if then, only while you are on Earth (assume a 100 km altitude edge of space, no "different Hubble volume" nonsense). You can't use conjuring to transfer information faster-than-light any more than you normally can.
- The critter disappears and reappears more-or-less instantaneously, with minimal sonic effect; it's not quite clear if the volume of air that formerly occupied the space where you conjured goes to where you displaced the conjuration from. In any case, you can't use the process to displace something out of your way.
- There's no obvious indication that you are using your power other than its result and the physical effects of your conscious intent (mind-reading works to detect it, mind-control works to use it). You can use your power with the approximate mental effort and intentionality it takes to pick up an object and throw it; random gerbils flying out of nowhere from a seizure are extremely unlikely, but in principle possible. Physical restraint has no effect on your ability to conjure. Inability to visualize the situation could effect your success, but you could still conjure something at an abstract vector from yourself.

The Ineffective Rain-Dancer: You can spawn a single raindrop per second. Your range spans roughly any visible part of the sky (raindrop can be defined as a sphere of water of a certain small size, sky can be defined as a specific range of distances from the ground - not too close, but not out in space either, and your range is a function of distance from your body - the "visible part of the sky" bit is just a rough heuristic for how far the power goes).

You definitely need to integrate technology to do any truly powerful stuff, and how much you can munchkin this is definitely in proportion to your knowledge of the natural world and your engineering-style creativity.

This is also a good time to start fleshing out edge cases, such as what happens to the material which previously occupied the location ofthe summoned water droplet. Via your water droplet example, you've implicitly chosen "things get displaced (pushed out of the way)" - as opposed to say, things disappear.

Are the drops pure water? If not, can I control what impurities they contain?

How about creating the drops such that they turn a waterwheel? Not much power, but some.

Can the drops be created inside another object? Creating the drops inside a computer could short it out. Creating them inside a person's eyeball would make them highly unhappy. They'd need to be far enough up to do that, though.

How long does it take from the moment I use the power to when the drop appears? Can I do FTL signaling? If not, I can still use it for remote communication -- when my team sees the drop appear, that's the signal to go. Or have them set up a keyboard and I create drops over the relevant keys to spell words. Slow but workable.

Using it for communication is also brilliant and I hadn't thought of that - you can even do that on the ground actually, since the drops will fall down to the intended recipient and you can use the mega-drop trick to make it noticeable. Drop size and distance could be used for increasing information density, and although each drop takes you one second to create the recipient can get the drops slower or faster depending on your spacing - you could essentially do morse code, or some other alphabet.

I think creating droplets inside of objects is definitely where all the more advanced applications come in - just the ability to create a bunch of matter /anywhere you wanted/ within a subset of space should be a boon to engineering. My version of the thought was to put multiple droplets in a very enclosed space and then using the extremely high-pressure situation that would arise to some advantage - weapons, or energy.

Respawn: Any time you're killed, your body disappears and then reappears in perfect health somewhere within a 100 meter radius. Any blood/biomass you lost also disappears, and any foreign bodies within you are left behind where you despawn.

I don't think the person with the power should be able to /directly/ predict the negative outcome, but they should have a rough idea of what will happen, based on the action they're trying to commit.

That way, you can always 'cheat' by picking a negative outcome that's disastrous and drama-enducing, but not story-ending :P

** Giving the power to be calm and rational when in combat to the Hulk.

The ability to summon a random useless object, whenever you figure out a use for the object it changes what it summons.

To have all of Superman's powers but they either stop working or refills in power when it would increase dramatic tension. They always reset to normal if it would decrease future potential for drama though.

Power proportional to unused intellect, so stuff like munchkinning decrease your power.

Or for something that can actually be exploited a bit the inability to get bored.

Of course a better contendor for most useless possible power is to passively boost or weaken people near you based off how much they want to harm you. Obviously desire to harm = boost and conversely desire to help = weaken. You have no control over it and it affects everyone.

Hm. I'm not sure what the limits of modern brain surgery are. It would be easily weaponized though -- lobotomies are pretty straightforward, and you could repair the damage once the person was in cuffs. Pain induction would also be an option. I'm not sure about pleasure induction -- is there a "pleasure center" in a human brain that can be poked? I know they can do it to rats.

This would be an easy way to launch space probes. Although it would be most likely to land you outside our galaxy, so maybe that wouldn't be so useful.

Let's make some simple assumptions though: we're not writing a snuff comic or a NSFW comic, so the teleport will put you somewhere on Earth, only in a safe location (not into the core, not 100 miles in the air), and you can bring with you whatever you are wearing / carrying up to a small load limit (say, ~10 pounds). That means your clothes and your (e.g.) messenger bag go with you. You didn't say that there was a cooldown on the power so, if you teleport enough times in sequence, you'll eventually land somewhere near whatever destination you want and can proceed the rest of the way via normal transit. Not useful for traveling across the city, but useful if you just need to get to France from the US.

If the material is air, then you would be immune to wind-based powers and I think to certain kinds of motion sensors that work off air movement. You might be able to get work doing things inside a wind tunnel, maybe adjusting sensors in real time.

That's the advantage of being able to teleport back again :)

Space is big enough that you probably wouldn't end up in a planet or star, anyway. And yeah, no cooldown, that would just be unfair.
