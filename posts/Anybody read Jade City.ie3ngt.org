I just stumbled upon [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city][Jade City]] through [[https://davidepstein.com/from-nike-corporate-strategist-to-award-winning-novelist/][this interview]] and this part raises some rational!hope:

  I think that having a business strategy background certainly does influence my writing, because even though I write fantasy novels, I'm always thinking about the way my fictional world works, really works, not just in terms of the magic system, but the politics and economics and culture. I want the fantastical elements to feel entirely real, as real as anything in our world. A substance with powerful properties like bioenergetic jade would absolutely be subject to state regulation, international trade, and black market smuggling, so that's what I put down on the page.

** Haven't yet, but it just got put on the list to read. Which means if I get through 2 books a day, I might finish that book by 2030 sometime.

** I read the reviews and it follows multiple perspective characters. Also heard the worldbuilding is more about intercene magic mafia conflicts when outside of the Jade City isles there are real monsters that prey on humanity. Therefore it didn't sound like I'd be interested in it, since it glorifies the crime life and not the rational future of the humanity. Could be wrong, read about 15 reviews before not putting it on my own list.
