[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Fables and Legends". [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/cw9o0kj]["The Bear and the Fox"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair.

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time the challenge will be "Amnesia", or more generally, the loss of knowledge. This covers everything from self-editing of memories to antimemetics. It's up to you whether to go with retrograde or anterograde amensia (the latter seen in /Memento/), or if you want to go with something more in the realm of science fiction. If you want to write fanfic, franchises of opportunity include /Men in Black/, /Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind/, the /Bourne/ series, /Harry Potter/, /Artemis Fowl/, along with many, many others. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, November 18th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]).

** [[https://votcd.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/erasure/][Erasure]] (1959 words)

This is an idea I've had kicking around for a long time. May last year based on when I created the original text file, probably longer in the form of idle thoughts.

Also an opportunity to put something on the embarassingly empty wordpress I created for a project that isn't likely to see the light of day.

I wrote it from 11 PM to 9 AM, so I expect it's rife with errors. I'll do an editing pass after getting some sleep.

*** Interesting. The 'wish' made a question mark pop up above my head (effectively, 'Why?' (did it work)); there's also the question of why/when it was written down. The strongest impression I got was that a lot near the beginning closely mirrored the start of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, particularly around the 'heartfelt speeches' memory. If you have a copy, it might be worth rereading that part and then separating the two.
