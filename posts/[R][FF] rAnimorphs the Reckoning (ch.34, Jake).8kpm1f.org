And I think we can all see that parts of the chapter would have clearly suffered if you'd rushed it. You're basically writing the ultimate Animorphs fic (I mean, the fandom is kind of dying overall); so personally speaking, I'm absolutely okay with you taking your time, as long as it gets completed eventually.

*** Came here from fanfiction because your last chapter mentioned you appreciate feedback.

So here it is: soglad to have a new chapter. Think I read the previous ones in a week (work week that is).

Really love how you manage to give your spin yet still have it feel like Animorphs.

Obviously I liked the events that mirror chapters/books (cause pure nostalgia) but the exploration of new paths is very interesting & enjoyable as well.

Edit: [[/r/HFY]] has a bot that messages us when an author we subscribed to post. That's not a thing here?

** Very glad to see this updating again.

Previous couple of chapters might have been a better time to mention this, but I haven't been this unsettled by a villain since HPMOR!Voldemort. "Blade that falls without warning" (even though its Elfangor's title) is a great way to describe the feeling, the constant worry that even if things seem alright it might already be too late to even survive, let alone stop him.

I really enjoy seeing antagonists that are menacing for better reasons than kicking puppies (Esplin gets bonus points for being menacing while working to guarantee the health and security of all puppies).

** While I'm flooding this thread with posts, one remark: have you thought about updating the story's Summary? The current one worked when you had a few chapters and you needed to attract a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] audience, but by now I think everyone in that demographic knows of your story whether they read it or not. You should probably think about attracting general Animorphs fan and mainstream SF fans; the "fix/sanitize/rational agents" parts might put them off.

Instead of the current summary, I would suggest the one I posted on TV tropes:

#+begin_quote
  "You know who does have brains, though?” I continued. “The Yeerks. Maybe a thousand of them already. A thousand human brains, a thousand slaves, except those slaves can't even think without their masters knowing about it. There is nothing standing in their way except us---did you get that? This isn't some movie, where humanity's going to rise up and pull some bullshit trick out of its ass. The Yeerks are /winning/. Did you not see Elfangor get eaten? Do you not understand the stakes? He was coming to /destroy the planet/ because he thought that might be the only way to stop them."
#+end_quote

(I really, really love this rant)

I think it establishes most of what you need in a few sentences:

- This an Animorphs story. The main beats of the premise (the kids met Elfangor and got powers, Elfangor died, the Yeerks control brains) are explained or implied.

- There's a first-person narrator.

- This is a retelling (as opposed to a cross-over or a fix-fic or a shipping fic) that starts around the time Elfangor gets eaten.

- The characters are really angry and terrified, and the Yeerks are freaking dangerous. They might actually win if the heroes don't pull their weight.

- The characters are rational, not because they're smarter, but because they take the time to think through the implications of their situation and their actions, and discuss them out loud. (which is something canon did really well when the author bothered)

It doesn't include the "morphing animals" part, but I think that's okay; because it's better to keep the blurb short, and because morphing animals is kind of secondary in the fic anyway.

** Delighted to see this story back.

Not entirely sure what the implications are of the opening segment. At first, I thought it was a metaphorical passage describing Jake's slow rise from his comatose state. However, the second half (from the first /shift/) are clearly memories of Crayak. Rereading it, I strongly suspect the first half was as well.

The following passage, I think, is key:

#+begin_quote
  The bottom of the ladder, the first of a string of pearls. An oasis in the dying deep, a careless bounty of matter and energy a thousand times brighter than anything I had ever before experienced. Delirious, I drank, and drank, and drank, and then, rejuvenated, I turned my eye toward the pair of rocky planets---
#+end_quote

Matter and energy? Rocky planets? If there was any chance of all this being metaphorical, that chance is now blown out of the water, in my eyes. Especially with the second half of the segment, which is clearly about Crayak, and which also refers to something which consumes stars and planets.

With that in mind, this is what we learn of Crayak:

Crayak is stranded on a planet (the bottom of a deep, black gravity well), as stars are born and die and are born again, though fewer and lesser with each iteration. Desperate, they use up the planet's resources to escape the gravity well and launch themselves towards a nearby star. At one point, a rock drifts past, and Crayak is forced to eject half of themself to stabilize their course. Eventually, Crayak reaches the star, filled with energy and matter, and eats it all, before turning towards a pair of rocky planets.

There we reach the first /shift/. The narrative fractures from there, but some details can be picked up. A planet wrapping itself around a star. A scarlet shadow spreading throughout the galaxy, stars dimming and dying in its wake. Strange creatures howling as their skies go dark. Each of these, I think, are signs of Crayak consuming all they can reach. A monstrous eye atop a throne of metal: the canonical appearance of Crayak. And various other details, which I'm not sure how to interpret, other than to consider them Bad News (the thing in the lake, the nightmare in the web).

My Anticipated Percentages:

Odds that the first scene here describes part of Crayak's past: 90%

Odds that the first scene here describes the past of another, non-Crayak entity: 8%

Odds that the first scene here is nothing more than Jake recovering from his coma: 2%

Odds that the half shed by the Crayak turns out to be the Ellimist: 15%

+Odds that I'm sad about Garrett's fate: 100%+ Misread the chapter, thought that Tom hadn't had his morph to bring back.

** You know, it's funny, with how far apart the chapters are, I keep forgetting how much I like this series.

Like, if you'd asked me two days ago, I would have said that /The Reckoning/ is maybe my 3rd favorite ongoing serial, after /Worth the Candle/ and /Ward/ and ex-aequo with /Practical Guide/ and, you know, /Girl Genius/ is pretty good too, etc.

Now? /Holy shit/ this is good and I've missed it! My ever-unsatisfied thirst for more Animorph stories is quenched for a few weeks yet again.

I think this is one of the "all the dominoes have been set up, now we push the first one" situations ("except the first one was two weeks ago and meanwhile you've been in a coma"). I really like that the fic goes into details of the logistics of setting up an open worldwide invasion. And that it's avoiding really hard the trap of Americano-centrism, and being very international instead. The parts about blackouts, confiscating nukes and oversight deals felt very real in particular.

I do hope we get a chapter or an interlude showing either the international politics or the street-level chaos from up close. This something I think Wildbow does really well in his stories, for instance: connecting the big events (Leviathan attacks) to the small-scale chaos (gangs take over, people need help everywhere, field hospitals are set up, food convoys are raided, vigilante justice becomes prevalent, etc).

It's also nice to get all our protagonists back in a way that doesn't really take away from the last two cliffhangers. The answer to "How did the group get out of this jam, how did Tobias get away, and how will Rachel survive?" is "Nope, they all died and had to be resurrected (out of cancer patients, no less) from old back-ups who don't remember the last 10 chapters of the story."

In a way, this is positive! Tom could pass along all the information they forgot (while getting back to side character status), and since they're fresh out of Ventura, they're not /too/ worn out and demotivated by weeks of mostly doing nothing while the world went crazy!

I wonder if they'll make another broadcast. "Screw you, Esplin, we're /still fucking/ alive!" (probably not)

** Yes yes yes yes! So happy to see this again! Thank you so much for writing this.

Like you, TK17Studios -- as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, -- I stamped Animorphs onto my soul about 15-20 years ago. Not only is this amongst my top three favourite works of fiction; it's the one I'm the most attached to for sure.

I'm super keen to see what happens next and I've been immensely worried about how dire the situation has been. Especially the whole time the ticking-David-shaped-time-bomb was right there. Now, as dire as things are, it seems like there's the possibility of hope.

What I don't get, probably because I don't have CouteauBleu‘s memory related super-powers, is why they didn't keep doing the morph circle thing. Even if some of them had to mark themselves off-limits at times for information security (e.g Garret and the blue box) --- in which case update-acquire-only. Is it seen as too close to killing & death of an intelligent mind?

** Does the information given in this chapter (insofar as Marco/Ax are reliable/able to understand the blue box tech) that morphing doesn't operate "just" off DNA (scars copied, stored morphs' most recent states (i.e. wounds) constantly updated) confirm that there's some sort of Miracleman shenanigans going on? Are they copying/uploading entire bodies to the Z-space cloud, and swapping them while maintaining continuity of consciousness via the inherent Yeerkiness of the blue box tech? It seems so, since morphing into a human puts you in control of a sapient entity with a "consciousness switch" you can toggle.

Wouldn't this imply that morphing into a human, allowing the human to be conscious for the two hours, demorphing, and then remorphing into that same human would maintain the new state of the brain, since the morph's memory of those two hours and the associated physical changes to the brain would be maintained across morphs? Or does the tech disallow this for some reason (inherently treats sapient creatures differently, maybe via mandatory memory wipes)?

(I've yet to do a reread of this fic, so forgive me if this has been asked/answered or if I'm way off base due to already established info I missed/forgot.)

Also, did Jake's (wonderfully confusing, well done!) Crayak pseudo-premonition confirm that the Yeerk race has some sort of extra-dimensional properties due to it being an offshoot of the greater Crayak entity (as another poster interpreted the "course correction" to be)? That would make a lot of sense, if true: Yeerk matter is part of the blue box tech because it's necessary to interact across dimensions. Visser Three is able to operate remote bodies because he's exploiting the dimensional stuff to bypass the "real" dimension's restrictions re space and time. And maybe Visser Three is freaked out about the Varynx (sp) because it's some sort of Crayak-based recovery process/error correction that's working to reconstitute his lost mass via "killing off" the Yeerk race.

Perhaps Crayak is soon to make an appearance on Earth, since it's about to be the biggest concentration of Yeerk in the universe? I could see that as a way to throw out a common enemy that'd dig the Animorphs out of the hole they're in, plus it'd make them relevant beyond the whole "power of the human spirit" trope since they've got some kind of Ellimist-given ability to directly gather info on space Satan.

(Also, Howlers confirmed! I hope they make an appearance because I'd love to see TK17's take on a race of uplifted, genetically-engineered murderhobos. They're basically space sharks, IIRC.)

*** There's no canonical answer as of yet as to whether the Yeerks can even use morphing tech (though I've previously speculated that they probably should be able to). The main issues seem to be:

1. A given Yeerk dissolves entirely into the coalescion, and so any nanotech that was trying to hang onto brain matter will have a hard time reassembling.

2. The control tissue /is/ Yeerk tissue, so if you're morphing into a Yeerk in particular ... can Yeerk control Yeerk? I think the control structure would just break down entirely, which might be catastrophic if you're then getting basically randomized inputs into bits and spots of a larger Yeerk mass.

Still might be worth trying compared to dying.

** Long time reader, then [[/r/rational][r/rational]] lurker, and now Patreon supporter, here. I just wanted to leave some comments and thank you for such an enjoyable story! Animorphs has always been close to my heart and, after HPMOR, so is rational writing. You're seriously killing it with this series.

I'm continuously impressed by how consistent the quality of your writing is and how consistently engaging the plot is. Talking about this chapter specifically, I think many rational narratives fall prey to long and tedious internal/external conversations, but yours flow naturally and are very well-paced. There is enough subtext within the conversations to keep me engaged and thinking, but not so much that I have to pause, go back and re-read, or try to decipher cryptic comments. It makes the characters feel more real.

The plot/tone shift in this chapter is really refreshing. So much has changed for the characters seemingly overnight (or between chapters, to us readers) and they've essentially been given a second chance after losing badly. It feels like an Act 2 ending, and I think that helps the overall flow of the story arc - we needed some sense of where we are at in the story, and to know that it's progressing. We've been lacking some of that in the past 10 chapters or so.

One change that you might consider: [ "The meteor-" I began. ] made me think Jake was referencing the Ventura asteroid, which made me confused for a bit. It's been easy to forget the "threat" of the Andalite meteor since we, as readers, know it's not actually a threat, and the fact that Jake's been reset caused some dissonance. Maybe changing to ["The Andalite meteor-" I began.] might help? Or maybe I'm just singularly slow on the uptake regarding that part.

As for major experimentation, they were in a stone-age mentality despite having plenty of spare compute lying around. They just hadn't really gotten around to thinking of it, yet (and didn't have a wide variety of native species to try it on).

** Hi, longish time reader (started early last year) and first time commenter here.

I'll admit that early on I had some bones to pick with the series, especially compared to the original. The characters seemed a bit too different, and I felt a bit mixed about trying to make Animorphs uniformly serious.

But over time I've started to strongly enjoy this series, mainly because of the very inventive reworking of the backstory and technology. The rationality doesn't hurt either. The “flaws” I mentioned in the previous paragraph stopped feeling like a big deal once the Visser arrived on Earth and Australia sent 10,000 boomerangs to South Korea.

Regarding the current chapter: these Animorphs are insanely resilient: immortal even. But these versions of the Animorphs don't remember the “real” Animorphs' last moments, which could make things a bit odd if Marco learns about Visser One and immediately dies several times.

If humans are building Yeerk equipment there could be plenty of places on Earth to find spare rays. Of course Visser Three would be expecting that, if he knows Temrash is still alive.

Not really related to this particular chapter but do Hork-Bajir seers exist in The Reckoning?

Eagerly awaiting the next chapter. Keep up the good work!!

  “What if we tried morphing a Yeerk again?”

  Marco had finally come up with a theory for what had happened, the one time that Garrett had attempted it.

  The morphing tech scans, he'd said. It doesn't just run off DNA. Look at your scar, or how long our hair and fingernails are. But I think---I think if the scan gets interrupted for some reason, the morphing tech tries its best anyway. Tries to extrapolate from DNA alone. And if a single Yeerk is like a finger---

  ‹We considered it. But the danger is too great. The body would be large enough to produce kandrona, but there is no guarantee that Temrash would be able to reemerge after the sharing. We do not know how a---a feral coalescion, a primal one, would behave. We could be lost forever within it---›
#+end_quote

Found a probable solution: they could always have someone morph a feral Yeerk pool/sludge ball and then /eat/ them. Of course, the Andalite's warrior culture combined with the communal nature of the Yeerks makes this an unethical solution, but it would likely work if these characters were willing to get their hands dirty.

Maybe we'd get a cheap method of undoing the loss of several major characters, restoring the status quo. Maybe we'd have to reckon with a reduced cast of two-ish still-living characters, with the full weight of the last two chapters hanging heavy over us. Neither extreme was desirable.

Somehow you managed to find a solution that avoids /both/ problems, flows naturally from the existing state of things, and even reckons with the extended hiatus of the series.

** Whaaaa - it's back! I ... don't really have much to say right now, since the story has been out of my mind for so long. Great chapter. I'm happy the characters were all resurrected, and in a way that makes complete sense and doesn't diminish the impact of what happened in the past two chapters. This is still my favorite rationalist story.

** I'm very back-logged on my reading, and just got to this... but you said comments help so I guess I just want to confirm that I'm reading and enjoying and this is always /so good/

Intricate plot and the passage of time mean I'm almost certainly missing things and forgetting things, so I'm going to have to read it all again at some point... I'm sure I'll enjoy it even more when read clean through at a pace that allows me to make all the connections.

** OMG, now Cassie is truly gone? No one even has her as morph? That makes no sense with the Ellimist's involvement. He would have predicted exactly what would happen to her when he manipulates her choice and she stays. Why would the Ellimist go out of his way to get Cassie killed?

Perhaps her mind is still floating around somewhere? When the minds run on some kind of Ellimist-Crayak-network, they should be protected from damage to the original and morph body.

Who still has an Elfangor morph? Has Ax one?

This David fucked them even more than canon David. Why would Marco want a psychopath to join the team? That is not very rational.

How can Earth have a Z-space monitoring system like Serenity when the Yeerks or Andalites do not have it? There Z-space tech should be better in any way

I just read it all in three days, skipped some work. Thought it was a finished story. Fanfiction said published in 2012 :/

*** Cryptic responses: - No one has Cassie's morph. - No one has Elfangor's morph (Ax learned to tolerate it, but he still had essentially religious objections to morphing Elfangor himself). - Marco's mind was interfered with. ctrl+f "fleeting disorientation" - The Serenity system wouldn't work anywhere else in the universe; it only works because of the rift around the system reflecting signals back.

Sorry; it's definitely actually gonna get finished, but I don't know precisely when.

That is so sad

Cassie was my favorite Animorph in the originals

#+begin_quote
  Marco's mind was interfered with. ctrl+f "fleeting disorientation"
#+end_quote

Then that is what someone (Visser 3?) meant with manipulated memories and never morph again during the hypersight?

#+begin_quote
  The Serenity system wouldn't work anywhere else in the universe; it only works because of the rift around the system reflecting signals back.
#+end_quote

But what if they get multiple Serenities and place them around the system like GPS satelites around Earth?

Also, Rachel never says she is Xena anymore?

Will you write about The One?
