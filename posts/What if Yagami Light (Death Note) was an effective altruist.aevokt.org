** Used effectively, the Death Note isn't so much an assassination tool as it is a mind control tool that happens to have the unfortunate side effect of killing the targets.

If Light's wants to wipe out crime, then targeting probable criminals for whom there isn't enough evidence to convict is ridiculous. Instead he should have the heads of terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and the like, all experience bouts of guilt, turn themselves in, share detailed records of the names, faces, and locations of their subordinates, and then commit suicide in jail.

The effectiveness of such a campaign would be boosted by cooperating with government agencies, but it might be difficult to do so without those agencies obtaining the Death Note, which would be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO][potentially disastrous]].

--------------

A less gruesome use of the Death Note is as a form of euthanasia. And this may have the beneficial side effect of extending other people's lives. One of the rules of the Death Note is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  A human death caused by the Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other human's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a particular person's original life span in the human world.
#+end_quote

Combined with the fact that "A god of death can extend their own life by putting a name on their own note, but humans cannot.", this suggests that the stolen lifespan is randomly distributed to another human. So Euthanasia can redistribute lifespan from those who don't want it to someone who, statistically speaking, likely does.

This also calls to mind some sort of dystopian nightmare where the lifespan of humans is harvested from toddlers to make the rest of humanity immortal. Like how fetal souls are farmed for fuel in Worth the Candle, but significantly more horrific because the Death Note can't kill someone until 780 days after birth.

Hrm, and the sacrificed children would have to actually have the potential to live long lives absent the Death Note intervention, or else the Note can't harvest their counterfactual lifespan. So there would have to be facilities to raise them, kept mostly empty except for randomly spared 'calibration children'. It would be interesting to read a story from such a child's perspective.

*** The part about lengthening the lifespan is more in the case of, if Light kills a murderer who would later go on to murder Misa on the 1 January 2010, then Misa lives past the 1 January 2010 and instead will die on, say, the 1 January 2018. This has extended her lifespan even though Light didn't intend this: the 8 extra years doesn't "come from" the murderer, it just appears out of nowhere, AFAIK. I don't believe the "conservation of lifespan" that Death Gods operate under applies to humans at all, canonically.

/Is/ this a dystopian nightmare? I mean, arguably small children are less intelligent than livestock we routinely murder for food. Arguably, preserving sentient self aware adults who have been around for centuries is a higher cause. You know, if you had to. And you would ideally gene edit the small children so they are all born with microcephaly and use artificial wombs if you can so there's no mother or father to be emotionally attached.

Is there an optimal tipping point of personhood where you get maximum life value for minimal evil?

​

the deathnote requires a face and a name, so I suppose you need the fetus to develop at least so far as to be recognizable as an individual, and give it an identifier.

**** The logistics of collecting the children for slaughter would be pretty dystopian.

Parents tend to get pretty attached to their children, and you're unlikely to get enough donations for the system to work. In particular you need to worry about the effect of slowing death on population growth and reign in births accordingly so you're talking about confiscating children by force.

​

And preserving adults at the expense of children is likely to lead to social and genetic stagnation. It would probably be strictly worse for the human species than the status quo in the long run.

**** Refer to my quote above. That rule is canon, but unknown to the characters in the story.

Also, consider this: /The Shinigami are not actually gods of death./

The vast majority of deaths happen without their influence. They don't shepherd souls to any afterlife. They barely have any power to influence the world at all.

What they are is a species of magical parasite. They sit around and occasionally drain some lifespan if they are about to run out.

So the Death Note's primary cosmic function is as a feeding tube for shinigami. A magical lifespan transfer device.

Why should this primary function stop working when the book is brought to earth?

****** True. And like I mentioned in another comment, the lifespan being lost into the aether is more likely to be what the author intended.

My point is just that there are textual elements which suggest conservation of lifespan as a plausible mechanism, even for human users.

Plus, it's an interesting hypothetical.

/Edit/: I'll add that my headcanon is that the reason shinigami die when they save someone is that their lifespan gets transferred out of them. And that humans are similar enough to shinigami to use the Death Note and benefit from transferred lifespan, but different enough that the targetting mechanism gets messed up. But that's complete imagination on my part and has no textual support.

I like [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans][Eliezers answer]], though I don't know that I fully agree with it.

If you really pushed me on it, I would say something along the lines that, yes, there is a moral distinction between killing people and letting them die and sacrificing someone else for the greater good is not a morally defensible decision.

That said, you can always make the thought experiment dramatic enough to make my intuitions flip the other way (sacrifice one innocent guard to prevent an omnicidal villain from getting to the nuclear launch codes), so my position is mostly that I don't really know and that we shouldn't judge people being put into impossible decisions whichever way they go.

#+begin_quote

Me personally? Definitely not. I don't have the stomach for using a weapon that powerful in a consistent enough manner to yield net utility for the world, so even from an extremist utilitarian position I would reject using it. Can I imagine a mostly good, mostly rational character that would decide to use the Death Note? Yes (and I would read the hell out of that story).

Although Eliezer meant it differently, this has long been the crux of the matter to me with a lot of these thought experiments. The situations they use don't embody the pure, crystalline dichotomy that is being claimed. Then people add things like the fat-man variant, where a random person asked the question is going to be influenced, likely subconsciously, by a whole lot of aspects that are then projected by academics onto unqualified claims about utilitarianism and deontology.

Sticking to likely, relatable models seems a lot truer to me, like discussing sending people to war, or experimental variants; [[https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/psychologys-trolley-problem-might-have-a-problem.html][one article I found that talks about a mice study]] points out:

** The problem is that, contrary to famous historical figures, death solves very few important problems. Effective altruism is aimed at doing good most efficiently, so death note isn't a great tool for it.

Many of the people you might think to kill first, are /also/ holding things together while they're awful. Western capitalist republics and all the high living standards they have aren't the result of a mere lack of dictators. Rather they're the result of a cultural value system that most people in the west share. People on both right and left generally agree that we have a right to life liberty and pursuing our individual happiness. We generally agree that individual freedoms/autonomy are important even when we disagree on specifics. We generally agree that all people have value and some minimum amount of 'human rights' even when we disagree what exactly those rights should be. We generally praise people who work hard, are frugal, and are generous towards others.

Kill a dictator creating a power vacuum in a country which has neither these shared values, nor the prosperity required to allow the vast majority of people to survive /while being virtuous/ (i.e. not stealing to eat), and you won't get our results. Unfortunately you can make very little headway towards instilling virtues and a culture that leads to prosperity with death.

If it were me, I'm not even certain that I'd use it to say, kill all the radical terrorist imams. If I were aggressive and successful enough, maybe it slow their roll a bit, but it's not a long term solution because killing them doesn't destroy the philosophy. So in a few decades when I'm not paying attention, the ideas will come back and I won't be around to stop them--then what? The antidote to bad philosophy can only be a convincing case for good philosophy.

If not terrorist leaders and dictators, who else do we know the names of that we could righteously kill? At best you're playing The Punisher and killing people after their crimes. But you're not solving the problems that create more criminals.

Life is suffering /by default/. If you wake up naked and alone in the woods and every person and human creation has been removed from the planet, you're going to have a bad time. Death is just the capstone on that suffering. Most people aren't so evil that early death is a solution in any but the most cynically twisted way.

*** I think the context makes this different to traditional assassinations or warfare. If corrupt leaders reliably commit suicide writing "I REPENT" in their own blood, it will have an effect.

On top of this, attacks can have a protective role. One of the major inhibitors of good people in bad societies is simply that the bad people aren't afraid to use violence, and jail or kill their competitors. God's wrath descending on the perpetrators is at the very least going to act as /some/ kind of protection against this, and likely legitimize those protected by it in the eyes of the populace.

The "only words can fight words" thing is an addictive phrase, but I think we've seen a fair bit of evidence that actually you can fight philosophies with bullets. The thoughts don't live in the air, or even the books, they have to be carried and transmitted through human brains, and if you take out the right ones you stop the spread. This is especially true from extremes like "kill all the radical terrorist imams".

** If Yagami was an effective altruist, he would've realised that treating the symptoms doesn't cure the disease. He's a lone actor, and he has to be a lone actor due to the murderous nature of his power. That in mind, if he uses the note at all, it is best done as a method to discretely give himself enough wealth to begin distorting the world in his favour via the conventional means of bribery and corruption, and then to use the note to take out major locii of organized criminal networks. Beyond this, targeted execution of certain politicians may have a beneficial effect. Also, he could probably edit society's preferences by using the note to exacerbate problems in media-sensational ways. Suppose Light wasn't to end the Yakuza. Then, he could use the death note to cause a bunch of them to do something outrageous to Japanese sensibilities, while remaining sufficiently within the baliwick of things that it is concievable a Yakuza gangster would do. Perhaps Light believes that weapons are too accessible: he can streamline stricter regulation by scheduling a spate of successful knife and sword attacks in preschools.

There's all kinds of levers to move society in a Death Note, if you're rational enough to consider it's potential, and disgusting enough to actually use them. The lesson for us here is that Light was a Level Hollywood Intelligent character.

  Light: At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking.

  Ryuk: But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left.

I think it's /kind of/ ambiguous, depending on how many people you think Light killed before he got to this end state that he more or less stays in through the whole series, but if there's a character arc there, a corruption through the use of the Death Note, it's mostly implied, and contained entirely within that first episode. "Power corrupts" certainly doesn't seem to be the driving theme of the show to me, because Light is a megalomaniac basically from the end of the first episode onward, and debateably before that.

******* that sounds exactly like he starting down a utilitarian path. get rid of all the criminals through obvious ways and undesirables through accidents.

​

wanting to make the world a better place (same goals as EA and hes very rational) through the use of force (the death note) is inevitably going to lead down a path of corruption. it doesn't matter how good your intentions are, or even how rational you are.

​

the path starts the moment he decides that hes going to make the world a better place through the killing of others. when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail. when all you have is a death note everyone looks like they should die.

​

the rest of the show is just the inevitable consequences of the first episode, and Ryuk knows this. he knows that the moment a human picks ups the book it brings misery and death to the user and everyone around them. this power can only end in death and destruction. the end is preordained and its only the journey that is interesting.

​

at first he starts with criminals and saving people then the second a problem shows up he immediately tries to solve it with the death note. he knows L isn't bad he knows the cops aren't bad but he kills them anyway because he is going to do good in the world and they are stopping him therefor they are bad. your with him or your against him.

​

i think the main issue is that he hasn't gone meta. the medium is the message. its the way we go about solving problems that matters not just the problems themselves.

​

you cant solve the worlds problems by forcing it. you try to kill to solve problems you create a world where people kill to solve their problems. change comes from within.

​

sure you can give me a examples where violence solves problems but in general (there are probably lots of real life edge cases) you are probably creating more problems then you are solving. your solution is worse than the problem.

​

sure hes got flaws who doesn't? what separates the normal person from becoming a tyrant is that they have to contend with others. if a power dynamic is overly tipped to one side then the one with the power will not care about the other. there is no reason to, from a game theory point of view.

​

sure you can give exceptions people with power who doesnt abuse it but it is the exception the proves the rule. a good tyrant is a rare thing.

​

anyway the way i see it is that the whole show is about his journey down this path, starting as a model person and ending with making the whole world a worse place.

** Honestly I would start by writing down every dictator's name in the book, starting with those dictators who live in a quasi-democratic country and are trying to make their countries even less democratic. This lack of political stability is what's causing severe poverty and slow economic progress in many developing nations. Not to mention that they tend to resort to severe repression in order to maintain their power.

So first on the list would be people like Erdogan, Poland's prime minister, Viktor Orban, etc. Going after criminals is small potatoes and not really worth your time. Besides, by keeping the number of victims somewhat small you can vary the causes and times of death enough that even if people realize that evil leaders are dying, they wouldn't be able to notice a pattern in terms of who the killer is. Unlike with criminals, every leader's pictures are well-known and published by multiple newspapers and magazines so people might not even realize you need both a name and a face to use the Death Note.

It's a random idea which could come across as a) supernatural or b) a reason for an unusual circumstance. A bunch of people dying of heart attacks is suspicious, and people look for a reason. 'A zombie virus spreading through the mob' comes with a 'reason' - virus spreads between people in close contact, and now people are looking for the answer to a different mystery - where did the zombie virus come from? This also has the benefit of having some of the people on the list go after other people - less 'heart attacks' and more 'zombie attacks'.
