I've been thinking about alien intelligences, especially those with blue and orange moralities, and the sort of cognitive biases they might have. Especially those biases that humans wouldn't have. Mostly as just an idle musing, but I'd still like to throw the question out there.

A few example "aliens":

- Classical Fae, with their insanity to break contacts and inhuman goals.
- Singletons, like those stories where a single cooperative intelligence evolves in an ecosystem, instead of multiple competitive ones.
- Collective Swarm Intelligence, like the zombies in a hero's war or any number of sci-fi robot swarms that get smarter as the swarm grows larger.
- People living in the UNSONG world with it's weird causality.
- Nature Spirits.

Thoughts?


** It's best if it comes organically out of their evolutionary origins. A lot of human biases and instinct come from our social/tribal nature, ingroup/outgroup dynamics, and natural apophenia/pareidolia.

So if your aliens' ancestors were solo predatory hunters, for example, they might have a bias towards instinctive attacking of perceived weakness, or an over-inflated sense of their own correctness.

Herd ancestors might lead to instinctive group consensus, where regardless of the correctness of the argument, you can't convince one unless you convince all.

*** +1.

Most of our biases are useful - in a caveman environment. They're only now harmful because our society advanced faster than we evolved. Many are vestigial heuristics.

So the simplest way to imagine new ones is to create a relatively sudden change in the alien society, and see how tools that used to fit well are now sub-optimal or harmful.

Considering the fae for a moment:

- Perhaps they only recently (oh, a few millennia ago) encountered humans, and are still caught off-guard by their willingness to lie and break their word. Say this results in something like the planning fallacy that applies when considering what others will do. Maybe they're consciously aware of it, but it can sneak up on them.

- Ruled by a Great Fae King for untold aeons, he has recently disappeared. They have since learned to cope, but a lack of initiative remains - they're more susceptible to suggestion than you might expect from a human. Something like an inverse bystander effect - they're /really/ easy to command in groups, which has good and bad sides.

I'm not feeling very creative at the moment, but I think I made the idea clear enough. Some aspect of the world used to be one way, and it's now different - but the aliens have not fully adapted to that change. Maybe it's resource scarcity (hi, obesity epidemic!), or a parasitic species turned symbiotic but still causes distaste... etc.

Also, the way I imagine it, it's not so much them not figuring out lying as having an unconscious bias to not take it into consideration.

It's not very hard to come up with an evolutionary path where "estimating completion time" isn't important at all.

In this particular instance, the over confidence bias is part of the reproductive strategy. It only becomes problematic now that the species is sentient and more social than in their ancestral environment.

When an idea is based upon the assumption of a particular evolutionary path being plausible then it /can/ actually be wrong, since evolution is still an orderly process that follows high level emergent rules. For instance barring some very particular circumstances (like social insects or gender changing animals) species will have gender parity due to Fisher's principle.

************ I think you read a lot more into a thirty second comment than I ever meant.

Just because I said they were overconfident does not mean they don't know how to back down.

I was thinking specifically of sentient online communication, absent our normal in-person sensorium.

Of course they'd back down, unless they didn't. Maybe they're an r-type strategy in which perma-death is not detrimental to the overall species. A semi-hive mind with individual volition, but overall synchronicity of purpose.

Basically, I was thinking what if Reddit were cats.

They hunt solo, but congregate in groups. An individual cat will step up and get his ass kicked in public, and yet that doesn't really stop him from doing it again and again. There's no great harm other than to reputation, and every now and then you can win an otherwise pointless conflict for great societal success, but mostly you're just ignored.

No worries. It's all in fun.

**** Which is why subverting or altering these needs results in some amazing alternate morality and points of view.

The buggers in Enders game for example with their views on murdering scores of humans (no more amoral from their point of view then disarming an enemy).

In another book (can't remember the title), the main aliens have had faster than light travel for generations, a part of their 'self' is stored in an organ which even after death can travel a specific distance in a sort of astral projection. FTL spaceships literally use ancestor relay to communicate. Every first contact they have ever experienced has consisted of the other aliens trying to murder them and their ancestors! (ie, radio communication being seen as an attack instead of communication).

Just off the top of my head, some great alternate needs:

- Memory is stored in dna and can be consumed and exchanged relatively easily. Fights of dominance, child rearing, etc all result in sharing less or more of these memories...by eating the flesh of the other being. The conflicts this would cause at first contact are obvious.

- An ecosystem where radiation is so high and so constant, but importantly something that slowly rose over the evolutionary history, that all life on this planet has multiple sexes beyond the two since it's needed for the redundant error correction. this results in more than just the 'fight and nurture' specialisations of our genders. You could have fight, feed/clean, educate, protect, etc etc splits and the social and political roles which develop from that.

- Vastly split time scales for two species interacting. One species is essentially formed through the gestalt reaction of mosses and slimes and so focuses entirely on food gathering and harvesting, long term goals for this species might be converting dry plains into swamps. this would be seen as something they do for the their 'day' but the other species 'year'. Their sense of time is just so long that days are mostly ignored. the other species might experience something closer to our time sense, the conflict there is easy to see.

in general, if you want a blue/orange morality instead of a white/black morality (as we know it), you /need/ a significantly different biological/structural/social system with a bias towards the more fundamental structural changes (biological/life cycle) side.

** I'd ask the question "What is so often true for these aliens that considering it is a waste of time?", or, "What situation is extraordinary for these creatures?"

Sounds fun. Let's go down the list.

Classical fae might have a bias against even attempting to understand the goals of others; goals are always inscrutable, so why would they ever learn to understand each other's machinations? Communication isn't about conveying information, it's about pulling levers. RPGs and alcoholics anonymous aren't going to make sense to this species (How does talking help? What use is acknowledged fiction?) They won't be offended by misleading statements like humans are, since they expect that sort of thing, and if you mislead one it won't trust you any less than before. Quiet individuals are stupid individuals to the Fae, and the chatty are intelligent or trying to give that impression.

Singletons won't invent battle tactics or weapons for use against rival intelligence. Game theory for them might be as difficult as keeping track of thousands of body parts would be for us. Imagine trying to explain the difference between socialism and capitalism to such a creature: natural order for the individual and... what even?! Won't the smartest one kill or enslave dumber animals invariably? It's going to have a massive bias against any work that requires multiple entities. Having another entity to work with isn't something it's experienced--expect it to forget to inform you of its intentions, even if it joins your fleet.

For the biases of swarm intelligence, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]]. Even if it conceptualizes that intelligence can occupy a single body, it might not (for example) get why a human freaks out about losing a limb when it has three good ones remaining. The status-quo bias will be absent in this species; a fatal risk doesn't cost it all of its reproductive capacity, so it will be more adventurous than humans. It might also be biased to respect others that are physically larger, even more than humans; for it, size is the most direct measure of power in every sense. When it sees a clothing store, it will think the mannequins are a deception about strength or popularity, not a mere device for displaying clothes.

I'd expect more folks in UNSONG to be good at programming. Invoking a function is a fundamental property of their universe. They might identify with roles and persona more strongly than people of our world; the spelling of the word determines its effects, the title of person determines who they are, that sort of thing.

Nature spirits... depends on the specifics, but when was the last time you tried talking to a fly in your room to get it to leave? Cooperation and communication could be the first solution in use by a nature spirit, and if an obstacle won't move itself it might as well be immovable. I don't think they'll have the stereotypical bias against technology, however. Tech to them is like rocks to us; so irrelevant that it takes deliberate effort to notice it. Will the threat of technology be salient to them? Well, people still live near Yellowstone.

** I find swarms fascinating, so I'll dip my brain cells in this topic:

- We become incomprehending towards bigger scales. Those swarms could have an opposite bias, focused on bigger quantities, while ignoring small numbers.

- Swarm itself is all that matters, so individuals (even genius ones) are worth nothing compared to more computational power.

- A natural tendency of sub-groups of the swarm to specialize.

- The more use there is to a skill, more protection/priority it's group will get.\\
  A swarm that's constantly hunted will forget most things besides avoiding said hunts.

- Since it gets smarter with size, it could automatically start doubting it's previous knowledge, even if it's based on solid data.\\
  Same goes to opinions of other swarms, if they are smaller. Small is dumb, which could apply to humans as well- a big rally looks smarter than a lone professor.

- The size bias could lead to posturing. If a swarm feels threatened, it could spread out, to pretend it's bigger than it is.

- IQ is useful in survival, so it will always strive to have more members, even when upkeep costs could start to be debilitating.

- But increasing the number of moving parts increases the chance of it becoming mentally ill or outright broken (especially if new part is... contagiously persuasive). So probably a... safety-of-new-parts bias. It will be more, not less, reluctant to absorb different swarms or deviant individuals, even if they show promise.\\
  So a massive swarm will be disgusted (to oppose any desire for closer integration) by encountering a sprawling human civilization.

- Smaller swarms would seek independency, and in general be wary of bigger swarms (after all, once you get absorbed, it's game over for those genes).\\
  Strains of the swarms that are comparable in size could band together regardless, especially if they feel threatened by a bigger competitor.\\
  This situation, combined with a general fear of splitting up (since bigger numbers are a real strength), could lead to societies of different swarms. But that would probably come upon odd roadblocks soon enough, if not simply melding together.

Whales breaching, birds plucking out all their feathers, dogs scratching way too much, birds feeding cuckoo chicks, insects laying their eggs on any shiny surface, ants getting trapped in spirals, insects flying incessantly towards the light.

The interesting thing is that humans share some of these (e.g. picking at skin) but not others, so you get a smooth gradation from familiar biases to complex ones. And then there's some biases that you might imagine are near universal e.g [[https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/]]

** Aliens that have an evolutionary background as solo predatory hunters might have a strong bias towards respecting bigger, stronger people, to the point of instant deference. If two tigers fight in the wild, the bigger, stronger one often wins; for a sentient species evolving from such a situation, unused to doing things like working in groups to take out otherwise un-killable opponents, the idea of doing anything but flee in the face of a stronger opponent might provoke instinctive, crippling fear, and the idea of trying to outsmart or gang up on them might not be obvious.

Or interestingly, you could have a situation where a sentient species evolved intelligence, while still being preyed upon by a similarly smart predator that was specialized in hunting them. A cat and mouse situation, only both the cat and the mice are sentient. This could result in a species whose Us vs. Them instinct is always stuck on maximum, the out-group always completely de-humanised. It wouldn't matter to a Mouse species if humans were sentient or not; the Cats were sentient as well and they still killed the mice in droves. The idea of things like the Holocaust or slavery being bad would take a long time for the Mice to understand, as they would have literally started off in what was essentially a war of eradication; their culture would have begun with the genocide of the Cats. Tribalism, to them, would be the only true philosophy.

Or you could have the Cats be the winners of the conflict, and have an even more interesting situation; humans encountering a species whose survival was literally based upon their ability to de-humanise other sentient beings, with massive cognitive bias surrounding any activity that requires working with an out-group, or cross-species empathy. They would have an incredibly hard time understanding the concept of pets, and, again, wouldn't understand why things like slavery or the holocaust was wrong, as they would have evolved in a situation where exploiting and murdering other sentient beings was their main cultural norm.

**** A lot of discrimination ostensibly about color is greatly influenced by cultural markers, such as accent, clothing, etc. There are plenty of racist blind people IRL.

Cultural biases among RL blind people seem to include things like it being considered rude to enter a room without identifying yourself, trouble with snow and obstructive headgear (they greatly dampen echoes), perplexion over the obsession the sighted have with faces. When everyone uses canes, single-file is necessary, for all practical purposes, while those who don't are more likely to cluster together. I remember something about blind babies consistently hating certain positions due to how they interfere with acoustics. I recall a case where a blind couple was arrested for having sex in public, because they assumed that since they couldn't hear anyone, no one could see them. IRL Braille is politicized, between the people who don't learn it well and the abismal state of the relevant technology and general low availability (compare how things would go if everyone suddenly stopped learning to read print). Blind neatfreaks are way more anal about it than their sighted counterparts, since a lot of things too small or transparent to see are still large enough to feel on smooth surfaces. At the same time, visible stains and mars that cannot be felt would be missed.

Some of that wouldn't make sense for a whole civilization, but I expect some of it might.
