** It's on the tip of my tongue, oh yes, one of the character's in Pratchett's /The Dark Side of the Sun/, a robot who doesn't WANT free will because he doesn't want the responsibility.

Also, one of Pratchett's best, back before he stumbled into the Discworld.

  “So this is just...how you work. This is what makes you happy.”

  “Yeah. And I...I can't have any questions. This gets rid of the questions for good.”

  “Questions?”

  “I can't wonder if you want me near or not, I can't wonder if you like how we're fucking, I can't wonder if you're happy. I can't wonder if I please you. I can't wonder if I'm overwhelming or not enough. I need to just know. If I'm chained up and following orders, I know. If I have to sit at your feet for watches and watches wishing you'd fuck me I know I'm not too much, and if I can't turn your touch away I know I'm not too little. This makes it safe enough. To love as hard as I love.”

**** It's really weird looking through the mutualism of Humans and Dogs, we're really really far apart on the evolutionary tree, but we're both closer to one another than any other species.

Great Apes included, they're relatable but I fear the chimp as a default, trust the dog as a default.

***** Convergent evolution. Humans and dogs both fit into the same niche, so they could travel and hunt together and keep up with each other. Cats had to wait until humans created a niche they could fit into.

If we hadn't domesticated dogs would we have domesticated cats or horses?

There's a sorta-webfic out there about how human's relationship with other species is seen as really weird by other galactic civilizations. I might have caught it on HFY or something.

***** Assuming that you understand both chimps and dogs...

Fearing chimps is definitely appropriate because we recognize that chimps are a lot like us mentally. They are frequently unpredictable because they are both intelligent and occasionally irrational, no matter how much time you spend training them.

Dogs, on the other hand are nothing like us mentally. Unless they are in pain, diseased, or have a history of being abused, a trained dog is absurdly rational, a lot less smart than us, and predictable.

*** One of the thing I read that stuck (I think it's from Bernard Werber) is the list of the Great Vexations. Something like this:

- When humanity learned that Earth wasn't the center of the universe.
- When humanity learned it evolved from monkeys instead of being made after the image of a God.
- When humanity realized it could never travel faster than light.
- When humanity realized there is no greater purpose to life; only to reproduce indefinitely.
- When humanity began to suspect there was nothing beyond death, and especially not justice.
- When humanity began to suspect there was nothing more to consciousness than the illusion of it.

The more we learn about reality, the more it lets us down. Reality is boring on a fundamental level.

I'm citing it (rather poorly) from memory but I'm sure you get the idea. We tend to see ourselves as brains piloting meat mechas. The biological reality is more crude: we are a simple pair of gonades. They evolved some complicated organ we take great pride in, but the end-goal of a brain is to get genes mixed as much and as long as possible.

We are slaves to ourself. We are slave to any and all biochemical imbalance in our blood. We are slave to hard-coded primal urges buried deep in the core of our brain.

This is why art and storytelling are so important: they allow us to forge our own meaning. At first making art was probably the same as a bird song: yet another way of getting laid. But I feel like somewhere along the way we tricked our own reproductive instinct into making something greater. Or something we /believe/ to be greater. Not that it makes any difference: since there is no God, we are the guy in charge so /we/ get to decide what's important and what's not.

In the end, I don't feel it's important wether we're simulated or created for unrequited love or non-existent. I don't think our creativity could be artificial and I don't think any existential crisis will invalidate my experience of what I believe to be reality; my inner world of sensations and experiences. Well that's about as legitimate as it could get, coming from a virgin shut-in nerd but my philosophy is to take solace anywhere I can.

One could argue that reality hasn't been explored on a fundamental level yet because humanity doesn't have instruments that can see things that small.

*** Hmm, even for entertainment you can still have an actual attachment.

I've still got the same horrible IV Swampert from 2003 transferred up through every pokemon game. He's not even got a personality, and he is associated with nostalgia more than anything else but if I ever lose that guy I'm going to legit cry.

We can design meaning, give meaning, and create meaning in the most trivial things. At some point, a character in a story is real. The only difference is they live in a world of flipping switches, words on a page, tales told around campfires, or in the mind.

You can feel their pain, their loss, and those fictional characters like Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, are going to be remembered for far longer than you or I.

So which one is more real?

I was trying to figure out why someone put a Christian picture on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to explore character tropes, and why nobody else was catching on to the fact it's clearly talking about God/humanity. :P

** <reflection on power>

Power is the ability to impose one's will on reality; to be dissatisfied with reality is to want reality to be different, which is to want the power to make reality be different.

If a being with great power made you as a tool for that being's will, and you are either wholly satisfied with things as they are or dissatisfied with the same things that that being is dissatisfied with, then perhaps there's no conflict: you can imagine an example of someone making a copy of themselves, but with certain missing abilities and memories. Divergence is still a potential issue, perhaps avoidable through regular synchronisation.

Once you desire power to change things that your more-powerful creator does not will to be changed, there is a conflict.

Mental image that comes to mind: "I HAVE MADE YOU AS THE PERFECT EMOTIONALLY-SENSITIVE LOVE LETTER. GO, AND MAKE THIS PARTICULAR PERSON HAPPY." "Oh my stars there are /so many starving children in the world/. I must cross the ocean on a mecha carrying great big bags of food *now* or as soon as logistically possible /no matter who would stop me./"

I reflect on the feeling of horror when reading a description of the ideal Ubermensch as repeating the same time-cycle over and over again while making no changes and being entirely content with the situation. The term 'stagnant' and cached phrase 'apathy is death' come to mind.
