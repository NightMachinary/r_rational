** How do you pronounce "Special Agent Cristal", and is it audibly different from "Special Agent Crystal"?

Also, does Garnet have the Doctor's psychic paper, or does she just carry a forged FBI badge around in case she needs it?

*** Cristal is homophone of 'crystal.'

As for where she got a badge: same place she gets her swimming goggles.
