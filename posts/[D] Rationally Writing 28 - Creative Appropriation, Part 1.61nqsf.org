** Hey everyone, this week we discuss creative appropriation, aka "stealing," and the philosophy and benefits behind it. The discussion meandered a bit, but I hope you enjoy it!

Our sponsor this month is still [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php][Scrivener]], the software that helps organize ideas for writing stories, research papers, or articles.

Alex and some of my other writing friends have been using it for years, and I recently started too. It's got a lot of tools to help outline and plan out stories, in a much more visually useful and organized way than my usual slipshod method of keeping a bunch of disorganized notes on google docs.

If you want to try it out, they offer a free 30-day trial, and if you decide to buy it and help support the show, you can use the code RATIONALLY to get 20% off until May 10th. Hope you find it useful!

** Regarding your mention of /Tanya Grotter/, you may be interested to know that in ex-USSR it's somewhat of a time honored tradition to write "remakes" instead of translations. Nobody /really/ cares about /Tanya Grotter/ all that much, but there are accepted "classics", namely:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_the_Emerald_City][The Wizard of the Emerald City / Волшебник Изумрудного города]] for /The Wizard of Oz/
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buratino][The Golden Key or the Adventures of Buratino / Золотой ключик или Приключения Буратино]] for /The Adventures of Pinocchio/
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_Lagin][Old Man Hottabych / Старик Хоттабыч]] for /The Brass Bottle/ by F. Anstey
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Aybolit][Doctor Aybolit / Доктор Айболит]] for /Doctor Dolittle/

And even though it's all pretty blatant (some more blatant than others), since these were the only versions the people knew, imprinting and nostalgia are strong forces, so people would squirm and find excuses if you suggest plagiarism, e.g. /The Wizard of the Emerald City/ is at worst *very* AU fanfiction from the second book onward, not /really/ plagiarism.

There's also something similar to /My Immortal/ in infamy, if not in content, [[https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-07/lights-camera-propaganda-russias-paranoid-patriotism-gets-cartoon-movie][Kids vs Wizards / Дети против волшебников]], where you can't really tell whether it's serious raging religious nationalist anti-Rowling anti-West propaganda or a super massive troll.

*** I've heard a bit about that tradition, but I haven't read any of the titles you mention (in large part because I don't speak Russian). I've read /The Last Ringbearer/, though, which I'd definitely call a remake instead of plagiarism - would you say that's a decent representative of the tradition?

(I've also read [[http://www.young-0.com/excerpt][this translation of the Chinese /Harry Potter and Leopard Walk Up To Dragon/]], which's so bad it's good. I'm not going to even try comparing the Russian tradition to that, though.)

I'd say not. /The Last Ringbearer/ is more like HPMOR in essence, since it's a "subversive" fanfic. There are two other prominent LotR fanfictions in the vein of "Sauron did nothing wrong": [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D1%8C%D0%BC%D1%8B][The Ring of Darkness / Кольцо Тьмы]] and [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B4%D1%8B][The Black Book of Arda / Черная книга Арды]]. All three of them are published books, so you could say that they're a part of the same tradition of "legalized fanfiction". But the four titles I mentioned are more "straight" remakes of the original stories (again, some more blatant than others, the first book of /The Wizard of the Emerald City/ is the worst offender, it is almost exactly the same story, /Doctor Aybolit/ and /Hottabych/ are the least, a good lawyer probably could convince a court that they're only /inspired by/, not plagiarism, /Buratino/ is somewhere in the middle).

UPD: Forgot to say that /Kids vs. Wizards/ *is* close in spirit to HPMOR and /The Last Ringbearer/, except that it's a trash propaganda (or a troll so good, it's indistinguishable from trash propaganda).

*** Ha, that's pretty amusing. Have you read any of them by chance? Any idea how they stack up to the originals?

**** I've read all the "classics" when I was a kid, but I'm mostly familiar with the originals only by Pop-Cultural Osmosis. The accepted wisdom is that they are not cheap pieces of trash to profit on the similarity e.g. like the modern "mockbusters", but "good faith" high quality remakes, but that could be just collective nostalgia. And not to give you the wrong idea, the cycle continues to this day. You can find direct translations of the originals if you put you mind to it, but the "remakes" are still the more widespread default option for these works.

For /Tanya Grotter/ I mostly just know that it exists. Before HPMOR I was pretty dismissive of /Harry Potter/ (and I still am, I just finally finished the books to get all the references in HPMOR like the Hallows), so obviously I wasn't and isn't interested in a culturally adapted "forgery".

***** Very interesting. I'm glad to hear that they are, to many at least, considered "real" stories with their own value rather than just cultural cash-ins.
