Here's an interesting thought experiment I just came across.

#+begin_quote
  *The catalog price crosscheck.*

  To get an idea of the accuracy of the CPI for goods that do undergo significant quality changes, we can turn to another source of historical price information: old mail order catalogs. Full reproductions of historical catalogs from Sears, Wards, and other retailers are available online at wishbookweb.com . In a post I wrote a couple of years ago, I proposed this simple thought experiment: If you could choose between shopping on line today at today's prices, or buying from a mail order catalog of the past at past prices but with your present disposable income, what items, if any, would you buy from the past?

  For example, would you buy a 25 inch color television from the 1981 Wards Christmas Catalog (p. 344) at $688.88, or would you buy the Samsung 28 inch LED model that I found on Amazon for $219? Based on the 1981 price, ShadowStats would predict that a 25 inch TV should cost $7,712 today, whereas the CPI would predict that it should cost a mere $1,794. Both indexes wildly overstate TV price inflation even without allowing for quality changes, but the CPI does not miss by nearly as much.

  Maybe it is unfair to use something high-tech like a TV, so let's go low tech. How about a pair of ladies leather gloves, item A on p. 85 of the 1981 Ward's catalog, for $13. Compare them to a pair I found on Amazon for $10.70.

--------------

This might be an interesting system for a story. One advantage: you don't have recourse to ill-defined magical powers. The system is grounded in the realm of the known which might appeal to folks who prefer less fantastical stories.

Addendum: Assume you can buy a fixed value of goods from Sears each day. No immediate access to infinite money if you spot an arbitrage opportunity.


** 1937 Sears Christmas Book. 90% cotton, 10% wool full body long underwear. $2.49 per three suits ($0.83 each).

From Amazon: [[http://www.amazon.com/Indera-Mills-Classic-Union-865us/dp/B000V5CQKG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1427874009&sr=8-6&keywords=long+underwear+cotton+men+suit][here]] 100% cotton full body long underwear. $18.70 minimum per each.

I will happily take the arbitrage from buying $0.83 full body long underwear suits and reselling them for $18.70. 2253% gross return is rather more than acceptable.

*** Interesting [[/u/farmerbob1]]. I can honestly say that cotton underwear never crossed my mind.

One point. I think we should restrict ourselves to the 1985 catalogue else the difference in price due to inflation becomes too large even accounting for quality changes.

**** Without doing a real dig through the catalogs, I'd probably turn my head towards gold jewelry next. Gold prices in 1985 were around 317 dollars US per ounce. Right now they are at 1200 or so dollars per ounce. Clearly 14kt jewelry wouldn't be the best way to take advantage of the arbitrage in gold values, but the Sears 1985 catalog indicates that their jewelry is 14kt.

A jeweler that knows the jargon for gold jewelry, and knows what is selling well right now, could probably turn a tidy profit. Some jewelry styles are timeless. If I wanted to do it entirely by myself, I'd have to spend some time learning about jewelry.

EDIT Also note that there are a HUGE number of shops that will buy jewelry directly, with few questions asked. You could conceivably make a substantial profit doing this and never be noticed.

** Leather boots from Sears seem to have gone up by a factor of three or more since 1985. Other durable clothing (jackets, coats) seem to have a similar ratio. The problem with 1985 is that inflation has been unusually low since then, with post-Reagan policies holding it low and increasing inequality instead (inflation is good for equality because it targets money capital).

*** I think the lack of large arbitrage is a feature not a flaw. It alows you to tackle the problem of "What's the best thing to do with an extra $10-$20 per day?"

Optimisation done small.

**** Have you tried selling used goods in small quantities? Unless you're a killer salesman, or you have a lot of goods, you're lucky to get anything like wholesale... you're buying at 1985 retail prices and selling at 2015 garage-sale prices.

With only a 3x price difference, and no way of establishing bona fides, you're more likely to lose than profit.

If you already have a store that you can sell this stuff through, then it'd be a nice extra low-price supplier for good condition retro goods. Otherwise, I wouldn't touch the 1985 catalog for anything I wanted to shift. I might want to pick some stuff up for nostalgia value, though.

***** 3x price differences are huge. Buy boots from Sears 1985 and go to a local flea market and resell at your own table, near another clothing seller. Remember that everyone else in that facility is buying at today's prices. If you advertise a price less than what the nearby clothing seller could buy similar boots at, bam, they will probably simply walk over and buy you out right there.

Start creating a network of flea market vendors, pawn shops, and retro clothes shops that sell used goods. Remember that these boots are going to look and smell new, because they are new. A person that knows used clothing will recognize them as being valuable, and you'll be able to get a reasonable price for them.

Sure, some people will try to rip you off. The grey market's like that. You won't lose money though, unless you get the attention of the black market. Which is likely, over time. Then things would get a bit scary. Which, incidentally, would potentially make a quite interesting piece of fiction, like the original post indicates.

****** But now you're dealing with large quantities of goods if you're building up a "network". It's not "an extra $10-$20 per day" scale any more, it's a business.

******* Oh, I missed where that was added into the conversation in this thread. Somewhat odd. Why would you limit yourself to $10-$20 per day when the OP says nothing about limits other than you don't have an infinite amount of money?

If I had to be limited to $10 to $20 per day, it would then become a hunt for collectables. Action figures and other toys, shipped to me in perfect condition, in their original packaging, and then turned around on Ebay.

******** Anyway, my original point is that inflation since 1980 has really been amazingly low^{*,} especially for the kind of stuff in Sears catalogs in 1985. If you could buy cars or houses or groceries, that would be a much bigger deal. That's why an earlier catalog would be much more interesting, even if it wasn't THAT much earlier than 1985.

Note: ^{*} And this is not a good thing.

********* At the risk of starting a side argument, how is inflation a good thing? If you assume that wage-payers will also increase wages to match inflation, maybe, but I think it's safe to say that's not likely. Unless you are a top tier wage-earner. If you have a very long term investment like a house, again, that is only good if your wages increase with inflation, otherwise, the expenses of other things will make it impossible for you to maintain the long term investment.

*********** Hrm, and here I thought supply and demand drove prices. This is definitely not the place to have that conversation though.

EDIT I have to say this. Wages are an expense and therefore would impact pricing/inflation. In that, you are correct. However other things impact pricing too. Fuel cost. Other materials costs. Taxes & regulations. Automation. New processes. To link wages directly to inflation is a bit of a fragile connection. In some industries, wages are linked more strongly than others.
