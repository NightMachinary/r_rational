** This is great. Now there is no way into Callow besides the Stairway, so Cat essentially has a whole year where she is guaranteed safe from invasions from Procer. Stairway would be a bitch to assault if it were guarded by an army, so even after that Callow is fairly safe. This means Cat could (in theory) pop over to Black, Gate his whole army home to Praes, and that'd be it for the crusade, assuming they don't open up the Vales somehow.

**** I think it's the the crusade - which is distinct from the heroes - can no longer win.

I think a question there is whether the Pilgrim, in his role as an observer accompanying such a plan, would be free to try to kill Black.

*** Forgot about her being able to do that at his request.

That was the main flaw in this, to my mind, was that he's giving up every advantage he had. Chasing after the heroes means they can just turn back and pound his army, and even going the other way will likely have them show up due to the "heavens" tilting things in their favor.

Being able to Gate back if things look to grim before the fight? Perfect.

**** yeah, this is basically bonfire all over again, only better- because it isn't "evil villains pre-emptive striking civilians", it is "defending army getting trapped in hostile territory, running from superior numbers" and after playing catch with Papenheim for a while, they still can gtfo via gate. I hope this works out.

****** I disagree - the strategic thought behind bonfire was to keep Procer busy at home, instead of sending out its forces to wreak havoc in Callow/Praes. All you really need is to get your army home quicker than the Procerans can march into your country, which means you need the one gate to gtfo once they have actually pulled their forces or to wreck them if they decide to turn things into a siege contest. Until then, jumping from city to city is more impactful and efficient, but not strategic necessity, Black stealing a march and forcing Papenheim into a goose chase achieves the same objective.

******* To be honest, I'm happy Wekesa didn't see Cat after she went full-winter since he might get ideas about weaving his soul into his name. Or, if he did, he didn't notice it. I mean, Akua missed it and she was bound to Cat for a quite a while.

(Also, I just realized that /absolute positioning/ seems to be a version of Warlock's *imbricate* except with stories and narratives instead of physical parallels. Masego is definitely his father's son)

******* I'm pretty sure that any villainous Name can be upgraded to Dread Empress/Emperor, but I don't know if that's an example of a general rule allowing any Name to be upgraded, or a specific exception for a post-transition Name that can only be won by conquest.

*** Mine is that they got shifted into another plane and there continue their battle.

Likely Hell #720. Just being there doesn't give Warlock a huge advantage, so he's not signing his own narrative death warrant, but they can continue to cut loose at full power without harming either side.

** I think Black is intentionally trying to get his whole army killed, but in a way that dilutes Procer's Crusade story. This has the double effect of removing a lot of the people who would object to Cat's near certain rebellion, and helps reduce a large threat to her rule
