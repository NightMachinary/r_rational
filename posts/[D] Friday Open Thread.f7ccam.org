Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Apparently, the fanfic [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AThingOfVikings][A Thing Of Vikings]] is listed on Tv Tropes as a Rational Fic. While I do like it, how does [[/r/rational][r/rational]] view it in terms of a Rational Fic?

** I know I'm posting in the Friday thread even though it's technically not Friday anymore for most of us, but I wanted to post /somewhere/ and this didn't feel worthy of a whole thread of its own.

Recently I got caught up with r!Animorphs for the first time since The Big Hiatus. I read from the recap up through the recent Jake/Visser chapter before the rewrite happened, and then today I reread the rewritten chapter and continued on through all of what's posted. I have thoughts in no particular order. Spoilers ahead, naturally.

First, I feel a little conflicted about the scene where Marco is dying and asks Jake for a kiss. It was well-written and everything, but as a gay guy myself, I couldn't help but feel a little... uncomfortable. I /know/ how it feels to be a Marco in love with a Jake. I'm also all too familiar with how Marco obviously felt when this plot thread first came to light - his squirming discomfort at the thought of it being the center of attention, his need for it not to matter. There's this quote from the first chapter we really find out about it:

#+begin_quote
  Or worse, the whole thing could devolve into pity, patronage, condescension---could easily, accidentally, irrevocably turn into a story about Marco being fragile, being needy, being somehow less than an equal in their friendship. It could end up displacing everything else, become the thing their friendship was /about/, and things might never be the same again.
#+end_quote

This paragraph sticks out to me because it's so /real/. I've had friendships where one person was interested in the other, and there's very often this terminal sense of unevenness that settles in and kills the friendship.

Marco's dying wish being a kiss from Jake - that feels like suddenly it's "the thing their friendship is /about/." If I were Marco, asking for this would make me feel needy, and Jake's compliance would feel a lot like pity. I can't imagine I'd even /want/ a kiss from someone who's probably only doing it out of obligation. I'd also feel humiliated about /this thing/ being dragged into the spotlight, and on top of that, I wouldn't want to make Jake do something that might honestly be a little weird for him.

So that scene has been weighing strangely on my mind. (Funny how I was totally on board with the chapter where a character maybe had sex with a dolphin, but as soon as there's a straight guy doing a gay kiss, I get uncomfy... but I digress.) The rest of it, I'm loving.

I actually registered the possibility of clones back when Jake woke up after dying the first time - but I conceived it as "the group thinks x character is dead and brings them back, only for the original to resurface, and then there's two of them." I didn't consider /mass-producing someone on purpose/, lol. I'd like to know more about their little language, their numbering system, etc. Most of it was reasonably intuitive, but I couldn't crack how they assign numbers.

Rachel is having seizures and glimpsing the memories of a different Rachel. Among, y'know, other stuff - I got some vibes from that last vision that reminded me of the end of Megamorphs 4, when the fake reality is crumbling around Cassie. Presumably, the emulator in the hypercomputer still has a ghost of the old Rachel's brainstate floating around, and the streams are getting crossed somehow, so bits of that Rachel keep getting mixed in when the current Rachel demorphs. That's a /damn/ cool idea. How is it happening? Why now, with Rachel, and not with any of the other resurrectees? I'm stoked to learn more.

I can't quite decide how much of Esplin and how much of Alloran there is in Visser Three. On the one hand, he seems to have a smooth blend of memories from both in equal measure. On the other hand, he only really has the goals of Esplin. And on the bioengineered third hand... I don't actually have a third thing, I just wanted to make this dumb joke.

Ante doesn't quite have me yet. I believe he's trustworthy and strong-willed and all, but I'm not emotionally invested in him the way I am with, say, Garrett. (Whom I /love/. Garrett is a /beautifully/ realized character. I mention him specifically because, even though all the characters are sorta OC's to an extent, Garrett's the only /real/ OC. I was sad to see him get reset so far back, back to only having known the others for a month, but I of course understand that it had to be done. Ooh, /unless/ - apparently the Ellimist keeps a backup of everyone's brains even after they demorph - maybe they'll fly up to space, fight God, and redownload all the "lost" memories from their alternate selves, or something? Might get complicated for Marco....) Anyway, if Ante sticks around in a psuedo-Animorph, non-narrator capacity like Tom did for a while, that'd make sense to me, especially with him being introduced here, in the endgame. But we'll see!

That semi-Visser-hemi-Andalite-Chronicles thing with Edriss and Elfangor sounds like a ton of fun. I wonder if that will ever be explored in depth, or if there's room for a fanfic of a fanfic?

And lastly, as my train of thought peters out, I seem to have found a typo in Chapter 39:

#+begin_quote
  ‹I don't want it to---to not be okay to shout, or something,› I continued. ‹Like you're trying *to* hard not to piss me off that it---that I feel like I'm hurting you if I do.›
#+end_quote

I think that's supposed to be "so," right? Summoning [[/u/TK17Studios]] . I feel like there may have been another one higher up, but I didn't write it down :(

And now that you're reading this, dear author, I'm compelled to try (and fail) to describe how much I love this fic. It's so incredibly well-crafted, it's hard to express. I used to view fanfiction as this thing that's just uniformly /pretty bad/, and this story has proven me incalculably wrong. I wish so desperately that I knew more people who read Animorphs so I could share it with them and they'd fully appreciate it - while a stranger to the series would easily enjoy your story for what it is, they wouldn't have the background knowledge that makes it so breathtaking. You've teased a logic and symmetry out of the Animorphs universe that simply wasn't there in the original series. Every twist and turn of the story is /fascinating/, the basic writing is like candy for my brain, the characters are like people. Like /different/ people - you have this profound grasp on what it's like to live inside different heads, to think in different shapes - like, it's not just that people /have different thoughts/, but that they fundamentally /form thoughts in different ways/, like the very nature of thought itself is unique from person to person, and you've /captured that/. Your version of the Animorphs universe is such a perfect lens through which to view that concept, and you've executed it with /stunning/ deftness, in dazzling colors. I can't wait to see how it all ends, and I'll be right here with you and your characters when it does.

  First, I feel a little conflicted about the scene where Marco is dying and asks Jake for a kiss. It was well-written and everything, but as a gay guy myself, I couldn't help but feel a little... uncomfortable.
#+end_quote

"Uncomfortable" was absolutely the intended effect. I don't know if it's ever been made explicitly clear on reddit, but I'm not straight, either, and the single dominating story of my life from ages 10 to 18 was a slow-motion crash-and-burn of falling in love with my straight best friend and then everything going all to hell.

The way I envisioned this scene in my head was something like this:

- Jake is begging Marco to lighten up, let go, be vulnerable for a second, stop /taking care of everybody/ and /be real,/ dammit.
- Marco, /thinking/ that Jake is in-the-know about Marco being in love, is like, ah, fuck it, why not. He's taking Jake's emotional reaching at face value, and thinking (without words) something like, if this is literally the end, if these are my last ten minutes alive, there's one thing that I've wanted for a while that I could get, if and only if it's freely given, and he's shouting at me to let myself want things/let myself feel things, so sure, I guess I'll ask, conditional on the belief that he'll say yes /only/ if he means it. I wouldn't ordinarily ask because I'd be afraid of like guilt or pressure or weirdness or whatever, but he's right, I've been sort of seizing control by doing all the being-grown-up myself.
- Jake's face twists up in confusion
- Marco's like OH FUCK, NO, SHIT, HE DIDN'T /KNOW??/ NO, NO, CTRL-Z, I was only willing to even make the request conditional on the context of this already being a thing that we had in common knowledge and that clearly /hadn't/ warped our friendship. I wasn't signing on to make this request in a sudden, out-of-the-blue, dying-man's-last-wish context, FUCK, that's the EXACT OPPOSITE of what this was supposed to be---
- Jake, knowing Marco through and through, knowing how hard he's ... curating? ... their relationship, knowing that Marco's mind is /absolutely/ spiraling on this right now and that there's no quick way to convince him that /it's actually fine, Jesus Christ, calm down/, takes the quickest possible route to making it not-a-big-deal and shutting up that part of Marco's mind and is just like, look, dude, here. Smooch. Now let it go and bring your mind back into the present moment here with me, instead of being all inside-of-your-own-mental-model-of-the-consequences. Look at ME, buddy. I'm right here with you.

And yeah, all of that should feel /insanely uncomfortable,/ in my opinion. Like, one of those situations where they both care deeply about each other and they're both trying to do the right thing, and it's that very fact that makes everything twisted and difficult and horrifying and no, no, no, this isn't what we were trying to make happen---

#+begin_quote
  If I were Marco, asking for this would make me feel needy, and Jake's compliance would feel a lot like pity. I can't imagine I'd even want a kiss from someone who's probably only doing it out of obligation. I'd also feel humiliated about this thing being dragged into the spotlight, and on top of that, I wouldn't want to make Jake do something that might honestly be a little weird for him.
#+end_quote

Exactly. Marco mistakenly thought that Jake was trying to send the message "It's /not/ needy in this context," or maybe "It's /okay/ for you to be needy for a minute, you're /literally dying,/ stop insisting on having iron self-control literally all the time." And when he found out that this was a (slight) misinterpretation of what Jake was saying, he was extremely dismayed.

(As a side note, you might enjoy [[https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/need-dynamics-54ca9ff5955c][this nonfiction essay]] I wrote about need.)

As for the rest of what you wrote---I couldn't find many places to offer a response that wasn't spoilery or whatever, but thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. It was amazingly warm and fuzzy to wake up to this comment, and I'm so glad the story is working for you; this is the sort of thing that makes it feel like it's worth writing and I'm not just alone at a keyboard entertaining myself.

Can I ask how long you spent in the planning stages before you started writing and posting chapters? I've been playing around with a ratfic setting of my own for the past couple of months, and I think I have most of the building blocks in place to go ahead and start really writing the thing. It's got me curious how long it took you to get your longer, more comprehensive story to the same point.

***** I spent about four months thinking and planning, which was enough to get a vague sense of the whole story and a pretty solid sense of the first ... 10? ... chapters, and then I just dived in. I think this was better than trying to square more stuff away at the outset, because even though I've been frantically scrambling to keep the thing going and to keep up with plotting and planning, having only half-baked preconceptions about direction /also/ allowed the characters themselves to sometimes tell me where the story ought to go, and allowed input from readers to make things better than they otherwise would have been.

(Where we currently are in the story is me sort of pathfinding reasonable and plausible lines from the evolved state of things toward a set of events that I want to occur in the near future, which feels eerily like being the Ellimist/Crayak.)

Anyway, I know I've ironed out any possible plot holes that would require major rewrites, so this might be a good sign that it's time to dig in for real.

By the way, forgot to mention I read your essay about need when you posted it above. "Coference" is a wonderfully useful word, one that's already slipped into usage in my internal monologue, so thank you for that. I enjoyed the rest of it too.

*** "Stories that make the reader feel like everything makes sense."

Plot holes are bad because they make the plot not make sense. Worldbuilding is good because knowing the greater politics makes the story's politics make more sense. Villains are generally smart because most of the time it doesn't make sense for the BBEG to be an idiot (notably, an idiot can be an idiot, and smart people can do idiotic things /as long as it makes sense/)

It also doesn't have to make sense all the time, but if something doesn't make sense then it should make sense later with more context. (Leaving questions unanswered is slightly different. "How did Wizard-guy get from point A to point B so fast?" doesn't make sense if we don't know that Wizard-guy has a rare teleportation relic. "Who made that rare teleportation relic?" is an unanswered question that nonetheless doesn't harm the 'makes sense' of the story if something like 'any number of strong wizards from centuries ago could've made it' is an answer that makes sense in the setting).

The idea of 'making sense' goes beyond internal consistency (which we already espouse) and avoids rational-fiction-is-good-fiction because 'making sense' is only one part of the whole of narrative enjoyment and something that, to most people, can be traded away to some degree in exchange for other important qualities if necessary.

** Law school is kind of a disappointment. The classroom environment feels intellectually stifled because of a vocal minority of (in my opinion) overly sensitive and politically correct individuals.

I came to school with the hope of engaging in honest intellectual debate about divisive issues, but instead it's a bunch of virtue signalling and emotional, not intellectual, reactions.

One of my classmates posted an article about George Zimmerman suing 2 democratic candidates for defamation, right after we learned about defamation in class. He (somewhat flippantly) asked for people's thoughts on whether there was liability for defamation. A black girl took serious offense to his post and called him out for re-traumatizing the black community and a couple people piled on to agree.

I think posting the article was kind of stupid but I also think it was an honest invitation for discussion. And it was shut down hard. It's really disappointing that people assume malice instead of ignorance and are unwilling to talk and learn from each other.

Arguments from emotion aren't inherently flawed either, assuming that the subject of argument relates to how people ought to be treated. If something makes someone feel bad, that is an objective fact about reality. It's quite possible that something you assume people are irrational and overly emotional about is actually just something that personally effects them instead of just being an abstract intellectual idea they can consider with a cool distance.

Yes, but the problem is that in certain specific professions, such as law, it is inevitable to deal with subject matters that are likely to make you feel bad. Therefore, managing those feelings is essential for those in such professions, because otherwise they won't be able to perform them properly. Just like a surgeon who's afraid of blood, how can a lawyer do their job if they feel not just anger or indignation at injustice - that's absolutely fine, in fact I'd rather have that than completely amoral psychopaths - but paralysing amounts of it, enough to reject the discussion altogether? A passionate but more controlled response is to analyse your own feelings and rationalise /why/ you think Zimmerman is a piece of shit and doesn't deserve to win a single cent of restitution in this lawsuit, by the law. Or if the law actually agrees with him, where do you think its moral failures are.

I acknowledge that everyone has a very different set of experiences and I believe that sharing those experiences and learning from each other is largely beneficial. I want to learn. That's a core component of the problem that I'm facing.

The people that I'm talking about /don't/ share or teach. If your viewpoints don't align with theirs, there is no reasoned discourse to show you why your viewpoint could be wrong. They publicly shame and assume malice instead of ignorance.

I'm not saying that this behavior is absolute. It's likely that if I engaged in a 1-on-1 conversation, we would be able to have a principled conversation where both sides learned. But the default is that in classroom and group settings, some classmates speak out in a way that does not encourage learning and discussion.

Yes, some topics can be triggering. But we're literally paying to be here to learn about homicide, rape, institutionalized racism, and domestic assault. This should be an intellectual safe space, not a blanket safe space to avoid all topics of discomfort.

So, the debate arena isn't a one-on-one exchange of views. Rather, it sounds like your classmates are treating it as a spectator sport with themselves as the performers. Their aim is /not/ to persuade the person that they are debating to change his mind, because that is one person. Rather, their aim is to persuade as many members of the audience as possible to support them - gaining more supporters, albeit with weaker arguments.

Because they're trying to gain supporters /whether or not/ their position is correct (or possibly because they're trying to practice tools useful even when advocating a position that is either incorrect or too nuanced to clearly explain to a crowd) they appeal to emotion and use crowd-swaying rhetoric to support their points.

This implies that they're not interested in being correct. They're interested in being /accepted as/ correct, and cheered on by their peers.

Does this match with your experience?

**** Arguments regarding emotion are inherently flawed, even if the topic is regarding how people ought to be treated.

  If something makes someone feel bad, that is an objective fact about reality.
#+end_quote

No, the objective fact is that someone claims that something makes them feel bad. If there is an objective reality where it is fact that thing A makes person B feel bad, that reality can be indistinguishable from one where person B pretends that thing A makes them feel bad.

Even situations where it may be "obvious" quickly go into murky water. It is "obvious" that bigotry makes person B feel bad. Being called slurs for immutable characteristics is bigotry which makes person B feel bad. Being denied equal opportunity is bigotry which makes person B feel bad. Therefore, since hearing opposing viewpoints makes person B feel bad, it is bigotry.

It is worth listening to the feelings about a matter, but it is dangerous to make decisions based on a completely subjective, unverifiable, and uncontrollable variable. Arguments should be made with emotion, not be solely made of it.

This is a fallacy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent][affirming the consequent]].

PS. Good on you for "assuming malice instead of ignorance", and leaving the door open for "I'm not a homo/transphobe, I just disagree with their lifestyle choices" positions.

****** Yes. That example was crude.

A better example would be taking offense, since whether one takes offense is based on their feelings/belief structure.

As a note, arguments made purely of emotion cannot be grappled with. It's the same issue with trying to discuss religion, the statements cannot be proved or disproved.

** If anyone watches it, "rational fiction" was mentioned in episode 6 of the anime In/Spectre. I don't know if the origin is the same as how we use it here - the context it is used in is similar but not precisely identical. In the show it's mentioned when a character mentions needing to make up a believable story to deflate a urban legend that's giving power to a ghost, and thus plans to design a 'truth' that sounds both as plausible and intriguing as possible by connecting known facts about the case.

*** I'm fairly sure it's supposed to mean " A convincing/justified lie", but gets translated as "rational fiction" because of an over liter translation. I haven't checked, but this seems to be the most likely option to me.
