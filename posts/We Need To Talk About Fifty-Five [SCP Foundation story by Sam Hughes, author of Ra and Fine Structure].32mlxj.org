** At it's best, the whole of the SCP-wiki is supposed to be rational. The wiki is supposed to be rational best practices devised by very smart people who are dealing with a non-rational universe that doesn't care about them or their stupid ideas of physics. The lack of a central canon, and the desire NOT to have a good central canon after the whole Fishmonger episode, make that a little harder to find, but there are a lot of writers involved with the wiki that are as good at rational fiction as anyone here.

**** Fishmonger was an early member of the wiki who constructed the first coherent meta-narrative. He wrote a few early Foundation Tales and, amazingly enough, wove details of those stories into the SCP entries. If you just looked at the entries themselves, you could track incident numbers between multiple pages and re-assemble some of the events that had befallen the Foundation as a whole. It was an incredibly effective storytelling method that made the SCP Foundation wiki /feel/ like a living document that was being used by real people.

The downside was that Fishmonger was apparently not the nicest person to noobs and ended up feeling rather proprietary towards the wiki as a whole. When things came to a head, he decided to take his extensive pile of toys and go home, tearing the core out of the wiki. It's recovered, obviously, but is intentionally designed not to have or allow a centralized canon any more.

****** I remember the meta-narrative Fishmonger constructed being brilliant, but I wasn't around for the incident - I mostly just scanned archives about it a year ago. I have no idea what the man himself would say of the issue, to be honest.

Unless the entirety of the old guard was lying about his social issues, his reactions gutted a community for no good purpose.

** I extra-enjoyed this story and its sequel because It felt like I had read this story or one very similar before.

In fact, if the author's reading, re-submitting slight variations of the stories in a few months under a different account (with an explanation in the comments) would be a perfect. (Where "slight variation" involves things like switching character's names and whatnot)
