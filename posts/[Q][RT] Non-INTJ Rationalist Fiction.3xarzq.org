As the title indicates, I'm interested in the intersection of rationality skills and rational(ist) fiction on the one hand and personality type (using the well-known Myers-Briggs as an example) on the other. So in the interest of not over-assuming, let's break my inquiry/discussion into three inter-related questions:

1) To what extent is rational(ist) fiction or LW-style rationality as it's currently formulated/framed/practiced etc. geared towards INTJ people? My kneejerk reaction is that it is to some degree: HJPEV seems pretty INTJ, as does Taylor from Worm (sorry, those are the two stories in the gamut that I'm most familiar with); and if I remember correctly, INTx individuals made up a full 50% of the last LW census. Is this an accurate impression? Why or why not? There's obviously some value as to figuring out "how the other half lives" if ones goal is to "raise the sanity waterline"; thoughts?

2) Is there any good /rationalist/ (not just rational) fiction whose main characters would be best described as not INTx? Obviously more interesting if there is the bias I hypothesized, but an interesting question regardless.

3) More practically, how does one go about writing rationalist characters with intentionally different personality types?

Thoughts, anyone?

(Hat tip: Julia Galef's video on the difference between rationality and critical thinking.)

EDIT: There's been a lot of talk about the validity of MBTI in particular, which is interesting and useful; but I want to make clear I meant it as an example. I wasn't aware of some of the criticisms of MBTI, but if I wanted to be more precise, I could probably have replaced "INTJ" with something like "any set of predicates P such that P(P|rationalist)/P(P) > 1.05". Then we could all have debates over statistical validity instead :)

- Extroversion-Introversion is pretty easy, and I would say that a number of rational protagonists tend toward E, not I, mostly in terms of throwing themselves into political situations and talking their problems out (which is one of the ways authors have of delivering exposition and/or thoughts). The introverted rationalist is a watcher/spider archetype, while the extroverted rationalist just throws himself into the thick of it and trusts in his abilities to see him through and react better than others do.
- Sensing-Intuition is a little harder. I would say that you'd maybe want to make it a split of tactics and strategy? A good rationalist does both, but you can still express a preference or an aptitude. Sensing rationalists tend to focus on the micro and follow a munchkin or engineer archetype. Intuitive rationalists tend to focus on the macro and follow a scholar archetype. This is more about /preferences/ than anything else. You can be good at the big picture of grand strategy while still preferring the small, concrete things.
- Thinking-Feeling is the hardest, but I think it could still be done. You have to keep in mind that it's still a preference. The feeling rationalist is a peacemaker, always trying to mend bridges or use the principle of charity. They're probably more introspective and pay more attention to their feelings, asking themselves "What's causing me to feel this way?" They're probably more emotionally focused and when dealing with an opponent will be more inclined to get to the root of the emotional arguments rather than the logical ones (which can still be a good path toward winning).
- Judging-Perceiving is another easy one. Improvisation is already a strong rationalist skill and plays well with the extroversion traits. A perceiving rationalist might make for a chessmaster who favors speed chess and generating chaos that they can exploit better than their opponents.

So if our counter-type rationalist hero is ESFP, they're probably outgoing, heavily involved in politics, make decisions on the fly, generate chaos in their wake, and go for the emotional weak spots in their opponents (or aim for conversion). Their advantage is probably moving quickly or moving erratically rather than sitting down for a long time to think things through. When they /do/ sit down for long analysis, it's because it's necessary for winning rather than because they take any joy from it.

Pretty sure that's wrong. Look at how Tt's power works. Remember it's weaknesses and restrictions? That doesn't really look like magic intuition powers to me. That looks like something with ungodly amounts of processing power and a great grasp of heuristics and reasoning making connections in seconds that would require hours or days for a normal human.

I think Tt's power is extremely rapid deduction and hypothesis generation (with heuristics) or more concisely, Tt's power allows her to /think/ better. It's not magic and it /is/ fallible.

It's just headcanon, but I find this explanation far more satisfying than proposing that Tt's shard somehow being able to accurately deduce mental dispositions, floor layouts, and facilitate computer hacking, while at the same time making mistakes often enough that Tt has to work around it (remember the bank robbery?).

That said, good deduction skills and super-thinking doesn't make someone a rationalist, and Tt's isn't one by any stretch of the imagination (although, one might make a case for her shard).

** Non-science of Myers-Briggs aside, if you're looking for examples the first that comes to mind is Peter Wiggan (E) from Orson Scott Card. He's focussed on a lot more in the Ender's Shadow sub-series. Tiffany Aching (P) from Terry Pratchett is another example in deliberate /Rationalist/ fiction.

I think the reason for this lack is that the rationalist crowd is small and new and the kernel is from a group overrepresented by "INTJ" cluster individuals. People write what they know best, particularly in how their characters think.

**** Extroversion versus introversion is very much a spectrum. The dichotomy Myers-Brigs presents is a reduction, but a somewhat useful one.

Sensory versus Intuition seems particularly bad, in that I can't think of anyone outside of 1-dimensional personalities in fiction who don't do both, and few who could even be considered leaning to one side or the other.

The thinking versus feeling seems... weird. It's basically asking if you generally use Type 1 or 2 reasoning, but kind of not. I'd imagine that in the vast majority of cases, your results from your previous two categories would pretty much determine the result of this one. Yay, multicollinearity!

Judging versus perceiving, also weird. Very few people would actually include anything that could be described by this category when describing someone's personality. It's like they /really/ wanted a 4 letter system, and this was the best they could come up with.

At the end, when you're looking at all the personality types, they pretty much are a mix between horoscopes, and a straw-man factory for what personalities are actually like.

My opinion? If you mean extroverted/introverted, use the words. Anything else on the list seems to have either poor definitions, or isn't really all that useful when describing someone's personality.

While I largely agree with you, Meyers-Briggs isn't about what you /use/, it's about what you /prefer/ to use, to the extent you have a preference. When taken from that angle, I think it becomes somewhat more useful.

Really? The one I took asked what I /tended/ to use.

In any case, I don't think that that is very indicative of my personality.

Pretty much every question on that test had me saying, "Well, that would depend on the situation."

Ex: "Do you tend to think things through, or act on impluse?"

Me: "I don't know. Am I fighting a bear, or doing a math problem, because that's gonna pretty heavily influence my answer.

Another example "Do you tend to plan things out, or figure it out as you go."

Me: "I don't know. How much is the event in question stressing me out?"

If it had asked me what I'd prefer to use, the results wouldn't have really been much different. I prefer to use whatever fits the situation, and that's also what I tend to use.

Some questions basically had me flipping a coin, because both answers were wrong. I don't see how useful the result could possibly be.

******* From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Note that the terms used for each dichotomy have specific technical meanings relating to the MBTI which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more /judgmental/ or less /perceptive/. Nor does the MBTI instrument measure aptitude; it simply indicates for one preference over another. Someone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be correctly described as /more/ extraverted: they simply have a clear /preference/.
#+end_quote

I think a large part of the problem with MBTI is that it's been endlessly watered down by a combination of people who don't actually understand it (lots of freshman psych students), the difficulty of making a test that actually measures what it's trying to measure, and the proliferation of less-than-certified tests, all of which are compounded by the fact that they're using terms in nonstandard ways which are also quite close to their everyday usage (and also heavily correlated -- you're more likely to display aptitude at skills you prefer using because you use them more often).

I agree that there's a large degree of "why would I use a hammer when the situation calls for a screwdriver?" but that's something that exceedingly hard to get away from for some of the dichotomies, especially because the concepts are so abstract and adding in more details to the questions just results in confounding factors creeping in. It's one of the many reasons that I think MBTI is lacking as a diagnostic tool -- but that doesn't mean that it can't offer insights into characters.

If by characters you mean fictional characters, than I'd agree. It might actually work for them. That's what these 4 letter codes are, personalities for fictional characters.

Fictional characters have these types of personalities because it's much easier to conceptualize a personality than to conceptualize an entire person, so I can agree with you there. People are complicated.

However, while it does have use, it seems oddly restrictive. Rather than saying "An introverted person who plans ahead of time" it forces a 4 letter code that, as you note, has been endlessly watered down.

Why not just describe what you want to describe instead of using Myers Briggs?

******* Well, there are many versions of the test, some have better formulated questions than others. Try [[http://www.16personalities.com/]]

Though the question "Do you tend to think things through or act on impulse?" probably comes up anyway. In your post it sounds like you're purposefully misunderstanding the question in order to sound clever. It asks "do you /tend/ to?" While you're perfectly correct that one would act on impulse when chased by a bear and think things through when doing a math test, /every single person/ on the planet would do that. That's rather obvious, and hence clearly not what they're asking, or there would be no point. Are you often chased by bears? Do you take exams every day? It asks if there's a specific tendency in your normal actions in day-to-day life, like when you're grocery shopping or whatever. And if you consider yourself doing a little of both, great, there's a neutral option which you should take on that question.

And the results shouldn't be seen as dichotomy by the way, just on what half of the spectrums you seem to lie. It will also tell you whether you are close to the 50/50 mark or at an extreme, even though that information isn't conveyed by the four-letter combination.

Again, that has more to do with what situations I find myself in, not my personality. I can't conceive of a neutral situation in which you do exactly as good using type 1 thinking as you do using type 2 thinking. But that's exactly the kind of situation you need in order to answer a question like that... at which point, my answer would be "Either," and I imagine that most people's would be the same, unless they like Type 1 or Type 2 thinking for the sake of itself.

I'll try again: don't try to come up with a situation. Don't imagine being chased by bears, don't try to imagine some hypothetical true neutral situation, or any other situation that only exists in your head. Answer truthfully about actual situations that /tend to happen/ in your actual life, that's why I talked about grocery shopping. Think back on your days, and the types of things you usually do, and try to decide how you usually think when you take decisions. If we, for the argument's sake, scale this down to you making only three decisions in a day, and make two of them fast and intuitively and the last one after careful logical consideration, you'd answer closer to "impulsive" than "thought through."

I can assure you that there are millions of people out there who know that have a strong (or weaker) /tendency/ to take impulsive decisions, a pattern that they can't break out of. The tendency can so strong that they and others clearly notice this trait in themselves, and maybe even consider it a bit of a problem that they'd like to address, in the extremest cases. Vice versa, there are millions of people who know that they spend too much time thinking things through too deeply, decisions that others would just take in the blink of an eye. Perhaps these persons do this because they're afraid of decisions, perhaps they are perfectionists, perhaps they're just very calm and analytical compared to most. Either way, most people would instantly recognise themselves as described by a place on this scale. If you, after this explanation, still can't understand why anyone would answer anything but in the middle I strongly suggest you answer neutrally, since I guess that means that you're so much in the middle that you can't even imagine being any other way (it would also mean that you have a slightly lacking imagination/empathy, but that's a question for another test).

#+begin_quote

Maybe that particular question seems pointless to you if you answer neutrally on that question, but you are wrong for two reasons: 1) there exists other persons than you, who will answer otherwise, and 2) your "score" can as I said be between 0% and 100%, and if you answer neutrally on that question that will count towards a middle score, around 50%, which is a score like any other.

I told you in my last post that they will present percentages. The data or the presentation of it isn't a big problem to me (the only one of us who seems to know how it's presented), the problem might lie in people misunderstanding it and thinking the four-letter combination is the only information they're given. The four letters is a quick-and-dirty way to sum up their percentages, but to us at least it's clear that only presenting that represents a loss of information. I'm not surprised by this, as people in general aren't good at presenting or understanding data given in a statistical fashion.

No. It is not. As they aren't scientifically /grounded/ in any way, the terms mean whatever the user wants. It is like tarot or horoscopes. Just another way of casting bones to reveal what the user and audience are already thinking in a socially acceptable way--along with the usual witch hunts that always happen when +stupid+ average people get ahold of powerful memes.

Sure. That's a /use/, but that doesn't make it provably better than coming up with something less blatantly unscientific than using Myers-Briggs terms. Or, you know, even better than just /not/ making sloppy generalizations at all, and thus having more clarity of thought and communication in general.

The primary difference between MBTI and a horoscope is that a horoscope doesn't take in any information and in theory (and practice) it's indistinguishable from random chance. The same can't be said for MBTI. Go find someone who doesn't know their MBTI type, or better, has never heard of MBTI, then have them take three different tests without letting them know the results until all the tests have been completed.

It would be ludicrous to think that the results are going to be no better than random chance. MBTI sucks for a number of reasons, but the classification scheme it uses still classifies things in a way that (for example) blood type theory, astrological signs, etc. do not.

The two big problems with MBTI is that its four dimensions were chosen through intuition rather than factor analysis, and that it proposes a bimodal distribution that's not there. The latter is a serious problem, but it's not "means whatever the user wants". If we were talking about /height/ which has a normal distribution, and I was some kind of moron who only classified people into "tall" or "short", my descriptions would still be useful to you, even though I would have all sorts of measurement error, especially when I was looking at someone who was of medium height. Me telling you that someone is "short" is worth a lot less if I can't actually express /how/ short, and obviously it would be more optimal for me to be able to give you a measurement in centimeters, /but that doesn't mean that my stupid bimodal "short" and "tall" system is meaningless or nonuseful./ It's both meaningful and useful, while also being unscientific, suboptimal, error-prone, and removing important information about variability. That's MBTI.

Edit: If you want to read a study about the problems with MBTI, [[http://melindabrackett.com/Myers%20Briggs%20article.pdf][read this one,]] which goes over test-retest reliability, problems with applying bimodal categories to traits with normal distribution, and factor analysis.

For or against MB is /mostly/ besides the point. But [[/u/cyril957]] you might want to check out the arguments against MB. /I am not an expert/ but I have heard that it is less useful/consistent/supported than the big 5.

**** That sounds about right as far as the correlations are concerned (such as they are). It makes me really curious as to how a low Openness rational character might learn. I have a story idea that's been banging around in my head for a while about a gentleman with OCPD (which could be oversimplified as an extreme lack of Openness), and then the question becomes how do you start nudging them in the right direction. In this case when there's something clinical going on, medical assistance would hopefully be first, but a lot of OCPD people especially don't like getting help from what I've read. Hmmm...

Yes, if you try and use it as a diagnostic tool, it's as useful as a well written horoscope. If you try and use it to understand someone better, it is a good seed for discussion.

***** The concept that you can store correlated information using shorter symbols as lossy compression is a provable theorem in modern information theory. If I ask you about a bunch of questions and ask if you do the extroverted thing, and then if most of them you do the extroverted thing, and then label you 'E' that is perfectly valid information theory. If you want information beyond what you put in, you will need modern psychology and neuroscience, but if you want a cheap compression algorithm then it works fine.

This is pretty basic stuff. Using phrases like "information theory" and "compression algorithm" doesn't make your point better, especially when you have such extreme issues with methodology.

********* The key question is though is if you are trying to extract new information via inference, or compress information for easier use. You said you are an Aquarius. If I wanted to try to extract new information from that via inference, I would need some correlation between your birthday and other factors. If I want to extract the fact that your birthday is in the range January 20 - February 18, then THAT is perfectly legal. Knowing that someone is an INTJ tells me something about how they answered the questions on the test, does it not? And if I know something about how they answered the questions on the test, I may know something about their personality. If I give you a test "Do you prefer chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, or are indifferent" and then label you 'C', 'V', or 'I' based that, then concluding if you are an introvert based on that label would be highly questionable. If I want to figure out if you prefer chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, or are indifferent based on if you are a 'C', 'V', or 'I' then that is perfectly legal. Suppose instead of giving you the label, someone gave you the entire set of answers they gave in the test-would you be able to determine anything about their personality? If so, then depending on the form the compressed version of the answers take, you might be able to learn something about their personality. Where as knowing your starsign doesn't help me, since even if I knew your exact birth second I still wouldn't know more about your personality, and your star sign is a lossy compression of your birthtime down to the second.

**** I agree. Emotional characters are realistic.

I'm just saying that if someone's preferential way of interacting with others is by problem solving and rational application of concepts, they are more likely to identify with being a Thinker, rather than a Feeler.

A Rational Feeler may take the emotions of others into great consideration, but if we drift into social manipulation territory, there could be arguments that they are actually a Thinker. (a Socially Savvy Thinker as opposed to an emotionally-blind Thinker, but still.)

I'll withdraw my statement that "rational" heroes cant be Feelers. You're right about MBTI. Its the equivalent to horoscopes in that it is just hazy enough in its descriptors that you may find something to identify with in your own personality, regardless of the initial label.
