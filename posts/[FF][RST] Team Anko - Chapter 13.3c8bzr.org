** Serious question: can someone explain to me what it is that people hate so much about the Shino / Hinata pairing? I have literally lost count of the number of snotty reviews and FFN messages I've gotten since this story started, all of which boil down to "this better not be S/H or I'm not going to read it!"

EDIT: I was bored, so I went back and counted. Something like 3% of the reviews are some version of 'I hate the ShinoHina!!1!1!!' There's a whole bunch more that are polite but address the same issue -- asking if that's what it's going to be, saying that they were hoping for "NaruHina", saying that they aren't fond of "ShinoHina", or whatever. I didn't count the ones in PM, of which there have been a bunch.

And then, of course, there's the guy who wrote to say "I just want to know where you're going with this?" /blink/ That's like saying "hey, can you tell me what the last page will be?"

***** No, that's likely the answer. They have a specific pairing in their head and get grumpy when a fanfic sets the characters up in another manner. Personally, I don't really care about pairings, beyond them being well written. If the relationship is developed naturally and written well, I'll read and enjoy the thing, regardless of the characters being paired.

******* Fair warning, you might want to stop reading. This is a Naru/Hina/Shino/Sasu/Saku/Kiba/Chouji/Neji/Hinabi (aged up)/Lee/TenTen/Shika/Ino/Gaara/Kankuro/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC group marriage fic with a (genderbent)Haku mixing in when she's around and Temari being wangsty because she desperately wants Hinata but has been thoroughly friendzoned...which eventually will turn her into a romance!antagonist who tries to sabotage the marriage.

Don't worry none of the siblings are romantically/sexually involved, they are simply part of the marriage.

There will also be another (adult) group marriage that offers guidance and support to the kids on how to make it work: Hiruzen/Anko/Kakashi/Guy/Madara/Kurenai/Zabuza/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC/OC.

Obviously characters will be genderbent and/or sexuality bent as necessary to make all this work.

Oh, I almost forgot to say: This is /totally/ a troll joke. The above is absolutely NOT going to happen and noone will be aged up (well, aside from the slight adjustments I made on the Team Anko kids), or gender- or sexuality bent.

***** It's a Green vs Blue situation.

Pairings online are like politics or sports teams, and so are /spiders/ in a very significant way. Whole sites will support one or another, argue for thousands of posts that 'X should be with Y because Z', and write enormous counterarguments based on any number of different reasons to support their own position.

And like politics and sports, they snipe each other. They snipe constantly. Anytime anything shows up in the series itself that favors one over another (say before a relationship is resolved) they argue over what it means and attack the worse off side.

The trope term is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat][*Ship to Ship Combat*]], and it's a real thing.

As such, many supporters of X pairing (usually a portmanteau of the two names of the characters, Naruto and Hinata pairings are colloquially called 'NaruHina' for example) are used to people who write or express a desire for another pairing being direct ideological opponents, who would love to attack them. They therefore preemptively lash out.

It's a *lot* like politics actually. And of course, some of them are insecure, and identify with their position as a major facet of their personality, and so they attack even harder and quicker at any perceived threat.

I feel like there's a sociology study to be had here, but I've yet to secure funding.

** Nice little chat between Kurama and Naruto, and it was interesting to see the prison is shaped differently to canon. Glad you didn't use the 'kit' thing common in fanfic, or make the Biiju female or something.

And we also got the reveal of what 'the plan' finally is, between the two non-hospitalized Genin and Anko. Seems the idea is for the teacher to be so harsh in training the students for them to attempt defection, presumably in a ploy. As a side-effect it's likely going to beat any problematic habits out of Hinata.

...I begin to suspect Hinata and Shino are forming a romantic relationship, actually. A crush, certainly.

Although I always pictured the fox as male, going by personality and voice, it's likely the creature is genderless. Mass of chakra and all that.

Great scenes with Anko feigning callous indifference. She finally has the excuse to take the gloves off.

And Naruto/Kyuubi was way better than what I remember from the anime when they first meet -- the Fox is actually an interesting character. Lots of posturing and so on, but they manage to haggle their way down to a position of mutual respect, and I guess Naruto's superpower of getting people to like him is coming in handy.

Writing the Anko scenes was almost physically painful. She hates doing this, and it's hurting her emotionally about as much as it's hurting Hinata. Next chapter, her first scene will be her crying herself to sleep.

Kurama, on the other hand, I loved writing. Big Tough Nasty, but utterly baffled at this little monkey-thing that wants to be friends? That was so much fun. Don't worry, there will definitely be more of him...just like there will be at least a little more of Hashimoto.

it might not be too important as long as it will be stay consistent in the future, and the chapter generally was still an interesting read, but it felt somewhat forced.. like it sometimes feels when a fanfic wants a character to behave in a certain way and is hurrying there, so the transition between the pure cannon and fiction is not as smooth. anyhow as i mentioned its too much effort to be more introspective then this to point what specifically felt odd to me, hope this helps, or maybe it only felt that way to me so you can ignore it..

***** Treewalking is normally done at a range of 1/4" and costs almost nothing. It gets more expensive fast as you move away, because the distance in inches is an exponent.

Shadow clones are ridiculously expensive, but most of it is an overhead factor. Creating one shadow clone is very roughly half a million, and an average jonin can create on the order of 5 without falling over. (Again, the vast majority of the cost is the overhead; the individual clones are cheap in comparison which is why Naruto can spam them.)

****** Hopefully when you talk about treewalking from a distance, you don't actually mean being able to hold yourself off of a plane like a superconducting levitator. That strikes me as being much more unstable, without the benefit of your flesh being right there to act as an anchor for the field.

In my own formulation, I imagine treewalking as being attractive only, and the field is applied only partially over the surface of your feet, depending on where you stand in relation to gravity. So if you're facing the sky, your soles are activated, while your heels support your weight (naturally some musculature enhancement has to be present to counteract the massive leverage). If your side is to the ground, the foot nearest the ground is supporting you while the foot above is activated. And if you're standing upside-down, both of your feet are activated.

I'm not sure how much I remember my structural mechanics, but I think that would make standing upside-down cost twice as much as standing sideways?

Anyway, in my formulation, I'm not really sure how putting too much chakra in would result in explosions. Maybe there's a critical density for chakra or something.

******* Check chapter 1. That's exactly what I described except that yes, you can both push and pull.

As to "explosions", I don't recall if I've used that exact word but, if so, it was mostly metaphor. Naruto has pulled too hard and crushed big chunks of tree / roof. He's also pushed too hard, in which case he blasts a chunk out of the surface and sends himself flying. In both cases some bits get thrown around, but it's not technically an explosion.

** How come Hinata didn't spot Anko before they arrived back at the cottage? I thought she was keeping the Byakugan on at all times while they were in Sound, or was I mistaken about that? I would have expected either her or Shino to detect Anko's presence first and at least attempt to come up with a plan to get into the cottage without being detected.
