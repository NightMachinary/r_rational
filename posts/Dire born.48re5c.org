** As a fan of superheroic written fiction, it's incredibly good, and well-recommended for anyone who could stomach or even stand the genre in the slightest. Very well-grounded and human characters, lots of background detail, an interesting world, and a lot of stuff to make you care. My only complaint from that perspective is that, like Swann's /Forests of the Night/, it tends to be /too/ comicky, throwing in too many different sources of Weird Stuff and doing too varying a level of homework for each. It does so better than Swann, though.

I read it in a day, and went looking for the next (currently unreleased?) book.

As rationalist fiction, I'm not sure I can recommend it so heavily. The main character's willpower/psuedo-rationality is an explicit superpower, while almost all other characters operate at a significantly lower level of reason. While seldom so bad as to break suspension of disbelief, probably not a good way to think, and lends to the aforementioned Weird Stuff coming out of nowhere.

It also tends to have the character lose for reasons the character did not and could not have predicted. That's an in-genre convention, probably necessary when the main character is a superhumanly good planner, and Dire: Born does it significantly more lightly than Worm or even Erfworld. But it does break the "fairplay whodunnit" feeling.

*** I also find this an incredibly fun read, but not explicitly rational.

Dire solves problems a lot of the time with super-tech or planning with information she is given offscreen which is revealed in flashback after the fact. And there is a lot of hidden information and diabolus ex machina that requires a bit of seat of your pants improvisation (something it is explicitly mentioned that Dire excels at, and this is where she starts to learn it).

There are some well placed and clear Chekov's Guns, good foreshadowing, and while I figured out /what/ the antagonists really were almost immediately, /who/ it was still a good reveal and an interesting read. I'd recommend it highly.

** Started as a worm fixfic ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DireWorm][dire worm]]), this is a lot better in my opinion.

The protagonist is smart and the world is well thought out.

*** Didn't actually /start/ that way, Dire was an established character from LD's previous stuff. I've played in a forum game with the character (played by the author) as well, which was an interesting experience to be sure. But the fanfic is an interesting read as well.

** I liked it. Solid superhero fiction. Definitely not highly rational, but you can follow most of the decisions and actions made by the characters, and a significant amount of the content is foreshadowed sufficiently, but not too openly. As mentioned by others below, there is a lot of off-screen data finding it's way on-screen, but the writer is attempting to emulate a thinker AND tinker super.

Think chaotic good female Doctor Doom with no magical ability.
