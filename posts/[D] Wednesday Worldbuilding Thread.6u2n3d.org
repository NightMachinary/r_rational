Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** The Isle of Talis has long been home to the ancestor-worshipping Celta Tribes, who live in unofficial autonomy under the rule of the Red King across the Eastern Channel. They share the land with the Tuatha, a powerful and cunning magical race kept in check by deals made with humans. The Tuatha usually walk invisible among the humans, but have told stories of how they won the land from the savage Formor and will frequently offer deals to transform humans into beautiful and monstrous shapes. The Tribes have thrived under the protection of the Rangers from monsters and men alike, until invaders came from the north and south to claim it for themselves.

The Frost Clans hail from the Colossus Archipelago to the north, a chain of islands they believe to be the corpses of ice giants they are descended from, where they are locked in conflict with the Flaming Horde and their Iron Dragons. They came to Talis in search of power left buried by their ancestors, and found the remains of ancient battles in the Celta's sacred sites. The invaders dug up massive skeletons and armories filled with titanic weapons, reanimating them with arcane rituals and riding them into battle. The Celta cried to their distant king for help, only for the refugees to discover he had traded away his life to the Tuatha so his homeland would be kept safe, leaving a son with no schooling in war to lead the kingdom.

The Frost Clans pushed ever further south, decimating all in their path, and would've continued unabated if not for the Reman Empire. In the name of the Ascended, the man who became a god, they crusade from free humanity from cosmic imprisonment by the Demiurge. They had heard of the Frost Clans campaign and sought to prevent their enemies from surging in strength with their own annexation spearheaded by the Godblood nobility. Despite support from divinity that surrendered to humanity, the Remans did not know the land and could not match the Clans' advance. The two armies finally came to a head at the Battle of Bone Valley, so named for the miracle that happened there.

The Chief of one of the five Clans led the battle himself, slaughtering hundreds of soldiers with his Crypt Titans and Singer Priests who's words rent the sky itself. The Warchief held a sword of indestructible steel, claimed from a village that had revered it for as long as it's recorded history, but set it down to execute the Reman commander with his bare hands. As the man was brutalized before his wife, she snatched the sword and it suddenly burned with a primordial flame that annihilated the Chief and his guard. The Titans came to retaliate, but fell unlifeless to the ground before the sword. The rest of the army retreated in terror, leaving a fraction of the force that had arrived to claim victory.

The remaining Chiefs ordered their men and Titans to regroup at the northern fortress of Frost Landing and prepare for a siege, finally giving Talis a reprieve. The land hade been ravaged by war and many villages had sold their humanity to the Tuatha in desperation, the remaining of which had little love for the new Red King and the contingent of Rangers he had finally sent. Under the new leadership of the Lady of the Light, the Remans pulled their remaining forces back to the cities they had claimed while they waiting for reinforcements to take Frost Landing. Among these three powers, the Isle is now torn.

The child king in the east seeks to preserve his people and restore what they've lost, but he lacks the knowledge or the respect to command them. The warriors in the north seek the glory of uncovering powers long forgotten, but their paranoid leaders think them traitors for not retreating. The lady in the south has had power bestowed upon her not seen since the Ascended himself, but cannot spread the holy word without support from the rival Godbloods and the armies they command. A fragile peace has descended upon Talis, allowing cultures to intermingle and butt heads in the borderlands.

** I've been trying to work out some rules for tactile telekinesis (telekinesis, but you need to be touching the thing), namely in how to define it.

The spell /Mage Hand/ allows you to move up to 10 pounds of material up to 30 ft. per 6 seconds, but doesn't have any rules about slowing down as more weight is added, making me think that aside from the weight limit, it's weight invariant. I think that's a sensible way for telekinesis to work in D&D, because it eliminates a lot of math, but in prose fiction or a computer game, I think adding some simplicity that generates complexity might be good.

For example, "you have the ability to generate 10 newtons of telekinetic force". =F = ma=, so =a = F/m=, which means that if mass is =1 gram= then acceleration is 10,000 m/s^{2} and then I'd have to do some math to figure out how long you could actually apply that force before the mass was out of your reach in order to determine speed.

I'm having a little trouble making this workable and I'm wondering whether anyone has any bright ideas of how to quantify telekinetic ability in a scalable way, i.e. I want to be able to plug in /x/ for telekinetic power and get increasing tiers of power.

(One of the popular fan theories for Superman is that all of his abilities ultimately descend from tactile telekinesis, and that's sort of what I'm trying to create from base principles, but maybe with some neat unexpected things too. The powers:

- Superman is invulnerable because he holds his body together with telekinetic power.
- Superman can catch a plane without punching through its aluminum skin or tearing it apart with mechanical stress because he's applying telekinetic force.
- Superman can fly because he telekinetically lifts himself.
- Superman can stop bullets because he uses subconscious telekinesis.
- Superman can hit people really hard because he puts telekinetic power behind the punch.

This works less well when you consider things like heat vision, cold breath, etc.)

*** Earth acceleration is 9.8 you could round it up to 10 for slightly easier calculation. If object is so heavy that you can't lift it with acceleration faster than 10m/s2 then you can't lift it.

So easiest way to do it is do your a = F/m and for objects with a <10 you can't lift them at all.

This could simplify a lot of things. If you have one character with know F you can just created quick excel document and you can just add a mass of any object character tries to move and see if it is more or less than 10.

Things will change in situation like under water or moving object horizontally rather than up and down. But should give you some basics from which you can start.

*** The intuition on this is that it should scale similarly to picking things up with your hands (although possibly scaled up if your telekinesis gives you superhuman strength).

For very small objects like tennis balls or pebbles, the object's mass doesn't really factor into it - you can throw a baseball at about the same speed as a paperclip, even though it's 100 times heavier. With heavy objects, you're limited much more sharply by mass (or possibly weight) - you may be able lift a 40kg weight but not a 45kg one, and "throwing" either of those will probably look more like dropping it.

With this intuition for telekinesis: very light objects can be thrown at or near a certain maximum speed, and heavy objects are harder and harder to move until you cannot lift them at all (although you can still push them along the ground, if there's not too much friction).

- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute speed cutoff. You can't move anything faster than 10m/s relative to you, except to slow it down.
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute acceleration cutoff. You can't accelerate anything faster than 100m/s^{2} .
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but you need to grip the thing you're lifting with an invisible "hand" of TK. This hand masses 1kg, and moves with the thing you're lifting, so you'll need to spend some of your 100 newtons on moving it as well.
- Same as the above, but your actual physical hand needs to stay touching the thing (tactile telekinesis, remember) so you need to spend some of your 100 newtons, or ordinary muscle power, to move it as well.
- You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute power cutoff. You can't transfer kinetic energy into an object faster than 10J, though you may be able to slow it down.

**** Hrm, I think cutoffs for both absolute speed /and/ absolute acceleration are probably what I'll end up doing, probably scaling with increases in newtons of force. I'll have to monkey with the numbers a bit to see what gets the sort of "rich" effects that I'm looking for (e.g. raising a hand and stopping a sword that's slicing right toward you, being able to fly, using a stack of quarters like an automatic machine gun).

The next question would be "speed and acceleration relative to what", but "the ground" or "the user" would probably be the simple answers (that might give weird results).

*** You can control 100 spirits which have telekinetic power. Each one has a (pseudo) mass of 1 kg, and can exert 50N of force.

When you attach a spirit to an object, it attempts to move both the object and itself in the direction you want; if you're trying to move a 1g ball bearing, it would require moving the bearing /and the spirit/, resulting in 50 N vs. 1.001 kg. You can add spirits indefinitely, but that doesn't help much for small objects: 5000 N vs. 100.001 kg isn't much better.

Spirits also have a very tenuous grasp on the objects. They do not add any momentum to them from an outside perspective.

This also limits you to controlling a maximum of 100 different objects at a time, though that may never come up with normal human multitasking.

As written, you can shoot something light at ~5g, hover 400 kg, or pull a 25 ton ship at trolling speeds.

EDIT: as for restricting it to "tactile", the spirits live within you and flow out to any object that you touch, spreading until they find the edges (however they define that) and giving you control over the whole thing.

*** Why not just use actual [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)][power]]? I.e. kinetic energy imparted per unit time. When acceleration is constant:

#+begin_example
  telekinetic_power = power
      = kinetic_energy_imparted / application_time
      = affected_mass * velocity_change^2 / 2 / application_time = affected_mass * velocity_change^2 / application_time / 2

      = affected_mass * (applied_force / affected_mass)^2 * application_time / 2 = applied_force^2 * application_time / affected_mass / 2
#+end_example

With balance between apllied_force/applied_acceleration and application_time at the user's discretion.

This, however still allows allows the user to go at full power indefinitely, so you might also want to limit total energy expenditure, possibly via explicit time limit, or energy reservoir size and it's refill rate (which is also power), or vague 'mental fatigue' if you want narrative flexibility.

** So, plenty of media deals with vampire internal politics. (I'm thinking of nWoD in this case.)

I'm very interested in some logical and some blue and orange "vampire political factions" for my setting. My vampires are mostly standard, but there are two main differences:

- c. 1700 CE, vampire population crashed from 20,000 to 800: likely due to a supernatural plague (or targeted genocide?) that was brought on by an unspecified enemy of vampires, who managed to be defeated somehow. (Population in 2000 CE has recovered to 200,000)

- making a new vampire is an involved process (think battlefield surgery), has a 30-80% success rate depending on circumstances, and an individual vampire can physically only make a new vampire every 10+ years

Alternatively, ignore the above and put in your own ideas using pulp vampires - it's all good!

Here's some stolen concepts to give you some ideas, mostly stolen from nWoD - but none are blue and orange:

- Invictus: Feudal sort of system: importance of seniority, age, rank, and formality

- Carthian: Democracy, rule for the people

- Communism of some sort?

- "Vegetarian" vampires who try not to kill humans

- Some sort of religious fundamentalists - not sure of what Blue and Orange beliefs we can get from them though

- Quiverful vampires who want to ensure the vampire population grows / Survivalist vampires who have lots of taboos about doing whatever passed the supernatural plague

*** What incentive does a vampire have to make another vampire? Companionship? Ideology? Or is there something more concrete to be gained from making one, aside from "because I want to"?

I wrote a [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255][vampire novelette]] which has a pretty straightforwardly evil political system, but that comes as a consequence of the rules vampires operate under. As in, given those rules, I think that an evil political system is the natural consequence.

If you're going for blue/orange morality, I think that you first need a base of "how to be an ethical vampire" to build on, because otherwise you're going to descend too often into blackness.

I guess to my mind, the big question that you'd want a cleavage along is whether or not it's ethical to make more vampires, given the risks (whatever they are) involved and the lifestyle that a vampire must adopt. So you'd have:

- a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to murdering other vampires, because vampires are an evil upon the world and continued existence can only be justified by attempting to dismantle vampirekind, root and stem.
- a sect that thinks it's ethical for vampires to exist, but that it's totally unethical to create more vampires, even with the consent of whoever is about to be turned.
- a sect that thinks making new vampires is totally fine, so long as it's done judiciously and humanely.
- a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to the promotion of vampirekind and pushing the limits of vampire creation, at least partly motivated by the idea that more vampires in the world puts vampires in a better position.

But I think first you have to answer the question of what a vampire gets out of making another vampire, which helps define what your vampire population looks like, and thus their politics.

#+end_quote

Unfortunately, it's just companionship/ideology, and because the process isn't perfect the companionship angle is kind of dubious. I imagine it's a lot like the reason people have children: companionship / ideology / teaching. No "taking care of me in my old age" aspect, I don't think, though. I imagine my vampires get more and more powerful as time goes on, though a growth-decline like humans have might be an interesting thing to play with now I think about it.

So, yeah, the vampire population probably has "islands" of worldviews that are generally inherited, but then the young vampire through seeing the world/etc starts to realise that it's not so simple and migrates to other bubbles, but this makes the matriarchs very upset probably. You'd also have vampires making cases for their own world views to try and put more people onto their side and take them from opponents. Maybe some vampires decide it's more efficient to convert vampires to your worldview than to birth them.

But then you have to ask, why do they care how many other vampires agree with them? Is it because we all want our echochambers, or are vampires at an ever-present threat of war? I imagine the vampire "instincts" being quite vicious, which is why they have a lot of culture which requires them to demonstrate restraint, so perhaps they all know on some level that the dam will break, war will begin, and they want to have soldiers when that happens.

(Warning: maths might be wrong) But my vampire reproduction rate is based on 1.5% of vampires each year having a baby, and if you can do it every 10 years that means basically that during each 10 year block 15% of vampires have a baby, which seems like a lot: and if you assume a 50% success rate, you're talking about 30% of vampires trying to have a baby every 10 years (i.e. as often as possible). Reflecting on it, /this seems like maybe a bit too many/? Playing around with the exp growth rate in my spreadsheet, I can put it down to about 1% before there are too few vampires in the present day, which brings the 30% down to 20% - not much difference. Exponential growth is terrible. I suppose we can model this by saying that early on after the bottleneck, 80%+ of vampires made babies as quickly as they could, and then as the population began growing too large political will in vampire society swung another way and reproduction became far more discouraged.

(AOO is unfortunately blocked at my office, but I'll try and make sure I check out your novelette when I get home. Since your evil political system sounds like a great thing to draw on for me.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think the agreement of "what's ethical" in vampires is even more fragmented than it is in humans, and my cursory understanding of psychology has me well aware that humans can't agree on ethics at all.

Having "should we make more vampires" as a big point of moral debate has some interesting consequences as you laid out. It looks like those 4 are probably pretty compatible with any of e.g. communist, feudal, democratic beliefs though. Like, "we should make as few vampires as possible" can fit with communism (make sure the pie is split fewer ways) and feudalism (let's not share our power), so I think we need to have more values/etc to layer on top of that.

Have 4 main vampire characters so far:

1. William (protag): feudal

2. Elodia (antag): feudal, but "meaner"

3. Erlis (minor): "Vegetarian", very radical, believes in human/vampire harmony (though not necessarily equality).

4. Cassius (antag): feudal, has made baby vampires, his babies are very important to him (of course, for a not yet specified reason: character not yet developed)

So I think that's why I need to try and develop these factions, as I think factions will help with the development of the vampire characters.

It won't be a big point of moral debate because every major faction will make as many new vampires as possible. Doing otherwise will mean being wiped out or made irrelevant by other factions. Even if old vampires are orders of magnitude more powerful than newborns, these newborns will eventually grow strong enough to win through sheer numbers. There simply is no incentive not to make new vampires. Even using them as cannon fodder is better than not making them at all, since some will probably survive and grow into something useful.\\
This applies to all fields, not just military. Having one superhumanly good (through centuries of practice) diplomat or administrator is good, but having an entire team of them is excellent. Even one old vampire who studied rhetorics and public speech for his entire life can make humongous impact thanks to Internet/TV, but several of these will be able to cover a much wider demographic.

I imagine vampires with centuries/millenia of experience on their side will know very well how to make newborns loyal and eager to fulfill their intended purpose. For example, if I was a vampire, I'd try to always have a significant population of fanatically loyal humans at hand as a source of both food and recruits.\\
My main point, however, is that without some kind of a drawback, creating a new vampire is basically always beneficial. Vampires are more useful than humans -> getting more vampires is always better than not, unless you fail at loyalty and they walk away immediately, in which case your organization is doomed anyway. How exactly to use the resulting newborns is a secondary concern - obviously, immediately wasting them as cannon fodder is not desirable, but in a dire enough situation you might not have a choice.

If all major factions are roughly equal in what they can offer to potential traitors, there is no point in becoming one, since you'll get basically all the same benefits you already have, but with an addition of a ruined reputation. If one faction is significantly better at poaching than others, it'll either eliminate them and become a superpower or they'll come together and destroy it (both of these possibilities can result in interesting plotlines).\\
Things become murkier with higher-ranked vampires who might have unique powers or knowledge that are more or less useful to specific factions, but we're talking about rank and file currently. And for rank and file, it's more efficient to make your own vampires rather than spend so much resources getting through all the layers of indoctrination and incentives to stay loyal.

I suppose to get into the details of the mythology a bit more, there's two main reasons why making a new vampire might not be attractive.

Firstly, you can make a human into a thrall instead. Thralls have to obey you, whatever you ask them, so they're effectively 0 risk, and they don't age so you don't need to replace them every 60 years. This also makes them powerful (not sure how much exactly)^{a}, but holding thralls takes mental effort, so as a rule of thumb a vampire can comfortably have one for every 500 years they've been a vampire, but a young vampire can have 10 if they spend all their time focusing. (Consequence: self-interested vampire might make "brainwashed" baby vampires hold a maximum number of thralls in control and have baby vampire order them to obey self-interested vampire, and thus get a large number of thralls by proxy).

Secondly, creating a vampire is not always successful. The less often you do it and the healthier the human the higher your chances of success, as well as actually being able to do the ritual properly. So if you have a favourite human you're better off keeping them a thrall, which is guaranteed. Depending on your human entourage they might not like that their vampire god is always killing people and they very rarely get the eternal life they were promised. Probably can easily get around that with doctrine, though. A vampire turning humans every 10 years (max speed though I'm not married to it) would have a 30% success rate, so a vampire's cult members would only see one or two successful turnings in their lifetime - which might be enough, I admit.

Add to that vampire society might punish people who create too many babies (or the prolific ones might just stay on their own continent), the real but perhaps overblown risk of vampires you create turning against you, and the security risk of having so many vampires in a comparatively small area potentially attracting hunting teams which can ruin your day if they burn your house down while you're sleeping (you'd never let that happen, you have a thousand security measures against that, but the chance is still worrying).

Oh! A light-bulb went off in my head. The 800 survivors of the Catastrophe are probably the "aristocracy" so to speak and the rank and files are trying to make babies to help them rally in the event that the 800 try anything. After all, the 800 haven't spoken about the Catastrophe, so the babies are very curious/suspicious about what the hell it could have been. Perhaps vampires cyclically kill off the baby population when the world is overpopulated? Well, they will be ready this time.

(Aside: I want the 800 survivors not to talk about the Catastrophe, but that's kind of stupid and tropey and I guess maybe I should abandon it. If the Catastrophe is indeed a plague, then perhaps they'd be better off with all the vampires knowing about it so they can e.g. wash their hands after meals. Even if you assume the 800 would on some level like a new bottleneck that only they know the secret to surviving, you have to assume that one or two vampires of the 800 /at least/ would have fallen in love with younger vampires and tell them. Then again, still others might have predicted this and pretended to fall in love with younger vampires and told them false rumours, so perhaps there's just a ton of rumours? Who knows.)

^{a} I want thralls to have a "percentage" of the vampire who created them, but that would result in an impressively old vampire's thrall being far more powerful than a 100 year old vampire, which I don't want. Perhaps giving thralls only one or two powers, like super strength and healing, and young vampires have other stuff as well - like super speed. So an old vampire's ghoul would be physically stronger than a young vampire, but the young vampire would still "win in a fight" because of super speed and whatever other powers.

For 800 people to keep a secret, it must be insanely dangerous. Like, a recipe for creating the plague dangerous, not the fact that the plague happened and wiped almost everyone out. There's no practical value in keeping that fact secret, so few vampires will even try.\\
Regarding thralls, with less than 10 thralls per vampire without sacrificing time and effort to maintain control, they're essentially trusted helpers that handle sensitive tasks and information. Overall, with these numbers, you can't really build a big organization with thralls alone. Especially since they're basically an extention of their master, so if you have loyalty problems, that just means one traitor can make significantly bigger impact because he does several jobs at once through his thralls. On the other hand, less points of failure is always good.\\
Though, if you actually have some reliable, but expensive mindcontrol, enslaving a vampire and then converting him into a bunch of thralls which he then controls 24/7 will allow you to reduce expenses while quickly expanding. It also helps you to keep the fact that you're stealing vampires from other factions secret, since they all sit in fortified bunkers controlling their thralls instead of walking around performing tasks.

Yeah, that's been sticking in my craw a lot lately. I don't know if you've noticed, but I feel like I'm pretty steadfastly against incorporating the deep history of my world into the story, and that is the point of friction that seems to fuck with me, stop me from getting from what I /want/ to what I /need/. I think I need to make peace with the fact that although I want to tell a romance story, it's a romance story set in a /world/, and that world needs to be reflected. I don't have to write a full flashback novella of William's adventures during the Vampire War or whatever, but he and the other vampires would be better to be open about it lest they repeat it.

Because even if, worst case scenario, the knowledge of the Catastrophe requires knowledge of how to build the plague, then that means that 799 other vampires who may not be your allies know how to build the plague. (Then again, those 799 also know first-hand how bad the plague was: perhaps an analogy is if people who were on the ground during the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the ones who were given control over the world's nuclear weapons. They'd be the most trustworthy people).

But back to what I was /trying/ to say, if the knowledge of the Catastrophe requires knowledge of how to build the plague, there must be some level of knowledge that is helpful without being plague-enabling. (You know... "a plague happened once, but I can't tell you the cure because then you'd know enough to create the plague again").

So yeah. Probably actually-secret Catastrophe is a fever dream. "Closely guarded secret", "kept quiet so humans don't ever find out", etc might be more feasible.

Vampires can give normal humans orders by maintaining eye contact (but normal glasses or contacts are enough to stop this). The orders are of the strength "gun to your head" - so mostly irresistible - but the compulsion lasts some 90 seconds. So it comes in pretty handy, but doesn't work on other vampires, and is really hard to munchkin.
