** I'm sorry; I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the writing style. I used to read a lot of webcomics, and there's a tendency of webcomic fanfics to reduce everything to dialogue-dialogue-dialogue-action-action-dialogue without any space devoted to character reaction or introspection, or exposition about the setting. It's become something of a pet peeve, which this fic aggravated in spades.

** This author has some of the crunchiest and most clear minded scenes I've ever seen in any fanfiction. In its serious, thoughtful tone, it reminds me of the official tie-in novel /The Buried Age/, one more Star Trek story I'd recommend to this audience in particular. The site isn't English, but the story is.

I found it while searching for fanfictions involving Cetacean Ops, so I joined the story /in media res/. +It appears to+ It definitely takes place between seasons 2 and 3, and coincidentally, I've been rewatching seasons 1 and 2 with my father. However, the introduction chapter (linked) is a framing story with Commodore LaForge.

I'll follow up once I've read more with if it's complete, apparently ongoing, or abandoned, and if it retains that air of quiet competence that made me post it here.

*** Well, it was certainly interesting enough to speed through, but I'm left with a bit of a sense of 'Why?'. It was enjoyable enough, as any competent brief star trek novelization. I don't complain about the various relationship focuses. But I don't know that I learned anything new about any of the characters (The obvious bits with Jordi, and Riker's willingness for Bird-people aside) and they don't explore the conceit of the wrapping story (trans galactic drive), so it just kind of feels like having watched an episode and not anything more deeply gratifying.

It was fine?
