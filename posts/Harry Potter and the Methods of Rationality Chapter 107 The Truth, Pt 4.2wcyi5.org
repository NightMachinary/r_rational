Alright, here's mine:

He snuck in the troll by transfiguring it and having it hidden on him when Dumbles hooked him into the wards. The troll could bypass some of the wards because it was technically also a defense professor. (Amazingly, the troll was only the third worst DADA professor in hogwarts history)

I'm confident enough to give that one *70% probability*

**** Trolls are /really/ hard to kill, and I think I remember some comment somewhere in HPMOR that their regeneration is done by a natural form of transfiguration; they're constantly turning into themselves. So if you overrode that natural transfiguration with your own magic, the troll would probably be perfectly fine once it completely turned back.

Plus, transfiguration sickness might take time to set in. He didn't exactly need the troll to live too long.

The reason he hasn't thought about it, and the reason why we didn't see anything between him wondering what to do after receiving the letter and showing up at the 3rd floor corridor, and the reason he seems so uncharacteristically unprepared, is that he had Cedric obliviate himself of that information.

*** I think the best way to describe the parseltongue restriction is that *you can't say something you don't think is true*. If you don't believe what you're about to say is a true statement, you'll find you can't say it, or it comes out how you believe without your intention.

While you're speaking parseltongue, there's a magical effect on you that temporarily prevents you from wanting to say anything false.

Whether you can, with practice, get around that to any degree I don't know. Harry has accidentally said things more frankly than he meant while speaking parseltongue, but perhaps if you're used to doing so you can still word things in a deceptive way without lying. I think that would take skill, though.

*** Parseltongue is explicitly designed to prevent doublespeak. I think the only solution is speed: Betray and finish him fast enough.

Getting the time turner for an unsupervised second would be enough for example. Although it makes for a crappy ending. At any point, Yudkowsky could just write "Suddenly Voldemort was shot from behind" and then explain how Harry got his time turner an hour later.

** I wonder why Voldi always asks "have you betrayed me YET". It seems deliberate, and it's strange, it seems to me the more natural question "have you betrayed me" would be better.

Maybe it's because he doesn't want to know if Harry betrayed him later in time, to avoid "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" consequences?

Maybe Harry could abuse that somehow?

Or he knows that harry betrayed him later, and that harry could deduce it from information he had from future, and wants to make the test false-positive proof.

** I have a question that I think is important in regards to Parseltongue speech.

Does Harry differentiate mentally between Quirrell and Voldimort? It seems as if he might be doing so, but it also looks like that's being obfuscated by the way it's written. The author isn't specifically telling the reader that Harry is differentiating between the two, and it would seem very obvious to me that Harry really should be spending more time thinking about that.

If he can choose in his mind which entity he is speaking to when he answers the betrayal question, he can tell Quirrell that he's not betraying him, while at the same time he is actively betraying Voldimort.

*** He differentiates between the Professor and Voldemort because there is a dissociation of observed behavior, similar to the dissociation of behavior between Harry and his dark side. Harry seems to have dissolved the perception of dissociation with his dark side, though.

Doublethink like that is essentially Occlumency, which is the sort of thing that Parseltongue is supposed to prevent. Not that that prevents you from potentially using your own boundedness, biases, and uncertain beliefs to answer with false certainty. Though the intentional use of those things would probably constitute betrayal.

**** Parseltongue would only prevent it if the correct questions are asked. If Harry is actually differentiating between Quirrell and Voldemort, then he's not betraying Quirrell. I just looked at this chapter, and in both cases where Harry is asked if he is betraying, the narration specifically indicates Harry seeing the question coming from Quirrell.

Voldimort does indicate that he is a disembodied soul, when discussing the possibility of a dementor attack.

When he does act, I expect Harry to explain to Voldimort, in Parseltongue. "I never betrayed the professor, I acted to free him from you." Or some such.
