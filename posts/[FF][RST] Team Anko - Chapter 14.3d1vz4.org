** I'm tentatively hopeful that Kurama actually is as beneficent as he seems. It would be nice if everything he said was sincere and truthful, but I rather doubt it at this point. He is a demon, after all.

***** This one I'll give you as a freebie: Tobi never hypnotized him. The idea that a human could forcibly control the mind of a primordial demon is utter bullshit. Lay a genjutsu on his human host which deceives the bijuu because he is limited to Naruto's senses as interpreted by his brain? Absolutely. Put it directly on an ancient being made of pure chakra who only has physical form when it remembers to and has senses aside from the human? Hell no. You can't create an illusion of something you can't sense yourself -- see Sachi's issues with chakra systems. (Well, technically it IS possible, but it requires some work to set up.)

Depends on your definition of 'beat'. Straight power output? Nope. Defeat? Yes, given the right criteria for "defeat."

This isn't quite what you were asking about, but if you look you'll notice that Anko beat Naruto+Kurama in this chapter.

Eh, just the fact the Zetsu clones were trying to gather the Bijuu together, and without a way to hypnotise the thing it might be harder now. I could be wrong, can't remember what I was thinking of when I posted yesterday.

******* *Beware: unmarked spoilers for the backstory of both Naruto and Team Anko follow*

I should preface this by saying that I'm using the wiki as my source of canon knowledge, as I haven't read the manga and couldn't stand the anime. Based on that, here's my understanding:

1.  No one had chakra
2.  There was a tree, the Shinju
3.  It had a fruit which some unnamed being had told humanity they should never touch, much less eat
4.  Kuguya ate the fruit and got super powerful chakra
5.  She had two sons, Haguma and Hashoromo (later aka The Sage of Six Paths), both of whom were born with chakra
6.  Kuguya was angry because she thought she should have all the chakra. She "incarnated with the Shinju" to create the Ten-Tails in order to reclaim the chakra
7.  The 10T did not do that, it just went on a rampage
8.  The Sage sealed the 10T inside himself
9.  The Sage walked around and gave chakra to everyone and everything
10. Eventually the Sage split the 10T up. He took its body and used it to create the moon (!!!) He used its chakra to create the 1-9 Tailed Beasts
11. The 1-9TB went off into the world and did their thing.\\
12. Humanity kept trying to exploit them, so the 1-9TB grew to hate humanity and started rampaging around
13. Humanity sealed the 1-9TB into jinchuuriki
14. Madara Uchiha (and presumably some / all of the other Uchiha) was a descendant of the Sage, which is probably why the Sharingan is so utterly broken

To me this story sounds like a summoning gone wrong -- Kaguya used her own strength and that of the Shinju to call up a pre-existing entity and create a body for it. (Hence, "incarnating" it.) There was presumably a deal here -- e.g. "I'll give you a body and you go recover my kids' chakra" -- but the entity found a loophole that let it do whatever it wanted. The loophole might have been as simple as "sure, I'll recover it...eventually."

As you point out, the Sage created the 1-9TB, so perhaps he left backdoors in their construction which could be exploited by his descendants. It's not clear how he created them, though -- they are pure chakra, so he didn't create bodies that could be bodyjacked. They are nothing except chakra + mind...which begs the question of where the minds came from?

To me, Occam's Razor says that he took the 10T's mind, divided it up into nine pieces (or maybe made nine instances, either way) and then edited each piece to form nine separate personalities. I imagine the thought process being along the lines of "I'm strong enough to contain this thing and wise enough not to use it, but I won't live forever. I can't destroy it, so how do I protect the world from it? I know, I'll limit its processing power and put a personality overlay on it which will make it Friendly."

If you start from the idea that he was trying to protect humanity from the thing that became the 10T, then everything begins to make a lot more sense...except for one thing: the idea that he just turned the 1-9TB out into the woods and walked off. (Which, honestly, doesn't make sense in canon either.) Instead, in Team Anko-verse, he sealed the 1-9TB into the various jinchuuriki. It was a multi-pronged containment strategy:

1. Reduce the 10T's strength as much as possible by distributing as much of its chakra into the world as possible
2. He didn't actually distribute it in packets, he created connections between living things (people, trees, grass, etc) and connected them to the wellspring of the 10T's power. Each new life descended from a chakra-connected entity gets its own connection, and bleeds off a little more of the 10T's power. Each connection filters the chakra and turns it into something that isn't dangerous to humans and doesn't feel like TB chakra. Unfortunately, there was just too much power to get rid of like this.
3. As mentioned above, he also divided the 10T's mind into the 1-9TB and edited the various pieces to believe that they are separate entities and that they are Friendly
4. He immediately bound each TB into a jinchuuriki.
5. If the personality edits hold, the beasts will work /with/ their jinchuuriki for the benefit of humanity.\\
6. If one of the personality edits fails and that TB / that part of the 10T entity becomes Unfriendly, then its jinchuuriki can keep it contained, and there are eight others who can be used to help contain / re-Friendly-ify the defective one.

He probably realized that it wasn't perfect, but it was the best he could do. The real question is what extra information did he pass down about the Beasts? /ominous and portending music/

So, to answer the original question: no, I don't think there's backdoors in the TB, because they are nothing but instances of an extradimensional entity's mind and some of its power. Well, I suppose another way to say it is that the TB /are/ the backdoor -- they are personality edits intended to make the 10T's mind safe to have around humans.

** Similar question as earfluff; is Kurama as benevolent as he seems? Normally, I have no problem with a benevolent Kurama. But yours seems a little too eager to please. And even disregarding that, since this is a Rationalist story, and the Kyuubi is an ancient entity, I'd assume he'd be much more....superior, I suppose, from a mental standpoint.

So is this guy an honest good guy or a manipulator? Or should I just wait and keep reading to find out? :P

*** Japanese "demons" of this sort are often two natured. Protective and destructive, nurturing and savage, a little good and a little evil. Given that this is rational fic, I'd say Kurama isn't definitionally "evil." I'd also say he's been locked up more than the less than a hundred years implied by canon having Naruto only be the /third/ container for the nine-tails. But he sounds in this story like the jinchuuriki thing has been going on for a long, long time.

Also, this is an AI Box situation. This is what you should expect from such an entity. Threats got him some of what he wanted, then he switched strategies. I don't think Kurama has actually failed any of his gambits since establishing contact. In fact, it isn't clear he's really as hurt as he appears. Personal illusions are a kitsune's specialty, after all.

Yes. In canon the conversation went something like this:

Ten-Tails: Grr! I rampage!

Sage: You mustn't!

Ten-Tail: But I will!

Sage: I split you into nine parts! And then I walk away!

Tailed beast 1-9: ...? Really? Uh...okay, thanks! Grrr, we rampage!

I figure it makes hella more sense if he split them up and then sealed them away. In Team Anko-verse they've been passed down for a thousand years from one jinchuriki to the next; sometimes they get out for one reason or another and do their rampage-y thing, but mostly they stay sealed.

(In retrospect, I really should have been spelling it 'jinchuuriki', since I've been using 'uu' to represent 'u with macron'. It was an early-on mistake and I'm not going back through 14 chapters and then re-uploading all of them through FFN's irritating interface just to fix that little not-terribly-important bug.)

**** If it wasn't a vital part of the story, then yes. For example, if the Kyuubis nature was always just going to be benevolently helpful, and it's not ever a plot point or in question, answering it would reveal very little. As it were, I'm inclined to believe there's more going on with him. If that's the case, then feel free to decline to comment.

** Interesting how Naruto and Kurama are working in sync from this early, compared to canon. I noted they only got up to a single Chakra Cloak and Tail, form-wise, but that's still quite impressive. Kurama is considerably more mellow as well, probably due to the window into Naruto's senses.

** One possibility is that Oro is watching Anko through the cursed seal somehow, and that's how he is always able to surprise her. If so, they'll have to start making plans which don't involve Anko. Using Anko as a means to feed Oro false information would also become possible.

I don't understand why Anko would think that Oro will fall for her acting. Shouldn't he already know lots about her personality? Is she running another gambit underneath this? Or perhaps she has a very dark past and really was like this once?
