*** It opened with a good deal of promise and has mostly done well. In my opinion there are times it struggles, usually in the form of somewhat implausible rushed transitions, but I definitely feel the good outweighs the bad and continue to enjoy reading it.

** I find the comment at the end interesting. While this kind of full-powers-vested negotiation is terrible for back-door trade agreements, it would have been damn nice for the negotiators to have when /actually trying to end long-running wars/. I can't help but think that the Israeli-Arab conflict could have been over for 6 years now...
