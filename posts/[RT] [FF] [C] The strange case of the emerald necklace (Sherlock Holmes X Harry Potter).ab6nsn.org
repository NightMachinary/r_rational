***** You're right about the Killing Curse, but he also used the Imperius on Watson before that. And meanwhile they're seeing all these bolts of light flying around. Really, the Expelliarmus /alone/ should be grounds enough to realise either something really is going on, or you've been hypnotised so thoroughly you have no contact with reality any more and thus no empirical evidence will ever be enough (and this, in itself, would be magic, since hypnotism doesn't work that way).

****** If Holmes doesn't believe on himself being imperiused, there is no way he'd believe when Watson gets imperiused. After all, he too could have been hypnotized earlier as well. The fact that hypnotism does not work that way doesn't necessarily mean that it's more probable that he should think there is actual magic rather than himself being wrong about how hypnotism works. It's not our world, it's a world where magic is a thing, so hypnotism could very well potentially work in any way instead of the way it works in our world, so facts about hypnotism are a bit weak argument.

Magicians can throw around sparks and fireballs and move objects around. That they don't, in the moment of action, notice how the trick is done, does not mean it's not just a trick. Magicians get fooled by other magicians all the time. They also arrived into a place where the wizard could have done any kind of preparations.

He has no reason to believe hypnotism/imperius would cause hallucinations, especially completely controlled ones. He has only experienced loss of memory and having to follow orders.

I'm just saying that not all magics are equal to convincing people about it existing. Doing stuff to a person, like levitating him, transforming him into a frog, making him puke slugs, transforming his clothing, etc would be way more convincing than killing a dog in a way that would need autopsy to figure out if there was a trick.

Agree on the preparation, but my point about hallucinations is that if he doesn't believe the Imperius can cause them, then he needs to justify the Crucio and seeing the gun fly from Watson's hand - twice.

Admittedly, it's not the strongest possible evidence. But the room for deception had considerably shrunk at that point.

But he says he is trying to become a good man and now that I think of it, he is not doing a very good job there.

Gun moving around could be just tricks with strings.

The guy could even have wiped their memories and walked and planted the string, then moved back and pretended to cast a spell.

Watson could as well have been hypnotized to just throw the weapon when he gives a certain command. Both plausible explanations with what has been demonstrated before.

He swore to /them/ he would not harm them. Holmes could as well just drop down and hit his head and die, so technically the wizard is risking a lot here. I'd disagree with the pain and harm here, but it's a /lot/ of pain, no matter how short. Harm is really too wide thing to promise, but as magic is probably intent based, it could be ok. edit: Uhh yea that one was not unbreakable one, but yea still a liar.

While certainly excessive, it was defense of sorts, and the offer of no harm was null and void. But agree that it /could/ kill Holmes by accident (though I assume a certain experience about how Cruciatus works means an expert user, like an expert torturer, would know how to limit oneself).

And by "Artemisia's Love" for all things, which I'd dare say should mean it has very little wiggling room for technicalities if he is trying to be honest there. He knew he could get free either way.

I don't think any kind of expertise in cruciatus would help against target being in so much pain they fall down and hit their head. I'm not sure it can do different levels of pain, as it's told to just give excruciating amount of pain. Potter is a bit bad with spellpower stuff. But Watson said he screamed a lot, so there was a lot of pain.

The wizard was in some danger in the beginning as Holmes /could/ have just shot him. But he knew Holmes was hungry for explanation and wouldn't have ever been satisfied without.

yeah the crucio really turned all his cordial affability on its head. If he wanted to convince them to just go along he shouldn't have behaved at all that way. There are less damaging proofs he could give.

********* My comment was originally about how "you can take Action A which would not lead to a stable time loop, as long as the full sequence of your actions do lead to a stable time loop." That said...

There are a number of ways things could work.

0) Time travel is impossible, or costs lots of energy, or no one gets around to it. Boring, but consistent.

1) People go back in time, and their actions have effects. But where those effects touch on their younger selves, this leads to more effects....

1a) And then you end up with self-consistent histories after enough iteration. Time travel allows you to solve most problems via brute force - but the consequences and moral implications aren't immediately clear unless you know what time travel actually does. Does it really "change" the past? Or does it create more universes? Biohazards may be a problem.

1b) No Self-consistency. (Maybe all "loops" are guaranteed to terminate, but no one has actually tried to make this /not/ happen.)

2) Everything works out being consistent in *one* go through. This might make life...unpredictable. The nature of cause and effect may be unclear at times.

3) The universe fixes things. If you break too many things you might be erased - possibly including everything you've ever done. Or maybe you'll just die of a heart attack before traveling back in time.

4) Inconsistencies can be created, leading to timeline erasure. This doesn't destroy the universe, but you might not remember the way things used to be. It's can be a tricky process though.

I believe things are portrayed that way because it is 1) simple*, and 2) surprising - a horrible series of events occurred, and then was averted - all without changing what happened from the perspective of their younger selves.

*(I hear physics finds this important.) Many a story grows a thousand gaping plot holes with the advent of time travel.

The only problem I can find with that idea of time travel in HP canon comes from "book 8"** -if the past cannot be changed, then they have nothing to fear from a villain with a time turner..., or anyone for that matter. Which just goes to show,... that how time travel works in the show is however the scriptwriters/etc. wants it to work, for the current plot, which isn't too surprising when you think about what kind of fiction she writes.

Not really: time travel would not be an independent mechanic, free from shackles from everything else. It would be a part of general relativity, and would work in the context of general relativity, and would also have to be consistent with all other laws of nature. So unless multiverse theory IS real (interesting question) and time travel moves you to a different branch of the universal wavefunction, then I'd expect stable time loops to form, the way in which in a spatial loop you'd have all field solutions be standing waves. Time and space are after all two sides of the same coin.

Well, they are /two/ faces... not literally /the same/ face. You're locked in a specific direction because in relativity the signature of spacetime is +++-, meaning you can't go faster than light, and thus can't "turn around" and go backwards in time. In a world with signature ++++ (such as the one Greg Egan describes in his "Orthogonal" books) you could go back in time simply by going fast enough. However, General Relativity /does/ have some solutions that travel back in time. We don't know if they're possible (we tend to think they're not and there's some law that forbids them, it just sounds more sensible that way), but if they were, then they'd be basically stable time loops. The one thing that could change this is integration with quantum mechanics, something we still don't have or understand fully.

If physics aren't your job of course it's kinda hard to justify that much time investment, unless you're really into it. I can tell you being a physicist myself I've /tried/ learning some quantum field theory (outside my usual field of work) but I hardly can find time to commit to memory more than the basics. I don't feel much like doing exercises like an undergrad, which I'd have to to really learn it, but that's also a side effect of me already doing physics work during my daily routine.

**** My choice went to the Unforgivables more for added horror effect - and because I imagined Cornelius here wanted to put some serious fear in his opponents, so that they would understand they were outmatched. But if we're talking detective work, I'd say everything that can extract information (Legilimency, Veritaserum) or alter it (Obliviation, Memory Charms, Polyjuice, animagi, Detection Charms, transfiguration in general), alter behaviour (Imperius, love potions), grant access inside otherwise locked/restricted areas (apparition, portkeys), hide (disillusionment, invisibility cloaks), and obviously kill in otherwise undetectable or unrecognizable way (Killing Curse and who knows how many magical poisons and potions). Heck, give your whole team of thieves a vial of Felix Felicis each and watch them rob the heck out of Fort Knox without firing a single shot, just because all guards will /happen/ to be looking another way when they pass. Slughorn's Eleven could be a thing, but not a very long or exciting one.

Really, magic just utterly and completely /breaks/ all assumptions a detective relies on if investigating a crime. And without other magic to protect you against it, it's basically impossible to prevent a crime or identifying the culprit if they're using it. Gringotts is safe because they have anti-apparition wards, the Thief's Downfall and all their other wards, but a normal muggle bank is completely defenseless. Even here, I made it clear the problem was that the Malfoys were worried about /other/ wizards sniffing something. If it was just muggles, they had a gajillion ways to kill Artemisia that would have been utterly undetectable.

I wasn't sure about posting this here, since I did not write it strictly with the idea of making it rational, and Sherlock Holmes on his own isn't considered very rational as a character (what with his wildly inaccurate use of the term 'deduction' to actually mean INDUCTION, and often extremely speculative induction at that!).

** This was wonderful. I've always loved it when stories explored just how terrifying HP universe must be for muggles, and this fic fit the bill perfectly. I've also always loved it when fics truly explored how truly scary mind magic, as portrayed in canon, actually is. Rowling created a world where anybody and everybody with a wand could drug you (Confundus), roofie you (Obliviate) or completely enslave you (Imperius), and there's basically nothing you can do about it, even if your wizard, except exercise constant, never ending vigilance. Canon doesn't provide any wearable shields that block such spells, or anyway such spells can even be detected (since if there was a way to detect mind magic like that, I'm pretty sure Gringotts would have it). And given how Malfoy and rest of the Death Eaters, after the first war, claimed that they were innocent because Voldemort had Imperiused them, apparently its possible to be under the Imperius curse, and for no one around you to even notice (because I guess your captor ordered you to 'act normal')! And of course, all of this is even worse for muggles, because they both have no idea any of this is possible, and even less ability to defend themselves.

Rowling created a setting that should, by all rights, be a hell state of paranoia and terror, and yet isn't, and I haven't even gotten into the sheer, bottomless moral abyss that commercially sold love potions are. You can't drink anything without risking getting mind whammied. You can't be alone with anyone without risking being turned into their eternal slave. You can't come back from being alone with anyone without being certain they didn't do unspeakable things to you and then mind wipe you. Any brief moment of confusion of stupor could be natural, or it could be someone confunding you in oder to make you vulnerable to more mind magic (since if resisting the Imperius is a matter of will, being confunded beforehand probably makes that a lot harder); and the list goes on and on. Rowling created a wonderful, whimsical world, but honestly I don't think she really considered if it was one normal people and society could actually function in.

In America we can't even handle guns being readily accessible without having to deal with school shootings. Could you imagine what would really happen, if instead we gave every kid all powerful mega-tools, taught them all the incantations for morally terrifying mind magic just as puberty was hitting full steam (I think Harry and the others learn the incantation for Imperio at around 13), and then locked them all in a boarding school together?

Anyways, this was a wonderful, wonderful piece of fiction, and your writing skills are excellent :)

*** Thanks :). I love the appreciation!

With regards to mind magic, yeah, I get the impression that while trying to keep herself out of narrative trouble by not inventing too many counters for it (which would have made her job harder) JKR actually dug herself way too deep and made a setting that's unworkable. Mad Eye Moody is way too right to be so paranoid. Would have made more sense if Imperiused people could be detected, or Imperius could be shielded. Though there's always the counter Harry uses in Significant Digits, namely [[#s][SD spoilers]].

As for the curse itself, HP & co. see it from fake!Moody in year 4, so I think they were 14. But they only learn the incantation: doesn't mean they necessarily learn the /spell/. Avada Kedavra for example needs hate to be cast, and controlling one's emotion at a command seems a complex skill. It's possible that Imperius requires a will to command or something like that? Still, probably ridiculously easy for such a broken ability (in fact, far more broken and dangerous than either the Cruciatus or the Killing Curse, both of which whose effects could at least be approximated with mundane, non-magical methods).

** And here I was suspicious of Lestrade because of his name. This was great!

**** Also one of the few regulars that always get carried over in the adaptations. In fact it's pretty usual to have him be the cop that Holmes always takes the piss off.

***** ...I think that that's Holmesian canon, too. Holmes never had a great opinion of the guy's intelligence.

*** Oh, because Lestrade/Lestrange. I wonder how is it that there are so many pureblood wizards with French names... guess they're all descendants from that William the Conqueror group (the Malfoys are canon as such). This actually reminds me, what would be /really/ awesome is some alternate history of the wizarding world. Just like we know Grindenwald was the wizard side of WW2... what was it like during the Hundred Years War? Or the War of the Two Roses? Who were the first wizards that went to America? And so on. There's a lot of potential material, especially if you're a big enough history geek that you can tie together all these events in a clever way.
