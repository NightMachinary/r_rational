** D&D magic in all of its brokenness is taken to its logical extremes. If you like harry potter and the natural 20 you'll probably like this. One of the main factions exploits those rules to end transhumanist.

*** I'm enjoying it quite a bit. The narrator/protagonist is maybe a bit overly snarky, but some people are actually just that way sometimes!

**** [author here]

Thanks to both of you! I'm glad you like it. Yep, Jake is snarky. Also, in the last chapter or two he's turned into a bit of a schmuck. Stay tuned.

** I read the whole thing in the last day and a half. Totally worth it if you like HPMOR and HP and the natural 20. Absolutely hilarious.

** This is very good, and I wish it would become longer by several orders of magnitude... It really is too bad that [[#s][Somewhere]] he didn't succeed and completely conquer everything. I do suppose it was necessary for the plot to survive, though.

Definitely worth reading.

*** Heh. Yeah, had I pushed the "Jake Wins" button at that time, the story would be over.

As to it becoming several orders larger -- well, we are currently at the start of act 2 in a 3 act story. It's definitely going to get longer. I don't know about several orders, though.

I'm flattered that you want it, though. If you're interested, I've written a spinoff story called "One Hot Night", which is on sale for $1 over at [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com]]. (If I get a moderate number of sales, I'll write more.) It's based on a reference that Albrecht made about his grandnephew a while ago; the blurb is something like this:

"Ingfred is a 20-something in a society of immortals. All the good jobs are taken and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, comparatively, an infant. So, he sets out to prove himself (and get ridiculously rich in the process). His goal? Arrange to undergo an illegal transformation, then sell the memory to The Experiential Herald -- something of a tabloid -- for a ridiculous amount of money. Problem is, the transformation is illegal, so how can he convince a High Mage to do it for him? Well, first he needs to convince the High Mage's bookie to help out. Things go downhill from there."

**** Well, I read far too fast anyways...

I probably will check out the spin off sometime. I've got almost nothing else to read, in any case.

I'm not familiar with D&D rules, but would it have been possible for him to make a Wish like 'I wish for a magic item that makes it impossible for any god(or servants, or demons, or whatever) to harm me,' and survive, if he did it before they got there? As I said, I don't know the rules and this may be a stupid question.

***** The wording of Wish is "can create or add to the powers of a magic item". So, technically there's no rule against such an item. In practice no DM would allow it and, as an author, I can't allow it either because it would remove all the tension from the story. This is why I nerfed those Wishes as hard as I did...the ones he used have a lot of room for creative application and abuse, but they aren't so totally broken that the story ends.

****** Thanks. 'I wish for an indestructible magic item that prevents the DM or any characters controlled by him or anyone else from doing damage to my character or changing the way I developed it.'

**** I think I found another way to win the game, via your economic system:

1. Put 100% tax on people who sell [item you need]

2. Order top level craftsman to sell you [item you need].

3. Buy [item you need].

4. Collect tax.

5. Repeat 3 and 4 until you're satisfied with the mountain of stuff you have.

Since the gods don't kill the Flobovians for producing cuirasses out of thin air, this should be okay. Also, this works with spells, since spellcasters can be hired.

** I lost interest in this story a while ago. At some point, it really should have stopped trying to add more and more stuff and just gone ahead with what it had. [[#s][]] I decided that I was done.

*** Ah, pity. I'm sorry it didn't work for you. The gods getting involved was necessary for upcoming plot, but I can understand how it might have been a turnoff.

I hope you've found something you like better.
