Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

Ideally something I can navigate on my smartphone, ideally something where the content isn't just brainless memes. (I have reddit for that.)

** The Worm fanfiction [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/camera-shy-worm-alt-power.685357/][Camera Shy]] is funny if you have read Worm. Taylor is blind but gains the ability to see from cameras and other people's eyes when they see her. She uses her jump scare superpower to horrify everyone.

*** I found this a slog to get through.

The problem is that even once the narrative establishes how Taylor uses her power to move through an environment, it still insists on describing every little power use, movement and repositioning in excruciating detail, instead of letting the reader figure it out.

It's like continuing to describe walking by listing individual muscle contractions, instead of abstracting and saying "OK, now you understand how the baby manages to walk. So what happens next is that it walks from /A/ to /B/ to /C/".

With their wits, their will, and their newly built Dungeon to protect them against the Iridescence, they should be fine. If they can survive the wild animal attacks. And the supply shortages.

After that he goes on to found a kingdom and introduce modern tech, but I haven't gotten there yet.

I'm still in the early chapters so can't say how good it is, and the translation isn't great, but it's clear the author/SI is very knowledgeable about ancient greece.

/Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan/ (Chronicles of The Hardships of Komachi in The Sengoku Era) is a manga/LN that is about a girl who studies agriculture being transported back to Japan in the 1560s. I prefer the manga over the LN, since the way Japanese write (stylistically) doesn't really translate to English.

** I'll start off with a new one, [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/46095/][Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song]] I have only seen the anime (2 episodes so far) so I can't speak to how well it maintains its tone if a Manga or LN exist for it.

Classic AI / Time Travel shenanigans, with the caveat that AI here are very utility function bound. They have a singular purpose, and fulfill it. So the AI sent back in time has the goal to (seemingly) stop AI development at all costs, while his accomplice is a Singer android. Her purpose is to sing and make people smile.

She eventually helps out of a want to continue singing, and making people smile, but not in an ignorant of the rest of the world kind of way.

I'm enjoying it as so far the only main characters are AI, and they have sometimes opposing secondary goals / methods for approaching a problem due to their differing 'missions'.

The animation is good as well, I'm going to keep watching.

This is the sequel to Apocalypse: Generic System, a decent litRPG that I thought was reasonably intelligent. In this one the main character has been kicked out of the main RPG system, and is sort of poking around in the guts of the system without actually using it directly---he now gains power through dealmaking, a la the fey. I enjoyed it, sometimes I had questions about the worldbuilding, but it's so much better than most worldbuilding in this genre I had few complaints.

I listed it as a suggestion in the recommendation thread a few weeks ago, and I keep going back and forth on it. I really enjoyed it for the first few dozen chapters, then it felt like a repetitive slog to the point where I almost was going to write a follow-up recommending /against/ reading it, but then after 100 chapters the main plot finally started moving forward again and it got me hooked. Now up to about chapter 117 and I'm still really invested in it.

******* Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog? When I started reading it I had a lukewarm opinion until book 1 ending. From then it has been a steady increase in quality to what it is now. Chapter 120 is one of my favorite chapters from a fic on RR. I did find some of the Daydropper arc a bit of a slog but looking back it was more because I was expecting Ar'Kendrythist to be an action novel instead of a slice of life with moments of action.

  Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog?
#+end_quote

I felt like a good 60+ chapters of the book was a repetition of "a new character asks for Erick's help, he immediately runs to assist in a new location, develops a new magic to solve the issue, gets a power up, and then never uses his new magic again and the new characters only get mentioned from time to time." Rinse and repeat. There are some breaks, like the Jane PoV chapters, but generally speaking it feels like Erick gets pulled into a new direction every time the author has something else he wants to focus on.

How about a dozen chapters on growing citrus trees and chocolate? Dragons keep getting mentioned; let's have some chapters about dragon essence! We've mentioned other countries and cities - let's have some arcs where Erick or Jane go visit Oceanside or hunt unicorns so we can show other places off! How about a town management section?

Now, don't get me wrong, the world building and exploration of the magic system are some of the strongest points of the novel. But it feels like Marty Stu Erick is constantly getting pulled into B plots that leave a lot of the interesting plot hooks and characters to languish. I liked his growing relationship with Al, but then he hardly gets a mention for dozens of chapters. I wanted to explore more of Ar'Kendrithyst (the city itself), but it took the story almost 100 chapters to finally get back around to it. The most recent arc puts Erick solo, meaning no mention of Poi or Teresa or Kiri or Jane or any of the characters we've grown to care about. Meanwhile at the Feast, we get introduced to dozens of new characters, many of who only show up once or twice while Erick continues learning new magic at a rate that baffles the best practitioners in the world; his Marty Stu status grows and grows.

I guess it feels like ADHD (which I have). The author gets an idea in his head and HAS to focus on it, dropping everything else to do so. The pacing gets really messed up, and while the topics the author focuses on are /usually/ interesting, I don't find them interesting enough to justify dropping the other interesting things that had been brought up long, long before. Erick's been made into the vehicle the author uses to explore all the parts of his fantasy world, but I want to know Erick's story, not go off on a tangent quest about a crime syndicate that puts bombs in children who are part of a society I didn't even know existed until over 100 chapters into the novel.

**** Well, I'm not disagreeing buuutt... covers are like really, /really/ important and these clearly work well despite the cringe. Arguably, covers are more important than even the book's synopsis. This is because, particularly in the kindle/ebook environment, competition is fierce and you need to convince a scrolling potential reader to click on your book instead of all the other books they're presented with. There are two, dead-simple strategies to do so:

- *People like people, especially faces.* Our meat-brains are evolutionarily programmed to respond strongly to other people, and in particular, faces and their emotions. This is why so many youtubers put big, emotive, faces in their thumbnails--it draws clicks.

- *Sex sells.* It sounds a bit eugh but just like people like faces, people like looking at attractive people. Putting scantly clad women and eight-pack adorned men on covers often comes across as tasteless, but it works, time and time again. More specifically, it attracts more readers than it turns away, so it works.

#+begin_quote
  You're arguing that the movie outright changes the setting by adding in free will.
#+end_quote

It doesn't add free will. It just undermines the severity of the "obligation" to do what has already been done. In the book it's much more clear that she has no "choice" but the brain is happy to make it seem like she "chose" to do so anyway.

That's all I'm saying. That the choice to present the child's illness as a disease instead of as an accident is an explicit shying away from the metaphysical nature, and even message or thematic core, of the book.

There is more than just that but it's the most obvious change.

#+begin_quote
  I think the movie uses the same rules,
#+end_quote

Yes, I agree. The movie uses the same rules, she never does anything that would "break" the continuum. But, unlike the book where it's very very clear that she couldn't break it even if she wanted to, in the movie it's much less obvious than that because all of the "choices" she made are things reasonable people would make anyway.

Unlike allowing your kid to get hit by a car for no reason, which nobody would do unless they literally and physically could not do otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  You claim evidence of absence, I say there's just less evidence than in the book.
#+end_quote

I am saying the second thing not the first thing.

You cannot interpret the book as having free will in it, but the movie really emphasises that she is CHOOSING to have a kid because it's worth it. As if she has a choice. Which is why as my example was the layman who just accepts (or does not consider) free will and knows nothing about principles or determinism or paradoxes will not find their perspective challenged unlike the book where you simply cannot ignore it.

I watched the movie and read the story years ago so I'm remembering mostly what I already wrote about it.

**************** Out of bed myself, so I can articulate better as well.

I get the concept, but in another sense, the movie's approach actually is /more/ rational.

As you pointed out, death by car accident is easily avoidable with a very short term intervention (just don't send her to school). Since by that point the MC knows heptapod, her time perspective should now be global. So her "decisions" (whatever that means in this atemporal perspective) should be self-consistent. Now the most obvious reaction to knowing that would be not to send the daughter to school, as you say. But to do so means not having the foreknowledge, which means sending her, which means she dies... etc. It's not self-consistent.

On the other hand, however, there's a perfectly consistent option that saves the daughter too: the MC just thinking randomly to not send her to school for unrelated reasons. For example, they organise an outing for that day. Maybe a bit random and uncharacteristic. But why would this be /less/ likely than a mother simply fatalistically accepting the death of her daughter? To bring up a comparison with the time turner in HPMOR - leaving the daughter to die is the numbers being factored. Randomly deciding to not send her to school is "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" written in slightly shaky handwriting. The latter sounds a lot less complex.

Conversely, in the movie's version, the dilemma is real. The disease is part of who the daughter is. Even if genetic pre-natal screening was a possibility, the resulting daughter /would be a different person/. So there's no third way out here, even with foreknowledge. The only two alternatives are to either have the daughter, and take the good with the bad, or give it all up. And the choice that she ends up making being self-consistent is a lot more believable; especially considering how in her new state of timelessness (which probably includes seeing her own death), death itself takes a new meaning, becoming not an end, but a boundary. Sure, she only has 20-something years with her daughter. But they'll be forever there; they don't just "pass" somehow and vanish in the past. They're as real as anything else to her, every single moment of her life.

Right, so it's a completely separate dilemma. Or rather, in the book the point is that there is no dilemma because there's no choice and the movie as you say makes it seem like there's a dilemma when the MC has no choice but to have her daughter.

She isn't "accepting" it. She cannot not accept it. That is the message of the book. For example, if I plugged an electrode into your spine and then walked your body to the door. Your mind would then say "I wanted to walk to the door, I chose to walk to the door." That is the equivalent of experiencing time in this fashion.

  She isn't "accepting" it. She cannot not accept it. That is the message of the book.
#+end_quote

The book explicitly mentions Fermat's principle and the least action principle as examples of how atemporal physics work. Look at it from a purely physical viewpoint. The brain is just a configuration of atoms. A series of actions is just a way in which these atoms can arrange themselves and interact. Except that in a quantum mechanical world, /all/ paths are potentially real and weighed by their own action; so random fluctuations and small deviations from classical determinism are justified if they result in lowering the overall action of the path.

So you have two possible paths:

- one, the daughter is sent to school, dies, and the mother accepts her death despite knowing it beforehand without acting to stop it;

- two, the daughter is randomly not sent to school on that day, for reasons unknown

Both these paths require the mother to take an action that would be unusual from her standard behavioural pattern. In other words, we expect there to be something like a potential barrier to both these possible paths, which will increase their action. Which one ends up winning out? The major factor in play is: which one has the /lowest/ potential barrier, and which one has more different realisations (so, higher entropy: there are more microconfigurations of the path that lead to the same fundamental outcome). And it seems to me that both these factors weigh in favour of option two. The mental resistance needed to decide "fuck school, let's go have a picnic today!" is much lower than that needed to decide "I know my daughter will die and must accept this fate" (never mind that as you say there is no choice; for the path to be self-consistent, the me-that-believes-there-is-a-free-will must also believe to have freely chosen that path). And there are a lot more ways in which that second path can be accomplished. By all means, I would expect option two to be the one the universe settles on, as a matter of optimisation. This being just physics at work; no free will required whatsoever. But we need to at least accept that the human brain is configured in ways that oppose a potential barrier to certain courses of action more than others, which is entirely legitimate and in fact matches observed reality: people don't act randomly, they have patterns.

#+begin_quote
  two, the daughter is randomly not sent to school on that day, for reasons unknown
#+end_quote

Could this not have happened literally every other day right? Every day she avoided her daughter's death because of the universe "solving" the equation in a "simpler" way by having her be spontaneous she wouldn't have any memory of. And since the context of the universe solving these problems is literally the grand waveform level I don't know that one instance of least action

If she has a picnic that day then the next time her kid dies she has to do something else to avoid it. And then you get to someone else learning it who's like "I know that I can make billions on this stock and must accept it"

But the biggest problem I see with that is:

Since she can see the future of every single moment then I don't think "accepting her death" is that weird. She already has to accept every action, from lifting her hand, which she already has a memory of, or stubbing her toe, every moment of her entire life is her accepting the future and "performing" her role in it. She starts crying when she gets to the point that she remembers she was crying, she bites her lip accidentally when she remembers doing so, she feels happy when she remembers feeling happy, etc.

If it is the case that humans or any creature who experiences time completely "accepts" their future then it makes sense that the universe would use this to resolve time loop problems by having those creatures do any random thing, including randomly travelling to a specific part of the universe (ie Earth).

Edit: My analogy would be that every human is on a railway track. Learning the alien language simply allowed her to see the rails, that's literally all it did. Since it isn't possible for her not to cope with it (unless that was the path of the tracks), or to jump off the train or do anything else but travel onward at 1s per second, so it doesn't matter how unusual the actions are in context of the future knowledge because anyone with future knowledge will already have accepted it so it only matters the context of someone without knowledge in which case having the picnic is weirder than just doing your normal day.

That's true, and I brought it up when discussing the movie. But still, 40 years with a person would be more happiness than 20, even in an atemporal perspective.

I would still expect her to have a strong preference for her daughter NOT dying (she does seem sad after all). The point is that in the book she has a clear choice that avoids her daughter's death.

She's on a railway track whose design must take into account that from a certain point onward she will be able to see the railway track, which in turn affects the shape of the railway track, for a sufficient number of iterations until the shape stabilises. The book makes it look like instead there is an outside authority that simply decided her "fate" and she can only accept it, and knowing makes no difference. But in real life, even if this may be entirely deterministic, past information affects our actions. The part where it feels like free will may not exist is the deterministic aspect. So her actions should be similarly deterministic, but determined by both past /and/ future information.

It's not living beings. It's consciousness, just a by-product of matter, not something that does anything. Seeing time all at once doesn't actually give you the knowledge it just changes how you experience it. If we accept time travel is solvable at all then it must be the case that all that's happening is her consciousness is different, otherwise as you say it makes no sense at the atomic or quantum level where electrons will simply never align to be internally consistent with a single pass. If learning the language means electrons are sent back in time it is practically impossible due to the complexity for that same electron to bounce its way back to the exact spot it was. One maybe, but trillions?

My understanding is that all that changed was her perspective, nothing is actually different. Learning a language doesn't let you see the future.

As I said it has been a while.

  Right but there's a million things you could do with future knowledge that you'd be constantly changing things. I'm to believe that someone does the exact same movement that they remembered doing? It doesn't work if you think they can implement the future knowledge in any way.

No, but they don't remember the details of the movement. Again, the HPMOR example is funny but IMHO perfect. When Harry copies "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" in slightly shaky handwriting, does he purposefully try to reproduce every single wiggle? Of course not. His hand is just shaking because he's nervous. But the paper will come out with the same exact text, down to the single molecule of ink; it /has/ to.

  Right which is why the movie is just about free will and having the choice to do something which is completely different from having no choice at all. If you're choosing in the waveform simplification process then you're still choosing
#+end_quote

All the "choosing" that is being done here is that the individual, having certain pathways established in the brain that encode what we call a "personality", will be more likely to do certain things rather than others. This is an easily verified empirical fact: without it, the very concept of people having a self would make no sense. If you think this much is enough to talk about free will, then free will exists, no question. Declaring this to be false would be thinking that the Queen of the United Kingdom, at the funeral of her recently deceased husband, is equally likely to give a mournful speech in his honour or to pull down her dress and take a shit. I believe we all agree which of the two courses of action is /highly/ more likely.

Yes, that is why both the book and the movie are actually quite silly in their core conceit. But if you accept the outrageous proposition that /somehow/ learning a certain alien language allows your consciousness to become atemporal, to the point where you can have visions of your yet-to-be-born child, or one such alien can come to Earth to establish an alliance for the sake of solving a future problem, then I can see no way to avoid the fact that somehow, information /is/ travelling back in time. The way it's depicted in the movie and book, this is what's happening. And so we also have that for example as soon as humanity learns heptapod, P = NP, with all the fun consequences of that.

A more accurate example would be to refer to the properties of the potential it's navigating in, but yes, sure. Which is why I'm saying that there's no incompatibility between doubting the concept of strong free will and admitting that the choices of an individual trapped in a self-consistent time loop ought still to depend strongly on who that individual is, what their priorities are, etc.

** I'll preface all this by saying that the first several floors of the Dungeon Crawler Carl novel on RoyalRoad have been removed from the site since the author published them on Kindle, so you have to buy the released volumes or through... other means if you want the whole story. I do think it's very worth it though. Also sorry for the upcoming wall of text, it's a bad habit of mine.

I've been catching up with the RoyalRoad novel, Dungeon Crawler Carl, and I've been really surprised by it. It does some unique things I think no other series does. It leans into over the top, absurd, bizarre, and quirky humor, but unlike other series where it's always cringe or overstays its welcome or doesn't mesh with the plot, DCC avoids all of these issues.

It's a series about humanity pretty much being instantly destroyed because of a contract or debt that just expired or such after starting in like ancient times, and the survivors are forced into a massive Dungeon and fight through the levels to serve as amusement for the rest of the universe. All the while the Dungeon and monsters and levels all "use" human culture, or whatever bastardized version the aliens see it as. There's also programs about human culture aired to the universe as well, all mostly very misrepresentative and derogatory towards humanity.

The Dungeon and crawl has ridiculous lootboxes, stupid achievement names, ridiculous items and equipment, monsters ranging from drug dealing llamas to KraKarens to a giant rolling ball made out of a bunch of noble(actual nobility) orcs all in one massive orgy all wearing BDSM gear to a feral duck that has an aura that nullifies all magic, special effects, and equipment buffs, while also being completely immune to physical damage, and so on. There's a sand mage weeb who wants to turn his sex doll to a real human and accidentally unleashes an evil god, and other completely nonsensical things. There's a town inhabited by camel beings in the current level, and it's called Hump Town. Of course, it's only business is prostitution, which is run by changelings.

The thing though, I think this all /works/. It's completely ridiculous, yes, but I never find it too overbearing or awkward or stale, even though I was not at all a fan of other comedy-oriented popular novels on RoyalRoad like Vanquier the Dragon, which has a lot of the problems I mentioned at the beginning.

This humor actually works really well with the story as well. The remnants of humanity go through this cruel entertainment for the rest of the universe, on top of the dead corpse of humanity which is being paraded around by them. The bizarreness of the ridiculous stuff, like tiny flesh eating weasels being shot out tubes, really clashes with how dark and fucked it is, like when said tiny flesh eating weasels enter a person and eat them from the inside out.

And the MC and his plans and the combat is actually pretty competent. The gimmick of the Dungeon Crawl season the MC is part of has the gimmick of infinite storage, and he really abuses it. I'm never left annoyed or unsatisfied watching him trying to progress, as he's simultaneously careful, but is still great in chaotic scenarios where things go wrong(and as you can imagine, things always go wrong in this fucked in situation). His main motivation and focus is on "They will not break me," and vows to return it to the bastards that destroyed and desecrated humanity and its grave, which I feel was well done too.

I'm honestly surprised at how well DCC mixes bizarre humor, a serious and dark plot, and competent action and game-like abilities.

A recent arc highlights this blend that I think is really done well. A sponsor gifts one of the main characters, a talking cat, a robot toy version of herself, which quotes her, but is also pretty crappy so it mixes in Garfield quotes. But, instead of Garfield quotes, it says I'mSorryJon sort of things. It's also crappily made and explodes easily, as said cat's dinosaur pet shows several times. This is basically a joke whenever a newer model shows up and inevitably explodes, but it plays into the plot later on as well, in a beautiful way.

The MC decides to take his first step, and begins setting up the pieces and steps. When he makes a smoke curtain and it "accidentally" gets used right on top of him and the robot cat, it turns its head around to stare perfectly at the MC through all the smoke and says a fitting ominous line. When he's about to show up for an important interview and ad filming, the robot cat turns around to them and tells them something along the line of "death comes for us all".

[[https://imgur.com/a/3dlCVQe][These little excerpts]] were honestly surprising and touching, especially with how it interweaves the previously over the top ridiculous humor into a serious plot moment. Anybody else feel similarly on this novel?

The series is nothing mindblowing like Worm or Mother of Learning, but I do greatly enjoy it for using all these elements and making it actually work, especially with me hating over the top comedy novels. I've been wanting to talk about DCC for months but just couldn't find the time or the words for it. I'd even put this above Super Minion and on the same tier as the likes of Journey of Black and Red for how good and unique it is.

*** I liked your wall of text.

I think the story works because it balances two layers, a serious layer in which Carl has to think strategically and wrestle with the ongoing tragedy as an existential issue, and the layer of the farce, which is only mildly entertaining in itself, but which is aesthetically self-consistent and provides a lot of grist for the strategic layer. Dumb jokes can be introduced as jokes, and they flesh out the motivations of the organizers, the AI, the political factions, and so on, but they also are details that a shrewd Carl can take advantage of, or which provide clues to the current scenario. The book also does a (really) good job at foreshadowing, where threats are telegraphed and then come to fruition at appropriate times. It doesn't usually feel as if the author is just making things up in the moment. I also like how Carl is always on the hunt for new strategic options, he never breaks the system completely open, which always winds up being unsatisfying except in a denoument, but scrounges up enough new options to move forward.

Maybe because it's so unique that it doesn't really fit into anyone's requests for specific genre/story type recommendations? I dunno but more people should read it. I started it after the first book was only out on Amazon and I did not regret buying it even a little bit.

Definitely the case for me. It's not even a secret, it just feels so well-known despite little coverage that I didn't see the point in making a rec. It's on the second page of best-rated RR works, so anyone with even a tiny inclination towards LitRPGs has probably read it already---at least, that was my reasoning for not talking about it.

But I'm going to second the rec now. It's the best LitRPG I've ever read precisely because it's popcorn-y as heck, in a good way. It's very, /very/ engagingly written.

Carl's background is sometimes a bit too tragic for my suspension of disbelief, but the way the author ties in his childhood trauma with story moments and later on Carl slowly moving forward is touching. Even Carl's mantra of "They will not break me. They will never break me. I will break them." never feels grating or undeserved.

The closest thing I can compare it to is Patriot the TV show. That mix of tragic and tragically hilarious.

Which counts for shit since he doesn't try to improve himself and keeps holding the idiot ball. Admittedly, some of his plans fail hilariously (forgets to pose outside hero tower during time-stop run lol) and I could rationalize it as a normal man having his nerves fritz in high-intensity situations but there is a limit to how many times I can do it before it breaks my suspension of disbelief.

Hell, his whole reason for not sitting one loop out and watching the aftermath (who knows, maybe the perpetrator will out themselves) rather than running idiotically into the fray loop after loop when the bombs can kill even the top heroes is because it's morally his duty to save everyone. (MC doesn't like how he might be killing people with his inaction even if his ability might not spawn new universes where the people are dead.) Now I agree with the duty part but to pursue it so badly despite knowing he might be dooming millions of people each run tells me it's nothing more than a feel-good reason: Oh praise me because I'm trying to save the world. We don't even conclusively know if the bombing is happening only in his city or throughout the world!

The whole 'you should sit out this run and try to gather more information to formulate a better plan because the fewer loops it takes you to solve the mystery, the fewer people die and you can be morally satisfied that you helped save more people' was discussed in one chapter and the very next chapter MC ditched it.

Just gonna note that this is re-visited later and the MC actually /does/ end up doing it and agreeing that it's the right thing to do. Mostly against his will, initially, but still. I'm just counting it as a character flaw. It's made pretty clear in-story that his position is pretty much wrong, IMO.

*** My personal favorite is the series “So I'm a Spider, So What?” It's an isekai featuring a high school girl reincarnating into a spider in a fantasy world. Her classmates were also reincarnated, but that's reaching into the overarching plot. It's my favorite isekai and litrpg, and I love the author's take on it. Some people in previous weeks had some problems with it, but for a light novel series, the author does some truly exceptional things.

You should know how lazy isekais and litrpgs are in lightnovels and animes, it's always the same template worlds and plotlines, the same tropes and cardboard cutouts, the same lazily implemented game mechanics to be cool. I really love how Spider approaches all this by actually making an isekai where the elements really matter. Where it's important that there's always a Hero and a Demon Lord, both recognized by the System, clashing. Why there's a game system, why this typical isekai element exists, and so on. In one moment when the MC gets a notification that an Administrator makes a skill just for her, she realizes how strange it is that there even is a game system in the world, and that there's apparently at least someone managing it, and watching it, and realizes that such a being would basically be a god. The human reincarnations also wonder why all the skills are explicitly used for war and combat. The reincarnations actually realize how strange and unnatural all this is, instead of just taking it for granted like basically every other series.

The System and game-like elements are done fantastically. I suppose there might be some gripes or issues people may have with it, but I honestly think there are no plotholes regarding it. The battles are clever, and everything from the beginning to the end, powerscaling, and the power of other characters is well-defined and explained. There's no stupid things like "MC uses the System the Gods invented to kill said Gods" like you might typically see. It also relates heavily to the overarching plot and story, and I love how it's used to play into the mysteries and unraveling the truth. The System and game mechanics are done a lot better than most of the popular RoyalRoad litrpgs even imo(well of course excluding Delve's System).

I like how the MC is written as well, she's really one of the main things selling the series. She's your typical antisocial high school gamer, and gets reincarnated in terrible conditions. Her narration and personality are fantastic and full of life, and really works well with how light novels are typically written. If I talk about what I like about her, I'd spend several paragraphs, so I'll just say there's a good reason why fans all love her so much.

There's so much more I could say about this series, but I'll end off with a passage from an interview with the author about an "interesting" decision he made with a certain early-game opponent:

Editor: Speaking of which, how come the Araba fight ended like that? In many "rising to the top”-type stories the protagonist feels good after they gathered enough power to defeat the final boss, but the Araba fight was nothing like that.

[Baba: I wanted to embed the message that "winning is different from victory”

Editor: Different from victory, you say?

Baba: Winning against Araba was fully Kumoko's personal feeling, while Araba didn't have any self-interest in that battle. Kumoko was able to overcome her trauma by defeating Araba, but I thought about what that victory meant if I looked at it from bird's-eye view. And so I had the unease that, if she was able to defeat and overcome her trauma known as Araba, then it means that Araba was nothing more than a hurdle with the sole purpose of making Kumoko satisfied? I thought no, Araba should have his own way of life. So I didn't use him as a hurdle and tool to make Kumoko feel good.

Editor: Looking at it now, that might have been unsatisfactory if she had won there normally.

Baba: I also wanted to make it into a "meaningful battle” for Kumoko, so she would live on in the from then on precisely because of her battle with Araba. I thought that after leaving the labyrinth and fighting various powerful enemies, the existence of Araba would get blurry with time. Her battle with Araba turned Kumoko into who she is today. His warrior-like way of life definitely influenced Kumoko's way of thinking, and I think that's the reason Araba turned into such a memorable character.]

And this opponent is a Dragon who never says a single word throughout the series.

There's an anime of it currently airing too! It has some...issues, but most fans are happy with it, and I will also add that it leaves out a lot of the details and explanations that elevate this series to the next level in terms of concept.

*** My personal favorites are Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria (also known as HakoMari) and Overlord.

Overlord has an anime and is more well known, in it the MC is isekaid to a fantasy world with the same mechanics and servants of a MMO he used to play with his friends. Very OP MC and very dark, though it may not look like it at the beginning. You may like it if you liked the misunderstandings of Tanya the Evil and aren't completely oversaturated with OP main characters. Rich and interesting world, often more detailed than the protagonists.

HakoMari has seven or so volumes, and each one of them has a "theme" or "game". The first volume has time shenanigans going on, and it's not told in a chronological order. Can also get pretty fucking dark, though your millage may vary. If I had to describe it in a sentence, it's kinda like a mix between oregairu and a misery murder?

Really really good, not sure if the english translation is up to standards. The first volume was probably my favourite, so if you end up not disliking it not sure if it's your type.

Each volume deals with a specific situation that can be solved and thought by the reader, with a main group of characters, each of them with defined but changing goals and personalities to which shit happens.

For another type of overview, a being is making people's wishes reality, and this is a very bad thing.

Also often recommended is Spice and Wolf, which is a ... economic slice of life romance? Something like that, haven't read it.

**** Highly recommend spice and wolf if you're looking for a relaxing slice of life romance. Not too much drama and lots of fun banter.

**** I've had discussions and put forward recommendations myself in previous weeks for Overlord, I might find one of the detailed ones and edit a link in here later once I'm at my computer, bht it's important to point out that the author of Overlord is definitely weird.

I mean volume 4 is about the main character taking over a series of Lizardma tribes that are dramatically weaker, basically as a test run to make sure everything is working right. It's a stepping stone the average novel author would spend maybe 5 chapters at most on, and instead Maruyama writes a whole novel on it. And ~90% of it from Lizardman's perspective. So there's definitely a weird take on worldbuilding and character perspectives across the novel, and temporary viewpoint shifts, or ones that last the majority of a novel or two, regularly happen. Also Neia is the protagonist of novels 12 and 13 and she is definitely Best Girl imo, so yes, the perspectives and characters are capable of being very engaging.

***** It's probably useful to know that Maruyama is largely just adapting old D&D campaigns him and his friends had, then stretching them to make them fit the Overlord setting. I still find the series enjoyable, but it's definitely helpful to understand why he dedicated entire volumes of the series to plots that don't particularly advance the story of Overlord.

****** Oh, I hadn't heard of that. I did hear though that part of the reason for staying anonymous was because too many of his characters were based of his co-workers in his office day job.

** With having run across the SPFBO I now have a bunch of /good/ Kindle Unlimited books to read, but I'm still short on some entertaining trash. Anyone have recs? Pretty much my only requirements are that it be well-written and that there be at least some characters who treat each other decently. (Kindle Unlimited specifically.)

edit - I'm also always looking for dungeon core stories with non-murderhobo cores. I've already read or am reading Oasis Core, Blue Core, the Taylor "Woke Up As A Dungeon" story, and No Epic Loot.

*** You might enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon][A Lonely Dungeon]]. The basic premise is what follows when a normal dungeon is born, prepares itself with all the normal traps and monsters, and then ... nobody shows up.

*** Ok....you are making me consider re-signing up for KU, which I tried a few years ago and dropped after giving up on sifting through the trash. How good on average are the submissions (not necessarily the winners, but the general list, or the group of finalists or whatever is a reasonable set)?
