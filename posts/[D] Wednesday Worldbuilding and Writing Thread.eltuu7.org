Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Back in 2013 I started writing a fantasy novel, and I've recently dusted it off. The central magic system is very simple, with the magically gifted saying specific spells which cause static effects. There's no element of creativity in being a spellcaster except how you use those effects, very little interaction between spells, etc. Most of being a caster is memorizing the hundred-some known spells and figuring out which ones you're going to use at any given moment, sharpening your diction and response times, and employing various tricks that specifically counter other spells or aid your spells.

In some sense, each of these spells is its own magic system unto itself, with some of the overarching structure being dictated by the rules of the large system (e.g. spells must be spoken without interruption between syllables, above a certain decibel level, etc.).

I recently went through what's been written so far, about 60K words, and a plucked out all of the references to spells, adding them to a spreadsheet to ensure that there aren't any gaping holes where spell X should have been used in situation Y. This is all well and good so far, but there are remarked to be 163 known spells, and my spreadsheet only has 50 of them. A complete list of all known spells and their effects isn't necessary, I know ... but I still want to do it.

So, anyone got any spells that aren't likely to break an existing plot, especially one that includes some small amount of military action? Currently the bounds are:

- Creates food and water (~4 variants)
- Changes form to be an animal (~6 variants)
- Creates materials (rope and chairs)
- Creates temporary shields of a few varieties
- Energy-related attacks
- Projects force for attacks, motive power, or labor
- Speeds up natural healing by a factor of 3
- Makes a flashlight
- Lights a fire

So anything else will need to be within those bounds, as exceeding any of them would likely require a new spell to be included in the actual text itself.

(I lost a lot of enthusiasm for the project when /Unsong/ came out, as it had a bit of the same ideas, but when I read back when I'd written six or seven years ago I though it was pretty good, or could become so with editing and alteration.)

*** Hmm, so basically spells which are more or less useless from the plot's perspective, but presumably have a niche use /somewhere/. That means things with direct combat usage are probably out unless they have a severe drawback or have been eliminated from common military use for some other reason. Logistics spells are similarly restrained, since a teleport would obviously have military uses. I assume this also eliminates scrying etc for the use of intelligence gathering.

Possible candidates:

- animal beacon which attracts nearby individuals of X species to it over a matter of hours
- plant growth +
- plant wither
- shape tree trunk growth
- alter wood post shape
- alter which fruits a plant produces
- cause flowers to bloom
- increase/decrease animal/human fertility/virility
- douse for X nearby mineral or metal
- transmute metals
- summon moderate wind
- freeze water
- still water
- douse for items hidden in water
- clear smoke
- solidify gravel into fused stone
- reduce bleeding
- pain reduction
- caffeine effect
- dry out wood
- transcribe spoken words
- identify blood relation between individuals
- water to wine
- douse for nearest population center
- spin fiber into thread
- enchant item to absorb residual heat
- enchant item to release stored heat
- weather forecasting
- light adhesion (think scotch tape)
- light grease
- water to ink
- purify water
- invisible ink
- repair spell
- homing message send
- grapple hook grip
- seal/unseal pocket seam

A lot of these could be munchkinned for combat, no doubt, but many of them could also expect to be of use behind the scenes and not during combat.

*** I can't guarantee that my spells won't break your plot since I don't know what it is. I could offer a bunch of spells that are almost useless as a way to ensure that they won't impact your plot, but that sounds boring. It also seems pointless if you don't intend to ever include any of these spells in your plot, so I'm going to suggest things that might be useful and seem likely to exist in a setting with magic. For energy-related attacks, there's the obvious ones to consider:

- Fireball: A pea-sized ember of glowing orange light bolts from your hands and slowly arcs through the air before exploding upon contact with the first thing it touches, scattering shrapnel and setting objects on fire with a boom. Range is limited by the arc, and it obviously can't be used in close-quarters combat.

- Lightning bolt: What appears to be an otherwise mundane lightning bolt shoots out of your hands and travels in a remarkably straight line until it hits the first object in its path, potentially setting it on fire. The light of the bolt can be almost blinding at night, and the thunder clap can easily cause ringing in the ears which persists for a few minutes. A powerful attack, but often not the first choice due to the light and noise that it creates.

- Gust of wind: Immediately after what seems like a flash of faint blue light, an enormous blast of air erupts in a cone in front of you. Small projectiles in the air (e.g. arrows and bolts) will be knocked away if they are within about 60 ft, including the one emitted by fireball. People within 10-15 ft. may be thrown backward by the blast. In dusty or sandy environments, a cloud may be kicked up by the spell, providing temporary concealment. (Note that if using this to deflect a fireball, the blue light will give your position away and make you an easy target for a lightning bolt.)

- Freezing jet: A continuous blast of extremely cold air shoots from your hands in a 20 ft. long jet of gas turned opaque and white by condensed water. People in the jet may quickly become frostbitten and their eyes might ice over causing temporary blindness if they don't look away. The jet can be used to embrittle metal doors or fences, to extinguish fires, and to make ice for refrigerating food or staying cool in summer.

Am I on the right track?

**** Creating spells that are /guaranteed/ not to break the plot are, of course, impossible unless you know the plot, but I do think you can come up with spells you think are /unlikely/ to break any given plot. For example, if you added readily-available invisibility to /most/ plots, you'd expect that it would break things more often than not, or at least require a fair amount of rewriting scenes.

Something like "clean the clothes you're wearing" or "gain the ability to jump five times as high for an hour" might break /some/ plots, but probably a lot less than invisibility, while still being of notable utility/flavor and having some impact on what the world looks like.

That said, typical combat spells are good, thanks for those.

*** u/TheJungleDragon:
#+begin_quote
  Morph into land octopus
#+end_quote

A simple form-changing spell that alters the caster's body into that of an octopus... That is much more suited for tree-swinging than sea-dwelling. Also comes with rudimentary camouflage and squeezing abilities, but the number of inhuman abilities and inputs means that someone who hasn't practiced with this form can find it difficult to perform basic actions.

#+begin_quote
  Skin into leather
#+end_quote

Can only be cast on skin that is currently part of a living creature. Usually kills the creature. Needs prolonged contact (maybe a minute long? This can be changed to taste). Results in some interesting fashions/torture methodologies as well as a unique form of artisan leather. I'm not sure if this would break the economy of the world, but if it would, the transformation can be made temporary.

#+begin_quote
  Churn water
#+end_quote

Designates an area that propagates in size from the mage's hands which churns water within. The larger the volume of water, the greater the churning. Would possibly see some usage in naval actions? Also perfect for spilling drinks if you happen to be the sort of person who spills drinks for fun. Probably has some niche cooking uses as well.

#+begin_quote
  Expunge chitin
#+end_quote

So long as the spell is maintained, gaps in the palms of the caster's hands open and expel chitin shards. Rate and force of expulsion can be altered as needed for story purposes.

#+begin_quote
  Magnify complex motion
#+end_quote

Part of casting this spell involves moving all limbs a minimum distance. Once the spell is complete, ghostly after-images will perform those motions on a grander scale. The greater the complexity of the motions on a limb-by-limb average, the more powerful and large the after-images will be. What the spell lacks in reliability (due to the difficulty casters have in performing the same motion time and time again) it makes up for in scale. Casters need at least four limbs to perform the spell.

#+begin_quote
  Simple Tuning Shield
#+end_quote

A temporary shield spell that can defend against material attacks. However, the shield can only tune itself to one element or molecule at a time, which to a lower tech level will appear as a defence against specific materials only. The shield tunes itself automatically to the most numerous solid or liquid that passes through it during the first few seconds of its creation, and thereafter tunes itself to any material that passes through in a quantity that exceeds that.

#+begin_quote
  Create unfortunate golem
#+end_quote

This spell takes a rabbit-sized portion of material and for a short period allows it to move as if there was animal intellect behind it. Unfortunately, it is very expensive to create a body that can actually move effectively. There's no telekinetic force or anything that moves the material, you see, it must have been capable of moving on its own, should there have been something driving it. So, save for the richest folks, the golem is quite unfortunate (for the hour or so for which it exists). There is a limit on the number of unfortunate golems one can maintain.

#+begin_quote
  Animate helpful bone
#+end_quote

A complex spell that is simple in expression. The most damaged bone in a person's body temporarily gains animal intellect and minor telekinetic force to move itself. It will then attempt to mend itself as best possible before the spell expires. The spell has the potential to be useful, but casters should beware that the intellect, although somewhat benevolent in its task, can be somewhat... Error-prone... in execution.

#+begin_quote
  Gift flammable property
#+end_quote

A spell which makes a material about as combustible as charcoal for a few hours. Tinder is still needed to light it initially. The mass of material that can be made flammable is limited.

#+begin_quote
  Toe into finger
#+end_quote

A simple spell that can transform a living toe into a digit as dexterous as a finger. Can be cast multiple times to affect multiple toes. Has a decently long period where it can be maintained, but unconsciousness cancels the spell. The transformation is seamless and harmless, but damage to the digit is maintained both before and after transformation.

#+begin_quote
  Gust Bolt
#+end_quote

The spell creates a force construct that can travel through air. While it can be guided after casting, this requires a low chant to be performed and visual on the construct's location. When the chant is ended, the construct disappears. If the construct impacts a sufficiently massive solid or liquid, it explodes outwards in force. The level of power of this explosion can be tuned as needed for story purposes. The bolt is invisible save for a wavering in the air.

Hope that at least some of these are useful for you!

*** Things that probably won't break the plot - a list of useful but not magical items from dnd [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Adventuring%20Gear#content][here]]. But that's probably too many out of the 163, and more balance between categories might be good.

In one of the last books in the Inheritance Trilogy, I think there's a spell for a light without a source that is used against the Ra'zac. (With no other illumination*) There are no shadows in the area of effect. It was used in a cave, and the boundary was a radius or 'some sense of room' that wasn't clearly demarcated. Cool spell, similar to the flashlight without having to carry it, but it makes things look weird because we're not used to seeing things like that.

*Unclear how it would function if there was. If it just brings the light to a certain level, and can be adjusted or applied more than once, then with some work, it could possibly be munchkined into unit for light (or energy if drain is experienced from using spells).

Puts out a fire. (Might want limits on size or energy - starting a fire is one thing, but putting out an inferno might be a bit much.)

Making the caster's/target's body (a little) warmer or colder. (Risk: used in combat at critical moments to make people drop things, so people fight using gloves to prevent this, etc.)

Spells with (small) effects similar to drugs.

Detecting food or water. Finding north/magnetic north/east/where the sun will rise/set.

Healing a small injury (like a scratch) - works even on delicate tissues, like if your eye got irritated.

Slight increase in strength or energy. (a la Mistborn)

The ability to make different colored lights could be used to communicate (if large enough, etc.).

The ability to fly could make a difference in a story, especially if it wasn't dangerous. The ability to have a nice dream about flying, not so much. (A spell for lucid dreaming? A good sleep? A dreamless sleep?)

A spell for shared dreams likewise (usually) has consequences. If dreams aren't portents or omens, the ability to repeat dreams, or continue them where they left off, less so. (There's a series in which the protagonist lives two lives - switching between them when they go to sleep. The really weird part is that it seems like both lives are real and at different points in time - or the main character was going crazy, I never finished the series.)

Increased or decreased speed. Feather fall. Getting people's attention (perhaps proportional to user's power/expenditure. (Used for drama or getting people to shut up. (Mistborn or 13th child (Mage draws in magical energy for a spell, and doesn't do anything with it. People notice, they start speaking and let it out slowly.))

Teleportation can affect plot a lot unless it's expensive, doesn't work at a critical time (it can be warded against), or somehow is already used almost everywhere useful. (Young Wizards.) Locating or retreiving a (minor) lost item/communing with distant entities, not so much. Powerful spells can also be just 'tricky to use', or dangerous enough no one uses them.

A spell that kills the target (if it can bleed it can be killed), but only one at a time, or which can be warded against. (Could change the balance between magic users and non-magic users - if magic users* fit certain profiles/have certain things in common, then relying on them not using certain spells make sense - consider nukes (some people conceivably wouldn't (usually) use them, even if they could).)

*Or types of magic users. (Alchemy/chemistry for making explosives/potions that explode might fit better depending on the time period, and absorb/constitute the people interested in making things explode.)

#+begin_quote
  spells must be spoken without interruption between syllables,
#+end_quote

Is it possible to work spells into non-spell phrases? For example, if a spell's verbal component is 'tisrea', then it is possible to cast the spell sneakily be saying "Tha*t is rea*lly..."?

Similarly, is it possible to produce a spell effect unintentionally, by stumbling across a certain phrasing (and how likely is this to be dangerous to the caster?)

#+begin_quote
  above a certain decibel level
#+end_quote

Is this level the same for all spells? Are there spells that produce a bubble of silence around you (but not including you, so you can still cast sneakily inside the bubble at the cost of being deaf to anything outside the bubble) or that make your voice appear to be coming from elsewhere?

[[https://phoible.org/][Phoible]] claims to describe over three thousand phonemes, out of which the English language uses [[https://phoible.org/languages/stan1293][between 39 and 45]] (depending, as far as I can tell, on dialect). This leaves a few thousand phonemes not represented at all in English. If we assume that spells are language-independent, then does this imply that speakers of other languages will have a different list of known spells? Would speakers in more phoneme-rich languages have a greater known spell list?

You could crib some notes from this. If one of the powers at stage 6 breaks the plot, just pick one of the lower power-levels. Or maybe the lower power-levels are more interesting to find creative uses for.

** I'm making a roleplaying game where the entire society is composed of dumb trolls that can regenerate any damage that isn't caused by burns. They regenerate from the largest remaining body part.

They live within a closed society managed by an unfeeling overseer AI, that mandates jobs and provides food and tech in return (forced work included). The AI has plenty of flaws, but the trolls don't have enough mental capacity for one single person to take advantage of it. The AI runs medical experiments, but is pretty good at hiding it.

Parts of the place are protected by the AI (no drawing blood, no taking stuff) and other parts are gang war zones that the AI doesn't manage (often doesn't even see).

The trolls have sci fi tech implants (created by the AI), but they think of them as fantasy magic items.

The trolls can learn skills quickly, but they have a limit on how many things they can remember. In learning something new, they flush previous knowledge. In game terms, they have a certain amount of memory, in categories: skills, relationships, blackmail, language, deductions about the AI, tech interfacing, etc.

I've come up with a few scholarly groups within this society, but I have to cover my bases because players together will be more creative than me on my own. What scholarly group would you found in this society?

*** Since the AI is producing all of the electronics, I will assume that none of the electronics can be trusted if we're making plans to subvert the AI. However, I assume the trolls are literate (or reasonably capable of learning a phonetic alphabet) and have plentiful access to paper, or possibly trollskin parchment since they could regenerate an infinite supply of that (possibly sourcing it from troll criminals)? Further, I assume they have plentiful access to ink of some sort, perhaps something like lampblack derived from troll fat (again sourced from criminals)? As long as these are true, they can essentially bypass their individual and even collective memory limits without resorting to tech provided by the AI. Using this approach may be challenging, but feasible.

Basically, treat each troll like a CPU, and treat a group of trolls in a small office like multi-core CPU. A troll's short term memory might hold the current and next task, plus 2-3 items of information. That's your L1 cache. It will have a short list on its desk which provides instructions for a basic operation loop, that's your L2 cache. Next to that, it has a tabbed folder with any frequently-referenced information or instruction sheets. That's your L3 cache. It will also have a few filing cabinets with less-frequently used information or instructions kept in numerous tabbed folders for easy access, that's your RAM. Finally, for each small office, there's a central archive room with shelves full of infrequently-used data and instruction sheets, that's your hard drive.

With this setup, you could take a difficult problem and basically use something akin to an object-oriented or functional programming approach to decompose the problem into successively smaller and easier chunks until you're left with pieces that can be easily managed by the trolls.

Due to the nature of their memory, the trolls will obviously benefit from intense specialization, so an organization like this would do best to grow rapidly. As it does so, it would be best to begin setting up large-scale centralized specialty archives, e.g. a personnel archive, a tech interfacing archive, an AI deductions archive, etc. These will make it easier to organize the data and begin processing it into actionable exploits and strategies.

This kind of setup will probably require the trolls to arrange some kind of campus to keep all of these offices and archives together within a secured area in the gang war zone that the AI doesn't see. As long as this group is larger than most other gangs in the area, decently equipped, and has a well-fortified perimeter, they should be able to work relatively easily.

One of the priorities for this group might be starting to analyze the AI's tech to see how it works, how to use it, and try to interface with it, modify it, repair it, scrap it for parts, or reverse-engineer it. They'd probably start off by sending out groups of investigators to ask other trolls what they know about the devices, including any trolls who might be involved in the production process, and essentially compile the current state of knowledge regarding the devices. To go further, they would need to get or make tools to take the devices apart, and get some of the devices to work with, possibly by working for the AI, or possibly by collecting broken devices. They would then need to take meticulous notes during disassembly to allow them to rebuild or modify the things that they take apart. They would gradually end up accumulating large piles of carefully inventoried scrap parts and materials that they could potentially reconfigure for novel purposes, and potentially use their custom devices to interface with the AI and subvert it.

It reminds me of an episode of Community where the group has to beat a video game. The nerd character realizes that the system of telling your children what to do is turing-complete, and constructs a megazord out of children.

The trolls could do most of this within an area the AI watches, it wouldn't really take notice. It's not proactive in preventing crime, only reactive.

I'm curious of how they would come up with a system like that, if they don't trust tech enough to even write stuff down digitally.

They don't have to produce everything themselves, though. They have books and paper, and most other basics of productivity, provided by the AI.

The system itself is actually pretty straightforward and has been widely used, historically. The use of offices which make written records and carry out administrative work by partitioning and delegating large projects into manageable individual portions has existed for well over 2,000 years. I don't expect that they'd think of things in terms of L1 cache, L2 cache, RAM, etc. That's an easy analogy for educated modern humans, but for the trolls, it's simply a practical matter of making well-organized written records of things to be able to archive and share useful information.

The only thing really unusual here is that these guys are basically shunning the AI's technology in favor of trusty old pen 'n' paper. This could stem from a variety of motivations, but the most likely motivation would be concern that the AI's tech implants might harm them somehow, either physically or spiritually, making them more machine than troll. Troll Luddites, perhaps.

Any examples of implants gone bad would easily fuel this sentiment. An impression of AI-induced harm might then lead to generalized wariness about the AI, and a sense that its 'gifts' cannot be trusted. This would spur on their antiquated approach to studying the AI's technologies and seeking a deeper understanding of them with the aim of being able to subvert the technology and ultimately the AI itself.
