Did Henge really get erased from existence by Kagome? I somehow filed that line away as a brief joke about the dangers of sealing, but it seems to have actually impacted the narrative, and the technique ceased to exist or couldn't be remembered (arguably the same thing lol)

Also, can anyone tell me what chapter it happened in, assuming I'm not wildly misinformed?


** Obvious spoilers up to Ch 190ish:

Henge was done away with via sealing failure related phenomenon that Kagome terms a "shift" in-universe right after Event 4 of the Chunin Exams. You'll notice that people start talking about "disguise kits" henceforth. No one save Kagome remembers such shifts.

This phenomenon gets revisited in two future chapters as far as I recall, and there are multiple references in future chapters.

From an OOC perspective, Henge was probably a solid candidate for "the most broken thing to ever exist in setting" (and I say this while we're at Ch350ish and us players have all manner of horrifying toys to play around with). There is virtually no way to work it out without having your local physicist come by and give you a small migraine over how XYZ can be exploited to win the everything, while preserving all of its shown abilities. [[/u/eaglejarl]] can probably expand quite a bit, but thats my take on it.

*** Thanks, I only remember it being mentioned in passing (happens when I read too fast sometimes) and became extremely confused after it didn't go away. I started to wonder if I was the one who was losing it lol

On your OOC point, that's something I'd wondered about before even reading this rational take on the universe. The fact that people can not only become any other human, but can also turn into animals or inanimate objects blew my mind, especially given the original canon almost never uses this. They turn Naruto into a friggin shuriken for god's sake. Why not just have a coat full of ninja pebbles ready to burst forth into an army?! And so on.

*** Hm. Is there any reason why Henge couldn't just be some kind of Genjutsu technique without breaking the setting over its knees? Supplanting your place in everyone else's sensorium with a different object or person makes asymmetric ninja warfare even more broken (even if the technique isn't infallible), and it does away with the whole "throw Naruto like a shuriken" bit in canon, but I don't know if that's too aggressive an AU element when the universe is already getting retconned.

**** "Genjutsu-Illusion Henge" was an option considered IIRC, but it still opens up a whole other can of worms with how Genjutsu works in MfD, amongst some other stuff like how it jives with previous material (I suppose. I don't really remember the specifics since this happened about two years ago.)

***** Why not just do something like high level ninjas being able to notice henge easily? I'm not sure what's so broken about it, though.

** You're misattributing it. Kagome isn't responsible for Henge falling out of the setting, he's just the only character (so far) who remains aware of techniques/inventions/creatures after they've been 'eaten by the Grue'/fallen into The Out.

The losses aren't always permanent. Wind Country's Gliders were lost, for example, but Hazo isn't running into any memetic barriers in trying to create them from scratch.

Henge is gone for good, though. It vanished during the Chuunin Exams, and isn't coming back. It's just too broken to work without bending the rest of the setting around it.

*** Okay, I barely remember the segment so I wasn't positive on all the details, thanks. Do you know roughly what chapter it was?

**** The chapter name is "Interlude: Journal, Entry #20,934". Easy way to find it is to search the thread for 'watermelon', by user eaglejarl, with minimum word count of 1000.

***** While you're giving chapter-marks, I am on chapter 267 after reading /just/ the story-only mode. Did I simply miss the in-text resolution to the Akane/Tsunade confrontation?

****** Nope. Akane's living/dead status remains unresolved until the kids get back to Leaf and see for themselves. Trust me, you won't miss it when you get there.

******* I'm well past the return to Leaf. My question was whether the Akane/Tsunade interaction is ever (a) resolved onscreen, or (b) explained to the returning members of team uplift. I am binge reading late at night so I'm sure I've missed several crucial details but I didn't notice Hazo mention it to Tsunade in the hospital scene. Did Akane tell him about it?

Not quite, as far as I remember. The implication is that she stopped short of punching her and instead was impressed enough by her guts and ability to stand up for something she believes in to take her on as a psuedo-apprentice. You can see Akane refers to Tsunade as "Tsunade-sensei" in certain spots and mentions taijutsu practice with her offhand (IIRC).
