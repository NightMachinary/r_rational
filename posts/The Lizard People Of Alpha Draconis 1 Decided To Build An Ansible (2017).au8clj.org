** “The only thing known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin Wheedle. He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed.” -- Terry Pratchett, /Mort/.

***** With relativity Ftl generally means time travel.

The speed of light is not some arbitrary speed limit that you can just surpass without weird effects even if you have scifi ftl handwavium(or negative average preference utilitarianism signals :b).

If I'm in a spaceship and you are in another moving in oposite directions from my frame of reference time moves slower for you , while from your frame of reference time goes slower for me .

If we both seem to have slower frames of reference to the other, you can't sent it faster, because you have to see it after it's been slowed, then I have to see your /response/ after it, too, has been slowed by an equal amount.

Most of the 'FTL is time travel' arguments require you to have some /other/ method of sending information that is absolutely instantaneous. This one is not it.

Similar to what the prior reply said, FTL and instantaneous are not the same thing.

******* Relativity is weird (or we are weird for not understanding relativity if you've been listening to [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7FSwbFpDsca7uXpQ2/quantum-explanations][Eliezer]]). Let me try to repeat the explanation that made it somewhat make sense for me:

If two spaceships are moving at very high speeds in different direction relative to two planet a very long distance away, the sequence they see events happening on those two planets can get out of order relative to what the other spaceship sees. So if for the people on the two planets event A on the first planet and event B on the second planet happen at the same time, for one spaceship A might happen before B, while for the other B might happen before A.

Note that this has nothing to do with measurement errors or anything like that, the events /actually/ happen in a different order depending on which direction you are moving in (check the wiki page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity][relativity of simultaneity]] for more details). Yes, this is super counterintuitive and not at all how we usually think of time working, blame the ancestral enviroment for not including more near-lightspeed tigers for us to avoid.

So, on the planets A and B happen at the same time, but for Spaceship 1 A happens before B and for Spaceship 2 B happens before A. This is all perfectly fine and nothing breaks because the spaceships and planets are all very far away from each other, but what happens if we introduce FTL communications? Spaceship 1 can now send a message to the planets as soon as they see B happen, the planets relay that message to spaceship 2, who then holds on to it until they see A happening, at which point they send it to the planets who relay it to Spaceship 1. And since on spaceship 1 A happens before B, they receive the message before they initially send it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, the events are actually /observed/ to happen in a different order depending on which direction you are moving in. The events themselves happen as they happen regardless of observation. For macroscopic events, observation of those events from different angles, speeds, and times has no appreciable effect on the events themselves, though observations taken from those different positions may well be unequal.

The problem here has little to do with FTL per-se, and more to do with the fact that the common-sense definition of 'simultaneous' breaks down in the face of relativistic time, since what is observed to be 'simultaneous' varies with reference frame. Resolving this is non-trivial, and probably requires timeless physics. From this view, the only absolutely correct sequence of events is one that references the entire universe (or at least the entirety of the relevant system) in four dimensions, detailing the exact position and velocity of each particle at each moment from the beginning of time to the end of time (or at least from the beginning of the question at hand to the end of the question at hand). If some /magic spell/ allowed you to 'instantly' send information from one part of the universe to the other, it'd be instant according to the timeless view of the universe, and not instant according to your own reference frame within spacetime. If possible, such communications would be non-paradoxical, since they necessarily could not be responded to prior to being received. Magic spells that don't work this way, and instead send information obliquely through time according to subjective views about what seems to be simultaneous, are /necessarily/ paradoxical.

I came back to post exactly this, but *Endovior* did it for me. Thank you.

None of the "FTL is time travel" examples work because every single one of them so far presented still requires you to *observe* something, and that information is being transmitted at light speed.

Most of them require /three/ speeds, /TWO/ of which are FTL. They assume that a ship is travelling FTL, but not instantaneously. They assume some method of communication exists that is instantaneous (ie: faster than the FTL drive in use, which makes you wonder why they bother with it at all). And then they assume that observation of events is somehow FTL as well, despite the fact you can only observe it both after it occurs and after the observable medium has reached you the 'slow' light-speed way.

I would say no, while you seem willing to take such observations at face value. Observations can be misleading, and the weirder your circumstances, the more misleading they can be. Saying that the correct order of events changes with your reference frame seems to me like saying that the shape of your body changes when you look at yourself in a funhouse mirror.

The practical problem with timeless physics is that we can't actually access an omniscient external view of our universe, so we can't use that view as a source of absolute truth. This leaves us with no viewpoint but our own limited and distorted one. We can, however, refuse to naively accept what our eyes show us, and can apply math to those observations to correct for known distortions.

*********** No , the thing you are calling a timeless god eye view of the universe its just a preferred reference frame which is what relativity is incompatible whith .

Simultaneity is just not an objetive fact about events , the actual god eye view of the universe doesn't contain it .\\
Time doesn't work in an intuitive way that happen to look like the less intuitive way , it actually looks like the unintuitive way .

You are assuming there's an "objetive" simultaneity and therefore if it looks like things being simultaneous or not depend on a arbitrary choice of frame of reference that must be a fact about our perception , not about reality.

But actually the objective absolute truth about the universe but it doesn't seem to contain facts about which events happen before others , just a different kind of relationship between events happening , which fits different orders of tings happening depending on an arbitrary choice of which velocity is 0.\\
And where causality IS absolute , unlike the order of events , as long as there's no physics breaking magic to go faster than light .

If you , in the situation I proposed before ,turn back when you reach me less time will actually have passed to you your clock will have advanced less , you will have done less stuff etc.\\
Its not a weird quirk of how things moving at different speeds look like , there are actual observable consequences.\\
(It looks like there's a paradox there whith you considering that less time would have happened for me but actually from your perspective it gets synchronized when you turn around to go towards me.)

Its not really about the observer , I'm putting the reference frame whith an observer because it's more intuitive but you can put it wherever you want .

************ That's... not what I'm saying at all, actually.

Recall that we are talking about a phenomena which appears to be impossible. Bearing in mind that either violation does serious harm to the models we are using to support our theories about what the results of the violations are, I'm suggesting that a violation of locality seems less impossible than a violation of causality.

Given such a violation in either case, it would be /most appropriate/ to start by throwing out the models in question, which explicitly disallow such violations. Regardless, physics in which violations of locality are permitted would also seem to permit simultaneity in a sense that our current understanding of physics does not.

We start whith synchronized clocks at 2 pm.

From my perspective at the right speed when my clock is at 4pm your clock is at 3pm.

From your perspective when your clock is at 4pm my clock is at 3pm.

If you send an instantaneous signal at 4pm it arrives to me at 3pm , and I send a response back wich arrives even sooner(since when it was 3 pm on my side for me your clock was at 2:30) Efectively sending messages back in time.

I'm not sure I understand your objection, what do you mean by "the response has been slowed" And "absolutely instantaneous"?

If you are observing at light speed, this either means one of two things. Either you are the functional equivalent of one 'light hour' distant as far as the observable medium is concerned, since your eyes only see the photons moving at lightspeed, or you are somehow doing time travel. Which do you think is more likely? Do note that if you are somehow observing the effects through some sort of magical divination that occurs at faster-than-lightspeed, then you are no longer affected /by/ the distortions caused by apparent and relative velocity.

#+begin_quote

So to clarify, we are dealing with *TWO forms of FTL*, yes? You have your FTL drive moving you faster than lightspeed but not instantaneously, and you also have your communications device, which somehow is perfectly, absolutely 'fast'? I mean, breaking reality one way is fine, but I just want to be clear we're doubling up on violating natural laws.

The events occured before you saw them. The communications, even if instantaneous, still occur after the events you have observed, although its possible to receive the information prior to actually seeing it. Again, if you claim that you are somehow 'seeing' the event instantaneously, then it is not affected by the distortion, and you are STILL communicating after the fact

********* There are no two forms of FTL in the previous example. Moving faster than lightspeed is not required, only moving close at something like 99.9% lightspeed, to get noticeable dilation effects.

The only FTL that is present is an instant communication device.

The "the events occured before you saw them" is what inability to exceed lightspeed is.

Once you have ability to surpass lightspeed, this assumption does not hold.

I'll leave more detailed explanation to [[/u/crivtox]]

EDIT: [[http://www.physicsmatt.com/blog/2016/8/25/why-ftl-implies-time-travel][here]]'s an article with spacetime diagrams that should clarify the issue, in case you want a detailed explanation.

A relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  ...if we could just say that there was only one frame of reference where we needed to set up cause and effect, then we could have FTL without worrying about causality. However, there is no special frame of reference, there cannot be one if relativity is to be true. And relativity is true, because we all measure light to travel at the same speed (also, you need relativity for electromagnetism to work, which you probably do want).

Well, there's you're problem right there. They will never see each other /at all/ as long as they continue at that speed. One object going 99% lightspeed in one direction while another goes 99% in an opposite direction will result in their relative speed to each other being much faster than the photons travelling between them.

Even if they are travelling in a similar direction, unless it is /exactly/ the same, the divergence will go quickly from "you can see them moving next to us right there" to "they just rapidly accelerated off into the distance and/or disappeared".

Hence my argument that this will require at least two different forms of lightspeed, the engine and the communications, or possibly even three as you need an 'FTL telescope'.

Well, there's /your/ problem right there. You don't just add speeds of two objects to get the speed with which they move away from each other, instead you use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity][velocity addition formula]], that's one of the big parts of relativity.

Relativity says that no matter how fast you move, you can never move away from other object at speed faster than c, even if you move at 99.99% c away from the starting point, and other object moves at 99.99% c away from the starting point in an opposite direction.

There is no need for different forms of lightspeed.

Relativity is highly counterintuitive, so it's not surprising you got it wrong. If you want to learn more, here is a good place to start:

One of the least intuitive parts of relativity is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference#Special_relativity][there is no privileged reference frame]].

There is no "reality" that is more "real" than "appearances" from the point of view of any inertial reference frame. Which means that all three views are equally valid, and there is no fourth view that is more "real" than they are.

Regarding your question:

B sees that A and C move away from it at 99.99%c.

A sees that B moves away from it at 99.99%c, and C moves away from it at (0.9999*c + 0.9999*c) / (1 + (0.9999*c * 0.9999*c) / (c*c) ), which is to say, at 99.99999949995%c.

C sees that B moves away from it at 99.99%c, and A moves away from it at (0.9999*c + 0.9999*c) / (1 + (0.9999*c * 0.9999*c) / (c*c) ), which is to say, at 99.99999949995%c.

Also, they experience [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation][time dilation]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction][length contraction]].

#+begin_quote
  Subjective or objective? Is each 'traveller' bending its own localized spacetime to enable this perception, and if not, are the photons somehow violating their own maximum limits?
#+end_quote

Photons aren't violating anything. Subjective and objective are ideas that were coined before we knew how different reality is from the way our intuitions perceive it, you would need to read a book on relativity to untangle the exact question. A simplified, and imprecise answer, would be: every observer sees different picture of the world. In this sense it's subjective. However, each subjective view is equally valid, and there is no superior objective view. Meaning every inertial observer's position is as objective as it is possible to get, and no position is more objective than others.

Again, yes, but depending on distances, "very shortly" may be measured in years, and number of photons will not actually be rapidly diminishing: lightspeed is the same in all inertial reference frames. However, this visual system does not need to be FTL, an ordinary telescope will suffice.
