What I mean by this is rational fiction without heavy scientific jargon.

I really enjoyed HPMOR, The Metropolitan Man and Cordyceps - though HPMOR had a lot of psychological jargon, none of these were very tech heavy.

Unfortunately, a lot of rational fiction seems to want to base itself deep in hard science like Blindsight (phenomenal story IMO but so, so heavy on scientific jargon).

Are there rational pics out there online that are more 'basic', or psychological-based? I tried The Origin of Species for about 14 chapters but couldn't really get into it as I was never into Pok√©mon.

** I'm currently doing a rational but not rationalist sci-fi fantasy serial piece. It's much more a light hearted kind of tone and generally I'm using it to work on my characterization and presentability. It also is illustrated!

I just posted a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][link]] to the reddit right before I saw your post.

Short elevator pitch: Xenofiction adventures of a space trucker and her best friend who is also her space truck. They have adventures .

** Is Blindsight considered rational fiction? I've only just discovered this subreddit (and rational fiction in general), and I'm not quite sure what its parameters are quite yet. But I have read Blindsight, and I don't entirely understand what's particularly... well, rational about it?

It might help me get to grips with the idea of the genre- and to work out whether if it's for me- if someone could explain what attributes of rational fiction Blindsight contains. Sorry if this is derailing the conversation, but I'm really interested in the idea of this type of fiction, and if anyone could offer their opinion I'd be grateful.

*** Its rational!adjacent at least. If you'll have a look at the sidebar, there are a couple of critera, we can check these off:

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Main problem solver is the vampire whose POV we are not private to, but the stuff the humans get to seems pretty creative. Also the humans are selected to be top of the field specialists and their conversations reflect that.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Lots of the specialists presenting their pro/cons and debating about decisions.

Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

The climax is building in lots of puzzlepieces falling into place, with deception and counterdeception and countercounterdeception.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Lots of discussion of cognition in general, but not so much on the individual level, this one gets very little points. (I think, been a while for me to read Blindsight).

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Yeah pretty much. Lots of interesting worldbuilding tidbits, the vampire thing is taken trough its paces and logical conclusion.

** I found Maoyuu Maou Yuusha which I think is nice, the bit about economics, future trading, dual economies and hyperinflation is a bit hard to wrap one's head around but it never actually uses such terms and displays the whole thing fairly clearly
