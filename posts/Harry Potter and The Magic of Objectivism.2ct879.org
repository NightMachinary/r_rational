** Just in case no one was aware of this reddit functionality, there's an [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/duplicates/2ct879/harry_potter_and_the_magic_of_objectivism/]["other discussions"]] link at the top of the page which will get you to the other discussions (naturally) like those posted at [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/26ua4g/ayn_rands_harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone/][/r/HPMOR]]. I found this a quite funny send up of both Ayn Rand's writing and the dark side of using fanfic to make an author tract, but your mileage may vary.

** Disclaimer: I am partial to objectivism, and though I do not label myself an objectivist, I share a lot of beliefs with objectivism's core tenets.

That being said: This was pretty funny. I was worried it was going to be a parody of the shitty caricature the likes of Salon or HuffPo like to drag out and burn every so often. However, it had a least a few very barbs, mostly relating to Rand's writing style rather than her philosophy, that I found very funny.

One odd note: The fuck is with the SNAPE IS A JEW thing? The fact that this guy seems to associate the way Snape is described with Jews is what's wrong here, not that one of JK's archtypical characters has a typical description for said archtype, and archtype that many thorughout the years have associated with Jews (shiftyness).

It's just... weird. A hook nose is really the only part of Snape's description that can really be taken to imply Jewish heritage but even that's a stretch.

Also, I really like the art. Silly name, but great art.

*** Jew here. Roman nose (cue /Life of Brian/ jokes... /now/). The primary reason hooked noses became associated with Jews is because people kept breaking Jews' noses.

**** Sounds like an urban myth, like the "rule of thumb".

***** Seconded. Seems much more likely that it's a stereotype because a lot of Jews have hook noses... I know quite a few of my relatives do.

*** Ayn Rand was Jewish so, maybe an homage..?
