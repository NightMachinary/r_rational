** While I don't want to comment on my opinions about this story as a whole, I do wanna ask; is this actually rational fiction? The protagonist does the typical fantasy student thing of just aimlessly bouncing from one power up to the next, and no broader goals are ever really stated. It's not badly written at all, but I think it's very much a product of its genre's tropes.

*** I mean it's not as mathematical as delve. But the MC is doing their best everything considered. Last few chapters showed a lot of insight into her self and goals. So far i say the MC is lucky but not in any plot armor or overbearing way. Opposition to the MC is well thought out and not just a caricature. The novel also manages well to insert cultivation titans into the story and their interaction with low level cultivators. All the characters are well fleshed out and have their own goals and motivations to follow.

** I was surprised by how much I enjoyed FoD, especially since I usually don't enjoy the genre.

This chapter was certainly interesting

*** Yeah... Forge ruined the genre for me as it was my first work in it. All I could think reading some of the more main streem recs before droping them prety quickly was whether the authors have even ever haerd of good world building.
