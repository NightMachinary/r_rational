I've been reading the story on fanfiction and the chapter ordering/numbering seems all fucky. I can never find the correct thread for the chapter I just read. Is there a compiled list of the threads somewhere?


** note that, due to interludes, chapter numbers don't quite line up.

For example, this chapter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/61/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning]] fanfiction.net labels it as chapter 61, but the title of the chapter is 'chapter 42'.

I suspect you had trouble because you were looking at the wrong number.
