** Not sure how I got started on Delve but thinking of putting it on hiatus till the chapters build up. Story updates once a week and the pacing is so slow, it is as if the author is racing alongside the Chinese wuxia writers who take chapters to make a point that one could make in a couple of sentences. Less said about the constant Math tutorial the better, though the author seems to have toned it down off late.

That said there are occasional flashes of brilliance in the writing, which is the only reason I haven't dropped the novel as yet.

*** Me too. I binged it up until chapter ~105 (which happily coincided with the end of a big arc), and enjoyed the story a lot. The story is just slow-paced, but not necessarily in a bad way, although it makes it a bad thing to read as a webnovel. I'm planning to forget about it for at least a year.

****** We don't reasonably expect him to for half a year as he'll likely need to delve to do so, which he plans to do in the badlands, which he won't reach until at least after vestval, but he also said he might take vestval survivors to the smuggler city first. And he'll need a party capable of taking down a 25 monster, I don't know if ameliah and tallhearts will be sufficient when his other highest companions are lower than him. So yeah, that sounds like around 25 chapters, maybe 50 for the actual blue, no?

**** I think what made Delve great from chapters say 1-60 (this is a huge ballpark, /basically/ everything was great up until the barrier is erected.) was a few things:

- *Rain filling out his levels and build* was really interesting reading about how his build is super non-standard but still potentially very viable.

- *Rain exploring /other/ builds, learning about them, and how they interact, meeting new people with new builds. Seriously, unlocking skill trees and selling that information should have been one of his highest priorities once he realized he could do that. Its such an easy way to make money.* His group should have /very/ strong supports and fighters at every level, because he can write down their build and show them how good it will be to convince them to do it.

- *actually delving.* We get him in like, 2 lairs in the whole story, although that's about to be 3.

- *meaningful progression of skills/levels/abilities* He's been spending like, 100k mana per day for weeks just so we can get throwaway lines about how mana manipulation is finally level 7. It ties in with other complaints I have, namely that he hasn't increased his cap in like 2 years worth of chapters.

As for how this chapter specifically feels like a let down? Well, its extremely short and nothing happens to change anything. There's a lair, but it won't raise his cap. He hasn't spent time convincing people to build efficiently for higher levels, so we're gonna see the same old shitty builds or perhaps slightly optimized builds. Based on where the story is going we're gonna get a few chapters of this lair, then they'll move on with some newly awakened and continue to that city where the mages family is, likely spend 15 chapters or so there, where nobody is likely to advance, nor can Rain make any progress besides stupid "synchronization" percentages which feel really useless as a reader.

Basically this chapter feels like a precursor to 4 months of the same shit.

***** Got it. I'm not on the wagon of "if it's not the System it's not interesting," so I don't find interim chapters disappointing, but if you're only interested in combat and System exploration I can see how it would be.

For the record I also disagree with what seems to be the consensus here that the author sucks at writing interpersonal/emotional scenes. I enjoy the friendships that Rain has built, and even though Rain/Ameliah is obvious from a mile away, I'm still rooting for them & think they'd make a good couple. I'm also interested in the fleshing out of Ascension's command structure/economy, so chapters focused on that are interesting to me as well.

****** Oh I'm not either, I think he's plenty good at writing interesting dialogue, scenes, characters, etc. I think some of the hardest hitting scenes were Ameliah thinking she didn't do enough for Rain, for example. I just wish progression through the system drove the story, rather like it did at the beginning.

  Mlem snorted and shifted his gaze back to Rain. “Here, at least let me help you before you hurt yourself. I understand acting quickly to seize an opportunity, but this is ridiculous. No one is just going to run into it or something.”

  “Oi! Dibs!” Kettel's voice came from over Rain's shoulder. He turned to see the teenage idiot sprinting toward the barrier at full speed.

  Rain glanced at Mlem. “You were saying?”

This is the best bit in the chapter, and no one can convince me otherwise.

  As they neared the camp, Carten's voice boomed through the twilight. “Oi! There's somethin'---oh.”

  Rain stumbled out of the trees a moment after Ameliah, spotting Carten waiting for them.

  The bearded man relaxed as he recognized them. “It's jus' you two,” he said, lowering his shields, his face splitting into a grin. “Done kissin'?”

  Ameliah sighed and glanced at Rain. “Do you want to hit him, or should I?”
