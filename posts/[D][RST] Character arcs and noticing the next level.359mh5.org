I have a half-formed thought I'm hoping the local hivemind can help me finish:

A lot of fiction is about characters overcoming internal obstacles, and becoming better people by the end of the story. In some senses, having a character arc like that is the very definition of a story.

But once you've read a good number of stories... then you've picked up all the lessons that the authours seem to come up with, and the only forms of improvement left to you seem to be incremental skill improvement. You know sharing is good, so stories about how sharing is good simply make you feel better that you already know that lesson; you know that letting a desire for revenge consume you is a bad thing, so you avoid that; you know that good people are skilled in their jobs so they can support themselves and their families, so you take classes and whatnot; and so on and so forth, to where you can predict what lessons any character is going to have to learn...

... and that's about as far as most readers seem to get.

An important thing about at least some Rationalist fiction is that there's at least some hint that even if you're starting out as a well-adjusted modern human, you can /still/ have a character arc, learn lessons that you didn't know existed - that you can become better /still/, in ways that all the usual stories seem entirely blind to. It's not just Informed Intelligence of being able to Do Math Good, or Sherlockian super-intelligence that draws infeasible conclusions, or something over in the faith/acceptance/submersion-into-humanity-as-a-whole arena.

It's discovering that hint - that however good you are at all the old lessons, there are still whole new worlds to discover, that the ancient Greeks couldn't calculate an arrow's fall, that there are brand-/new/ lessons to start telling stories about - that I'm trying to pin down. Is there an existing TVTrope on that under some name, or a standard literary device, or some other parallel with existing fiction? Is there a more complete expression of this idea, which has its own name?

Can you recognize anything about what I'm fumbling for here, better than I have so far?


** The overarching thing you're talking about is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop][The Aesop]], and the ones that writers like to explore are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops][Stock Aesops]]. I don't believe that there's one specifically for what you're talking about - an Aesop that applies to well-adjusted people who don't have obvious faults.

I think I'd like a template for what you're talking about?

HPMOR is the ur-example of the genre/style, and Harry's not at all well-adjusted. He's deliberately (and obviously) flawed from the start of the story. Many of the lessons that he learns /are/ Stock Aesops, or refined versions of them. The closing thought of the book is basically "The Power of Friendship".

I think I understand what you're talking about - Bob is outwardly sane and normal, with no clear faults, and learns some Aesop that you wouldn't have seen coming which leads to character growth, but I can't recall ever seeing that.

A fictional equivalent for something that happens in real life: A reasonably well-adjusted sciency nerd, who knows about skepticism and tolerance and all that good stuff... discovers the Sequences on LessWrong, and goes "Oh."

Another description: A lot of stories with Aesops aim them at children, or at young adults, and the Stock Aesops they teach are ones that are useful for people of those stages of development to learn. I want to find stories with grad-school-level Aesops, lessons that you need to have already learned those earlier lessons to be able to work with.

A piece of fiction being rationalist seems like a necessary precondition for this 'next level', but I'm not sure if it's sufficient by itself.

Ah. Well see, that's called the Underlying Unity of Reality, and how there can be many maps, but one territory, and it's always a rather profound experience finding a way to compress and connect your maps.

The closest thing TVtropes has to what you're describing would be [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop][Family-Unfriendly Aesops]].

Excuse me. He is a wizard, after all. It's the /Magic/ of Friendship.

** Uhhhh... going Beyond the Impossible, and kicking logic to the curb? Always Someone Better? To Be a Master?

Basically, I think authors just have a hard time coming up with challenges for overly awesome characters. It's a lot easier to tell a story about flawed people being threatened by something and having to work past their flaws than about awesome people struggling to achieve an ambition.

** You seem to be saying that you want the general wisdom of society (as expressed in the Aesops in the fiction that people write) to increase noticeably within your own lifetime as opposed to the multi-generational timescale on which such progress actually occurs. /You/ (and indeed, probably everyone on this subreddit) have seen all the Stock Aesops a hundred times, so you're eager to move on to the next thing, but a lot of /other/ people aren't. You should keep in mind that the list of Stock Aesops is constantly changing: new ones are added when they've been used enough times to become common knowledge, and old ones that have been revealed to be flawed (e.g. bigoted) are removed. It just happens slowly.

There's an analogy that I often find useful, and that I've never seen anyone else use: humanity can be thought of as a group of people on a long journey together with pre-industrial-revolution technology. Some have put their heads together and built a kind of wagon, and now there are people riding in the wagon, others pushing it, others walking beside it, and still others trying to chop the axles in half because they don't want to go any further (despite the fact that local geography has been getting consistently nicer and nicer for as long as anyone can remember).

You (in the analogy) are bored of the terrain around here, and wish we would crest the next hill already. Or perhaps, you (IRL) are looking for a story whose main character /recognizes/ this trend in history, and is (in the analogy) running ahead to the top of that hill.

** Like, he already knew he could power his love gun without love because his eidetic memory allowed him to remember to not be a selfish sociopath?

** It sounds like you're trying to imagine a story, /about/ a hypothetical, possibly archetypal story, that teaches a lesson that /humanity itself/ hasn't yet learned. Like some kind of "Virtual Aesop", wrt [[/u/alexanderwales]]' comment.

I /think/ I understand where you're going with this, or at least we're gesturing in the same general direction, but I'm not sure how much further it is possible (or worthwhile) to take the concept.

** That would be cool but I don't know of any examples.

edit: Beware the Mary Sue. The Mary Sue isn't the same as a character with no flaws. A Mary Sue has flaws the author doesn't notice, usually arrogance. Tom Baker's Doctor Who was very arrogant, but the writers and the characters acknowledged this, so it was ok. James Bond is a perfect guy / power fantasy, so he's not a Mary Sue either. I'd name positive examples but I don't want to anger fans. I'm sure you've encountered them.
