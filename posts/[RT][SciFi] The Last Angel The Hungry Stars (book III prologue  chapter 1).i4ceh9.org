** This starting up snuck by me, figured some other folks here would appreciate know this is happening :)

There's also ~8 chapters of Angelverse short stories up in Book II's thread after its conclusion.

*** Err quick synopsis of Book 2 is:

Red and Echo deniably team up with the Red Hand, and enemy-of-my-enemy-is-also-my-enemy-but-also-friend with the Other Giant Star Nation to wreck a forge system where the Original "Evil" Star Nation was staging / building an invasion fleet.

Meanwhile, Red has been faking a nesting ground in one location while actually building a nesting ground in a different location (I think?) and mostly baits a hunter fleet through the fake one, although they figure it out by the end.

Trying to think "what else is plot", as opposed to universe/character development.

**** Awesome, thank you!

Yep, I remember the nesting ground decoy and the team up, but not the star nation figuring the decoy out
