** If using base 10 or base 6 numbers doesn't add any more space to the design and there's no problems with moving numbers around and such, it would be a more compact method of building a computer. The gates would be more complicated and I think in general it would be harder to work with, but base 2 isn't a requirement for building a computer, it's just the best method of engineering them IRL. I believe base 3 processors were made, but they ended up being a good bit more complex and ultimately not worth the extra hardware needed to support it. Also transmitting and storing base 2 numbers is easier from an electrical standpoint, because you don't need to be as precise in the voltages needed to signify certain values. A 0 can be the lowest voltage possible, and a 1 can be the highest voltage possible, and you have some cutoff point in the middle when it switches. If you want 3 values, you need to get the middle value in a more precise range of voltages, which leads to the processor failing more easily. That doesn't necessarily apply to magic, so it might not be a concern.

To do subtraction in base 2 arithmetic, you swap the values of all the bits of one number, and then add them together normally. In hardware, addition and subtraction are handled by the same circuits. No idea how you would do the same in base 10, but I suspect you would need separate hardware for addition and subtraction. That would be one advantage for using base 2 over base 10.

*** I think that method technically also works in Base 10, but the operation to invert the digits is more complicated, and so you don't really save effort.

*** Additionally, from an algorithmic standpoint, base 2 makes more sense. Most algorithms split things into two: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.. Sure, it's not directly related to how it's implemented on gate-level, but the point remains. Things in 2 are typically the simplest and thus how things are typically done, unless there's a strong reason otherwise.

You also have to add 1 (which is often accomplished by passing a "carry" bit to the hardware that adds rightmost digit).
