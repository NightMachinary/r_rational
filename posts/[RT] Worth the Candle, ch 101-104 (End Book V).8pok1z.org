#+end_quote

Well that is alarming.

It now seems clear that the degree to which level-ups affect Juniper is growing at a significantly-greater-than-linear rate. This seems like a very big problem, since he has rapidly become one the most powerful individuals on the planet, he is still getting stronger, and at any moment he could be driven unexpectedly insane by a future even-stronger level-up. What if this happens later when his other party members aren't around, and he wakes up and just starts murdering everyone he can see in the hopes of getting experience for it? If Arthur faced a similar challenge, then I think that should increase our sympathy for his situation.

Hopefully the group will place a high priority now on finding some kind of solution to this problem.

*Edit:* Some further thoughts.

So on some level, this portion of the level-up mechanic seems intended by the GM to drive continued adventuring and questing. Providing a powerful incentive to avoid just resting on their laurels.

I will propose that the extremity of the effect this last time may have been affected by some combination of two factors:

1) Juniper's attempts to reduce the level-up's influence on his thinking with soul magic.

2) The fact that he was "relaxing" for two months in the time chamber for their recent quest.

This raises the question:

- Is this a semi-automated process that the GM isn't paying that close attention to?

- Or is the GM purposefully trying to "punish" Juniper for some combination of the two points above?

On the other hand he's giving him a super-heroin addiction that can only be satisfied by pursuing increasingly difficult goals.

It really seems like an unnecessary step at this point to make the Level Ups more and more addicting. It feels like he's putting his hand on the scales much harder than he implied he would. But I suppose this was already a mechanic of the game before they had their conversation, and if it was something that Arthur had to deal with as well, then it would be inconsistent to change it at this point.

Also, for those that got a kick out of Valencia's demon fueled analytical combat competence and devil derived social manipulation I strongly recommend the 'Prince of Nothing' fantasy Trilogy by R Scott Bakker. The protagonist is from a once monk like order who secluded themselves away from humanity in order to conquer their emotions, focus on reason and logic and having /complete/ and utter control of their environment. Skip forward thousands of years of eugenics breeding programs and you have a sect of hyper competent individuals who are trained in various things such as emotional reading through flayed (living) human faces in order to study which muscle contraction combinations indicate which mental states. The protagonist is in many ways a Strawman Vulcan version of Valencia holding a demon and a devil at the same time except with just as much big picture awareness as situational awareness but secluded to the point that they have, almost literally, no knowledge of the greater world around them. The writing is also brilliant, packed with philosophy and the author writes my favourite battle scenes bar none with a switch to a wonderfully grand omniscient perspective.

** I feel like, as time goes on, Joon is slipping further and further away from being the protagonist of this story.

I mean, think about the last I dunno, 15 chapters or so. Amaryllis plans the modernization of her planet while pregnant with a druid baby and bonding, one at a time, with Grak, Fenn, and Joon. She has the more interesting conflict-connection with the newest cast member, the house. She has the weird big-sister relationship to Valencia. In the final meeting, she's the one proposing the plans and the methods used. Joon barely even speaks at this point except to give away the game to an agency that is, natch, /hunting Amaryllis./

I don't /particularly/ mind the Mary show, because I think she's got more interesting character motivations in general, but "The Mary show as seen by a kind of socially dim dude who's very wrapped up in his own shit" is a difficult lens with which to view it.

I agree that the story kinda has turned into "The Mary Show". But I really like viewing it through the lens of "kind of socially dim dude who's very wrapped up in his own shit". Told from her perspective, it would run the risk of becoming "Mary Sue, boring"

This allows to keep us readers guessing about her internal conflicts (she also is kinda wrapped up in her own shit) and plans; just telling all is boring in comparison. For comparison, Tettletale would make for an awful PoV-protagonist in Worm, even though she is the secret protagonist of the first half. Or like, for good reason, Bakker's "Prince of Nothing" series does mostly not tell the story from the viewpoint of the prince.

*** I can understand why 'most recent 15 chapters' is a useful benchmark, but large parts of recent events were boring and/or stressful downtime in the chamber (for the characters, but not for the readers).

Juniper/Mary is an important thread on the nature of self-modification and personal identity. I'm not sure it would be the same if we read about that as perceived by Mary.

Juniper's reckoning about Arthur might be part of what he's wrapped up in, but I wouldn't say it's not important.

Letter 15 advanced Fenn's character and all the relationships between Fenn, Juniper, and Mary. That said, it /was/ Fenn-and-Mary driven, so I can see how it contributes to your count of times we didn't need Juniper to narrate.

I think you're right to say that Valencia and Amaryllis still have the more interesting dynamic than Valencia and Juniper, so far.

The dynamic between Bethel and Juniper, once it gets going, should be interesting because while Mary is Uther's descendant, Juniper is his analogue, and Bethel won't want to make the same mistakes twice.

**** A good question. I think it's up to the author, of course, but so far increasing Juniper's social stats has made him more aware of what /others/ are thinking and feeling, without being any more competent at managing his /own/ thoughts and feelings. A significant number of his issues seem to stem from his depression and inability to let go of the past, and the rest seem to come from his indifference toward his companions other than Fenn and Mary. He really hasn't put much if any effort towards socializing with Grak, Solace, or Valencia. To be honest, he hasn't put much effort towards /anything/ including his own personal goals. Frankly I don't think he needs social brilliance, he needs to stop being such a frustrating non-entity in his own story and show some engagement with the world. For example, he has completely blanked on the Grak byplay during this several-month sidequest. Grak is now much more closely bound to Mary than to Joon.

I agree with you (and other responses) that the story wouldn't be the same if perceived by Mary. I can't help but feel like that'd be a good thing, because it might lend the story some direction. Mary is /driven,/ in one way or another, and driven characters are interesting. When they overcome a challenge, it feels like a victory. Let me pose a counter-question: We just finished another book in this story. What was the climax, and what contribution did Juniper make to it versus Mary?

All of this could be authorial intent. The whole story is a unique window on escapism and depression and how the former doesn't cure the latter. But I don't feel like there's been a whole lot of emotional or character growth for Joon, or any opportunity for him to demonstrate the same. If anything he was substantially /more/ active and engaged towards the start of the story than he is now.

He contributed in the assault on Kuum Doona, but I am willing to guess we'd agree that combat is not /character/-driven to the same degree.

Juniper's main contribution was the soul mage shenanigans that brought Solace closer to a recoverable state. Moving those numbers around: not /quite/ delivering the same in-universe emotional impact as childbirth.

You had the crisis of needing to save me, then the crisis of needing to cure me, then the crisis of needing to cure your own ailment, and now we have the crisis of Fallatehr, not to mention trying our best to save the locus. We need to break out of the cycles of crisis. We need to chart a path forward of our own accord.”

  “Ah,” I replied. “That's kind of hard to do when we're still putting out fires.”

  “I agree,” said Amaryllis. “The problem is that the fires multiply. They're what I'm worried about, when I talk about stability. We need to keep our fires contained. Episodic.”

**** It's more that /every time/ Grak has basically said "uh hey, I'm a party member too, with my own backstory, motivations, and needs" Joon has pretty much responded "Cool." It's been pointed out in the text a few times that Joon (at least in retrospect) recognizes on some level that he's neglecting Grak.

So from a munchkin perspective, yeah, having that 10 loyalty seals the deal. From a storytelling perspective, from a /relationship/ perspective, Joon has been a bad friend to Grak, who has consistently been there for him. It's easy to say "but da's just in it for the money," except we know, specifically, that da needs the money for deeply personal cultural reasons. (Da also has no clue what to do with da nad life after da completes the penance. Da also is deeply uncomfortable with all forms of manipulation, perceived or otherwise.)

So even Amaryllis saying "fucking whatever, we'll put a hard date of 2 years on when we solve your problem" is doing more to address Grak's feelings and motivations than Joon has done up till this point.

#+begin_quote
  “Return my body to Darili Irid if I die,” said Grak.

  “You know I would,” I replied. “And if you fall, we'll pay your penance.”

  Loyalty Increased: Grak lvl 4!

  [...]Grak and I weren't exactly friends, not yet, but that was how you made friends, in my opinion; you committed to the friendship.
#+end_quote

At this point, Joon gets it, and is treating Grak the way Grak wants to be treated.

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Grak, returning his gaze to me. “You are not the family I would pick, but you are also not like my father.”

  Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 8!

  I wanted to ask what it was about me, but that seemed like a conversation that would just irritate me. Count on a guy like Grak to sap all the enjoyment from having made a breakthrough in soul magic and fixing him.
#+end_quote

By this point, in his heart at least, Joon is being a /bad friend./

#+begin_quote
  “You'd be making me blush, but I can control my bloodflow,” I replied. “But I am serious, the gap between Grak and I just seems so huge that there's no way that I'm going to overcome it.”

  “Bigger than you and the locus?” asked Fenn.

  “Point taken,” I said. “You know, sometimes I wish that our party were just,” /the Spice Girls,/ “more archetypally arranged, it seems like we've got a ridiculous, erratic spread both in terms of personality and utility.”
#+end_quote

/Ooooooff,/ Jooooooooooooon.

#+begin_quote
  There were very few personal details I knew about Grakhuil Leadbraids. Most of those, I had learned from his biography. The only personal story he'd ever told me had been when we'd been at Weik Handum, a story that I thought was just him being incredibly blunt about weird stuff that I didn't care about, by way of telling me not to sleep with Fenn. And my response to that had been to say ‘sure', and then the very next morning Fenn had teased him, very graphically, about all the ways that we hadn't had sex. Worse, I'd only really put effort into trying to raise his loyalty after learning about the Twinned Souls thing, which hadn't really been my intention, but I could see how that looked.

  “Fuck,” I said. I closed my eyes and scrunched up my face, trying to think of some response without the distraction of having to look at anyone. “Okay, I can see it now. I'm going to have to hope that I can explain what was going through my head at some point, but I want some time to think about things, how it looks from your perspective, and where our different cultures are getting in the way. And even if I could explain it perfectly, that probably wouldn't be enough, because with you, I failed. I need to just ... listen more, I guess, and focus less on the end goals, at least when it comes to our kharass.”

  I opened my eyes.

  Loyalty increased: Fenn lvl 22!

  Loyalty increased: Amaryllis lvl 16!

  Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 10!
#+end_quote

And see, with effort he can still find the right things to say to show how he should be changing his behavior.

#+begin_quote
  “That would be telling,” said the Dungeon Master. He flashed me a smile. “And for now, I plan on being just the right amount of opaque. They weren't set up to wait forever though. Amaryllis will get over you, if you let her. Null Pointer Exception will too -- she's malleable.”

  And Grak? The Six-Eyed Doe? I didn't ask. I didn't want to know. Better to keep assuming that Grak was just a straight dude that didn't happen to have a penis.
#+end_quote

That's such a horrible thing to assume! And it's the only time Grak came up in Joon's conversation with the DM.

My gut-level read at this point is that Grak is at least a little bit in love with Joon (da /is/ a princess in Joon's harem,) Joon can recognize it with his enhanced social stats, but he's choosing to ignore it because he's uncomfortable with the idea of romance with a very male-seeming creature of non-human-analogous gender, and he's even more uncomfortable with the part of himself that's uncomfortable at that thought, because he irrationally wants his feelings to be /fair/.

  When I finally got it, it was different from how I'd experience Amaryllis and Fenn's souls. Those had been, in some respect, extensions of my own, governed by the same logic, at least from my point of view. By way of analogy, if my soul was an enormous sheet of paper, Grak's was another sheet laid on top of it, this one without writing. I had to navigate between the two frequently, because his soul didn't have the order to it that mine did. It felt like sitting in front of a television with a printed out sheet of paper, trying to follow an FAQ to a game, going from instructions to screen and back again.
#+end_quote

At the very least, Juniper doesn't have the right "muscle memory" to intuit the structure in Grak's soul. He only found Fallatehr because he was specifically looking for Fallatehr.

On looking more closely at this scene, I think Grak is dropping some hints here that Juniper is (again) failing to follow up on at all.

#+begin_quote
  “It wasn't service,” said Grak. “It was wanting something more than myself.”

  [...]“What happens when you take your thousand pounds of gold to Darili Irid?” I asked.

  “Nothing,” said Grak, looking past me.

  “I have a quest for it,” I said, but at that he turned further away from me. “I really don't understand you.”

  “There is not much to understand,” replied Grak.

  “Sure,” I said. I was watching him closely. I wanted to say that all of this could have been avoided if he'd just been more loyal to me, or that I had been trying with him, was trying with him even now, and it was frustrating for it to not be paying any dividends, but that wasn't the kind of thing that I thought would be helpful, and if I needed to vent, I would go vent about it to someone else.
#+end_quote

Grak sure is acting the way someone might act if they were in love with someone they knew they didn't have the /slightest/ shot with, who also happens to keep making attempts to be friendly /to further their own ends/ and /without genuinely wanting to help/ and then /consistently refuses to get a clue even though they talk the talk about being a better person and a better friend all the time./ Oh, and he tends to act like a pretty good friend to all the hot girls.

Just think of how many times clueless adolescent boys have asked "Why's she acting so /weird?/"

Also, the above happened at loyalty 7, just before getting loyalty 8, and Grak is now at loyalty 10. I think the only time Juniper has touched da nad soul since then was to make /grak.bak/, and he was in a bit of a hurry at the time.

***** Superbly put. Joon has a terrible habit of shallowness in how he sees the people around him, and Grak is at the top of the list of people who suffer as a result (although Valencia, on the other hand, has really benefited from it).

I kept thinking throughout the last chapter how important it was that Solace and the Six-Eyed Doe were introduced relatively early in the story - if they had been the 7th member to join the troupe I think it would be much easier as a reader to partially dismiss them as "also that weird druid thing with them". You made me realize how crucial that was for Grak as well. Da's a very complex character who on the surface looks very simple, because da doesn't emote very openly and is explicitly in it for the money, and it would be very easy to treat [them] as just a straight male dwarf mercenary if we hadn't had time to get to know [them].

  Grak frowned at Amaryllis. “I do care for you,” he said. He looked around the small room. “All of you. Some more than others.” That was characteristic dwarven bluntness right there. “I will not be subsumed by this group.” That was also a characteristically Grak way of saying things. He seemed allergic to the word ‘but', so instead, he'd just give two statements of fact, one of which undercut the other.

  “Fine,” said Amaryllis. “It's going to cause us no end of problems with capital, because we'd be idiots to plan on paying anything out in the beginning, but I'll personally guarantee you forty million obols within two years time, and if I don't have it, we'll go kill a fucking dragon and take its hoard or something, okay?”

  Grak stared at her, then nodded.
#+end_quote

It isn't about the money. It's about /finishing da nad quest./ Mary went from trying to haggle di down, thinking of the utility of the obols toward the goals of the Council of Arches, to setting a hard time limit and thereby acknowledging Grak's importance and status in the Council. Grak just wanted somebody to say, without prompting or quid pro quo, that they'd take care of da nad thing, not /someday/, but at a set time.

Mary (and Joon) are also ignoring that from a gameplay and narrative perspective, quests that involve giving up enormous amounts of dosh typically involve commensurate rewards-- not in coin necessarily, but in terms of politics, capabilities, items, and XP, completing that quest will probably have /some/ kind of awesome consequences. (Although to be fair, if this was the reasoning behind assistance rendered, and Grak realized it, da would probably reject the assistance.)

****** HPMOR has the continuous problem that the literal message/moral given, the intended message/morale, the characters exposition, and the emotional message are often at odds with on another. I.e. Quirrel explains why fascism is cool and democracy sucks while being really cool and edgy, Harry fails to reasonably defend democracy, and Eliezer in an author's note gives a weak reminder that Quirrel is a villain.

Harry's view of friendship as manipulation is an example of this. The plot never really conclusively shows manipulating friends is bad, Harry is sometimes rewarded and sometimes punishes for it by the story. Even at the end of the story he is manipulating Hermione to take out Azkaban for him.

Actually it's already been briefly discussed that Amaryllis is likely to be asexual or lesbian with an exception for Juniper when she normally is repulsed by the idea of dating and having sex with a man.

From chapter 52 about her distaste for men:

#+begin_quote
  “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,” she finished, apparently not pulling any punches. “I would get through this thing that I didn't want to do, and I would learn to like it, or at least learn to not visibly dislike it.” She folded her hands in her lap. “I'm aware of how that makes me sound,” she said.
#+end_quote

From chapter 93 about how Juniper noticed her likely sexual orientation:

#+begin_quote
  “No, you're not,” I said. “Just ... asexual?”

  “Mostly,” said Amaryllis. She frowned at me. “Did you know before I did?”

  “After our long talk in the bottle [in chapter 52], it seemed like one of the two likely options,” I said with a shrug. “The other being that you were lesbian.” I hadn't wanted to pry or make assumptions, but I'd really been hoping that her revulsion towards sex with me wasn't just because it was me.

  He actually thought that.

  And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, and /then/ talk to Hermione.

If they figure stuff out enough to show a Harry Potter book to one of the other dream-skewered, if there are any of those around, they'll get some right confusing reactions; I have no clue what conclusion they'd come to.

Remember, also, that /in addition to Harry Potter, Mary and June each left her a dozen books to read/. These are unspecified except at least one is Animorphs first book. So I figure we might have more than one other Animorphs book, and possibly a bunch of other Earth fiction too. If someone left an Earth dictionary for Valencia - which they might well have done to help her with Harry Potter - that'll raise tons of questions immediately too. If there's any more explicit reference material there, it gets correspondingly weirder from their perspective. If Mary was trying to further Valencia's education and provided her with a illustrated book of science from Earth, that'll puzzle them a /lot/.

But just from what we /know/ was there -

Animorphs cover art might raise questions if they look at it closely - they were produced digitally using morphing software. And the inside cover art when you open the cover in Animorphs 1 is distinctly computer generated images of a lizard on a shoe in a locker which they /also/ won't know how they were made - it looks super artificial and weird as it was from the [[http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/The_Invasion?file=Animorphs_1_the_invasion_inside_cover_only_high_res.jpg][early days of computer generated images]]. Like, it's got a very pixellated look to it, and if they go over it with a magnifying glass it might boggle them a bit.

Moreover, if they read the text of both Animorphs and Harry Potter, they will discover that they are two books both set on a fictional world that shares startling similarities. To start with, both mention nouns that have no meaning and aren't described at all that are very similar - Animorphs 1 mentions video games within a page or two, while HP&TPS mentions a video camera and computer games being given to a Dursley fairly early on too. The idea of whole classes of unknown, undefined nouns for a population large enough to have it's own literature, with those nouns undefined in the text because they're so much a part of their culture, that the Uniquities have never heard of before, might worry the heck out of them.

Deathly Hallows references Native Americans once. It takes a fairly close reading to find these references (I don't think Uniquities will have the benefit of ctrl+F).

They clearly belong to the same culture but identifying continuous elements in the settings will be a product of time and close reading, rather than being immediately obvious. The more obvious things like sharing weird formatting and presentation details (ISBNs, copyright pages, etc.) will be a quicker tip-off that these are two artifacts from the same culture which is dissimilar to their own.

**** If the book wasn't specifically Harry Potter I might have a harder time agreeing with you. Its background is our world plus a hidden, smaller world of magic users, so I suppose that the average reader on Aerb would see it as their own Harry Potter story being transplanted onto a weird alternate universe. (Such a reader might be confused that the book then kept so much of the original story the same, but the hypothesis space won't immediately narrow down to the truth).

Amaryllis had tried to extract enough from the backpack to be self-sufficient, so that integrating it away would not be a huge loss. From the outside that might not seem that far from a forge frenzy (if not "merely" a conventional discovery, which seems to have been outpaced by the otherworldly magic).

Demonstrating the summoning ability is also more difficult now that it's entangled with Bethel. Now you have to reveal the meta-entad, convince Bethel to do the thing, etc.

It's been obvious that each succeeding level up has been increasing in pleasure and before Juniper learned soul magic to lower the value/desire for level ups, he had been growing more and more frustrated that he didn't get a level up after combat. It's most noticeable when he's debating to fight a few more golems for the XP instead of escaping when the group were breaking Fallatehr out.

The most recent level up most likely was so intense in pleasure that he won't listen to any logic to lower his desire for level ups. Just like how the people Fallatehr soul-changed didn't have any desire to change back despite their memories telling them otherwise.

I personally think that explanation is a bit BS as early Joon was strongly following the game rules and he didn't think he was building a princess harem when recruiting Grak or Fenn. Additionally the disruption of the aging process is more DM fiat that anything Joon chose. So I'd say the DM is vicariously living through Joon more than fulfilling Joon's true wishes.

** I completely missed that level ups were getting progressively more addictive as Joon got them (as if they needed to be even more horrifying).

Kind of confused as to why level ups would be like this though. Even if level ups weren't particularly pleasurable at all I feel like Joon would more or less be doing the same general thing, he didn't need that extra carrot. Does that suggest that the game layer is a general thing and hasn't been customized to Joon, even if the individual companions and world both are?

Also, what would have happened if Joon hadn't gotten access to soul magic and had no way to manage the level up value? Is the plot on rails enough that he'll reliably get soul magic, or is the PC becoming solely devoted to leveling up at any cost the expected norm?

Maybe it's the game layer's closest way to represent the single mindedness of PCs in RPGs? But again, getting stronger to achieve goals seems like a perfectly valid in-universe reason for wanting to level up, why the addiction?

But it's weird; this is the previous level up:

#+begin_quote
  I laid both hands on my chest and concentrated my power, burning through bones on my left side in order to fuel the healing in my ribs. It would take some time to reset those bones, but that was now a solved problem. The changes came fast, first sensation returning to my skin, then a gnawing hunger from an appetite that was finally waking back up. I didn't suffer from a sudden heart attack, as I had feared that I might, and whatever the soul's conception of the body was at the boundary areas, nothing horrible like a rending of my flesh happened at my shoulders or hips.

  The quest didn't show up as completed though, and I slapped my forehead when I realized why; I'd drained bones in order to complete the healing. A quick dip into my soul was enough to fix that, and I came back out quick enough to see the notifications in my view, before they were washed away.

  Affliction: Drained Bone Removed!

  Skill increased: Essentialism lvl 23!

  Quest Complete: Boneitis - Your body is back to normal, and under your control to a far greater extent than in your wildest transhumanist dreams, if you dare to risk fucking it up.

Another possibility is that level up not only heals all physical damage, but also all mental damage and soul magic counts as mental damage, and massively increasing sensitivity to a reward at the same time as receiving that reward feels amazing, but none of that happened the last time Joon leveled, so I don't believe that.

The expression is "to give /free rein/," meaning to hold a horse's reins loosely so the horse can travel at a pace it finds comfortable.

I'm pretty sure I've run across this one a few times in the story, but this is the first since I've caught up. Or maybe it was "reign in" for some of the other times, which should similarly be "rein in," meaning to grasp the reins and take control of the horse, or pretty much the opposite of "to give free rein."

Edit to add: the ones I've seen earlier might also have been "*seize the reigns*," which, again, should be "seize the /reins/," implying you're taking control of the horse from someone else.

Unicorn horn is actually correct -- they have an alicorn that they were going to sell in Boastre Vino, but were prevented from doing so by Larkspur showing up.

I thought I'd put it in this chapter, but apparently if I did, I cut it back out. Obviously that needs to go /somewhere/ though, but it's been almost 300,000 words since it was last mentioned.

*** There's also a trick in D&D3 where you can use a Candle of Invocation to get infinite wishes. I figured it was referencing that too - bringing up the moral question of what you'd sacrifice to gain power, and to what ends ultimate power is worth using.

*** Specifically, the expression was "the game isn't worth the candle", as in it's not worth it to stay up and play cards because any potential gain is less than the cost of the light needed to play. More generally, if something isn't worth the candle, the gains are outweighed by the cost of the undertaking.

** I know the updates accumulate but what does the release schedule typically look like for this series? What is the usual gap between?

I do like the story Alexander, you've done a great job creating this setting. I read the whole thing in one go without reading your real name and I believed you were Juniper, funnily enough. The hombrewness of the world makes it very unique.

**** Tricky, because that requires including that person in the ritual, which includes aspects of the soul mage thing and knowing about the last druid. I had a half-formed guess that Esuen was going to raise Solace a bit in the time chamber. This guess has some problems, not intractable ones, such as the operation of the time chamber as a long-term residence by a set of people that does not include Amaryllis.

Had the time chamber been used for long durations before? Between the forge frenzy and the haphazard addition of entads that may have brought it about, maybe no one actually had a good plan for long-term use.

The story already went over the big constraints: air, temperature, and food. I suppose there could have been other ways to address all three, such as the blanket of really long naps. Somehow those didn't make their way into the house though.
