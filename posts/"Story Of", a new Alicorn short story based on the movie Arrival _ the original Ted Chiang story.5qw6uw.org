** It's a sweet little read, and although the tone is borrowed from the short story, it's very clearly based on the movie because Things Don't Work That Way in the story. It has all the problems of the movie, and adds more (e.g. now Louise can remember futures that /never happened/; if reverse causality is cheap in the movie, this is /absurd/!)

Which was a whole lot of the point of Ted Chiang's story, and one he took great pains to handle delicately and adequately. Aside from stereotyping the military and the Hard Science Guy, the failure to appreciate this was the biggest issue with the movie.

***** Sure. The entire conceit which Ted Chiang's story examined was the idea that the physics we know does not specify that we should experience "Time" moment by moment. In fact, through the use of Hamiltonians/Lagrangians, you can formulate physics in a causally-global rather than local manner.

The standard example of this ambiguity is that the path a ray of light travels is always a local extremum. It is natural to humans to say "sure, but the /truth/ is that light follows that path because of things going on at every moment", to say that you can compute infinitismal time-slice to infinitismal time-slice where the light ray will move next. But the known physics is agnostic towards this.

So Ted Chiang considers a situation where the metaphysics governing conscious experience isn't tied to one perspective or the other. Humans have the viewpoint corresponding to what we consider straightforward/obvious/Newtonian physics, and then he introduces these other aliens that do not. From their viewpoint, physics is determined globally across time.

Is this sensible? What would it even be like? Does this in any way mesh with our experience of consciousness? What about free will? These are a portion of what gives Ted Chiang's story depth. His careful examination of this idea, melded with the pathos of the story itself, makes the story something special.

The movie missed all of this. For the local/global agnosticism to make sense, /it is not possible for the form of the experience to influence one's actions/. The physics is the same regardless of the perspective, therefore the outcomes are the same. From the outside, you can't tell what the metaphysical perspective is because the physics is the same either way. Ted Chiang makes this very clear in his story. His protagonist describes others experiencing things as she does as fellow actors/conspirators, always flawlessly rehearsing their lines. The lines that a normal human would speak had they not had this shift in conscious perspective.

The movie egregiously has the character taking actions based on future knowledge, meaning that in it the metaphysical perspective on the physics influences the outcome of the physics. Less egregious but still bad, it invents some bizarre reasoning when seemingly her present actions based on future knowledge cannot proceed until after some experience of the future has occurred, which is portrayed as taking real time, as though time is passing now while she experiences things in the future (I'm referring to the scene where she struggles to remember her future self hearing the general share his phone number). Okay, fine, there is nothing wrong with that as a model of someone's experience, except that jettisons everything Ted Chiang introduced to explore the co-existence of the two distinct modes of experience, so the movie is far far weaker than Ted Chiang's story.

tl;dr : Ted Chiang is very careful to examine how two different and completely distinct metaphysics could lead to two completely incomparable kinds of consciousness, where both of these metaphysics are possible compatible perspectives on our physics. The important point was that the physics is the same regardless of the perspective, so you cannot tell which is in effect. This was too deep for the screenwriter or maybe for the studio's perception of the audience's intellect, so instead they made the protagonist into a psychic with the ability to act on her psychic awareness of the future, which has nothing to do with the conceit which made Ted Chiang's story valuable.

** I disagree with the complaints. In the original story, from the perspective of the main character, it seemed like a single timeline, and thus predestination and such exists. But did we ever see the main character test and push these limits? In the movie, there wasn't really time to show such, and thus we never saw for sure what the limits are. I haven't read the short story yet, but I don't think she pushed her limits in the story either. Thus, I find this fix-fic acceptably rational.

*** In the short story, it's made very explicit that she /cannot/ push her limits any more than I can jump into the air and fly, ignoring gravity. The entire point is that learning the future means you are /doomed to fulfill it/. I would heartily recommend the story. It's short enough to read inside an hour and easily available on the internet.

That said I do recommend buying the collection ("Story of your life and others") as Chiang writes amazing, rational science fiction. There's a story in that collection about the consequences of a world where angels visiting is a regular occurrance. The ending is extremely emotionally impactful.

***** The movie already ruined it, really. Since a major plot point involves Louise /using/ her knowledge of the future to influence the present, it can't be true (in the movie universe) that humans have no free will. The movie also framed Louise's decision to have her doomed child as an actual choice she made, rather than as her helplessly enacting the events she already remembers. I don't think there's anything about the movie that would rule out what happens in the fic.

There's /zero/ indication that your "deterministic loops" interpretation is actually happening in the movie, and nearly every possible indication to the contrary. The movie also /could/ have been taking place entirely in Louise's imagination, but there's no evidence of that, so it's not a justifiable interpretation. The only way to see this movie as being about deterministic loops is to project your own extra details on top of it. If you just take the actual movie as it was actually written, you can clearly see that Louise is making choices /and that those choices are of narrative significance./ It's completely obvious that the folks involved in the production did /not/ have deterministic loops in mind.

All choices in all movies are narratively significant but it doesn't mean those movies have free will either. And most of those movies don't have 100% accurate future senses either. Yet those movies can be explained with determinism too.

Until the movie shows a clip of a future that hasn't happened the only explanation is that the illusion of free will is maintained and that's a difference between the book and movie.

Your explanation requires information not present and then has to justify how the information interacts while my explanation treats this movie just like all others

***************************** No, I don't have to explain that. It's not my job to make the movie make sense. Take it up with the scriptwriters.

If you want to argue that the movie contains flaws or inconsistencies, feel feel; I'm not claiming otherwise. I am not a fan of the movie. But I think it's dead obvious from watching it that the writers framed Louise's decision as a genuine one that she freely made, and that Louise having the freedom to make that choice was critical to the theme of the narrative. There was that whole scene about how the father left her because he thought she made "the wrong choice," and that whole internal monologue about prioritizing the journey over the destination. The story the creators of that movie were trying to tell was one about a woman freely choosing to have a child she knew would die young.

I don't know how you can have seen the movie and still argue otherwise. Do you really think the creators were trying to tell the story of a woman who thinks she's choosing to have a child, but actually it's just fate and she never had a choie? Because if that were the case, it would be pretty strange that the movie neglects to even address that possibility at any point, and instead continually harps on the theme that she made a meaningful choice.
