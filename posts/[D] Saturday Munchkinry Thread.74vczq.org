Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I want to write an SCP tale which, at one point, involves a character traveling about ~500 years into the past. The trip is one-way. The character in question is a woman with a Ph.D. in physics. The question is: what should she take with her?

Assume that she has to fit whatever it is she can take into a bag she can reasonably carry. Also, she understands that she has to time-travel only a few hours before she has to use the time machine, so while she has a few hours to make a trip to the local hardware/electronics/something else store, she does not have a lot of time to procure materials.

*** Seeds would probably be among the most valuable things to bring, since modern GM crops are vastly more productive than the crops of 500 years ago, and there's no way she would be able to duplicate them in her lifespan. Aside from that, a topographical map and a good compass (one with marked out bearings) would be absurdly useful for navigating. A map of current or historical mining sites to go along with that would give her a huge advantage.

However, to survive long enough for any of that to matter, she'll probably need to start with warm clothes, a raincoat, several pairs of socks, a cooking pot, a hatchet, a good pair of hiking shoes, a tent and sleeping bag, a lighter, a gun, a magnifying glass, a knife, a rope, some clear plastic bags (garbage and resealable), some water bottles, and enough trail mix and/or hard candy to last her for at least a week.

*** Where in the world is she travelling from? And does she have to end up in the same place? THis will make a hell of a lot of difference, to the extent that I would spend some of the time travelling to a city which still existed 500 years ago and where women are treated less badly if at all possible. Even If I could do this I'd make sure I was wearing modest dress or dress as a man of the period if I could pull it off.

For modern things to sell I would add needles and spices as they were worth a lot by weight. And if I was still menstruating I'd bring several mooncups, and if fertile I would stock the hell up on birth control.

**** Antibiotics have a shelf life, and they'll gradually become ineffective over time, especially if stored in less than optimal conditions. They're cheap and lightweight, not a bad idea for the first year, maybe two. However, I wouldn't go for trying to isolate penicilium mold and extracting penicillin, I would just lean towards making synthetic antibiotics.

Laptop and solar generator are probably a bad idea, they're very heavy and I think you'd need 300-400 watts for a laptop. The solar generator you linked is 39.5 lb, and I don't see many laptops less than 2.5 lb. However, you could use a [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIACYN5R34804][tablet]] (1.5 lb.) and you'd only need a 24 watt solar generator for that (like [[https://www.amazon.com/BigBlue-Portable-Waterproof-Sunpower-Rechargeable/dp/B071G4CQSR/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1507538293&sr=1-2-spons][this]] at 1.3 lb., but you'd need an adapter). It looks like there are also some tablets with USB ports, so you could take a [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA9DE5MM1470][4 TB external HD]] (0.53 lb.) full of reference data to plug into it.

This particular kit would be about 4.5 lbs, plus computer. I would choose a Macbook, weighing 2 lbs. I'm sure there's a more optimal solution, but I'm not willing to spend an hour researching this, when the time-traveller in question only has 2 or 3 hours to shop. As for laptop vs. tablet, there are a few arguments for laptop: fully-featured OS, keyboard, and less likely to crack the screen. I know there are solutions for tablets that do all this, but at that point they're basically laptops.

** You gain the preternatural ability to roll dice to whichever side you want every single time provided the dice have the following properties

- are platonic solids
- are, at most, only 5% more likely to land on any side than any other side. (your skill doesn't work on weighed dice)
- are capable of being picked up by you with at most both arms, and at minimum two fingers, without the use of chemical bonds
- aren't capable of switching which face is which (such as, for example, through the use of lcd screens).
- aren't self-propelled

Restrictions that /don't/ exist on your ability include:

- you don't need to know the starting state of the dice.
- even if something interferes with the die while it's being rolled, but doesn't actually stop the die from rolling, it'll still land on your intended face. (Although if an external force completely stops the roll, your power doesn't set the state of the die.)

You have until January 1st 2020 to become the richest person in the world. Can you do it?

*** Well I think I know a way to use the dice to generate free energy, however given the limits on the size of the dice that won't be of much real use until the singularity (after which your artificial body might well be a megastructure and that 5% difference in dice fairness could correspond to absurd amounts of mass). However that isn't going to be game breaking over the desired timescales, but luckily I also thought of a way to use it to generate many types of arbitrary information.

How this works is that since dice are actually deterministic it should be possible to make a machine that nudges the dice in midair so that it lands on a particular side, given machines can reliably predict a coin flip in the air this seem highly plausible. Then the trick is to have that machine keep hitting the dice to keep it in midair for a while (but still a definitely finite amount of time so it will eventually land).\\
Now the way you use this to leverage the information about the future, is to make it so that the most likely way the machine stops hitting the dice and makes sure it's last hit would make it land on the desired number is for the machine to detect some change in stock prices or the like.

Basically you rely on the fact that the power must necessarily be able to manipulate quantum events and massively leverage the butterfly effect in order to work in every conceivable scenario it has to work in. Thus even if it only achieves this manipulation through somehow controlling your body it still effectively works the same way as a probability pump. So all you need to do is arrange your setup so that the easiest way for it to get the dice to roll a specified number is for it to manipulate the stock market or some other systems.\\
The real important thing to keep in mind is that the odds of your machine malfunctioning need to be smaller than the odds of whatever event you are trying to cause. I am also assuming it's control over you in how it makes you roll the dice doesn't extend back in time too far, otherwise it might try to mess with your mind in order to ensure you never build your probability pump or other such things.

Anyway as for becoming the richest person alive by 2020 that should be easy by just messing with the stock market. Once I was the richest person alive i'd probably use it by hooking my machine up to prediction markets or something else quantifiable so as to control world affairs massively by having many dice in the air for years, with machines hooked up to let them down when future events occurred.

***** If the power really doesn't care about duration one can quite easily work around that by making the machines such that they will make the dice roll onto a certain number other than the one the power's trying to make them land on.

Thus the easiest way for the power to get its desired number will be to cause the event which triggers the machine to let it land on that number. Basically if you set it up that way then you just need to ensure the event you're trying to force happen is more likely to occur than the machine breaking.

Well no the whole point is to construct the machine(s) such that the chance of them malfunctioning is less likely than the chance of a given event occurring.\\
I'm not planning on using this probability pump to do anything as extreme as affecting lottery drawings. It should be pretty easy to make a machine that has a less than 10% chance of failing and with that I can cause events that would otherwise have a 10% or greater chance of happening to occur most of the time. Similarly I can do the same thing in reverse to stop many highly likely events from occurring.

********* Going off the default assumption that it's messing with quantum events (or controlling which everett branch you end up in) and wants to expend the minimum amount of effort to accomplish its goal of making the dice come up in a desired way. Then it seems rather inevitable that the difficulty of getting something to occur will happen to correspond to the likelihood of it happening.

Like in this formulation it's nearly impossible to conceive of how the "difficulty" as far as the dice's concerned /couldn't/ correspond to the probability of finding yourself in a given set of everett branches. What i'm going with is the purest form of probability pump I could come up with that meets the canon requirements of always working and not just using telekinesis (based on the author's comment).

I also prefer this to an interpretation that it predicts all future events, simply because due to quantum randomness that's impossible and thus you can't get away from the fact the dice has to mess with quantum events to achieve certainty that it will work as specified.

**** So the regular method for rolling dice to land on a side would involve knowing exactly how to move your body so the dice would move to land on one side (seeing as how dice are only psuedo-random.) Instead of you personally knowing how to roll the die, you "power" does, and you tap into it to get down the body movements to roll the dice. The "power" can also predict anything that would interfere with the dice roll (from wind to other people) and so long as there's a physical motion corresponding to the proper roll you can execute you'll get it to land on the face you want. But, as I specified, someone completely stopping the die means that you can't complete the roll, meaning there is no possible way you can move to land on the proper side.

What about non-weighted magnetic dice? So it is equally likely to land on any side... unless you throw it on top of a magnet.

The magnetic field would "interfere with the die" while it's being rolled, but doesn't actually stop the die from rolling. So it should still land on its intended face... except the magnetic field stops it from landing on its intended face since it repels the other side...
