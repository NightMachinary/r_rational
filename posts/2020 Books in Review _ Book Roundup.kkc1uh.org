I figure we all share at least some degree of taste in our books, and frankly, with 2020 having been the year of being stuck at home, maybe a lot of us could use a consolidated new-reading-material thread.

This thread is for things you read in 2020. It doesn't have to have come out in 2020, but you've got to have read it in 2020. It can be paper books, audiobooks, ebooks, web serials, manga, whatever! People are encouraged to also mention why these things in particular might be of interest to the posters here at [[/r/rational]].


** *Web Serials* (books in a different comment):

I re-read *Unsong*, which remains probably the best web serial ever written. Fake, glorious Kabbalah, incredible biblical puns of extraordinary awfulness, obsessive and human characters, a sysadmin angel, the end of times, and the greatest notarikon reveal I've ever seen.

I re-read *Lady Knight Volant* (featuring Protector of the Small's Keladry of Mindelan), which remains probably the best fanfic ever written. Enough people asked whether the author was Tamora Pierce herself. No; it is not. Also it has some sequels, which I read. LKV specifically is about Keladry building her holding; at first to protect the refugees she's assigned to shepherd, and later building it into a glorious fortress-steading in the face of adversity.

*Katalepsis* is the best ongoing web serial on my list. Sapphic romance, friendships through trauma with traumatized people, mental health, a great vast all-seeing eye that screams hyperdimensional mathematics into your brain until you bleed out from your ears, it's got it all.

*Ward* by Wildbow (the sequel to his debut, Worm) wrapped up. It's amazing how much the fanbase hated this serial. He started his new serial, Pale, which is set in the same setting as his older Pact but with a totally different cast of characters (and is much less bleak). It's much more cerebral than Worm, I think. I really liked it. I really liked Victoria's struggle with trying to figure out how to be the person she needed to be, and how to figure out who and what she wanted to be.

*Just a Bystander* is a serial about a student going to the Mage Academy learning to deal with the fact that he's gotten wrapped up in some gosh darn Chosen One prophecy, and he does not approve.

*The Wandering Inn* is an extremely long (7ish million words and going!) slice-of-life litRPG story. It starts out pretty bad, so if you're giving this serial a shot, you owe it to yourself to read until the chess match happens, at which point if you still don't like it put it away and don't come back. Pirateaba (the author) publishes more words of web serial than anyone else writes of fiction, we're talking like 50k words a week. On update days, I don't need anything else to read while I do my morning cardio. It's not particularly rational, though there are characters (Saliss!) who are standouts in terms of having a clear internal narrative that drives them to behave the way they do. It is, however, extremely long, so it's got that going for it.

*A Practical Guide to Evil* by ErraticErrata started out YA and has long since left. Catherine Foundling, recruited by the Black Knight to become the Squire, has gone far and seen amazing things, and the recent chapters have been just gut-punch and moment of awesome packed. There's a lot of meta in this story, and a lot of meta-story. Every trope in the book is played with and analyzed with clear eyes.

*The Zombie Knight* (George Frost), a serial about a young man who commits suicide... and is then offered a chance to stick around and make a difference, but with superpowers this time, as an ancient reaper's sidekick. Has some very interesting superpowers, which are used in very interesting ways.

*Worth the Candle* (Alexander Wales), needs no introduction on this subreddit.

A bunch of other isekai litRPGs that don't get their own line. *Delve, Cinnamon Bun, The Many Lives of Cadence Lee, Eight, New Life of a Summoned Demoness*, (arguably) *Dungeon Crawler Carl, Devil's Foundry, Unbound, Vainquer the Dragon.*

*Blessed Time* and *Tower of Somnus*, the former a non-isekai timeloop litRPG and the latter a serial-numbers-filed-off Shadowrun Earth being actively quarantined by galactic civilization. Tower of Somnus is probably the best-realized Shadowrun-esque setting I've seen. It understands that Shadowrun as presented in most contexts is absurdism and that if you want to present a literalist world you have to do some work... and it does that work. (Also recommended to me via this subreddit.)

** *Books* (web serials in a different comment):

Glynn Stewart: 30 or so books of spaaaaace operaaaaaaah milSF across his various serieses plus a fantasy trilogy about goblins. They're exactly what it says on the tin. Well-realized pulp. A lot of this is at least a little bit character driven, which is nice. The math checks out and with the exception of some of his earlier books not considering all of the cool things you can do if you travel FTL, he covers all the usual ground and avoids the usual mistakes.

*Martha Wells, Network Effect*. A murderbot novel! I love murderbot! Aww, who's a precious terrifying terminator who just wants to hang out with his dumb take-too-many-risks science friends and watch anime. Murderbot is! Seriously, Murderbot is funny but also a great exploration of what it means to be a person, a friend, a teammate, and an AI.

*Jim Hines, the Libriomancer series*: what if librarian nerd book magic. As a nerd book kind of guy, yes, I loved it. Great for people who, like me, obsess over optimizing "if you could pull items out of books, what's your best option for self-defense".

*Emma Bull's War for the Oaks*, courtesy of my book club: wow, there are so many things that I only knew as tropes that originated here, and it was really good, too! This is recommend to folks who have a deep connection with rock (as in, the music genre) or who want to read the originator for a huge array of urban-fantasy tropes.

*Bujold, The Physicians of Vilnoc*: too on the nose, TOO ON THE NOSE. Also, it had basically no Penric-being-Penric. He doesn't even shit-talk his God once. *Masquerade in Lodi*, on the other hand, was fantastic and extremely Penric, so that was nice. These are both quite in-the-head books; they're in a way both whodunnits, though the first one is not a murder, it's a plague.

*Jo Walton: Lent, Lifelode, Or What You Will*. She's so utterly amazing. I don't even like art museums and she makes me want to visit art museums. How does she even do that? Also, she writes Catholicism, genuine full-faith Catholicism, better than anyone I've ever read. Recommended to anyone who enjoys books that have philosophy in them. Seriously, Jo Walton is the queen of that.

*Adrian Tchaikovsky: Redemption Blade*. "OK, we killed Sauron... what now?" really good. Really really good. Great grappling with coping with what was lost in the war and what war costs the people and the persons.

*Mary Robinette Kowal: The Relentless Moon* came out, it's set sort of at the same time as another book in her historical-fiction space race series but completely separate plot. She writes this alternative history with such amazing grace, humanity as humanity warts and wonders and all. To some degree it's a whodunnit, to some degree it's a journey into the past (an alternate, very grounded in history past). This series is extremely emotionally wrenching to me, very good at plucking my heartstrings.

*T Kingfisher AKA Ursula Vernon: **A Paladin's Grace* (superb) and *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking* (OMG AMAZING). The former hits all of the usual Ursula Vernon "sit down and shut up and let me show you how Paladins should work" buttons that I love so much, and the latter is an excellent look into how to optimize a rather unusual and weak-seeming magic... and also how you can have a child stepping up to be the hero without having them abandoned by their caregivers.

*Seanan McGuire*: Between the October Daye books, the InCryptid books, and the Wayward Children books, that's like thirty books. Plus a standalone about cheerleaders. Seanan McGuire has a thing for cheerleading. The InCryptid books feature science-minded, thoughtful characters and also the protagonist (of the first two). Of all McGuire's works I'd recommend them for y'all.

*Tamsyn Muir's Harrow the Ninth*: I literally don't go a week without thinking about this book and I read it back in August. Obviously you should read Gideon the Ninth first, but this is probably my highest-emotional-impact book of 2020. Necromancers in space, sure, but also "How do people break in different ways and how do they manage to keep moving forwards".

*Katherine Addison, The Angel of the Crows*: Yet another delightful retelling of Sherlock Holmes in a supernatural setting. Yay! It's... Sherlock Holmes-y. What's not to love.

*Mike Brooks, Rites of Passage (WH40K)*: A decent read, but it would have been a better book in literally any other setting, because WH40K is absolute fucking garbage as a setting. I mention this only because it lets me shit-talk WH40K as a setting, which I literally never get tired of doing.

*Elizabeth Bear, Machine*: I fucking love this setting, it's so beautifully at the exact most optimistic edge of the realism space. This book was great! Sort-of-transhumanist hard-SF. While there's plenty of cyberpunk out there, it's rare to see something go hard on the solarpunk side of things, and I'd say this (and Ancestral Night) / The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (and its sequels; not by the same author as this book) are a rarity in taking that approach. Highly recommended; not all science fiction has to be about pewpew-my-engines-go-this-fast-and-my-missiles-go-that-fast.

*S. L. Huang, the Cas Russell books*: God, Russell is such an ass, but her friends are great and math-as-superpower is great.

*Andrew Rowe: How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* is a litRPG critique/sendup of Zelda, and was an entertaining read.

*Diane Duane*: I'm working through the Young Wizards series. Extremely fun. Mentioned because my introduction to the series came from here.

*Graydon Saunders, A Mist of Grit and Splinters*. This series starts off with The March North, which is a straight-up military fantasy novel that delivers a radically different setting and set of characters, which get built on with two sorcery school novels. I love, love, love these books. Warning, it's written technically in English, but hoo boy is it an engineer's English.

I could probably rec Not Even Bones by Rebecca Shaeffer. It's about a girl whose mom kills zannies (humanoid monsters) and the daughter dissects them for purchase. It's rather interesting so far. I've been reading the comic version on webtoon.

** Holy shit. I just looked up a bunch of these and they seem right in my wheelhouse. Thank you very much for these which will act as a late Christmas present to me!

Edit:

Should probably add some of my own.

Mother of Learning finished this year:

Focused on a less-than powerful mage-in-training who is caught in a time loop and has to navigate this interesting setting that's filled out pretty well. The setting isn't anything completely original but it combines a lot of more general elements of fantasy world and really merges them into a finished product looks post acceptable and complex. Decently rational on its own with a pretty solid world and relatively simple characters which play out entertaining conflicts in creative ways. Very reminiscent of lots of Progression fantasy, but in a way that's more complex at satisfying than Numbers-Go-Up even if it takes a bit longer. The author has just now released the definitive premise for his news story which will follow a powerful arch mage in a separate fantasy universe which seems to be much more focused on the political and dramatic it's of the world and building up an empire rather than individual power

Worth the Candle speaks for itself.

I pretty randomly read the Ex-Heroes series by Peter Clines which turned out to be surprisingly fun. Set in its own Marvel/DC-inspired super universe that has fallen way to a zombie apocalypse which scoured the planet. An extremely comic-bookey and absurd premise, but pretty fun and enjoyable and it's execution. The characters and conflicts stuck with me which is a lot more than I can say about other things I've read. The characters are easily enjoyable and grow on you and it really has its own sense of personality which is rare. I was a little iffy on the depiction of a female character in the first book, there was nothing egregious, it just give me some bad vibes, but someone must've talk to the author by the second book because I really enjoy her from there on. This author did a really good job at describing the world, and used some relatively simplistic but incredibly effective setting techniques that I'm definitely gonna borrow. I don't know why, it's not one of the greatest things I've read, but this series really grew on me and I can honestly see myself rereading it in the future. If you're a fan of comic book movies and want to read a series with likable characters in fantastical scenarios with with decently written, and enjoyable characters, written in a grounded and researched way, this is for you.

I finally read Cradle by Will Wight and it is underdog, progression fantasy distilled to its purest form. The characters are far enough, the MC isn't anything to write home about but some of the cast and antagonist are really enjoyable. If want to read a story about a kid coming from nothing and slowly ascending in power to reach the strongest than this might be for you. Inspired by the Cultivation genre, the magic system is relatively simple but it's fun to think about. This is a pretty straightforward slow burn power fantasy that's really solid with enjoyable action but nothing really special about it. If you enjoy typical progression Fantasy you WILL enjoy this, otherwise you might want to read it if you're in the mood for some fun action.

** Honestly, most of the stuff I have read this year that I can remember has been fan fic, and not even the good kind.

A book that comes to mind that is better than most would expect is "The house of the Spirits" by Isabel Allende. Its a magical realism story set in a South American country and covers three generations of a family while discussing South America in the 1900s. I never thought to myself that it was great writing prose wise, but it was well built and definitely makes you think book.

** I know it's kind of a classic, but I finally read *Hyperion* by Dan Simmons. And what can I say, I think it deserves its status. It's a really interesting book with a lot of interesting themes and intertwining stories as well as literary references. John Keats being the obvious one, but there's quite a lot of Canterbury Tales too in this story of pilgrims telling each other stories as they progress towards their goal (but being sci-fi, the pilgrimage is on another planet, and the goal is a meeting with some kind of otherworldly, alien, possibly time-transcendent beast that will most likely just kill them all).

Problem is, I still haven't gotten around reading the sequel, *The Fall of Hyperion*, mostly for trivial reasons. Namely that the pandemic means I don't commute any more, and that has severely cut into my usual reading habits. Oh well. I really need to find a better balance with the whole "working from home" shtick. I should get around to it before I forget all about the previous book though.

Oh, on another note, just a curiosity, but I'm currently reading an Italian novel by one Michele Mari, *Io venia pien d'angoscia a rimirarti* ("I came full of anguish to admire you", I don't believe it has an official English translation though). Another book involving a famous romantic poet - this time it's the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi - but the funny thing is that it's told in the form of a diary written by his (real) brother, and it seems pretty blatant it's a story about... lycanthropy. It's a genuine, not shlocky but actually written with stunningly accurate XIX century prose, book about Giacomo Leopardi - a gloomy, nerdy, hunchback poet whose core philosophy was built upon how much of an evil bitch Nature is to its creatures and who likely died a virgin younger than 40 - dealing with a werewolf. Or /being/ a werewolf, I'm not sure yet. Make of that what you will.

** The most interesting work for me was Orson Welles' radio rendition of /War of the Worlds/ on [[https://www.bornalone.org/index.html][The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]. Tense, with an artistic touch, and a thought-provoking tone for the ending monologue. /Dracula/ was also good. Liked The Mercury Theater way better than his movies, though /Touch of Evil/ wasn't bad, and I have a soft spot for /The Stranger/.

Apparently the world of radio drama which I've never bothered with has some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet,_Please][gems]] worth trying.

/Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!/ was interesting enough that I've also started reading [[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/][The Feynman Lectures on Physics]].

I've been going through the [[https://www.bartleby.com/hc/][Harvard Classics]]. Special mentions go to John Woolman's /Journal/. Woolman was an American Quaker, and the journal is an interesting and often powerful mix of travel story, musings on conscience, and history, with a touch of Quaker oddity.

For works posted on this sub, I've taken a liking to /Pokemon: Origin of Species/ and /The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere/.

Just to mention some ordinary novels: /HakoMari/ (exceptionally good 1st book, was also one I learned about from here), /The Fountainhead/ (better than expected, Ellsworth Toohey was a great villain), /Casino Royale/ (interesting characterization of Bond, but inferior to the movie), book 2 of /The Lost Fleet/ series (Jack Campbell, writing is, um, not inspired, but I liked Geary's character- controlled, hard-working, a man of integrity), Sanderson's /The Emperor's Soul/ (short, focused, liked it better than Mistborn but the ending wasn't perfect), /Ender's Shadow/ (a retelling of Ender's Game from Bean's perspective, good, a little uneven, and feels a little like some retconning going on with Bean's character), the first Hornblower novel /The Happy Return / Beat to Quarters/ (was simply magic, and was an influence on /Star Trek/- reportedly Patrick Stewart was given a Hornblower novel when he asked about his character).

Poe's /Masque of the Red Death/ was as expected great.

Things I started but haven't finished yet: Borges (seems to be one of those remarkable names that everyone knows but no-one talks about), William Morris' /The Well at the World's End/ (apparently Tolkein and C. S. Lewis had a high opinion of it, its fascinating if you can tolerate the slow pace), /Null-A/ (can't say I understand what its all about but its written well). One day I'll finish reading an actual Shakespeare play rather than watching the animated BBC versions. May try to read out Zamiatin's [[https://mises.org/library/we][We]] before the year ends.

** Incomplete list of everything I can remember reading this year, in no particular order.

*Unsong*

Extremely funny and pun-laden work, with a unique world built on biblical literalism and Jewish mysticism.

Has a lot of characters and interactions I really enjoyed, but I think it has structural problems and an unsatisfying ending. Still highly recommend.

*Cordyceps*

A horror story where the twist is extremely obvious.

One of the main characters is very annoying in an intentional and well-rendered way that I still found exhausting to deal with. I didn't find this one nearly as enjoyable as everyone else here.

*Mother of Learning*

Time loop story, our hero unexpectedly finds himself in an endless repetition of the first month of Junior year of wizard school. Really nice slow, steady progression in the character, both in power and in becoming less of an ass.

Fun world building, good use of the time loop, nice use of revisiting challenges that were too much before. Somewhat weak on interpersonal character development. Really bad at establishing convincing stakes - every time the author establishes the potential for permanent setbacks or permanently missed opportunities he stretches it out for ages and fails to actually pull the trigger. Great overall, and very comfy, would highly recommend, especially during quarantine.

*Worth The Candle* (Ongoing)

Guy who's usually the Dungeon Master in his RPG group gets sucked into a fantasy world that appears to have been constructed by smashing together all of his campaign notes. He gets game mechanical superpowers to deal with the ever-escalating object-level challenges of the world, but the real challenge is causality bending everything to make him confront his traumas and failings.

There's a lot to unpack with this one. Good prose, good pacing, creative action scenes, incredible world-building, excellent internal character psychology. Does extremely subtle and impressive things with the narrator's changing mental stats. Very impressive post-modern flair as it goes on. Extremely highly recommend, unless you want something comfy, because this one is pretty damn rough. No seriously - the author is routinely on this subreddit asking for ideas for a cozy low-stakes setting he's planning on next, because even he's clearly needs a break from how rough Worth The Candle gets.

Would also recommend reading Metropolitan Man by the same author first. It's a lot shorter, and more quickly establishes what the author is capable of. The first several chapters of WTC can come across as a generic but somewhat better-than-average isekai.

*Ward*

Sequel to Worm, an action-packed superhero deconstruction/reconstruction/rationalization with an escalation fetish and an author who's become known for raw output, prose quality, and ability to write altered mental states, and infamous for dragging his characters through Hell.

Ward is a very different beast from Worm, focusing much more on the processing of and recovery from trauma. Superpowers now are much more tied into the metaphor, and no longer simply drawn, clearly specified, munchkinnable things. If you think "pacing" means the rate of change on characters and the state of the world you'll find it's much improved here, and if you think "pacing" means the time between action sequences you'll be disappointed. Still suffers from filler arcs, still lurches awkwardly from combat to combat at times. Still a Wildbow work where you can expect everything to be suffering all the time.

Overall I think Ward was a lot better than Worm, but if the above description doesn't sound like something you'd like, you're probably right. I'd also consider listening to the podcast We've Got Worm between Worm and this, as the attitude towards Worm that the podcast has is much closer to what Wildbow is going for in Ward than the attitude the general (spacebattles) fandom has.

*I Just Love Killin'* (abandoned, but not dissatisfying so)

Worm/Rick And Morty crossover. Worm knowledge is necessary, for Rick And Morty you can get away with the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDr9axb7X7E][two]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OWdwiU1W7g][scenes]] that Krombopulous Michael shows up in. Taylor's superpower is replaced with having a cheerful alien assassin stuck in her head, who decides to be her mentor.

Very funny, extremely well-paced, nice breezy casual thing about training and planning paying off. Would recommend.

*Wake of the Ravager* (ongoing)

In a world where everyone gets RPG-style stats, skills, and level ups, our protagonist dreams of being a super powerful wizard. He lucks into a broken combination of abilities, but doesn't rest on his laurels and instead constantly pursues more power, often through munchkinning and experimentation. There's also a harem.

This is a dumb adolescent wish fulfillment / power fantasy, but I think it's the best possible version of that. The action is solid, the pacing is usually excellent, and it enjoys being what it is. In particular, I'm impressed with how fast the author adds new ideas, powers, setting elements and characters, while still managing to keep juggling said elements without dropping them (it does eventually buckle under its own weight though). I think the Warp Tank arc is the part the audience here would enjoy the most (it has the most munchkinning and experimentation). It's also where I'd suggest stopping; I lost interest a few arcs later.

*Pokemon: The Origin Of Species*

A gritty Pokemon fanfic where, somehow, the world of Pokemon has been hammered into a form that actually makes sense. Our three POV characters seek to change the world through various rational lenses. They travel the world, try things that both fail and succeed, actually suffer from their failures, and actually benefit from their successes.

This is just incredibly solid from a rationalist standpoint. The characters are driven, intelligent, and good at what they do without having handwavy brain superpowers (even the psychics aren't handwavy!). The world is consistent and makes sense. The pacing is great, the stakes are extremely believable (the author puts in the work to show that things can go wrong).

Super big recommendation for this. I think it's highly underrated, easily one of the best stories in this subreddit's milieu, and the single best at whatever "rational fiction" is supposed to mean.

*You Needed Opponents With Gravitas* (incomplete/probably abandoned)

Worm/The Culture cross. You do not need to be familiar with The Culture to enjoy it, but you do need to be familiar with Worm. The world of Worm experiences an intervention by super advanced post-scarcity anarchist aliens.

I really enjoyed this. It's well-written, well-paced, has some neat world-building, shows off some uncommon ideas, and has a mature understanding of societal organization. It's a shame that it got abandoned, but since it was rather low-stakes (the conclusion was obvious, it was just an interesting to read journey), stopping short doesn't sting that much.

*Significant Digits*

Fan sequel to Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality, a Harry Potter fanfic where everyone is absurdly intelligent, the author considers imparting his unusual version of the scientific method to be his holy mission, and the genre changes completely every 20 chapters.

Significant Digits shows expanded world-building and scope, more mature understanding of human politics, and a more self-consistent understanding of itself than HPMOR had. I think in many ways it's an improvement, though it lacks the sort of sheer manic joy in being what it is that HPMOR has. This year I found myself rereading and enjoying it, even though I've outgrown HPMOR itself by now. Would recommend.

** *Automatic Reload* by Ferret Steinmetz

Protagonist is a mercenary who has four prosthetic limbs because AI and robotics have become a lot better at fighting than unmodified humans wielding dumb weapons - and he obsessively programs and optimizes them to get tiny performance improvements that can literally mean the difference between life and death. He takes on a job protecting cargo that turns out to be a woman transformed into a biological weapon by the IAC - the scariest and most amoral private military contractor out there, with all the best computers and technology - and the two of them go on the run, hoping to survive as long as possible and fight back as much as they can before they're captured or killed.

In terms of it appealing to the audience here, Characters do attempt to make reasonable decisions in the face of what might be superior intelligence ("our escape plan has to be stupid because all the smart things are too predictable and we'll get surrounded and caught right away, but we have to make our stupid plan as smart as possible anyway so it has a chance of working") and there's even some AI alignment talk which should appeal to the LessWrong crowd. ;) I enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend it.

** I'm a few days late here, but I wanted to get to the end of the Wheel of Time novel I was reading.

So, let's start with those.

In 2020, I read the first six books of *The Wheel of Time*.

The worldbuilding so far has been epic fantasy at its finest. The magic system is a little squishy for my taste (I can suddenly heal [this injury], which no one has ever done before, because I tried a combination of [two of the five elements], which no one has ever tried for this injury before!), but there appear to be pretty firm limits on what can be done, with only minor stretching as the series goes on. The history is detailed and not obviously inconsistent, the nations are recognizably the way they are for reasons that make sense given their history (even if those traits sometimes approach the point of caricature).

The protagonists, almost to a one, start out really grating, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the author, and makes sense in context. Many of them are teenagers or young adults who grew up in an insulated community, and are basically being dragged around against their will by an authority figure they have little respect for. /Of course/ they're going to be brats about it. This gave them plenty of room to grow, and they have taken full advantage of that. Although not all of those characters have grown out of the whinging yet (looking at you here, Mat). The characters are still a little two-dimensional for my taste; they tend to get hyper-focused about whatever they're working on, with only small diversions for minor side plots that almost always involve romance so fluffy that Disney princesses would go into diabetic shock from reading it.

As for the antagonists, a second dimension would be an improvement. It's fortunate that the forthcoming apocalypse, and the conflict between protagonists about how best to face it down, is enough to give the story some tension, because I cannot take even one of these Evil Overlord Academy washouts seriously. Big Boss included.

I don't want to say much about the plot, because I don't believe it would be fair. The first couple of books kind of worked as stories on their own, each with clear beginnings, middles, and ends, and self-contained story and character arcs, but the further I get into the story, the more I feel that Jordan is going for a more Tolkien-style "one book, published in [fourteen] volumes" rather than a traditional structure where each book, while taking place as part of a larger narrative, is satisfying to read on its own.

One major recurring negative that bugs me is all of the narrative convenience. It's somewhat justified within the story (one of the powers of the three male leads is that weird shit convenient to the narrative is just likely to happen around them), but that doesn't make it not-annoying when it happens.

Thematically, I like that a lot of the focus of the book is on /realpolitik/, about how someone might ethically gather nations together in the lead-up to an apocalyptic event. And as fluffy as the romance is, I'm very happy that they don't present love as one of those "Meet the right person and live happily ever after" things. I was hoping to have more exploration of the metatextual references (e.g. in exactly what sense is Egwene al'Vere a cyclical repetition of Guinevere?), but that might be something for the later books. Hopefully that actually gets paid off somehow.

Writing style: it's a slog. If I were an editor and were handed this series of books, there is a lot that I would cut out. There are /so many/ pages about love-struck characters agonizing that they can't be together; if I cut just half of that agonizing out I could probably reduce these six books down to five. And there are long periods where the author describes nothing happening. The plot got more development in the last third of book six than in the book and two thirds before it. When tension does build up, it's almost always resolved almost immediately. A character gets kidnapped in the last ten chapters of the 55-chapter Book 6. I thought that might be a set-up for the next novel, but nope, all of the planning, preparation, and execution of the rescue plan takes place in those ten chapters (with the help of a heaping serving of more narrative convenience).

I'm definitely going to finish this (I hear the pacing issues above get worse from here, which OH GOD PLEASE NO), but I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't either in it for the worldbuilding, or a completist who wants to read a very influential work in the fantasy genre. I'm definitely more the latter; the worldbuilding alone, as spectacular as it is, would not keep me reading this.

Moving on.

This past year, I also read the new *Dresden Files* books by Jim Butcher, *Peace Talks* and *Battle Ground*.

Three things I would keep in mind for these books:

First, read *Brief Cases* immediately before these books. Nearly all of the short stories tie in to the plot of these novels, in one way or another. There are a couple of references back to one or two stories in *Side Jobs*, so there's no reason /not/ to re-read that, too (h/t to Daniel Greene for the suggestion to read the short stories first). Most of these tie-ins are given enough context that the story doesn't lose much if all you know about those events is what the narrator explains to you, but there is one short story in Brief Cases that gets referenced over, and over, and over, and really explains a lot about one character's behaviour towards the protagonist, and the narrator/protagonist /wasn't there for those events/, so he /doesn't know/ the context.

Second, these are a single story. I haven't had possession of both books at the same time, and there are several things in the second book that I am /itching/ to go back to the first book to check out. If you can read them back-to-back, and then read them back-to-back again, do that. I certainly plan to.

Third, these are book #16 and #17 in a longer series; even paired up to make a full story, they do not work well without the context of the rest of the novels.

In-context, though, they're excellent. That thing I was talking about earlier, where you tell a story that is part of a larger narrative, while still having the smaller story feel satisfying in its own right? Jim Butcher is great at this. Even with the caveat that "these two books are a single story," the first book of the pair still satisfyingly wraps up its A-plot, with the B-plot ending on a cliffhanger to become the A-plot of the next book. And on a larger level, this pair is the satisfying wrap-up of a five book arc, and provides some hooks for the next arc.

The one point that I really didn't enjoy is that, even knowing that this series is supposed to be a pastiche of old film noir private eye stories, there's a whole lot of Dresden leering at women going on. Even, near the beginning of Peace Talks, his daughter's teenage babysitter. It's a recurring trend in these novels, and it's always a bit cringey. Dresden leering at his love interest is fine. Dresden leering at the lust-inducing sex vampire, sure, who can blame him. The babysitter was just a bit too squick for me.

But, all things considered, I am definitely adding these to my bookshelf, and I will probably be doing a full re-read of the whole series this summer.
