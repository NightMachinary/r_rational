***** Nah guys, remember, this is the rational subreddit. Once you eliminate the impossible, what ever remains must be the truth. Clearly Mewtwo escaped, contacted the time travelling pokemon Celebi and struck a deal. Mewtwo was sent a bajillion years back in time where he met Mew. Mew then taught Mewtwo not only how to use recover, but the shapeshift as well.

Mewtwo than travelled forwards in time, and shapeshifted in to human male, after which he then fathered a girl named Aiko. The reason he doesn't want Aiko to become a trainer is because he's afraid she'll learn her half pokemon, half human pokemorph nature in a freak pokeball accident.

**** I was thinking perhaps Giovanni intentionally sent a terrible spy to see how many meta levels the party (mainly Red and Leaf) are thinking on. Do they go "Ah shucks I can't believe Giovanni is spying on us, how mean," or "Wow, what an obvious spy, Giovanni doesn't know what he is doing," or "Giovanni knowingly sent this obvious spy after us to gauge our reaction to the idea that Giovanni is spying on us." Any situation ends up with either them underestimating Giovanni's intelligence, a positive, or respecting him more while trusting other people less, also a positive.

****** I got a bit carried away thinking through this reply. To be honest, a nagging part of my brain insisted that "Red is the protag" was my real underlying justification, but I tried to think through it better than that.

My theory is that Giovanni would consider Blue somewhat of a known quantity. The Oaks are a part of the Kantoan elite alongside the gym leaders, so Giovanni should be generally familiar with Blue's personality. And I think most importantly, he must already know that Blue is dark, if Giovanni ever had a psychic with him like he did when talking with Leaf (assuming that is close to correct). If Blue thought about it this way, he would come to the conclusion that Giovanni knows, and he wouldn't want that "secret" getting out and tarnishing his image. Blue isn't the story's rationalist protagonist, but I would imagine some-one with Blue's championship​ aspirations would know at least bit about politics/political etiquette​, and throwing a fit because a gym leader "encouraged" an awkward girl to befriend you at a bike shop hardly seems worth the risk of being labeled "Dark" by the tabloids. Maybe he'd almost consider it a compliment that a leader was paying attention to him. Also, like you said, Blue is famous-ish, so Giovanni can do some diagnostic work based on his performance in battles or regular old rumor mill type stuff. I just don't really see what surprising or enlightening​ information this hypothetical fall-spy would get from Blue, unless Blue acts incredibly rashly when he finds out. Which, if your enemy is an idiot, it doesn't seem worth the time or money to confirm that. Burning your trust with a potential champion might be a bad idea for a secret crimelord, but if Blue really becomes a problem, well, powerful trainers die every day.

There are narratively obvious reasons why Giovanni might want to gauge Leaf's reaction. The only unique backlash I can think of is her going forward with the renegade story, but that seems easy to predict, so Giovanni would only go through with it if the renegade story going public was not a big deal any more, or he knew how to minimize/handle the fall out.

This leads us to Red. He is the least known person in the group by Giovanni. And that must bother Giovanni, since he is a travelling companion of that meddling kid-detective and THE Blue Oak. He would feel like the odd one out to me. I'm not sure that Red has been particularly cautious/secretive about his psychic training, so if Giovanni was curious I bet he could find out a lot about Red by gathering intel from his teachers. Giovanni also knows that Red follows his blog, and even once sent a reply to the kid. He is seeding some kind of relationship there I think. And if he is the rational foil to Red's protagonist, I would think that him challenging Red with a multilayered self-betraying deception would be a interesting way to get that seed to grow.

Of course, all of this is assuming Aiko is some kind of plant or spy or something, and also Giovanni is the one setting it up. I'm not sure I'm convinced that is what's happening though. Simplest solution is that she is just a person with some awkward jealousy and sense of inferiority around the main crew.

This idea is mostly based on her description: "She has an angular impish face that takes in the room all at once," "Black hair cut short," being similar to Janine/Anzu's description: "The young woman's short purple hair is drawn back, making the clean angles of her face dark" Along with similar descriptions for leader Koga: "So severe and cold, his face sharp like hers"

And manurisms, she touches her forhead to the ground in a bow when she's accepted into the group. While the world came from much of japanese culture, I feel that a gesture such as that would more likely come from a family based in tradition such as the Kogas. (As shown in the end of the second interlude. She seems well brought up in many regards, but looking for her own anonymity.

Though that's mostly only clear because of the second interlude, no reason the trio would guess this with the information present to them.

Though, interestingly, if you add up all the boosts Pidgeot can give itself (agility x3 + tailwind = an 8x multiplier), and use its old base stats with the Combee method... you get a top speed of nearly 2000mph, which is about Mach 2.5

But it feels pretty wrong to suggest that Pidgeot is faster than Ninjask. Unless the speed stat is about agility rather than top speed, I suppose.

If that's true then according to 1/2mv^{2} that's around 7500 joules. (they are 5,5kg, according to bulbapedia.) That's... legitimately terrifying. If one of those hits you, you would probably explode. Or at least go splat.

**** Just checking your math here.

#+begin_quote
  For kinetic energy: KE = 1/2mv^{2}

  In SI units: J = 1/2(1kg)(1m/s)^{2}

  m = 5.5 kg (from Bulbapedia)

  v = 5km/min = 5000m/min = 83.33...m/s

  v^{2} = (83.33...m/s)^{2} = 6944.44...m/s

  joules = 1/2(5.5kg)(6944.44...m/s) = 19097.222...
#+end_quote

So, that combee is travelling with a little over 19kJ of kinetic energy. Let's assume that it maintains its 5km/min speed for its entire 6km typical range (or, for 72 seconds). Then that also assumes it's replacing any energy lost to air resistance/drag. I'm going to stop my speculation here, because a combee does not look very aerodynamic...

19kJ is enough energy to raise the temperature of a liter of water by about 15.83C.

[[http://genesisnow.com.au/reference/energy-examples/][This source]] gives an example of 10kJ of continuous usage as "large electric water heater, peak demand of medium-large home."

Perhaps most telling example is comparing that to typical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][muzzle energies]]. A high-powered sniper rifle outputs about 15kJ, whereas an anti-tank/anti-aircraft round usually has closer to 30kJ. So, really, it's a good thing Combee (unlike Beedrill) can't learn Take Down.

** Hahahaha, I guess this marks a year into their journey! Happy birthday, Red and Blue!

So I have to say that as an avid reader of the rational Animorphs fic the bit about the premortem was uncanny. Do you guys collaborate behind the scenes, or were you strongly inspired by its most recent chapter? (Is Aiko going to be the next David???)

This chapter was a nice break. It's happy, Red's being funny...I feel like this is your subtle (maybe not-so-subtle? I'm terrible at subtlety) way of informing the readers that Red's psychic training is paying off and it's lifting a kind of depression that he never even knew he had from his psyche.

Regarding Aiko...well, she's not dark-type. I doubt Giovanni would send a spy who isn't dark if he knew about Red's psychic abilities. I'm reminded of those escort-type quests in the Gen 5 and later games, where you pair up with someone to go through a forest and get free healing, revives etc. She does seem to get along well with all 3 of them - perhaps too well? Shares Red's preparedness, Blue's love for battling, and Leaf's desire to avoid causing unnecessary harm to relatively placid wild pokemon. So I don't know what she is. I do hope that she doesn't become a long-term addition to the group as imo that'd get difficult to juggle 4 main characters, but if you can pull it off then hey, have at it.

Lastly, that combee honey must have a crazy strong smell if it's still capable of attracting the hive even while frozen. Freezing things tends to reduce how much smell particles diffuses from the surface.

*** honestly looking at pics it looks like combees wear parts of their hive as a shell. when a lot of combees gather together in one place that literally forms a mobile hive of sorts kinda. that's also probably why vespiquen can release combees from her body with her order moves. upon evolution her shell moves down and becomes big enough to contain multiple very young combee. maybe when they're flying fast enough they shed the hive-shell and it grows back later.

** In the last scene, where Red is practicing with his rock and the rest or talking, I had the impression of suspense. Perhaps the feeling was anticipation, and I had the hypothesis that there would be some drama upon the revelation that Red is psychic. Was this an intentional effect that you subverted with the arrival of Prof. Oak & co., or was that a misreading on my part? If the latter, and your intended emotional response was different, I think it may be worth examining what gave me that impression. If the former, nice job :).

Anyway, more broadly, I can see the addition of this character as being sort of amateurish, or as being a warning sign in some other fic, but right now I am pretty interested to see how the story changes if she is not just a brief subplot, but a new mainstay of the story. That said, I think you were a bit blunt with the "hints" about her character. If she is going to be around for a while, I recommend making Red's observations more subtle (addressing them in narration but not his thought, making the things he is noticing more subtle, reducing the number, or adding things that paint a less unified picture), or else revealing whatever the deal is very shortly. I was already getting not-quite-annoyed by what felt like it was supposed to be subtle foreshadowing, and I think the effect would be greatly amplified should things continue in the same vein. Even if the reveal is coming in the next chapter, it may be worth another look at this.

(If you haven't noticed, I haven't learned her name yet. Though I was referring to Leaf as "Green" for some time.)

Looking forward to how this changes the shape of the story!

Maybe this won't make sense, but yes, I was aware it was building suspense and wanted to tie it into the more immediate suspense of them hearing something right afterward, even though it was an unrelated and different type of suspense and feels a bit like cheating :)

Yeah, I'm a bit worried about this too. I might try to tone it down a bit, but honestly it just felt like it would be odd if Red just learned a strategy for predicting bad outcomes and failed to consider her so fully.
