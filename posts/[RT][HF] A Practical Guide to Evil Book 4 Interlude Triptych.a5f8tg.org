** Love the conversation between Papenheim and the Dead King. Friedrich is proud that the Dead King remembers his line, and the Dead King is cordial and polite to the dying man.

It's wonderful how you can have a friendly conversation with a mortal enemy, before returning to merciless total war. It's almost like a play.

Not necessarily, depending on the era. There have been real-world, large scale wars where officers really did have polite conversations with each in between slaughtering each other's soldiers by the thousands. The Napoleonic Wars in particular come to mind.

** So many things here.

The Dead King is amazing as always. He feels like the kind of video game mid-game boss you cry after defeating, because the dude had /Class/ and now you're left with the crappy villain with the dumb motivations. Except that he's undefeated and closer in power to the optional late-game superboss.

Cat doesn't seem to have a Name, title or anything but she can do magic (?) and still feels confident enough to walk to the Herald of the Deep and chat with him. Most importantly, she can light her pipe herself. It only took four books.

Archer still MIA. Please.

Akua is still a ghost, but now she's a Winter free one. She's becoming more dangerous by the chapter. I mean, she was acting like a Good girl but at least Winter was there to be an Evil influence on her. Now there's nothing and if you can't trust her to be Evil, you can't trust her at all.

Edit: reading the comments on EE's site made me realize I'm stupid. Sve Noc has ascended and chosen Catherine as her priestess. Cat isn't doing magic, she's doing miracles. Miracles of Winter Night sound more like fairy tales stuff than something you would light a pipe with but you should always bet on Cat to remove the wonder and romanticism out of anything.

Edit2: more stuff. The Dwarves' kleptomania appears to be some sort of racial mental illness rather than a cultural thing. At least, it's common enough to have a name and disruptive enough to consider controlling.

The Heroes at Cleves are obviously the White Knight and the Witch of the Woods. Some major shit is going down there if the two hardest hitters of the crusade are here.

Masego is going to go /insane/ that he missed her descension and Sve Noc's subsequent, more complete, ascension. She might make it up to him by performing a few new miracles, maybe.

**** Oh man he is going to pout so hard. He'll still be able to observe her priestly connection though, so that's nice. Also, it's kinda rough, but these last few chapters actually showed that maseagos parents were right about cat. She just got lucky and it fixed itself. That's going to be a butter conversation to have.

***** What? If anything they proved the opposite. Wekesa's contention was that Cat was metaphysically speaking "dead" and just a shell or copy made by Winter (Masego decided he didn't think that was true and didn't really care if it was or wasn't either way). Cat's depowering and soul being torn asunder proves that her essential core soul always was real and was never faked by Winter, else there would have been no "her" to revert to after she lost the mantle.

****** Ah, I guess we disagree slightly on the particulars. I viewed it as winter /twisting/ cat, and leaving something completely different behind, that is merely trying to follow Cats utility function, with Cats third resurrection reversing that. I can see the other side of it though.

  “Catherine Foundling died at Second Liesse,” the Warlock gently said. “What walked out of that fortress is an impression of the young woman made on the fabric of Winter, no more and no less. I'm sorry, Masego. I really am. I know you liked her. But even if the Black Queen believes she's the same person, she is not. Amadeus didn't realize it either, he doesn't have the learning. But he described what happened in the city to me. There can be no doubt.”

There IS now an undeniable "Cat", Warlock thought she was merely facsimile made of winter.

** I can't help but point out the fact that pretty much the entire hero party came to the aid of the Alamans but not a single one came to help the Lycaonese. Sad to see the end of Hannoven, but they were quite badass in the face of death, and their young will live on.

And this is exactly why no Heroes came to save them. The Story was too good to have a cop-out "and then heroes came and saved everyone"-ending. This is the stereotypical bastion of badasses that fell, but their children will swear vengeance and probably produce several Heroes down the line.

Seeing their history it's probably not the first time this pattern occurs, much like Callow.
