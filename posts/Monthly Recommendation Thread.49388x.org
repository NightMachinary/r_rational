*** I was JUST about to post it here! I thoroughly agree in it's recommendation. It has over 1,000 updates so far and I'm currently making an pdf version of the comic. I only finished chapter 1 and 2 so far out of the 14 chapters though.

It starts out as an average woman involved in weird circumstances and she gets smarter about how to deal with things throughout the story. She reminds me a bit of Taylor Hebert, only less cynical and is slowly learning to munchkin time travel instead of bugs. In addition, it's not too much of a spoiler after the second chapter, but [[#s][the time travel is]]

**** Ugh so having just read up to the 8th chapter and I finally figured out I'm supposed to already have read the 'retcon'-spoilers from chapter... 3?

Urgh. I guess I should really read authors notes, I completely missed the point of those. And apparently some of them were simple replacements of original pages. G'ah.

(how are you going to handle the retcons in book format? I guess you could put them in after the scene in the past ends..)

Still, the story's really captivating.

***** I already did. Here's the [[https://www.mediafire.com/folder/52ysreiddfthx/All_Night_Laundry][MediaFire link]] for the first two chapters.

Don't worry about missing too much from the author's notes. The most important story-relevant information you might have missed were some fanart and when to read the retcons (which is usually whenever Bina returns to the present from her time travels).

I handle the retcon pages by using hyperlinks. They allow me to put links at the end of each post so you can skip over the retcon posts when reading the original timeline posts and vice versa. I even have a link in later posts to bring you to the first retcon post when a retcon occurs and the very last retcon post has a link to bring you right back to the post you were just reading before going to the retcons. Best of all, the hyperlinks works in doc /and/ pdf files.

I'm currently just finished editing the retcon section in the third chapter and it looks really well done. jack-fractal will notify the readers whenever I have a new chapter ready for downloading and the next one should be ready in a few days.

EDIT: MediaFire's not playing nice with me right now in letting me share a folder. Give me a moment.

EDIT 2: Problem solved!

**** I can't find it, but there's one where Dumbledore tries to... Dumbledore Harry into a time loop for 20 years, but it ends up being Ron instead. The loop resets every time he goes to sleep, so Ron sleeps for 5 more minutes for 20 years.

If you're ever wondering if things could be worse, you could be Ron.

**** I think you missed the point of the story. The loop isn't 'wasted' on him; the loop is torture that takes away all meaning from his life.

The only way mistake I see Harry making is not seeking novelty once Voldemort is dead. (before Voldemort is dead he did try seeking novelty, but it ends up killing him) Disappear after completing the necessary storyline, move to a different random city every time, and you can possibly have a tolerable life.

I suppose he'd get there eventually, now that he knows the script for the first seven years.

While the setting is not explicitly rational (the magic, in particular is very vague, like Lord of the Rings), the plot and character interactions are smart and consistent. It's an incredibly good anime, with vivid animation and thoughtful writing; I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime, no matter the genre.
