I've read:

- Cradle
- A Thousand Li
- Heart of Cultivation
- Ave Xia Rem Y

I've heard of:

- Street Cultivation
- Forge of Destiny
- Forty Millenniums of Cultivation
- Grandmaster Strategist
- Reverend Insanity, The Magus Era, Way of Choices and Nightfall (not sure if they are rational)
- I don't think it counts as 'rational' but all works by Er Gen and I Eat Tomatoes, some I've finished

It doesn't need to be completely rational; that's too strict for Wuxia/Xianxia/Xuanhuan. I would honestly take any recommendation that goes up to the standards of [[/r/rational]].


** Cultivation Chat Group! It's more comedy though.

Would you recommend all the ones you've read?

*** Yep, I only listed those that 'I deem worthy'. However they all have the same flaw for some reason, that being they all start slow. Cradle is undoubtedly my recommendation if someone wants to get into Wuxia/Xianxia/Xuanhuan.

***** Yep, Cradle stands as one of the best in progression fantasy in general IMO. Nothing's perfect for everyone however; If you've read two or three (depends on patience) books and still don't like it, then it's probably not for you. Each book is better than the last so sticking with it will be worth it. If you don't like reading about someone seating around in a cave and meditate on the Dao and come out dominating the whole planet, you should start with a steampunk fantasy webnovel from a Chinese author, Lord of the Mysteries. Rather than cultivation, there's potions that gives you powers. And the story-writing and translation quality is so good you read it like a novel from a western author. It'll introduce you to the good parts of Xianxia without the bad parts. It also starts off slow and really picks near the end of the first book. BTW, never search character names as you'll get spoiled even when just looking at an image.

For those accustomed to western media, the characters and settings in Xianxia can feel a bit off but it's something you'll get used to. Things like arrogant young masters, undying immortals, cultivation, etc that's prevalent in Xianxia can be jarring when you're new to the genre but I think Cradle's author tamed it down from the usual of Xianxia novels quite well. Well enough to get introduced and accustomed to them unlike how I started with I Shall Seal the Heavens and went "Why the fuck is everyone acting like POS murderhobo?" and "She just kidnapped you, why do you like her?"

What I like about Xianxia is that it's so different from any other piece of media I've consumed. Most MCs I've read are some Mary Sue or goody two shoes, but in Xianxia, the MC could do a genocide and I'll barely bat an eye and other characters would praise the MC for being 'strong' (Doesn't happen in Cradle and most good stories, so no worries). It really feels like a ruthless world where might makes right before any social reforms could take place, or is squashed before they could. Also, people that are said to be legends and such actually feel powerful; killing with a breath, gory deaths, etc. People actually die on the mass scale, and not just all them just got knocked unconscious somehow.

TLDR: Yep, Cradle's a good first, read Lord of the Mysteries if you hate cultivation.

** I really liked /Changing Faces/ (same author as /Street Cultivation/.) It's more LitRPG than cultivation, though. But there are so many times when there's a setup for a dumb choice to drive the plot, and then the characters... just /talk to each other/ instead. Or notice their own irrational habits of thought and consciously try to change them.

If you've ever read /Wheel of Time/ and now have a permanent itch because of how /dumb/ all the characters were, then /Changing Faces/ is like a soothing balm for it.

(Also, it's only three short books with a solid ending.)

[edit: the series is /New Game Minus/, /Changing Faces/ is the name of the first book.]

** It's not /really/ very rational, but if you want a legitimately great wuxia, I recommend watching Thunderbolt Fantasy. It's a great Taiwanese wuxia show, made with the assistance of a Japanese animation studio.

And while it's mostly just wuxia storytelling, it does have a pretty well-executed "master strategist" character who does some amusing anime-level plans.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master, Template A Variation 4]] is a light, fairly satirical/genre-aware piece.

If follows a xianxia reader who wakes up to find themselves as the generic early antagonist of a typical xianxia novel. They set about using their genre savviness to escape the traps and tropes such template characters tend to fall into.

I'd not put it down as a great work, but it's a fun enough read to fill time.

** Defiance of the Fall is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. It's really tropey but written by a western author so no translation or grammar issues. The characters aren't amazing, but they aren't as egregiously bad as you sometimes see in typical xianxia either. The main character isn't too smart or talented, so he has to rely on treasures and his high luck stat to provide him opportunities, which can and does result in him getting hurt or even crippled. But of course, he's the protagonist, so he survives and becomes better than before. I recommend it for light reading.

He who Fights with Monsters is kinda xianxia kinda jrpg. Really neat system with nice power levels. The main character is sorta an asshole though, and sometimes the item and skill descriptions take away from the flow of a chapter. It's better written than Defiance. So if you can handle the assholery of the protagonist, the other characters are actually pretty fun and the humor is usually good.

Paragon of Destruction is also written by a western author, and is on a slightly higher level of quality than Defiance of the Fall. It starts off pretty bad tbh, with the protagonist getting lucky breaks and acquaintances who are willing to raise his power, but it gets better. Once the protagonist starts traveling alone more, he starts taking more initiative. Around chapter 150+ is where it hits its stride imo. Power is still something he wants to attain, but it comes from himself and his ideas instead of random guy turning out to be a sage or something (usually).

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23878/broken-chains][Broken Chains]] is decent enough.

Characters are more human than some xianxia. The sympathetic ones don't do the whole amoral destroy the weak schtick.

Please note, I've made it about 60% through what's written and we're still low on the power tier. Story is still early on.

** I liked Renegade Immortal and ISSTH (by Er Gen). RI was better IMO, though its pacing breaks near the end as the MC needs to get several orders of magnitude stronger in relatively few chapters. These aren't rational by any means though.
