#+begin_quote
  Similar to a comment in the thread you linked, it seems like you could kill the entire [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community by putting a slow acting contact poison on a book labelled "Descriptions of infohazards", and then wait a week for it to be shared to and by everyone.

Thanks to everyone who participated in nominations, and of course, thanks to everyone who participated in the community in the past year. We'll almost certainly be doing this again next year, so make notes about what you find most worthwhile.

** I hope next year there's more people nominating stuff. Be sure to use your "save" options whenever you see a cool post on [[/r/rational]]! I know I had trouble remembering cool stuff, but I still managed to win [[https://i.imgur.com/nHinCPf.png][some]] platinum.

** If you include ?context=10 at the end of a comment URL you get the preceding 10 posts (or other number) in the chain. It helps a lot with readability.
