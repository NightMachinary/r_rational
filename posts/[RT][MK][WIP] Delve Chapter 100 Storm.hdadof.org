*** Ehh, "slow" update speed exaggerates the problem. Once a week is still fast for the raw linguistic quality we get. While it is still relatively slow for purposes of binge reading, rational worldbuilding still requires a lot of justification etc. that massively moderates the pace of story. Overall, it still manages to stay interesting every update, even if it has a high "filler" quotient.

** I feel this new escalation really wasn't needed. Just increase the pacing, no need to shove in combat and pointless action at this point in this arc. It will slow the pacing even further. Rain being underground 3-4 episodes was bad, the dealing with people and managing was satisfactory.

â€‹

This combat now will just slow things down imho. Nothing threatens him there. Just him being a hero and showing off, when him saving the city with his brain and hard work would have been more novel and interesting overhaul.

*** I think this is the important death knell for Fel Sadanis. With monsters spawning beneath your bed and in your closet it really isn't sustainable to have civilian housing anymore, and the Watch even intends to go around demolishing houses to solve this problem, if I read the chapter right. Fel Sadanis won't be /abandoned/, it's still got the all-important teleport pad and barrier stone, but it would be more a military outpost than anything.

What this does to the story is force Rain to move on. He can't stick around in Fel Sadanis anymore because there /is/ no Fel Sadanis anymore, and there's no point returning here if it's just an encampment around the strategic artifacts. It puts Rain on the road with no looking back, ready for the next leg of his journey.

*** I disagree. There's a ton of plot happening here, and I suspect it will drive much of the story from now on.

Rank shift means that monsters will be continually spawning in the city. Do the residents stick around and try to find for their homes or do they become refugees, moving hundreds of miles across a monster-filled winter landscape? Where do they go? If there are monsters spawning in, how many of them are blues? Will new heroes be feeling the area? What about the DKE -- how will this impact their conquest attempts? What about the side characters we've seen -- they've had zero large-scale agency since the barrier went up, since that's not a problem they can affect. Monster hunting and protecting others is something that Kettle, Myth, Reason, etc can do. Plus, maybe some of them end up awakened, which will cause its own changes.

Also, as another poster said, it's been foreshadowed for a very long time and needed to be paid off.

Also also, I get where you're coming from about Rain solving things with his brain, but other readers have been hoping for some action for a long time and this chapter /is/ the pace picking up from their POV.

**** I know but it didn't need to happen now, he could have gotten a breather. More non stop tension on top of already high tension. I understand he's got to pander to the people that are getting bored and to the lowest common denominator that only reads it for the fights but still.

****** Yes but that was a bad training montage. What I wanted was something like: "With the watch back keeping the order, the support of the nobility and commoners, my efforts on the mining to reach the control panel and on the city's cooling progressed swiftly. It's surprising how much progress we were able to make in only 4-7 days..."

That's it, 2-3 lines to improve the pacing and so the story doesn't feel like things are happening back to back non stop. But no Rain can't even get a nights sleep.

******* Exactly. Right now it's gone from "We're stuck in here for a long time, but as long as I can keep it cool we will be fine" to "we're stuck in here for a long time and everything has gone to hell, but as long as I can keep it cool, we will be fine" to "we might be stuck in here forever and all die and everything has gone to hell" and finally "we might be stuck in here forever, we're getting attacked by random monsters and everything in the city had already gone to hell!".

You can only raise the tension so many times before it starts to fail as a literary device.

******** I don't know why, but I don't feel the same way as you. It just seems like things have gone to hell in a relatively plausible way, and the characters are trying to survive the best they can.

It's a black swan event (except not really). They're trying to hold on and prevent everyone from dying, just the same as before. I don't feel annoyed, like the author's raising the stakes and it's not working.

** Holy cow, I tried to read this chapter after a long night of drunk gaming with my friends. It was the most surreal Delve experience I had yet. So many characters. So much action. What even was happening lol. (I reread it the day after and it was way more coherent, but the Val reveal at the end just didn't have the same surprise factor)

Loved the way all sorts of characters had a little slice of the limelight. (Ava was so cute trying to square up to a mushroom man with a dagger [batshit insane though]). But I wouldn't do it too often, it is pretty jarring to follow the narrative when we have to see it through so many lenses.

(Fucking slow clap Val? Really? I'm convinced that his brain is actually just a meme machine for rpg's.)
