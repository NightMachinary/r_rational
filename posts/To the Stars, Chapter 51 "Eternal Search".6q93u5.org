** I want to note that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5sraso/to_the_stars_chapter_49_transition_state/ddhmv3j/][two chapters ago]] I questioned: (1) the rationality of /To The Stars/ and (2) whether it was worth reading at this late stage.

I can now come back and say yes it is rationalist and yes it is worth it. /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ is also good fun (and available on Amazon Anime Strike).

*** Did you end up watching the show after reading the To the Stars, or before? I'm curious what watching the show afterwards was like for you, if that is in fact what you did.

**** I watched /Puella Magi/ before I read /To The Stars/. The Anime was quite good (I only had watched one previous Anime, /Death Note/). I will recommend that anyone who watches /Puella Magi/ watch at least 4 episodes before writing it off, the early episodes are ... well ... set to defy the stereotypes and standard tropes. If you don't like the plot after episode four though, at least you only wasted 2 hours.

/To The Stars/ is an incredible piece of fiction - It has possibly the most dense infodump to plot ratio of anything I've read, while maintaining a heavy interest in the material. I'm quite glad to have found and read it.
