** These are all fantastic, and [[/r/dwarffortress]] says hello in the comments. I /do/ love changelogs...

Other readers may be interested in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/working-as-intended-worm.320007/][/Working as Intended/]] - the /Worm/ fanfic consisting mostly of a shaker-12 issuing patch notes.

Edit: I didn't actually expect a post like [[/r/dwarffortress/comments/578f72]]

*** I really wish "Working as Intended" hadn't stopped updating. =( It was spot-on hilarious.

It is also worth noting there are a few fun little asides hidden in the text in the same color as the background, which I missed on first reading, but caught by accident by highlighting and unhighlighting the text as a nervous tick my second time around.

**** I use a invistext script. Works for both SB and SF, so I love it.

That said, I still highlight unhilight as a tick too. And I really want to lose it but wow is it hard

*** Fixed an issue where demons would sometimes depose monarchs and rule as immortal god-kings. This now occurs much more often than "sometimes".

** Did Francis Fukuyama say/publish anything in the last year to warrant this shout-out? Or is it just an older reference to /The End of History/?

** Can we just use this thread to bash the new Star Wars movie, please?

Rey is a one woman army, to the point where no one else on the team matters. She can fly the ship, repair the ship, use the force, use lightsabers, use a pistol, make sarcastic comment, make persuasive inspiring comments, look cute, outwit mooks, pretty much anything you can think of. Textbook Mary Sue, down to the mysterious abandoned orphan childhood and everything. in contrast, Finn is just treated as the token comic relief black guy because she takes up all the useful skills that exist, such a waste of potential after the awesome tragic first five minutes of the film. Pilot guy is off screen for ninety five percent of the movie, and so does not count as a real character. Was very disappointing to me. It wasn't even bad per se, but the first five minutes were so much better than everything else that I think there must have been some serious editing of the script going on, ruining what could have been an amazing movie based on an amazing premise.

*** It's like a good writer wrote the outline of the story and some key points, and then crappy writers filled in all the details.

**** Things I'm expecting in VIII and IX, and will be disappointed if I don't get:

- More Finn.
- More Kylo Ren.
- Rey's overpoweredness being an actual plot point, with her being the incarnation of some being more powerful than anything seen in the series to this point, rather than just writers trying to make her look more impressive and not thinking about what they're doing.
- Poe being a large number of clones passed off as a single person, one of whom died in the crash.

#+end_quote

Rest is possible, but I seriously doubt they'll do that.
