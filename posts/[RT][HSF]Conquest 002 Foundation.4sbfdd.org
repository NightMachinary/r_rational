** I'm a little confused, so I'm probably missing something obvious, but can someone explain to me why would damaging the Ikon fail? Especially the sentence:

#+begin_quote
  Dig one up and it'll be worthless. They operate in a blockchain, like a distro, so even if you could tamper with one, it would find itself outvoted.
#+end_quote

Thanks!

*** Sounds like the ponders basically act like neurons/beacons in a giant distributed network. Each one has some processing power and an interface, but actual decisions about ikon routing are evaluated and performed by the network in agregate. Thus, tamper with one, and the new instructions it sends won't trigger a viable response in the network. Might be totally wrong about that though.
