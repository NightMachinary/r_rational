Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** In building my own world, I give little nods when I know where ideas came from. Since coming up with names for everything is literally the most difficult thing in the universe, I often slap a borrowed name on such things as well, even when I end up with an idea that is very different from where the inspiration came from. And getting the reference is never anywhere near expected or necessary. But that said, I imagine (If I ever get shit finished) that readers will still go 'oh hey, event/name/location abc seems to be a reference to work xyz, hey maybe there's a twist coming related to abc similar to what happened in xyz'. And usually that's correct, even if the details are different. The seemingly throwaway royal guard who shares a name with the poor guard in The Three Musketeers does indeed go on to be manipulated into assassinating his lord for the woman he loves, and the ancient ruin full of lava that shares a name with a video game location does indeed turn out to have a hidden connection to a source of evil creatures.

But, not everything is meant to be a reference, and there are only so many different names and terms I can think of. So reading /Berserk/ for the first time, as much as I love the manga and will probably end up pilfering a few ideas from it, I learned yesterday that my most noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character shares a title and rare hair colour with a Berserk character who is a noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character. Right up until [[#s][Berserk spoiler]], which doesn't happen in my world. The similarity is complete coincidence, but now I want to leave it in just to troll everyone who picks up on me giving similar meta clues in other cases.

...This is not really a 'problem that needs to be worked through'. I just thought the worldbuilding thread was a reasonable place to mention it. Does anyone else derive joy from the idea of trolling their readers?

**** So like Macbeth? It's more common than you think, but I'm pretty sure it generally falls under tragedy. In the book /Seven Basic Plots/, the author mentions it as sort of a dark version of the rags-to-riches story where everything goes right for the protagonist except they fail that final test where they mature as a person.

*** It's always funny when you bump into coincidences like that. Not too long ago I was writing a rules post for my quest, and I picked a couple of random names for the people in the examples. I showed this to one of my co-GMs to get a go / no-go on whether it should become officially sanctioned. That worthy read through it and said "Why are my parents fighting ninja?" Apparently I picked zirs parents' names out of thin air.

** I have a ritual magic system that needs some inspecting (if not work). Spells consist of:

- Ritual: The things you do.
- Sacrifice: The thing you give up.
- Intent: What you're trying to do.

If you're missing any one of those elements, the spell silently fails. A typical spell can be rigidly described like this:

- This spell cures gout. Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle drawn on the ground, light a black candle nearby, then slit the throat of a chicken no older than 22 weeks. This spell must be done outdoors under a full moon on a cloudless night.

Or:

- This ritual creates a pocket of breathable air that surrounded the practitioner, which lasts for a single hour. Find a man with at least seven living trueborn sons. Mark his incisors with the medium of your choice. Suffocate or drown him. Remove a marked tooth and crush it beneath the heel of your left foot. Both incisors can be used in this way.

Rituals tend to only care whether you've met the minimum. If you light two black candles instead of one, the ritual will still work fine. If the ritual calls for a drop of blood and you supply a gallon, that works fine too. Overdoing it doesn't make the ritual more powerful. Some rituals are dead simple, while some are quite complex. Only one spell per sacrifice, but you can reuse your ritual components. (Spells are arbitrated by spirits, but that's a whole different thing. Assume that cheesing definitions isn't low-hanging fruit and there's no way to ask the spirits what it is they want.)

I /think/ this segregates out into two different classes of wizardly activity. The first are wizards who just use known rituals, and the worldbuilding impact of those is dependent mostly on what the rituals are capable of doing (but there are a lot of rituals, too many to enumerate here).

The second are wizards who are hunting new spells. They would naturally try to cast as wide a net as possible; if you know that rituals often involve lighting a candle, you would light one for trial and error, since there's never a penalty. Because candle color, scent, and wick all matter, you would light lots and lots of candles all at once. Because you know that inscribed and circumscribed shapes matter, you would probably put them all over the place. Because you don't know the threshold of the sacrifice, you would probably overdo it some, spilling lots of blood. They would try to intend as many things as possible while doing the spell.

Once they found a spell that worked, they would dutifully write down all the circumstances, then either work at narrowing down the /actual/ requirements, or just using it as it was done the first time.

Let's consider the amount of effort that has to go into figuring out this one. For a start, it's completely impossible to do it by accident - the intent actually /has to/ be there. (How someone figured out the /first/ ritual is an open question)

#+begin_quote
  Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle
#+end_quote

How many alternatives are there?

- Place the patient /outside/near to/under/over/(north/east/west/south) of/ a /regular polygon with X sides/other well-defined shape/irregular shape/

#+begin_quote
  drawn
#+end_quote

/carved/molded out of (claylike substance)/laid out in (stringlike substance)/imagined/

#+begin_quote
  on the ground
#+end_quote

on /a table/a rock/dirt/tile/concrete/the wall/paper/

#+begin_quote
  light a black candle nearby
#+end_quote

(Vast numbers of different colour object, non-candle objects, and locations could be placed here)

#+begin_quote
  then
#+end_quote

(ah, so order is important? The candle has to some first?)

#+begin_quote
  slit the throat
#+end_quote

(body parts other than the throat? Destruction by other means, e.g. fire?)

#+begin_quote
  of a chicken
#+end_quote

(other animals?)

#+begin_quote
  no older than 22 weeks
#+end_quote

(older/younger is another bit of uncertainty, and the 22-week figure is probably a good six or seven more bits)

#+begin_quote
  outdoors full moon cloudless night
#+end_quote

Okay. So, then, considering those requirements: an early guess as to a useful spell will involve putting a suffering patient on the specially prepared Testing Floor (consisting of dozens of shapes, all over the place, in a variety of mediums, colours, and shapes) The testers will then carefully light all of close on a hundred candles, then carefully extinguish them all, then activate a great variety of other things (honking horns, juggling, blowing whistles, etc.) - a process which may take a few hours.

Then the sacrifice. A small animal is destroyed in virtually every way; cut through every major organ, stabbed, beheaded, set alight and burned to ash.

/Then/, just in case the secondary action needs to take place /after/ the sacrifice, all the candles are re-lit (and re-extinguished), the horns are re-honked, whistles are re-blown, and so on. (And then all of this will still fail if it is done indoors, or if the Moon is wrong). In the ritual in question, there are a few elements; the age of the chicken, the inside/outside question, the cloudless sky, and the full moon - that are hard to try more than one of at once. (Apparently a chicken can, in theory, live up to about a dozen years, though it's rare. So, let's assume the median chicken, not slaughtered for meat, lives up to six years; and only for 22 weeks is it suitable, which would be about 7% of the chicken's life - let's say about four bits of uncertainty. Then the sky - let's assign two bits for different levels of cloudiness. The Moon - full, waning gibbous, half, waning crescent, new, waxing crescent, half, waxing gibbous - that's eight clear states, so another three bits. Indoors/outdoors is one bit. So, ten bits of uncertainty at least; even with the procedure described above, the odds of finding the spell are no better than one in a /thousand/. And that's before considering whether it /has/ to be a chicken.)

And you never, ever, find a ritual that doesn't do exactly what you intended it would do.

--------------

What I'm getting at is that, for the second class of wizard - the new-spell-hunters - finding a single new spell can be expected to be the culmination of /years/ of trying anything and everything (and cost hundreds of chickens, puppies, kittens, and so forth along the way). Now, it might be that there are actually hundreds of spells that cure gout - and it's merely a matter of coincidence which one a researcher runs across first - but, be that as it may, the knowledge of a spell (especially one that's been properly pared down to its base components) is going to be an /incredibly/ valuable piece of information. Most research wizards would have good reason to be wary of spell thieves (they'd probably keep their notes in code, at the very minimum) and a new spell - especially a new /useful/ spell - could probably be sold for quite a bit (though a cunning wizard might rather opt to sell his spellcasting /services/, casting the spell for a fee, secure in the knowledge that no-one else will be able to figure it out for several years - perhaps even using sleight-of-hand to hide a few crucial parts of the spell if he suspects he's being observed. Imagine being the only person who knows how to cure gout...)

*** Is there any pattern as to what kind of effect you get based on the spell? If so, you could at least choose which general area of magic you wanted to research new spells in.

Also, how exact does the Intent need to be? Can you just slap "For enemies" on there, or do you need to repeat spell research over and over again with slight variations in guesses as to which kind of zombie your dread ritual might raise?

**** I've been struggling with how intent actually works. You can't just have a generic "do stuff" that satisfies any result, but you don't need to be extremely specific. How about ... you don't need to specify magnitude, duration, direction, or range, if any apply. But you do need to get fairly close to the actual effect; if the spell cures the causes and symptoms of gout, then "cure gout" works, or "cure the ailment that's causing joint pain", but simply "cure any ailments" would be too broad.

(If someone has a formalization for this, I would appreciate it, but there's an arbitrating authority in the form of spirits, so it's not entirely necessary.)

The system also, /should/ work such that you can chain multiple effects together, so long as one of them is the correct one. In other words "cure gout, cure chlamydia, cure bone cancer" would work even if the spell only cures gout. The practitioner is then limited by how many things they can intend to do at once.

In a world like that, I would not expect to see any spells at all that require human sacrifice (Unless there are unearthly beings that occasionally dole out knowledge of new spells). Is spell 'power'/usefulness at all correlated with the preciousness of the sacrifice? If not I'd just focus all research on the cheapest possible things that can be sacrificed.

Are there limits on how small the smallest spell can be? If I was a mage I would be interested in researching the effects of smaller and smaller rituals and seeing if I could get a combinations of small rituals into a large effect. Or could I sacrifice the results of one ritual to feed another?

**** The smallest spell I currently have in the book requires the user to draw a circle with a drop of blood, which gives a preternatural sense of where people are for a few minutes. Generally speaking, strength of the spell correlates to power, with the weakest possible sacrifice being something like a pinch of salt or a strand of hair.

I think there's probably no way around going through and compiling a list of spells that appear in the book, but that doesn't seem terribly fun.

*** Is there any way of discovering / creating new spells other than by guesswork? I thought Unsong covered that pretty well, with its sweatshops of workers reading out candidate spells to find the one-in-a-billion that works.

Is it possible to cast several spells at once - for example, if you have a spell whose sacrifice component is "spill a drop of blood", and you spill a thousand drops of blood, could you use that to cast the spell a thousand times over? If you manage to satisfy the requirements for two distinct spells at once (bearing in mind that each sacrifice can only fuel one spell), could you cast them simultaneously? Could there be a ritual that everyone thinks is a single spell but is actually casting three or four spells whose requirements overlap?

That's 55K words down the drain ... here the guesswork isn't very much part of the plot, since this type of magic is illegal and most individual practitioners don't have the resources to test permutations over and over, even if they can narrow their parameters down.

But yes, it's very possible for practitioners to be confused about what their spell(s) are actually doing, and some spells can multicast in a way that makes it seem like it's a single spell that depends on quantity.

** If you haven't noticed I'm using this thread to continue my thoughts about my stories. I don't know if I'll ever put the pen to the paper, so if any of my posts inspire a short story or anything, please let me know.

I've thought a lot about last week's weekly building thread, especially the 'wishing hour' thought, and I've decided utter chaos would erupt which may or may not cause the destruction of life as we know it in an [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-234197][XK-class Reality-Ending scenario]].

Now, I'm not a big fan of stuff like that, so I've thought about this. A period of time where items become enchantable with magic power. Any physical object during this 'wishing hour' can gain some magical property based on a persons wish. For example, a kid wearing a super man out fit wishes he could become super man. Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman. Same with practically any person who wishes that during wishing hour

This enchanting needs the following rules to be met in order for the enchanting to work:

1) A moderately direct and specific wish. "I wish I was good looking" wouldn't work, non-specific.

2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.

3) Specific wishes can be spoken or unspoken. Less specific wishes must be spoken.

4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)

5) The wish cannot affect free will directly. Perhaps a person could wish that everyone would understand the beauties inherent in Marxism, and a nearby paper becomes enchanted with memetic qualities, which transfer Marxism and the desire for everyone to understand it, but that doesn't make the person want Marxism or begin to advocate the people rising up and taking control of the means of production. At the least, if everyone were infected by that enchanted piece of paper, they would end up more knowledgeable.

Thoughts about these rules? Too easy to break? Too rigid? Not clear?

*** So I read your post from last world building Wednesday, and I really liked the response that mentioned you should start from clear cut limits instead of trying to cover all the loopholes of unlimited wishes.

These rules are a good start, but I think I already see some loopholes and possible additional things to cover, if you want to avoid a CK class event in story that is.

#+begin_quote
  2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.
#+end_quote

I don't think that will help much against the smartest people that figure out the process earliest in the hour. A bunch of separate items with direct and specific, but general usage and flexible wishes would still be really OP. Maybe to balance this, people are limited in how many wish items they can use at once? (Unless you are going for a CK class scenario). Otherwise, someone wishes for a bunch of interacting intelligence enhancements, which would give them the thought power to get even more efficient intelligence enhancing wishes until they reach whatever limit their is/go insane/ thinker headaches like in worm. They then use their intelligence to ask really effective wishes and basically dominate the setting afterwards.

#+begin_quote
  4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)
#+end_quote

Whoever made wishes related to stealing/taking things and/or finding magic items becomes a God. They use their initial item stealing enchanted objects to steal more wish items, which makes them more powerful/intelligent, which they can then in turn use to steal more. This also ties into the need to limit how many items a person can use at once. Maybe have the enchanted items be weaker for other people besides the wisher? Or have the fate/luck/other phenomena tend to redirect them back to the original wisher unless freely given or something like that. Otherwise you will have runaway power grabs going on.

#+begin_quote
  The wish cannot affect free will directly.
#+end_quote

Does this include the wisher themselves? Might be a way to nerf intelligence items and other mind boosting runaway sequences. Their attempts to boost their intelligence are stopped because anything more than moderate intelligence boosts or very specific abilities would otherwise alter their personality.

#+begin_quote
  Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman.
#+end_quote

If wishes can grant up to that power level, they are going to be majorly OP. People who wished for multi-function power sets would basically be gods... To nerf... maybe the kid just gets generic flying brick powers that are much more limited? (Unless XK/CK reality ending scenario is the intended plotline)

Other limits you should consider:

- How does the hour affect things globally? If it is the same hour all at once across the world, people in some regions are going to be sleeping and this will upset the balance of power majorly (and you are trying to avoid world ending scenarios?). How about for each person the hour starts whenever noon is for them... hmm but then later time zones would have the advantage of the earlier time zones experience, skewing things as well. What if it is the same hour globally, and people mysteriously woke up at the start of the hour? Might tip some people off... Maybe magic stops the spread of information initially? Or the items are weaker until the hours has finished. Or the hours occur randomly different for each person within a 12 hour period, so not enough time for the information to spread. Or let the chips fall where they may and write about the global consequences.

- Can enchanted objects make more magic. Like if someone wished for an item that can empower other items would that work? Or if they wished for more generic magic power... lets say Harry Potter style wizard powers into a wand, could they use that wand to breed magical creatures and plants, then use the parts from those creatures and plants to make another wand. I do have an idea for balance and a way for this to tie into an overarching scientific investigation plotline... The magic is limited in conceptual priority by extent that is had been replicated from the original item. So in my HP wand example its possible to make more wands, but they will always, no matter what, be weaker than the original wand. If they are matched against an "original" enchanted item (i.e. not derived from another item, from the original wishing hour itself) the original item will always beat the derived item, unless conceptual/elemental rock paper scissors heavily favors the derived item. For example, the superman cape kid can resist all of the knock-off wands, even if someone tried casting an AK on him, however a spell to transfigure kryptonite would weaken him, even if done with a knockoff wand. Also, for further balance and/or to limit munchkin, deriving items weakens the original to some extent.

- Overall, it could be an issue if magic is getting stronger and stronger from items interacting with each other and bootstrapping into stronger magical effects/items. i.e. imagine a Dresdenverse wizard interacting with derived items created with Harry-Potter magic, which in turn are utilized by someone who had Nasu-verse mage style powers. Eventually you would get runaway reality warping that dominates the rest of reality. Conversely, if there was no way to derive more magic, and the enchanted items didn't get any durability or such, then there would be the underlying worry that they would stop working or otherwise fail. What happens when the last healing item breaks after hospitals and doctors and pharmaceutical companies have come to rely on them? You could create a balance where attempting to break an item just causes its magic to spread out further and strengthen other items. So the Harry Potter wand becomes able to do more spells as other items are broken and their enchantment passes on. In between this and the derived item limit, this could create a long-term balance in the level of magical power in the world. Older items that are protected and conserved slowly gain in power as other items are broken or used to derive more but weaker items, until those preserved items are eventually brought into use or broken themselves.

- Figuring out all the limits of magic and the rules could be a long-term plot point, or a background detail exploited in clever ways, depending on if you set your story during or well after the wishing hour.

- Going off the Harry Potter wand example and the superman example, for another possible nerf, wishing to be a wizard/witch/mage/super hero doesn't grant you their full power set, it just grants you the most prominent abilities/powers as you think of the wish. So the wand could maybe do patronous, expliarmous and stupefy and a few transfigurations, but not use the more obscure abilites, like the enchanting used to create items/breed magical creatures that was done off-screen. The superman cape gets flight and durability, but not the freeze breath or the laser vision unless the kid was specifically thinking about them in association with superman also (and maybe the flight and durability are weaker as a result of splitting the wish into so many functions). This would also limit runaway interaction of magic items.

- I think enchanted items need some kind of limit on implied information processing, otherwise you get strong AI in an item, or just a few combination of items. Even just someone wishing for an item that would give them answers about wishes would be really OP. (Then you could ask the item for some reality-breaking combination of items to wish for.) Maybe the implied free will limits prediction/precog items to large scale extrapolation of human behavior and strictly natural phenomena. (Predict a hurricane precisely, but only get a general probability for a terrorist attack)

Let me know what you think. I can elaborate on any of these ideas if they sound good are useful to you. Also, it might help if you have plot/characters, and you go back and solidify the rules after thinking about the direction for them. Hmm... I've got a few snippets in mind about the first people trying to test/exploit their magic items, nothing too long though.

Intelligence doesn't work... what about piping knowledge into ones mind? Is all mind interaction banned? If so, that is a pretty solid limit.

Even with these limits, wishing for powerful and diverse divination items could still be game breaking though. You can't wish the knowledge into your head directly, but you could for example wish that a piece of paper shows the appropriate mathematical equation to any problem that you concentrate on, then wish that a calculator can solve any equation/mathematical problem that you can think of while holding it. In between these two things, you could dominate the stock market (save for other powerful wishes), and in general address any problem approachable by mathematics. Stack on several other divination items and you are like a Thinker 8 in worm (instantly blackmail people, find out bank passwords, manipulate others with ease, set up plots, etc.)

It may have a memetic/magical property that inspires people to share it with others, but they would still be able to choose whether or not they want to. If someone wanted to get better at math and they had some sheets of paper in front of them when they wished it, then the papers would turn into a form which would help them in the most effective way.

There is a hard limit to where there is nothing which directly affects someone's mind... Enchanted objects can't insert knowledge directly, but they can help people understand if they read the document or use the object.

You have a good point about the stacking objects, so I'm thinking of making a limit of one active object per person at a time. Like if a person is under the effects of the Super man costume, they can't use the Harry Potter wand they wished up until they take off the Super Man costume.

It sounds like wishes that relate to other wishes in general need to not work to stop runaway loops and exploits. To top your example, instead of wishing for a new language, the person could wish for an item that tells them the ideal wishes to make for their preferences/values. They then make all of those wishes. Maybe the item would suggest your strategy also to get around the word limit.

Maybe the word limit should actually be a conceptual limit on how much a person can concentrate on at once. For most people, this is around 30 words worth of wish, longer or shorts depending on their efficiency at conceptualization and their memory. Thus the redefine "blorg" in Wishtralian strategy wouldn't work because the person couldn't concentrate on 50 pages worth of English at once. If the person already has an imagined language with some highly compact concepts they were used to thinking in and wanted to wish with, this might be a small advantage over their native language.

I can recall thinking of some very specific revenge fantasies after being bullied in middle school. Even only allowing the most specific wishes to manifest as lethal enchanted items, this is still going to be a pretty dangerous number of revenge fantasies ready to carry out. Also, I think a dangerous fraction (not a high percentage, but dangerous in total number) of teenage wishes are going to be kind of rapey even if they can't directly violate free will.

The magic would still grant a specific lethal object. It would be up to the person wishing to make that revenge real)*

The other thing is that may have to be a hole I have to leave open. The magic system isn't going to be bound by any moral code, so it'll be up to the people to be bound morally.

I guess it depends for how many revenge fantasies are purely fantasies. I guess you could use this for an author tract... if you have a grim view of humanity, then just getting lethal items is enough to motivate people to get violent and you are looking at a lot of bloodbaths. If you have a more optimistic view... even then, 1/10,000, 1/100,000, 1 in a million, either way there are going to be a few Columbine level events. And given the way the media reacts they are going to be emphasized just as much if not more than all the people with healing items volunteering at hospitals.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States]]

Imagine these kind of events, all of them that might have happened in a year, happening all at once because they would-be killers now have the means to do it. Now imagine if all of them have powerful items that put them at a level where they can get 10-30 people instead of 0-2, with the occasional lucky power getting over 100-1000. Now imagine the media reaction which would emphasize the most sensationalist aspects.

Your best bet for avoiding this in story is if a lot of would be superheros are out trying to superhero in the first couple of weeks after the wishing hour. Even then, its going to take sensory powers (does this violate the no mind interference rule), pre-cog powers, or rapid emergency communication powers to get the heros to the right place at the right time.

And that gives me a superhero snippet idea. A comic fan, who really obsessively knows super man well (and thus because of their clear concept of "superman" has a proportionately powerful and multi-functional power set with all of superman's abilities at a decent level, i.e. super hearing, super sight, laser vision, freeze breath, super speed, etc.) goes out to superhero. They get contacted by someone with an item that contacts the right person for the job. This person has teamed up with someone with an item for sensing tragedies. The superman spends the first week stopping all kinds of disaster... school shootings, empowered terrorists launching attacks. It could be a deconstruction of the kind of psychological trauma that such a superman would experience as they fly around nearly nonstop just trying stop the worst events. You could also push a moral about the balance of good and evil in humanity. For every bullied teenager or just laid off employee or terrorist ready to cut lose, there are 10 people who are willing to be a hero....

Another story snippet idea. A teenage who has a powerful item from a revenge fantasy, decides instead to be the better person and be a superhero. Interesting twists... they have to stop someone who originally wished for benevolent items but then changed their mind and uses them for crime after the end of the wishing hour.

******** You have really good story ideas and aspects of humanity we could explore. I imagine that this 'superman' would be absolutely willing to do his thing and save people, but grow weary of the effects of what transpires, especially if it's a worldwide phenomena. There's a decent anime called Charlotte that explores this, iirc it's on Crunchyroll if you were interested in checking it out. Sadly they only got to make 24 episodes so the exploration of the human condition is extremely condensed.

I've basically got the rules down for this 'wishing hour', and a decent way of preventing the death of all life on earth as we know it. If someone figured out wishing hour, and were perceptive enough, they might wish for an item which could prevent catastrophic events, or give them immunity from the effects of all other's magical items. One thing I could explore as well is discovery time. There's potential someone wishes something evil, but doesn't realize what their now-enchanted item does until long after the intense emotion has passed.

As far as the magic power goes, time of day/day of week/season of year for a 'wishing hour' makes a massive difference in the kinds of things people wish for, for example - those in extreme distress would most likely be the ones wishing for revenge, while those who had it light wouldn't have as big of an incentive to go on a murder spree.

If it's akin to a Lunar eclipse where only those under its shadows could make a wish, there could be swaths of people with powers, and a majority of people without it. If it were attached to cosmological coincidences like that, the effects of the 'wishing hour' would be dramatically focused on certain areas, causing massive imbalance. I'm still working on if I want a blanket "everyone can make a wish" or if I want it attached to some predictable event. You could have people working to predict when it would return, and based on how confident they are on the predictions if it ever returns (albeit to a different location on the planet) and if the effects of the first were dramatic enough, there could even be interventions from nations and perhaps attempts from governments to secure the regions where the wishing hour would affect.

Edit: I'm mostly interested in group dynamics and which demographics would have the most enchanted items.

Most magical items require the expertise to wield actual weapons plus the magical competence to use those weapons without exhausting yourself. Celestial keys are limited by their rarity, and the fact that they require a contract.

I'm fairly certain that it's some kind of attribute point deficiency that forces people to go into one field of magic. Like, there's a specialty they're restricted to or something - Erza is explicitly shown to be competent in many kinds of magic, but that's because she collects an impressive amount of magical weapons and armor. Her actual specialty is Telekinesis.

I don't know, really. The magic is just whatever the author saw fit to include, and any trend I enforce will lose something. That being said, there's a lot of things I think would be really cool if the characters were just a /bit/ smarter.

I highly recommend the series as entertaining, but if you are a picky reader I suggest you start at book 3 or 4. The author never got anything published before Dresden Files, and the first two books are way less well written and edited than the rest. Book 3 focuses on vampires, and book 4 on faeries. Normal people can see the supernatural just fine, they just don't get exposed to it, and when they do it's usually because something eats them. Supernatural nations don't want the mortals to know about them, because humans are major assholes, and if you somehow convinced a nuclear power that Fairyland existed, they might get Clever Ideas.

***** As I said, they are not too plentiful, and I do enjoy the series and have read everything at least twice. Most of it more than that. Still, there were a few more. Spoilers for you nolrai, obviously.

In the second book, Murphy does not listen to one thing Harry says. Sure, she's feeling hurt and betrayed because he lied about one thing, and he's a suspect. But she hired him in the first place because she knew something really scary was going down, and yet she doesn't even let him explain or warn her about anything. Normally when you have a suspect you /want/ to let them talk, especially when there's a serial killer out there who may or may not be them.

Speaking of Murphy, in the later books, when she's been told about and accepted the reality of magic and the different factions... She knows about the swords. She knows that they are extremely major ancient artefacts with lots of extra pesky rules attached. And she just decides that she's the one to hold on to them. Against the advice and will of Harry /and/ the church. For /years/. Aaaand it's broken. And it's only the power of plot that saves her from the consequences of that.

Speaking of the last book, there were two more in that one. The Archangel risks what seems to be roughly 33% of the military might of heaven to make sure this one specific mortal can take part in a bank heist. Either he has perfect foreknowledge and there is no free will (Which, yes, is a concept that doesn't make sense, but this guy is supposed to be Christian, where Free Will is a big thing), or he gambles with eternity over a small collection of no doubt very useful weapons. Still, that was a xanathos gambit if ever I've seen one.

Also in the last book: Nicodemus is 2000 years old. I know he's super evil and all that, but how can be such a successful villain if he's this extremely stupid and short sighted? He's got the Word of Queen Mab that Harry will not betray first, and that he will help as well as he can. Harry isn't even expecting payment (Beyond a little money Nicodemus can easily afford). And still he betrays. And before that, he doesn't even order Harry to help him get the thing he wants, but some other thing in the same room, leaving Harry wiggle room to steal the thing he /really/ wants. No matter how cartoonishly evil you are, when you are dealing with a supernatural creature that *always* keeps her promises, just tell her what it is you want to steal. That's so infuriatingly obvious.

I'm still excited for the rest of the series, but the last book was definitely one of my least favourite ones, just because there were too many stupid decisions made only because the plot demanded it.

- Guns can be hauled from Isengard to Esgaroth in ~30 days.
- Isengard has magically-enhanced R&D divisions, sufficient to develop new weapons (assuming compatibility with existing early Industrial Age technologies) within 3 days.
- Isengard only has smoke-producing gunpowder. Smokeless powder hasn't been developed yet, mostly because of formulation issues.
- Gandalf, Radagast, and Saruman are cooperating. Glorfindiel is off doing his own thing. Galadriel is diminished after the banishment of Sauron, and is recuperating. Elrond is off doing his own thing.
- The Army of the Hand is a mix of created Uruk-hai and hired Men, Orcs, Goblins and Dwarves. Elves can't be bothered.
- The standard soldier in the Army of the Hand has a 11mm breechloading rifle, a full equip of 100 rounds, a triangular bayonet, a utility knife, light armor, and a warg.
- Saruman's crows are intelligent enough to carry messages on their own, but Saruman can possess the crows for telepresence work.

Here's the fixed timeline:

- October 1: Dol Guldur falls
- October 11: One company of Uruk-hai arrive in Lake Town, to warn the town of the approaching army of Sauron and to fortify it
- October 12: Saruman informed of the "Defeat the dragon" mission requirement
- October 25: Smaug attacks
- October 26: 2 companies reinforcements from Isengard arrive, having been dispatched on October 10
- October 29: 1 company reinforcements from Isengard arrive, dispatched October 13, carrying Isengard-produced physical copies of Bard's Black Arrow. They are not magically dwarf-forged, and so cannot pierce Smaug's hide.

*** If I know that I only have one arrow that can pierce Smaug's hide, I'd focus on ways to kill him without piercing the hide. Concussive force from enough cannonballs? Trick him into swallowing a bomb or something? And any regular troops without better targets would be instructed to aim for the eyes.
