** This story is rapidly becoming my favorite currently updating web serial. I found myself grinning from ear to ear multiple times, especially once I realized that we have The Culture here to start uplifting things.

â€‹

Now if only we can get some Pratchett in here to lighten things up it'll be perfect. <3

*** Yeah, same. I had the biggest grin when the culture ship was introduced. These certainly are "special circumstances". Also happy that they might be getting back together soon.

I was wondering if the spell mindblank will make you immune to the concept, but it looks like Pathfinder nerfed that spell. No more immunity to mind affecting effects, just a huge bonus to resist.

However, the best wandable spell to cure people is "sequester thoughts" assuming the concept is a single topic. It might actually be the best spell for it, wandable or not. As your only other options are "wish", "modify memory", "damnation of memory" (has limitations that may cause issues), "hidden knowledge" (probably won't work), or just drink an "elixir of amnesia".

*** Yeah, same - if I didn't know better, I'd suspect this was secretly AlexanderWales aka cthulhuraejepsen, or secretly Yudkowsky (I don't think it actually is, as the former is writing WtC pretty quickly and the latter is always leaving kudos on this work)

** Did anyone else notice that a Mind's avatar was stunned into silence for MILLISECONDS of real time? =D =D

** Is this worth coming back to? I read the first chapter and it seemed sorta silly and confusing.

*** I think it's worth reading the first 4 or so chapters to really get a feel for it. The first 2 chapters are just intro.

*** I found the beginning of the story to be a bit of a rough start. The original description blurb and the first two chapters, don't do a great job of selling the story. It picks up pretty good from there.

** Can anyone give me a non-spoilery summary of whatever work the Culture comes from? I may eventually read it so I don't want to know i.e. key plot elements, but I'd like to understand the impact it has on the story.

*** The Culture series are books by Ian M Banks that take place in the same universe but are mostly independent of each other. Some of this might sound spoilery but it's all just background for the books.

Some books take place completely outside the Culture but feature 1 Culture citizen.

Basic setting is that the Culture are a post-scarcity "space-socialist" society at the top of the technological chain possible in the material universe. Most books are how they deal with other peoples that they disagree with without simply curb stopping them into submission.

The only way for them to get more powerful would be to Sublime into a higher plane of existence which they don't do mostly because they see themselves as necessary for peace in the galaxy.

So the infomorphs finding this Ship means they're basically getting a near God tier uplift.

I highly recommend you start with Player of Games.

*** The other summary is pretty accurate- I will add my personal recommendations though:

Best for relevance to the current storyline: /Excession/

Best overall: /Use of Weapons/
