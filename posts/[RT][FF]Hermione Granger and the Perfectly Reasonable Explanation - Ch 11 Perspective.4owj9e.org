** I thought the bit about "conditionally obscured" laws was brilliant. Its a great little titbit of world building that sent my imagination running and stuff like that is part of what makes reading fun.

*** I had to think about this one for a while to come up with something that seemed to make sense while respecting canon. Of course, the canon Ministry is awful enough that they might well have just had entirely secret laws, that are only revealed to you if you break one, or if someone decides you genuinely need to know (because they're loaning a time machine to a thirteen-year-old, for instance).

*** Maybe Hermione should try to find out what all the types of magic are?

**** I would be an interesting and instructive project to count the number of physical pages of laws and compare that with the number you can account for actually having meaning and purpose, to at least get a sense of scope.

***** It's a good notion in principle. Though in practice, the government of magical Britain being what it is, I suspect the signal-to-noise ratio even measured only over /genuine/ laws is depressingly low, so it'd be hard to reliably distinguish Obscured sections from actual legislative inefficiency and/or nonsense.

Of course, there might well also be a law prohibiting attempts to defeat Conditional Obscuration that only pops up once you learn about Conditional Obscuration... ;)

*** Thanks!

I've been finding it helpful for me to post the chapter links myself, that way I get comments in my inbox and email-forwarded. I'm only doing it in [[/r/rational]] for the moment, though I try to keep an eye on threads that pop up elsewhere.

** Finally working my way through this one and while this is many chapter off Tonks introducing herself as (my interpretation) as Mary Sue Bottomwate I.E. Mary Sue Diahriah was a flat *what* that topped my best laugh this month with McGonigal's "Expiditiously"

** Nott /so/ told all the Slytherins and that's why they're looking at her funny. Calling it now!

*** Hm. Maybe, but I wouldn't think so. Passing out the secret to everyone might score you a quick point or two with the group but removes your ability to potentially personally benefit from it to a greater degree.

*** Slytherins were also looking at her with interest after she refused to share her secret to Transfiguration success with her fellow Ravenclaws. /They/ don't know that she's sorted the matter out with her own House.
