** Remember reading it a while back. Decent, but I felt like it gave Harry too much power with the whole "no wands" trick. Didn't really buy it that a 14 year old can take down experienced Death Eaters.

Enjoyable, but not rational.

So -- abuse provides super powers? Kind of like being an orphan. Harry with the proportional strength and speed of an orphan and the proportional magic boost of abuse.

  Shuddering with pent up emotion, Harry grit his teeth as new tears threatened to stream forth, and choked them down with a fierce, hot anger. Lurching to his feet, Harry wobbled dangerously for a moment, before snarling, a strange and chilling expression on his little six-year-old face, and stalking towards the school building with a purpose.

The purple is palpable.

  I will never cry again. He silently promised himself.
#+end_quote

No. "Strange and chilling." "Never cry again." "Silent promise." I mean, maybe he can think it. But that's just not happening.

*** Yeah, the first was enjoyable in a non rational way. The second was pure garbage, but it did have an interesting idea about magic.

***** IIRC, it was crossed over with the main Command and Conquer series of computer games. 'Tiberium' being the 'used for everything' resource in that game.

I vaguely recall thinking that it sounded like he was trying to setup for a third fic with the Scrin invading Earth...

*** Thanks for warning me. I thought the first was enjoyable, but flawed. Obviously Harry is extremely ridiculously unbelievably overpowered - but that can be fun in a mindless sort of way. Will gladly skip over the sequel if it is worse in any way though.

I didn't read many of the author's notes, but the one I read where he talked about how much better his writing was made me cringe pretty hard, almost stopped reading right there.

** Wow. It gets a LOT worse. And the author is about as smug as I can imagine in their author's notes, particularly re: being self-satisfied about how much better their writing is than everyone else's.

*** Yeah, but I thought it was interesting how the author put a lot of effort into making the harry behave like a person who was abused like that actually would.

** On the first chapter so far. Writing is fairly clunky, but the sort of ... beautiful truth? ... behind it shines through. Enjoying this a lot, thanks.

** It's a shame the author can't write credible adults. I enjoyed the fic in the early chapters where Harry hogs the spotlight while being asocial. But then McGonagall crushes a wineglass in anger at a faculty meeting, Dumbledore is casually cruel, McGonagall explains Harry's life story in public without his consent, everything about Petunia, etc. etc. I see what the author is going for, and it could work. But they don't have the skill to do more than cartoonish stereotypes.
