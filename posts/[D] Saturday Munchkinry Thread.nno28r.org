Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a small block, about ten centimetres across, which can produce a force from nothing. The anomalous force acts on the block and causes it to move. This violates conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The amount of force it produces can be controlled by some simple automatable mechanism. There's no upper limit on how much force it can produce, but for practical purposes if you request too much force it will just break whatever you connect it to. The block itself is indestructible, but easily lost if you accidentally bounce it off into space.

The main limitation is that there is only one, and will only ever be one.

It can be used to generate power of course, but doing the obvious thing of connecting it directly to a turbine shaft won't get you all that much more than a conventional nuclear power plant. Good but not amazing.

It can be used in spaceflight, but at very high risk of losing it forever.

What's the best application for this thing?

*** Lift /very large/ masses very slowly into low orbit. A slow trip to low orbit with it in the center of a huge and hard to lose structure is unlikely to lose it like other space travel would, and if you can get heavy stuff into orbit like that using conventional methods to go anywhere else is fairly easy. For anything further away it's only worth it once the mass you're moving is to large to move any other way, and even using it on an extremely low acceleration is worth it. Probably, it's main use would be terraforming, especially very slowly altering orbits of things that you cant use conventional rockets on /because the reaction mass is pulled back to them by gravity/.

If you do want to generate power, rather than use it directly to spin something, pushing it /through/ something like a planet or iron star to create heat repeatedly, then using geothermal power form that heat, is probably more efficient in the long term.

Hey, it can generate arbitrary amount of force. If all you care about is Venus spinning, you can just plow it through the crust at close to the speed of light, going around and around the planet, liquefying it as you go. The more resistance, the more force you're imparting, so try and target the parts that are still solid.

****** It's the "going around for another pass" part that is difficult here. Any additional machinery you attach to the block isn't going to survive plowing through a planet at near light speed, so you'd lose control of it. You could make repeated impacts at speed high enough to leave the block buried, I guess, and dig it up again for each repeat, or let it pass right though with only a tiny fraction of its energy still remaining so that it's still recoverable.

There's nothing stopping you from turning the block around however you choose to do so, but it won't do it by itself.

Let's say that the interface for controlling the block is by applying a small voltage across part of it. You can glue a simple circuit with an antenna to the block to make a remote control if you like, but your interface device won't share the block's indestructible nature and can get crushed by impacts or by acceleration.

** What are the usual ways to munchkin matter creation/manipulation magic? I'm trying to do a reconstruction of the Schools of Magic trope by making them more predictable so I can commission some art to post on [[/r/magicbuilding][r/magicbuilding]].

Let's say mana is some kind of non-relativistic aether that is always measured to be at rest in vacuum, but is otherwise repelled by matter unless converted into more stable forms.

Give it three laws:

1) *Mana cost is super-exponential in information density*. So e.g., cells are completely out of the equation, but perfectly arranged carbon nanotubes are fair game, paper/leather/resin all stop mana much better than metals do, no use trying to make computers more powerful than, say, finite-state machines, etc.

The meaning of information density here is roughly in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, let's assume all kinds of matter can be described by at most 1 MB of text. Then, we can rank the mana cost of creating various kinds of matter by how easy it would be to compress such a description.

2) *Mana cost is cubic in momentum-energy*, and *time to cast is linear with mana cost*. A building made of simple, inorganic compounds takes months to build. But manifesting 1 mole of carbon-12 takes one second. Furthermore, if you try to instantiate some complex object without the requisite mana cost, nothing will happen except wasting your mana (thus, build incrementally!)

3) *Magic is atemporal*. That is, by 'magic' we mean transporting ourselves to a parallel universe where its effects have always existed. So throwing a fireball means teleporting into a universe where the only difference is that there's some hydrogen-oxygen mixture that's currently burning in front of you, rewriting everything else so that this is physically plausible.

Let's peg the specialised forms of mana into twelve different schools (codenamed with zodiac signs for now):

1.  *Aries*: the ability to convert mana into matter

2.  *Taurus*: the ability to "see" causal connections between pieces of matter; so less fortune-telling and more animal tracking

3.  *Gemini*: the ability to apply magic to mana itself; e.g., Gemini can use Taurus to predict how a given volume of mana will be used

4.  *Cancer*: the ability to create non-quantum light, i.e., everything that proceeds from Maxwell's equations, so for example, you can use the ultraviolet catastrophe to make light bombs

5.  *Leo*: the ability to define finite-state machines on matter; e.g., implement Maxwell's demon

6.  *Virgo*: the ability to wear mana as a metaphysical 'mecha suit' to enhance bodily abilities, e.g., speed, endurance, strength; somewhat similar to Glory Girl's force-field

7.  *Libra*: the ability to create ectoplasm that LARPs matter; think simulacra in MoL which do not have internal structure but otherwise act as if they do; this is also subject to Law #1 so making anything with a brain is prohibitively expensive

8.  *Scorpio*: the ability to transmute one kind of matter into another, following equivalent exchange-like rules

9.  *Sagittarius*: the ability to add deltas to a piece of matter's position and its derivatives

10. *Capricorn*: the ability to change the mechanical properties of matter. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties#Mechanical_properties][this list]].

11. *Aquarius*: the ability to 'restore' matter to a previous set point

12. *Pisces*: the abiliity to 'stop' or 'end' things; e.g., turn a volume of space to absolute zero

As it stands, there's a lot of ways to munchkin these abilities already. So some of the limitations I decided to move over to worldbuilding, such as:

- Each mage can only convert raw mana into one of the twelve types. Also, to affect matter you need to keep it in contact with the corresponding mana form so that mana shaping becomes an extremely important fundamental skill for mages.

- Mages have paltry mana regeneration capabilities. Most mana is thus sourced from SCP-like entities which only carry specific forms, and as such /mana is dangerous to obtain and is really hard to come by/.

- Magical tradition is young. Only 1 in 100 000 people are born with the potential to learn magic (though it can be taught given enough exposure), and so it took until the 1800s for there to be enough people to start a proper magical tradition. Since Law #3 means all magic is locally reality-warping, it's really hard to do science on it so there are various competing and mutually contradictory theories still.

- Corollary of the previous bullet point: Want to do some megaproject? Tough luck: there are only ~77 000 mages in the world and normal people forget magic as soon as they look away from it.

- There's an anti-munchkin league of powerful mages who are very much inclined to end your life if you become too powerful, and they employ the largest collection of Taurus mages. So secrecy and subterfuge is paramount if you want to end the world.

--------------

Some possible munchkinries that I may or may not want to curtail:

- recursive self-improvement
- simulacra apocalypse
- creating an armament of Little Boys
- going Scrooge McDuck on the non-magical economy
- piece of ground + magically-enhanced aerodynamics + relativistic speeds = kinetic bomb
- using the reality adjustment clause to speed up technological progress, since e.g., creating nanotubes in vast quantities retroactively manifests factories that can plausibly deliver you such quantities
- expelling vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere to speed up global warming and force non-mages to fund your space elevator
- changing the viscosity of the hotspot under a supervolcano to bring about the next mass extinction event
- a lens-based mosquito targeting system

Anything else I should watch out for?

****** I'm not sure that the momentum-energy thing would suffice to prevent their production. The inherent energy of strangelets isn't that high. Strange quarks are largely the same as normal (up and down) quarks, just a bit more massive. In fact, a mass of strangelets would be dangerous precisely because it could be more stable (lower energy) than normal matter, making it thermodynamically favorable for the normal matter to convert to strange matter (and releasing energy in the process).

However, if you want the strangelet bomb to not work, you can just have the surface tension of strangelets be low enough that they are not actually more stable than normal matter at the boundary. That surface tension is a physical constant that we haven't been able to measure yet, so you could just say “turns out that the surface tension is low enough that strangelets just evaporate rather than converting normal matter”.

Are you thinking of Sagittarius here? Magic requires mana contact though so, unless you can shape your mana at near-lightspeed you won't be able to follow the object fast enough to move it at those speeds. Spinning an object might work though, if it's artificially strengthened by Capricorn.

Actually I just realised how to fix these two scenarios. Instead of mana cost being cubic in mass, it should be cubic in /momentum-energy/.

- magical power derives from secrecy (which means any Chaotic alignment mage can completely disassemble the entirety of magical society)
- some government entity takes great pains to keep it secret (this goes against a natural incentive for arbitrary long periods of time; implausible)
- you need a high IQ to understand magic (hilarious, but no)
- "But the authorities won't believe me!" (lol maybe, until you show up in their office with 64 kilograms of uranium-235)

The original idea just seems to have too many consequences.

Yup, definitely! So that's another source of difficulty in advancing magical tradition because it's hard to compare what's physical from what's not if the physical keeps changing under one's feet.

My biggest concern is "how do I add magic to civilization without it blowing itself up to smithereens?" and my solutions to the usual genre conceits tend to be downstream of that. If anything, having local reality-warping is also a metatextual reconstruction of "why the hell do things keep happening to our characters?" which is an aspect of simulation-style fiction that I haven't seen addressed very much.

Plus, I expect it to be a natural source of hilarity lol, although I realise that I'd have to work twice as hard then to make it fit [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s standards.

** The world is stuck in a very, very long time loop. Every 20.000 years, the world resets to slightly before 18.000 BC and human civilization has to start from scratch again.

Each century during this period, one Immortal is born. These Immortals have low grade healing powers, they stop ageing around their early twenties, don't get sick and don't die of starvation or dehydration. They can still be killed in combat or die in an accident, but when they die they are reincarnated in the next cycle with their memories and skills intact.

Each Immortal is born in the same year every cycle, so the first immortal is always born near the start of the cycle, the second one a century later and so on. The reincarnation process picks a body at random from the people born in this time window, without regards for gender, skin colour or any other physical traits. If nothing close enough to a human is born within that year, the immortal skips this cycle.

Immortals can sense other nearby immortals (within approximately 100m) and if they met in a previous life they also instinctively recognize each other, regardless of their current appearance.

On their fiftieth birthday (approximately halfway between their birth and that of the next immortal), each immortal gets a vision that explains the specifics of the time loop and their abilities.

You are the 197th Immortal, so you will always be born near the end of the cycle, having at most 300 years to live each time. You're being told all of this by the 193rd immortal (born in the fifteenth century). She tells you that the world is currently in the second cycle and that she suspects humanity went extinct in the first cycle before either of you were born. She doesn't know whether any other immortals are currently alive. What do you do?

*** Trying to find some older immortals and get a lay of the internal politics is an important long term goal.

The advantages you have are that you're generally less likely to be killed than older immortals, and that you'll probably be better acclimated to the present era than other immortals. For example, in this life you might be one of the few who have a good, intuitive understanding of modern technology. If the other immortal is correct about this being the second loop (I'm dubious, how does she know that but doesn't know if any other immortals are alive?) then it'll take things a while to settle down as farming gets invented earlier and earlier.

The later in the loop, the more divergent things get, so you should assume that each life you have is going to be completely unique. Thus, you should be trying to learn anything that you'll want to have in the future. This should include things invented due to a fluke (penicillin?) and pieces of information that are relatively simple to remember but have potentially large effects (theorems and proofs, useful algorithms, philosophy, transistors, etc). Of course this should be focused on things that are likely to be useful in the modern era - hopefully you never have to introduce crop rotation or plumbing.

Also, learning survival skills and some crafts will definitely be beneficial eventually.

At first I was disappointed that you wouldn't get to influence human history that much, but the benefit is that you're going to be able to spend many lives with modern luxuries and few without. A fun consequence of being so late is that the food will be wildly different each time due to crops being cultivated differently and cultures being different.

It's possible that she met another immortal previously, but hasn't heard from them in many years. Which would explain why she doesn't know if they're alive or not. And if the immortal she met also has no memories of previous cycles (Or only has memories of one previous cycle) she can make a guess that this is at least the second time through. Though you're right that if this is the case she has no guarantee that there weren't more cycles before the previous one.

** You have a computer program which can create 'bots' according to broad parameters you set and which will then do things on the internet/places which could practically be influenced from an internet-connected device. This is how it works: You have one main field, in which you can type up to three words in English (or your native language if you prefer, but only one actual language is usable for the program's ui) plus up to one optional proper name. The words will be interpreted by the program in accordance with the usual grammar of English in the same way that fluent human speakers would go about interpreting it. This field is for setting the main, primary, purpose/personality of the bot. For example, you could write ‘Shakespeare enthusiast' or ‘elderly automobile mechanic' or ‘teenage creative writer' and that will be the core part of the 'bot's' schtick around which the ‘bot' will organize its behavior and to which it will integrate anything you put in the other fields. There are three other, optional fields, in each of which you can up to five words to narrow down the bot's personality/etc a bit. ‘Devout Catholic', ‘speaks three languages', ‘migrated from Argentina to Canada', stuff like that. The bot will integrate the stuff in these fields into its behavior as appropriate but will still be using the thing in the main field as its primary motivating behavior.

Once you have filled out the main field and such of the optional fields as you choose, the bot will be created with a turing-test-passing persona and will go onto the internet and behave like a human with that persona might plausibly behave. It will make every effort to seem like a real human and avoid revealing that it is actually a computer program, and will be no more good, no more evil, and no more effective or less effective in its goals than a human is capable of being, and its only ability to interact with the world is through the medium of internet-connected devices. You, when creating it, can only influence it in the broad way described above, or by talking to it once it is created, or by deleting it.

The program can operate up to ten bots at one time. If you delete one and create another using an identical description, the new one will not be exactly the same as the old one; e.g. the Shakespeare enthusiast might be a 50 year old Scottish man the first time you make it, and a 15 year old Canadian woman the second time.

** You have the power to materialize an invisible sensor anywhere on the earth, which you can see and hear via (replacing your normal sight and hearing while doing so). You can place/relocate the sensor up to once every 5 seconds, and can place it either by specifying a location (such as “1 meter behind that wall” or “100 meters above the top of the Empire State Building”) or by specifying a person with either their name or a mental image of them (ambiguities in names produce the sensor next to a random person with that name).

EDIT: When placing the sensor at a specific location (rather than at a person), you need at least a rough idea of the target location. For example, the “above the Empire State Building” prompt would fail if you don't actually have any idea of where the Empire State Building is, but having a map of NYC with the ESB marked on it would be enough to place the sensor above it, but not enough for a specific location like “inside the north-most elevator of the ESB”, though you could get to that before too long by looking around through the sensor. The only way that the sensor makes use of information you don't already have is when using the “find a person” mode of placing it. /EDIT

You are in a deathmatch with another person with this power (and you two are the only people with powers). Neither of you know who the other is as the beginning, but upon seeing the other person either with your own direct eyesight or through the sensor you will be able to identify them as your opponent by a colorful aura surrounding them (and vice versa them you). To prevent the game from taking thousands of years, both you and the other person live in Manhattan and cannot leave Manhattan for the duration of the game. How do you identify and then kill your opponent (with no regard to the consequences afterward, so no need to keep the killing secret) before they find and kill you?

*** The safest way to make money I can think of would be the stock market and insider trading. Crypto is easy to trace, and I'm honestly just not sure how I could do bank fraud fully remotely without getting caught. The stock market steady form of income in the short term, especially as I'm figuring out how to use it effectively. Calling in bounties (like the location of FBI's most wanted) would be enough cash for a few years, but would attract a lot of attention. The FBI would probably freak out if I called in more than 1, possibly if more than 1 was called in in a single year. Although being an ESPer for the government would be a solid way to have constant protection, but if my enemy did the same thing it could get really thorny.

Putting that aside, I'd stay in my home 24/7, getting deliveries of necessities through a trusted proxy (so the enemy can't use that as a way in). Ideally this would be an apartment that's not visible from the street so the enemy can't just methodically look at “the apartment behind that window” and find me. Even more ideally, it would be somewhere that doesn't show up on public plans/maps, but I'm not sure how I would go about that. Possibly blackmailing some rich people.

Another strategy would be living somewhere more public but inherently better defended. Finding a way to live at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740_Park_Avenue][740 Park Avenue]] without attracting attention would be good, it's pretty secure and it wouldn't attract additional attention to hire private security. The problem is I'd expect to be found pretty quickly, it's a well known building and it's somewhat of a logical option if you have lots of money and blackmail (which are trivial to get with the power). So I'm not sure it's a good idea.

I'd also purchase guns and trap/alarm my apartment, and possibly get the building to get better security. This way, even if I'm found by the enemy, I still have a chance of winning.

In terms of tracking down my enemy, I'm not sure. Regular monitoring of Manhattan areas, a progressive sweep of all homes in the area (which would take at least 42 straight hours based on 750k households and 5 seconds to move the eye), checking the news for crimes likely committed by them or unusual stock activity. It's interesting that it's a symmetrical problem, I'm not sure how to break that symmetry. At least I'd find eaglejarl pretty quick - I wouldn't be using purely birds eye views all the time, and an umbrella would stand out if it's not raining.

** Information Divination Magic. Magic allows you to “add”/“create” information in a probabilistic fashion.

- With around 6 seconds of hand gestures and words you can add or create 1-2 bits of information.

- With two to three minute of words and hand gestures you can add or create 8-16 bits of information.

- With a few hours of meditating and occasional chanting you can add or create between 256-512 bits of information.

There are a few modifiers and limitations:

- A prop/tool that lines up with the type of information you are trying to get can generally double (and if it perfectly lines up triple or rarely quadruple) your bits of information. I.e a Ouija board for a one word message, a dowsing rod for a direction or location, an ornate pen and writing desk covered in occult symbols for short written messages.

- Having a group of N people supporting the primary caster adds 1/2^{N} for each additional person... so a really large group approximately doubles a persons bits of information

- You can't stack castings at the same time or within 4 times the time interval it took to cast. I.e. if you spend 3 hours at your writing desk making an automatic message with 1024 bits of written information, you can't get anymore information on the topic you were writing about for 12 hours after. 12 hours later though, you can continue the writing...

- Repeating the hour long casting can up to double the information on the base amount, I.e. with the writing desk you could get 2048 bits on the 2nd and later repetitions.

Using this magic works as follows:

- the words/gestures/chanting are mostly intuitive in a glossalasia kind of way, 1-2 bits require barely any practice, minute casting require a few months practice, hour long castings require a year or two if practice

- Information takes the form of intuition on picking between several options/choices/alternatives you are aware of and, probabilistically speaking might have done anyway. For instance, 1 bit of information might allow you to accurately pick between two options you were 50/50 on. 2 bits would allow you to accurately pick between 4 options. Picking can take the form of a lucky guess, a Ouija board or dowsing rod moving just right. With automatic writing, notably, you aren't paying the information cost on each letter but rather over the space of possible sentences you might write with spikes in information usage for especially informative words.

- For cases were the options are widely spread, some of the bits of information go to if the caster had counterfactual information that would allow them to narrow the options.

- if the options are unclear and/or very widely spread and the bits of information insufficient, the casting may fail entirely or give a simple approximation that lumps options together.

- Divinations about the future are limited by what in principle is knowable/predictable based on the present. In practice this means unintelligent and mechanistic but chaotic processes are predictable (I.e. the weather), intelligent processes (I.e. involving people) that are based on simple understandable choices are predictable but a bit fuzzy/noisy, and stuff that interacts with other future divination are entirely unpredictable.

So major obvious applications?

Minor handy little usages?

Edit: upped the information for the hour long casting, upped the seconds for fast casting to reduce discrepancy on time value of casting.

*** I think I found a loophole that makes the 1-2 bits per few seconds a lot more useful than the other two minutes/hours options.

Lets suppose 1 bit takes /n/ seconds, and 128 bits takes /n/ hours. So the hours long ritual will grant 128x more bits of information, but takes 3600x more time as compared to the quick hand gestures.

Consider that there are no length limitations on the /question being asked/ itself, any problem of arbitrary length complexity can be broken down into predicates and then perform a binary search.

So for example, if you need to pick a 1 number out of 10000, you need 14 bits, (2^{14} = 16384), you could ask a rapid series of 1 or 2 bit questions over the course of a few seconds each, breaking up your search in a binary fashion (e.g. is number between 1 and 5000, is number between 2500 and 5000 and so on), and since the total cost will scale linearly (even with the 4x cooldown multiplier) you will rapidly outperform the hours long ritual (not to mention being far simpler and less tedious to cast) in terms of bits of information obtainable.

I would like to remind, that you can use the power to light fires from afar. In terms of applications, you could foam someone's eyes to blind them, than act with the acid. Alternatively, you could foam a person and then invert the fire by having the foam secrete the flammable resource on the inside.

Those are some of the things that I've thought of in application so far.
