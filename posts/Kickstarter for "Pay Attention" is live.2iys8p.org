** Hey everyone!

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][The Kickstarter]] that I've been talking about is finally live! Please take 90 seconds to check it out; I took me 46 separate takes to make a 35 second video, and I'm going to be very sad if no one watches it. Oh, and if you felt like reading the text and / or donating while you're there, that would be very cool.

If you don't want to give, please take a look anyway and give me your feedback -- I intend to do more of these, and I can't improve without criticism.

Again, the first 48 hours of [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][a Kickstarter campaign]] pretty much determine its success (bandwagon effects for the win!), so if you think you might want to donate it would be very appreciated if you'd do it today.

*** I just discovered Kickstarter won't accept Paypal, and I don't have any credit cards. I'm glad to contribute ten bucks in exchange for the $10 tier rewards if you could direct me to a suitable email address to send it to, but raising the green bar to $300 is apparently not in my power.

I don't have much of a critique- I think the video was short and to-the-point and the whole Kickstarter seemed equally straightforward. I am curious, though, about how your plot can adapt to having one of several different word counts. Granted, it sounds like a really cool idea for a reward, but when you say that 20,000 words could potentially be added to the story, would that affect the nature of the plot, or would it be roughly the same story with five times the breathing room?

Yeah, Kickstarter only accepts Amazon Payments. Which *really* cheeses me off. Not only because they are a non-standard payment provider and most people won't have an account with them, but because I found it a pain in the butt to set up my merchant account with them so that I can receive money through Kickstarter.

I admit though, it was easy to set up a personal account on Amazon Payments. I'll give them that.

Anyway, you can use this email to PayPal me: *[[mailto:dstorrs.payments@gmail.com][dstorrs.payments@gmail.com]]*

I just now set up the PayPal account, so it's possible that it can't receive yet but, if not, it will be able to in a couple of days.

--------------

As to the plot thing...there's a lot that I could do here. Writing it as a 5,000 word short story requires keeping everything really tight. Writing it as a novella would mean I could explore the characters' backgrounds a bit more, as well as the cause of the supernatural goings-on. I could also extend the number of bad things that happen and spend more time on the psychological deterioration it will cause. So, there's advantages at every length.

Me too! That's a big part of why I started this whole thing.

Although, actually, even if it weren't for horror movies / TV, I'd still be going to the special hell. At a movie, I tend to lean over and whisper to my friends when I think of something funny, or when something stupid happens, or etc. I'm very quiet about it, at least.

*********** You've got a pretty good world and pretty interesting characters, so I think you've got plenty of material that you could work with. Besides, usually when you think of a society with magic, you think pre-renaissance levels of technology and society. Seeing a magical society that actually /uses/ the magic to boost themselves up to post-scarcity... That's pretty innovative for fantasy, and a lovely thing to see.

************ Oh, I've been intending to write more in the Anundjå setting. I just hadn't thought of doing a direct sequel to "One Hot Night."

Among other things, the story of "How Albrecht defended the Legion camp from the first attack of the drauga" has been itching to get out of my brain.

** For some of the higher rewards it might be good to have some extra rewards for $75 and above. The name in the story thing for example- you mentioned that they might be researching the monster so it should be easy to work in a short user submitted description and a name. Or mentions at the end of the book. Maybe some more rewards at the higher levels would help draw people out of the 5-10 dollar ghetto.

**** Add more elements in the high level rewards is my suggestion. 24 of your backers are level 1, 13 of your backers are level 2 are level 3, none level 3 or 4, one level 5 since it's a high reward. There's a sharp drop off for higher levels. So it'd be good to have extra rewards for the existing higher tiers to attract people to the higher price points. Cheap rewards that don't waste much of your time preferably.

***** Gotcha. That's a good thought.

Based on your suggestions and my own ideas, here's what I've got:

- Be included in a "thank you" section (seems like a lower level reward)
- Get a cameo
- Get to create (name and description) a minor character

Do you (or anyone else) have other suggestions?

****** How about a new reward for each tier above 5 dollars? One that lazy people could enjoy.

10 dollars. Your name at the end.

25 dollars. Your name at a special thank you at the start.

50 dollars. A cameo.

75 dollars. A minor character, name and description.

100 dollars. a protagonist.

If you wanted additional rewards, perhaps a villain one would be good? Perhaps someone could help write a villainous scene, if they've always wanted a villain to do something, or at the very high levels offer some input. Evil options are good.

Edit. Now I'm imagining a horror story where people bid to suggest actions to the protagonist and villain, or offer aid. Like the hunger games.

I thought about some villain ones, but I don't think it fits well for the story I'm telling. I'll save those for the next story I write. Thank you for the suggestion though -- I suspect it will be attractive.

******** Could you clarify a bit on your rewards? At the moment the 12$ reward looks more attractive than the $25 reward in some ways, in that you get a cameo. The rewards that are cheapish should probably propagate up the chain somewhat so that higher values look more valuable. None of the higher up rewards get thanked, for example.
