** A few old threads resolved, and another hint why Flicker trusts Jumping Spider but doesn't like her very much.

** Wait. This is going to be the promise about the conditions before she can start breaking governments or something like that, isn't it?

** That was a hell of a place to break off, Doc. :P

Have we seen this promise before?

*** Yup, Chapter 20, near the beginning: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/139977504256/the-makers-ark-chapter-20]]

Relevant quote: "And 99.7% is the threshold Doc and I agreed was enough to verify they've restarted the Lost Years war. That's when I start treating them like criminal organizations and taking out their infrastructure"

**** (Fresh post so you get the alert.)

You know, you would think they could settle this by sending a message to the President, or the head of the CIA or something, saying "If this is you, cut it out or Flicker takes you apart. If it's not you, give us everything you have and put all your efforts into shutting it down or we'll assume it's you." Sure, they could interpret this as "she's a terrorist" but it's not like they could do anything to her.

***** A full discussion of nuances, political costs, and consequences will be in the next chapter (it /is/ a cliffhanger, after all 8-)) But consider: A big problem for any vaguely competent group considering restarting the Lost Years was 'how do we hide what we're doing from Doc's damned Database'. They found a partial way--but not necessarily one that worked well with adequate oversight or timely communication. And a key link died just before the start of Fall (There is a discussion of Jumping Spider complaining about that a little later in Chapter 20).

It's a classic case of "this is a warning, not a threat."

"Me? No, I'm not going to do anything to you! My friend here, on the other hand, well, she's just itching to start breaking things..."

***** It will be scary, before flicker was constrained on destroying government infrastructure by the necessity of it providing critical services, now DASI and Black swan are willing, capable, and able to deploy better services.
