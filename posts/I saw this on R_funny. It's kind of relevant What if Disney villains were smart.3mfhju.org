***** Not strictly true - lions only kill cubs younger than nine months - the reason for the infanticide is not to eliminate competition but to get the lioness ovulating, and after nine months killing the cub wouldn't help matters so there is no reason to. Older cubs just get ousted. And of course, there's no real reason to kill Simba since lions don't typically inherit prides.

Besides, Scar and Mufasa were a sibling coalition - killing your nephew and sibling coalition partner is not adaptive. Since Scar is not physically imposing, Scar's pride is super vulnerable to attack by other males. BiologicallyTypical!Scar would have kept Mufasa around for defense purposes. Plus, a wild Scar would be uncertain about Simba's paternity - Simba could well be his own cub. So Scar's betrayal is, in fact, a betrayal even by wild lion standards.

And as long as we're talking about inaccuracies, Mufasa, being the more physically powerful lion, should have gotten the black mane. It's thought that dark manes are honest signals of fitness among lions because they're too warm.

Cruella de ville's plan was perfect and would have worked if it wasn't for the fact that animals can talk to each other and some random farm animals found the puppies.

Gaston liked Belle because she didn't immediately like him so changing that is changing what he's attracted to, not making him rational.

Wasn't the whole point about Ursula that she had to get Triton to give up his power willingly so that she could control the trident and not get blasted into tiny bits?
