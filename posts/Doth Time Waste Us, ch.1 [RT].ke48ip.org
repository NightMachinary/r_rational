*** Why does she need to marry them before they prove themselves?

***** Sure, but does she have a reason to be so wasteful and weird? Is there some internal thought that made her like the idea of marrying a bunch of men before killing them, on repeat, every day, for centuries on end? While supposedly also having the goal of listening to really /really/ entertaining stories for a literal millennium, yet not pursuing this lofty goal beyond her weird mass-marry-murder fetish routine?

Or is she just a story device and not an actual caracter with thoughts and goals?

** u/NTaya:
#+begin_quote
  Chapters: 1/1
#+end_quote

I assume this is a mistake?

Overall, it's quite nice. Infodumps feel a bit /too/ infodumpy, but the creativeness of /what/ is getting dumped at the reader more or less makes up for it.

If there are indeed more chapters, I'm looking forward to them.

+also, Abzydkcri is my spirit animal; I'm ready to kill for a good time loop story that I haven't yet read+

*** Weird that. Posted here, got mixed but not really negative feedback, deleted the story in less than half a day.

**** The other comments definitely had me interested. Too bad I was too late for it, apparently.

** Neat setting. I assume that Earth must be an already documented world, if it's named. I'm not sure how seeing another Earth represents a time loop, but I'm curious to find out.

Hope the Queen kills that hippo.

** My initial reaction was that the hippo thing was too cartoonishly whimsical for my taste, but the rest was so good I immediately wanted the next chapter.
