** Hm.

I'll make a wish to no longer have anti-wishes happen. Two universes appear, in one only anti-wishes happen and in the other, only wishes.

Then, I'll begin 'testing'. Every wish I make will be minor enough that an anti-result won't be catastrophic, but major enough that the positive effect is, in fact, a quite nice thing to have happened.

If I ever see an anti-result, I will stop wishing immediately.

If I don't ever see an anti-result, I will work with my fellow human beings to create Heaven by my own hands, and with the assistance of an infinite amount of minor wishes that allow me to positively direct the development of the world.

I will also go through the effort of thinking about the situation in depth and also giving the information on the genie to other people to think on, hoping for someone to come up with a better solution at some point. And I will take precautions to ensure that no-one will be able to input a potentially Hell-creating wish by accident or malevolent design, or benevolent design that is not very well thought-out first.

** Given that any particular sequence of wishes would likely send me on a random walk of wishes and anti-wishes, and a random walk along one direction will tend to eventually intersect any bottom-line of value (which is why gamblers need an infinite bank account to succeed in most gambits)... then setting the scale so that the worst possible sequence of repeated wishes isn't that bad, while the corresponding anti-wish is at least modestly nice, might tilt the probability mass of copies of oneself towards heaven.

"I wish for the difference between my current wealth, and the wealth I would need for a pleasant if modest above-subsistence lifestyle, to be halved." (This assumes that you're starting with wealth above that level. If you aren't, then adjust accordingly.) Repeat ad nauseum, until you eventually, by purely random walking, end up with more anti-wishes than wishes. This will happen in nearly all universe-branches, and in them, due to the results of the anti-wish which presumably doesn't quite double your wealth, you will then have more wealth than you started with. From this new point, adjust the wish to wish to lower your wealth halfway to the previous set-point.

It may take a Very Large number of wishes, but in nearly all universes, you should end up with an arbitrarily high level of wealth, at which point you may want to adjust your wishing strategy to increase some other form of leverage by which to build a heaven.

What should actually work would be for me to set my set point at halfway between what he was going to set it at and what my current wealth is, do his game for a hundred steps, reset my set point to halfway between its current position and what he was going to set it at, and repeat until we end up with at least 10 times the initial wealth, then repeat the whole thing as necessary.

Yes - /if/, once you've gotten to a positive amount of money, you /keep wishing/ with the original wish. The trick to changing the probability is that you never wish a sequence of ++---, you stop at the first +; while the counterpart, --+++, still eventually also makes it to the positive side of things.

In practice, making this wish and stopping when you're above the boundary line results in smaller and smaller proportions of successful universes as time goes on. With a threshold of three net positive results and a thousand steps, the ratio is about 7% universes that are net positive and 3% universes that cross the threshold.

If you make a new rule like "wish for pennies 20 times when I cross the threshold" you could probably offset this, though.

** I don't really see the point of asking us to flip coins. By the rules of the thought experiment, any information-granting wishes will result in a universe in which true and useful information is granted, and one in which false and misleading information is granted. Similarly, any meta-wishes will result in a universe which is successfully meta-altered, and one in which the universe is maliciously meta-altered.

As such, plans must include the factual existence of universes in which your wishes were perverted. Given that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30l2y3/double_genie/cptfdtu][this]] is the response to a wish that anti-wish universes no longer be generated, though, there is a solution.

Step 1: I wish that whenever a wish is made, an anti-wish universe is no longer generated.

(this will, of course, produce a universe in which wishes are always granted faithfully, and a universe in which wishes are always perverted)

Step 2: Test to see which of those two universes I am in, probably with innocuous wishes like "I wish that the next coin I flip should land on heads". (probably do this fifty times or so, to confirm that Step 1 actually worked; there's still a small chance that I just happen to be in the universe in which things went right/wrong 50 times, but if I do in fact get 50 heads or 50 tails, I will assume that Step 1 worked).

Step 3a: In the universe in which wishing has been successfully debugged, wish CEV, creating Heaven.

Step 3b: In the universe in which wishing has been confirmed to be invariably corrupted, experiment with the use of anti-wishes to result in beneficial consequences, via wishing for undesirable events to happen. If the anti-genie seems to pervert wishes in a predictably-reversed fashion, wish anti-CEV, therefore causing the anti-genie to create a Heaven instead of the Hell I just asked it to create.

**** Okay, so if coinflip-tier wishes are assumed to be purely-information-seeking, start small instead. The anti-genie will show itself sooner or later through use of non-trivial-but-not-reality-destroying wishes. Presumably, the content of a wish like "I wish my headache would be cured" is not information-seeking, so the invariably-corrupted genie would make the headache worse. All wishes with notable effects also have information content in this context, so I either have the genie that's granting all my wishes because it is in fact a safe genie, or the genie that's granting all my wishes because it's trying to trick me. In all practicality, my actions in a universe in which a genie seems to be granting beneficial wishes for me would be to acquire wealth and power and correspond with other like-minded individuals before making a CEV wish, it seems like there'd be plenty of time to notice any chicanery. And even if the genie is actually granting me large sums of cash just to trick me, there's still the possibility that access to mundane wealth and power may obviate the need to wish up CEV (y'know, via conventionally-possible means of reality improvement).

The objective is to create Heaven in almost all futures, and to create no instance of Hell. As such, in the debugged genie branch, I wish additional instances of Heaven into existence, eventually resulting in a vast number of instances of Heaven. In the anti-genie universe, it presumably eventually reveals itself by screwing me out of lottery winnings or something, and after some experimentation to determine that no, it won't be manipulated, I proceed to not make a CEV wish, and thus not make things any worse.

** So, the current problem is that once you split the universes, the information perversion of the anti-wish genie means you cannot tell by information searching wishes whether you are in the good or bad universe.

So, ignore the informational goals.

That leaves two options: Perform wishes which equalize over time, or perform wishes which will increase or decrease your standard of living by a non-lethal amount.

I trust the perfect copy of me in the good universe even if I am in the bad one. I legitimately want to make money/power/whatever. I am willing to accept any non-death outcome of my wishes.

Wish to win a smallish lottery for the sake of making money. Have the goal "it doesn't matter which universe I am in. I want to win this." This gets you the information you need without you actually having the goal of obtaining the information.

If that doesn't work, I wish for 0.9999999999999 Heaven with the intent of using it to gather information for my final Heaven 1.0 wish. *Fuck you, contrary genie.*

If the anti-genie doesn't actually care even what your current goals are, find a way to change your long term goals.

Alternatively, use someone else. Get a suicidal person to wish to die. This would actually be in their CEV, the Genie could not pervert it. Death for the true universe, continued life for the other.

Wait a minute. /I don't actually care./

We already know something that differentiates anti from true universe. CEV Heaven wishing.

I wish for a Heaven with no time dilation or differential time traits. I get Hell in Universe 1 and Heaven in Universe 2. In Universe 1 I suffer unimaginable pain for the time it takes me in Universe 2 to say "I wish the genie in the other universe was replaced by a copy of you, and all memories of all people since the Hell wish was made were replaced by the memories of those same people in this universe since the Heaven wish was made."

Also, I would like to point out that: >every time you make a wish, another universe is created where the opposite of that wish is granted.

So every antiwish has its own separate universe, but all the wishes are in one universe. Since you never wished for the genie to exist or not exist, that means the genie can only exist in the wish universe.

No, he doesn't. because the first wish stopped that by permanently splitting into an AlwaysAnti and AlwaysGood universe. I should have mentioned that I was using that, but my solution implied it.

You then wish for almost-Heaven, which send you to almost-Hell in anti-wish-world. In wish-world, you make Heaven.

So, what's the cutoff point? If that's not an information seeking wish, or if the Anti-Genie (who at this point is not just perverting the intent but being actively malicious, since it clearly isn't intent that matters) just decides at some point to actually anti-fulfill the wish rather than giving you the information, then there is some point where it either judges a wish non-information seeking, or ignores that to achieve an anti-goal.

This implies either a weighted function, an endstate goal, or sentient intent.

If it's a weighted function, then wish up by 1% at a time until it actually switches to Hell, then wish down to the nearest non-Hell number.

If it's an endstate goal, then my thing would have worked, because .99 Hell is insufficient to meet the endstate of Hell.

If it's a sentient process that is actively malicious, and good genies cannot effect universes with bad genies (really? no multiuniverse travel at all, in any circumstances? In Heaven Universe you have /literally all of polynomial time/ to figure out an answer and then either wormhole it back to your origin point, time travel or dilation being something an all powerful Genie should be able to do, or somehow or another get to that universe.) then there is no safe wish and no right answer to the problem.

****** Even so, it clearly has some point where it values "Anti-Wish" over "Fake Real Wish to Trick You".

Also, there are two kinds of maliciousness here as well.

If it is actively malicious in the "I want to fuck up your current wish" sense, then the easy fix is universe split plus the wish "I wish to want for my next wish to be to wish for Heaven." In Good universes you now want to wish for heaven and do so. In evil universes you now want to wish for Hell and create Heaven since reversed wishes for bad things have already been explained to create good things.

If it is malicious as to the end goal of Heaven or Hell, then it will actively prevent you from ever getting enough information to be sure on what universe you are in, and so it is never safe to make a major wish.

Basically, if it is malicious on current wishes, you can win by tricking yourself. If it is even slightly malicious and omnicognizant, you can't win.

"Only somewhat malicious" actually gives us /less/ predictive power then not telling us that, since that means it is inherently unpredictable unless we know its goals.

*** As has been demonstrated, any information-content wish is maximally perverted, so the anti-wish returns the same results as the real wish. Accordingly, your tests all tell you everything is fine, and the anti-wish versions give you bad information. This applies even if, like I did [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30l2y3/double_genie/cptg6g9][here]], you first make a wish to stop the universes from dividing, which is the only way to plausibly create a 'wish-universe' and an 'anti-wish-universe'.

Remember: both possibilities always occur. You can wish that the universes would stop multiplying, but you can't make wishes that are only beneficial; every positive wish is matched by an equal but opposite anti-wish. The two are just granted to other people.

More to the point, atoms are very small. You will die of old age long before making unique wishes for all the atoms that compose a single cell of your own body.

** Observation: you can specify your wish in negative terms to make some things easier to think about. If the wish is odd and you can't express it, the antiwish may be much better defined and easier to express.

Find out if I can convince my Mean to include a binary do-nothing condition. For example, if step one in the wish is "if this coin flips tails, do nothing, if it flips heads, do X", and then convince myself that that the negative outcome really is the coin flipping tails.

If that doesn't work, find a system with a finite global minimum value but no global maximum. For example, "I wish that either that I have infinite money", for which the antiwish would almost certainly be "I wish that I have no money". Then wish until you get the wish instead of the antiwish.

There may be value here in attempting to wish faster, but I don't know a change that would safely increase wishing speed without the antiwish setting wish speed to zero.

For directly doing things, it's relatively easy to construct wishes which perform physical changes for which the antiwish is just as useful. For example, "spin this rotor clockwise" would almost certainly antiwish into "spin this rotor counterclockwise", at which point you just use gears to normalize it and feed it to a generator. Even if it interprets the wish as "keep this rotor from spinning" you could probably extract some force from it.

If you're really, really sure about your interpretation of quantum mechanics, you could exploit the anthropic principle and quantum suicide to delete the antiwish effects. "Retroactively delete the universe and make me think a million times faster" will either never be experienced or resolve into the (positive) antiwish which simultaneously makes the universe last longer somehow and makes you smarter.

** Solution:

"I wish to know how, be able, and have the resources to use the laws of nature to create Heaven for almost all of my futures across the many universes, and never create Hell."

The problem with the solutions I've read thus far is that they seem to forget the genie will pervert the SPIRIT of your wish for the anti-you.

Wish for information and anti-you will become confused.

Wish to fix malaria, and the anti-you will worsen malaria.

Wish to improve your IQ/finances/universe by (best - current)/2, then his universe uses the formula (worst - current)/2.

I am not sure my wish will work, but my understanding is the following:

Anti-me receives no information on making the world better. It is also possible that the perversion of the wish has stripped my other self of ability, knowledge, and resources. His fate, however, is unimportant because his value system is such that if his universe improves, he is happy even if dead.

However, after the wish, I now have the know-how, ability, and resources to /ignore the genie/ and use science/magic to improve most universes until they become heavens, and no universe will be hell.

--------------

The other way to pervert this wish is to likewise give anti-me the knowledge, ability, resources, and intention to turn all universes into hell, and thus begins an eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil and I and my anti-self eventually become God/Devil analogues. Awkward . . .

I don't think the above is a possible outcome, however, because it prevents my wish from fulfillment.

** It seems that anti-wishes are generated based on my own personal value of what would be opposite and equivalent.

Therefore, I begin with the assumption that Heaven and Hell are generated in response to each other via anti-wishes because creating Hell holds a negative value to me equivalent to the positive value I place in creating Heaven. So, by changing the values of Hell and Heaven, the results of creating one would change how much of the other would show up as a result of the anti-wish.

If, for example, my belief system states that the existence of Hell is so abhorrent that Hell is twice as bad as Heaven is good, then if I wished to create Heaven, then only half of a Hell would be created in the anti-Wish universe.

Therefore:

Wish 1: "I wish to change my own beliefs so that I no longer find any value in the idea of Hell, while maintaining the same amount of value in the idea of Heaven that I currently hold."

Because of the information-twisting properties of anti-wishes, I believe that this works in both resulting universes, even though my underlying beliefs are different in both. In the wish universe, my value of Hell is 0 and my value of Heaven is still 1. In the anti-wish universe, my value of Heaven is now 0 and my value of Hell is still 1.

Wish 2: "I wish to create Heaven."

In the Wish -> Wish universe, Heaven is created.

In the Wish -> Anti-Wish universe, and anti-wish is generated that is equivalently negative based on my own personal values. Because my value of Hell is 0, Hell is not created.

In the Anti-Wish -> Wish universe, Heaven is created. In the Anti-Wish -> Anti-Wish universe, nothing happens, because Heaven has 0 value to me.

** I wish for the ability to travel between universes. In one universe I get this ability, and can then create a series of additional universes by making inconsequential wishes with no major effects, just to multiply my forces. In the universe where I got the anti-wish... I don't know what the proportionately worse thing that would happen is. Regardless, that version of me can be rescued from his predicament by the universe traveling versions.

Once I've got a team of universe traveling alt-selves, it also becomes easy to use the wishes to do all sorts of useful stuff, since we can then go intervene in the universe that got hit by the anti-wish.

***** The 'experimental evidence' section was intended to be humorous. The real reason is that inter-universe travel just isn't consistent with how the genie seems to work, which is like many worlds, but with only wishes as universe split points. And even if it were, the anti-wishing of wishing for interuniversal travel would probably be to make it impossible.

** Hmm. I guess if I knew that more universes existing was a net benefit to me, because I value other people and myself existing, and overall the universe created net positive utility by existing, then I could just make infinite wishes for the minor dislocation of a single quark or something similarly inconsequential for the sake of creating more universes. Of course I have no idea if this universe will generate net positive utility over the long term. I tend to think so, but what a massive choice to make for the universe.

This is assuming the genie sticks to the rules about creating the universe with the opposite of your wish, with the creation of two new universes being assumed to be already accounted for in the wish.

I'd note that Otherwise if someone places any value at all on the general net utility of the universe as a whole this would create a neverending cycle of value calculation which would instantly convert all possible wished for worlds into net neutral worlds.

ex. I wish for a hat. Universe A I receive a hat + the net value I assign to the universe Universe B I lose a hat + the value I assigned to the universe, but the universe just got split so I just got that value by virtue of the universe existing.

So now what? Does the genie adjust for me giving a net positive or negative value to the universe splitting in the first place or is that accounted for in the wish?

It seems since there is a law of conservation of value in effect on these wishes, the only way to alter anything about the universe is going to be if the initial universe splitting doesn't obey the law of conservation of value imposed on the rest of the wish.

*** Yes, the universe splitting occurs simultaneous to the wish being granted. Also, the genie is unable to affect other universes either in a wish or anti-wish, so your scheme does work.

**** Wait, the universe is split during the wish. That means that a universe is created. Two identical copies of the original universe now exist. If I assign positive utility to each additional universe exactly like this one existing then that means each time I make a wish I get the amount of positive utility I assign to that entire new copy existing.

So basically, If I assign a positive utility to the universe as it is right now, I double my utility value every time I make a wish because that universe is copied by virtue of making the wish. Now I just have to tally up all possible utility that may ever exist for me in the universe and decide if it adds up to be positive. (Shouldn't be too hard with the information I have now, right? Not at all arrogant for me to make this decision for the entire universe.)

****** I suspect that would be an information granting wish and therefore no good to me thanks the utilitarian trolling nature of value-neutral net wish effects. The only net utility change to the universe is the splitting. Anything else I wish for is going to basically just polarize the two new universes towards positive and negative values to varying degrees of ridiculousness.

Of course I may have misunderstood the wish rules.

** Step 1: I wish that whenever a wish is made, an anti-wish universe is no longer generated. Step 2: Ask genie which universe you're currently in. If Tails, wait. If Heads, ask the genie to politely remind me in a minute that I can now make consequence-free wishes, then - Step 3: I wish that the genie in the anti-wish universe I just triggered the creation of be replaced by a perfect duplicate of you, following your version of the genie rules. Step 4: Hi-five self.

****** Sounds like wishes are bullshit. The genie is supposed to grant my wish exactly as I intend it. I intend to wish for a dollar. I can deduce knowledge after the fact, but I intend to wish for a dollar. In one universe I gain a bit of happiness from getting a dollar, and in the other I lose a bit of happiness from losing a dollar. Then I figure out what's going on. It sounds like you're just fucking with the rules to prevent this from working.

******* You just aren't fucking with the genie hard enough. Declare the square meter around you to be a new country, with a currency made out of a specific rock on the ground. Each Rock is worth /i/ dollars, so there is no conversion rate. Then, while holding a Rock, wish for twice as many Rocks. There's nowhere else to draw a supply of Rocks from, so either the genie creates a new one /ex nihilo/ or it doesn't.

**** So it only communicates it's rule-set that once, then goes silent? Step 0: Wish for the genie to answer any question I ask with perfect factual accuracy and timing. If the genie refuses to communicate or provides incorrect information on a series of follow-up test questions, wait. Then as above, but copy the perfected genie to both of the Tails universes. So long as one universe ends up with free wishes and no Tails mistakes themselves for a Heads universe and blows up everyone, I think most problems can be solved this way.
