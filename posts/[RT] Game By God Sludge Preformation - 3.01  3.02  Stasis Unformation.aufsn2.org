Well good story guys, well worth a read. I have to say I enjoy the almost antagonistic nature of this story. I checked the synopsis when it started talking about that (I had largely forgotten it) and there's a sense of fun in being held almost accountable by what you're reading.

Let's hope the author writes something else in the future.

I was thinking about the author concluding the story early during the first two chapters, it actually is a reasonable solution to the Author Problem TM which is my term for the unlikeliness of a new serial writer.

If the author has already finished writing the story and is just faking it being a serial then it's much more plausible in my opinion. Whether that's more plausible than t3 being another author or a genuine first time serial writer who is just managing it by skill is up to the reader.

Also, the author can apparently edit any comments on wordpress which is insane and now makes every comment on that site suspect (obviously sockpuppets are a thing so they weren't exactly reliable before but still).

*** One of the things that makes this story so interesting, is how it constantly shrugs off expectations and makes 90 degree turns that while unexpected are interesting. It would not surprise me if this is the end, but I think it's more likely that this is another twist. Of course, there's also the possibility that this entire story is just an attempt at the Author to troll readers, and thus the abrupt end.

It would make sense in the course of the story, it does explain the multiple Chekhov's guns and even perhaps the intense emotional backstories attributed to some of the characters. Considering the dramatic shifts in tone and POV though, I think it's equally likely that the last couple of chapters were day dreams by one of the main characters.

I guess we will have to wait and see. We should have an answer in a few hours.

**** The answer seems to be that it was a very short serial

***** It's a funny coincidence that you replied now, the author seems to have announced a sequel at a future date:

** Some days since this appears to have ended, my remaining lingering feeling is regret that I never had a opportunity to try to deduce a Sludging culprit in this fiction.

That and playful Vned thoughts: "Wouldn't it make more sense to let each of them out as soon as they could telepathically ask to? And wouldn't that allow the also-fun outcome of someone finally, much much longer than anyone had ever endured that experience for, asking about her and the organisation finally realising that she was still in there?"
