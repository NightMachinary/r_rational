“Master Windu, I must talk to you.”

“Skywalker. We just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the Senate.”

“He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth: I think the Chancellor is a Sith Lord.”

“A /Sith Lord/?”

“The one we've been looking for.”

“How do you know this?”

“He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the dark side.”

“Are you sure?”

“Absolutely.”

“Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.”

“Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.”

“/No/. Convene the Senate Security Council and have them enact General Order 65. Tell them what you know. Better yet, I will come myself.”

“Are we not going to arrest the Chancellor?”

“The Chancellor has spent /ten years/ as the /head of state of the Republic/ with his office in our metaphorical back-yard. He /almost certainly/ has contingency plans for exactly this eventuality. In fact, he absolutely does; the clones have memorized - well, better not to discuss that out in the open like this. In any case, we cannot rush in half-cocked against an enemy who has had more than a decade to prepare and expect to get anywhere; we cannot rely on the Chancellor being stupid. We have little time. Come with me and I will explain on the way.”

The two boarded a gunship along with the other three Jedi who had come to ensure the Chancellor would relinquish his emergency powers.

“Pilot, take us to the Senate Building and advise the Security Council to convene for an emergency session,” ordered Mace Windu. “After you have done that, under no circumstances are you to accept any remote communications by any method until I personally order otherwise. In fact, disable the vehicle's communications array - turn off its power for now, but when we set down, physically destroy it along with any personal communicators you may have. This goes for the troopers in the gun pods as well as any other clones who may be on board. This gunship is now under information quarantine. 

“Masters Fisto, Tiin, and Kolar, when we arrive, report to the Chancellor's office and alert him that Master Kenobi has begun his attack on Utapau and that you are there to ensure his safety in the event of a Separatist reprisal.” Using the Force, he added more in mental communication to the other Jedi.

“/The Chancellor is a Sith Lord. Make sure he sends no communications from his office. If it comes to it, destroy his communications devices using any force necessary. Try not to kill him, but if it becomes necessary in order to prevent his communicating with others, you are authorized to do so. Do not trust the clone troopers until I tell you otherwise. Under no circumstances are you to reveal to the Chancellor that Grievous is dead or that Skywalker has told us about his true nature/.”

Skywalker replied to the mental message.

“/I do not understand why we don't just use the clones to overwhelm the Chancellor's guards and capture him/.”

Windu explained.

“/That would look like a coup - in fact, it would be one - and would give the Chancellor all the reason he needs to declare the Jedi Order an enemy of the lawful government of the Republic. Remember the contingency orders I mentioned before? One of them, created against the day that the Jedi actually might stage a coup, would compel the clones to kill all Jedi. Another thing - all of you, once we arrive and before you do anything else, recall your troops if they are away from Coruscant and instruct them not to accept any communications not prefaced by your personal authentication code. Actually, create a new authentication code and instruct them not to accept or acknowledge any communications not prefaced by that code and to assume any order authenticated with your original code was given under duress. That way, if the Chancellor gets to you and coerces you into ordering your troops to move against us, you can appear to do as he wishes, and no one can hijack your command. I will do the same with my troops. Grievous is dead, and the Outer Rim sieges can wait/.”

“/Order them not to accept any communications? Master, it's almost as if you don't trust your own soldiers! With all due respect, you're acting paranoid/.”

“/In my experience, most people are not nearly paranoid enough. That is to say, we cannot rely on our enemies to be stupid. The archives are full of stories of otherwise-competent and wise Jedi who died because they did not take sufficient precaution. We are dealing with a Sith Lord who has spent the past ten years as the head of state of the Galactic Republic/. 

“/The clone army is far too convenient for me to trust it. Think about it - the Chancellor came to power some fifteen years ago, immediately following the discovery that the Sith survive, and the clone army was commissioned around the same time, supposedly by a Jedi Master who died under mysterious circumstances shortly thereafter, having never alerted the Jedi Council that he commissioned the army in the first place. Who paid for the clones? The Senate certainly didn't authorize that expenditure - at least not as a matter of public record - and I would have noticed if the cost had come out of Jedi coffers. The only reason we're using the clones now is that the Republic could not have raised and trained an army in time to counter the Separatist threat. I'm not saying that the clones are definitely a weapon to be used against us, but they are dangerous and there are a great many of them. Even we can be overcome by sufficient numbers. Each clone has memorized a set of 150 contingency orders - among them, by the way, an order to execute all Jedi should we be found to be treasonous -/ /and they execute their orders without question or hesitation. Fortunately, we can make this work for us as well. The set of contingency orders also contains an order to detain the Chancellor should he be declared a traitor by a vote of the full Senate or the Security Council. We are not empowered to enact this protocol, but the Security Council is a small enough body that we can convince them to do so/.”

The gunship arrived at the Senate building and set down.

“/Act calm. Don't let anyone know that anything is amiss/,” added Windu, and then out loud, “Pilot, keep this vehicle here.”

As the Jedi walked away, the clones operating the gunship threw their personal communicators on the ground, stomped on them, and shot the remains for good measure. The doors of the Senate building closed on the view of the pilot, on top of the gunship, discharging his sidearm into the vehicle's communications array.

A few moments passed as the Jedi used their own personal communicators, funnelled through the Senate's long-range antennae, to issue the relevant orders to their forces in the Outer Rim, which promptly began to disengage from their own battles and make for Coruscant. 

“/You know what to do. Move quickly. Your actions will determine the fate of the Jedi Order and the Republic itself. May the Force be with us all/.”

Windu and Skywalker entered one turbolift as the three other masters entered another. They felt the motion as the lift accelerated, and there was a tense silence until it came to a halt. The silence continued as they walked to the conference room in which there sat a quorum of the Security Council, along with two senatorial guards - not clones - who stood by the door.

The chairman of the committee spoke.

“Master Jedi, we are honored to receive you. We take it that General Grievous has been dispatched?”

“Before we begin, all of you must disable any personal communications devices you have on your person. The matter we have to discuss is of the utmost importance and pertains to the immediate survival of the Galactic Republic.”

“Master Jedi! This is a Security Council proceeding. None of us is allowed to bring any personal communicators into this room.”

“Then you will not mind if we use the Force to search for any that may be hidden. Believe me, you will not regret allowing us to take this precaution once we have explained our reasons.”

“I do not see the necessity, but go ahead. We trust in the wisdom of the Jedi.”

“Thank you.”

The Jedi quickly swept through the room's presence in the Force. They saw no communications devices, but the entire room was somehow clouded, as though it was seen through a thick mist. They risked expanding their awarenesses and learned that the dark side of the Force pervaded the entire building.

Master Windu began to explain and spoke quickly.

“Before we begin, can we all agree on the fact that the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker who stands before you is a credible expert on the Supreme Chancellor? That is, do we all agree that Skywalker's assessment of the Supreme Chancellor as a person is essentially correct? That Skywalker would have no reason to slander the Chancellor and would not want to see anything bad happen to him unjustly?”

“Master Jedi, the Security Council does not see the relevance of this line of-

“Do we acknowledge this to be true or not, Mr. Chairman?” asked the Jedi Master sternly, glaring at the chairman as only one of his station could.

The chairman nodded his head meekly.

“Out loud, Mr. Chairman.”

“The Security Council acknowledges that the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker is a credible authority on the mannerisms and habits of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.” 

“Any objections? Rest assured that no harm will come to any of you if any here should disagree. I want your honest assessments, but I will brook no obstructions to my line of questioning.”

No one in the Security Council moved.

“Let the record indicate that the Security Council has unanimously affirmed the statement of the chair. Now, as to the reason why this is relevant. We have reason to believe that the Chancellor is a Sith Lord -”

“A /Sith Lord/?”

“The /Chancellor/?”

“This is impossible!”

“Slander!”

“Wait just a minute! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.”

Windu spoke on, ignoring the outbursts from the various Senators who made up the Security Council.

“ - and request that the Council immediately enact General Order 65 of the Grand Army of the Republic. For any unfamiliar with this protocol, enacting it would order all G. A. R. units to take the Chancellor into custody using any and all necessary force, at which point overall G. A. R. command will revert to the Security Council or to the successor of the Supreme Chancellor. It is crucial to the survival of the Republic that we do this immediately.”

“/Master Jedi/! The Sith have been gone for over a millennium. We would hear evidence to back this outlandish claim of yours.”

“Certainly, Mr. Chairman. Skywalker, tell the Council what you have learned. Senators, please remember that all of you have already acknowledged Skywalker's credibility in this matter.”

Anakin spoke.

“Yes, Master. We have known for almost fifteen years that the Sith survive. Master Qui-Gon Jin was killed by a Sith Lord, following which his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi was knighted and I was made his apprentice. 

“The Chancellor has just today told me that he possesses knowledge of the dark side of the Force. He also possesses knowledge that only an adept of the dark side would know - the details of the story of Darth Plagueis, for instance. Furthermore, the Chancellor has -”

Both Jedi swayed as they felt a disturbance in the Force. Dark energies exploded outward from some point about them, and the fury of the Chancellor nearly overwhelmed Skywalker. Mental communication came in half-worded idea-forms from the Jedi who had gone to the Chancellor's offices.

“/He knows why we have come! He has engaged us in combat - we are attempting to destroy his office's communications suite - we have already destroyed his personal communicator - he is an expert swordsman - we do not know how long we can hold him off -/”

The line of communication was severed as one of the Jedi Masters died Skywalker was briefly disoriented by feeling the death and seeing it from two other angles; he and Windu shared a brief glance and mentally communicated.

“/The dark energies! They must be him. He knows what we are doing./”

Windu spoke out loud to the Council.

“The Chancellor has just killed one of the Jedi we sent to confirm this. Senators, you must vote now! Call up the security footage from his office's antechambers; you will see we are not lying!”

They felt another master fall before the blade of the Dark Lord of the Sith.

The Senators did as they were told, as the security footage from the Senate building was available on any of the building's networked computers, provided one had the right access codes. Every one of them was astounded, and they all seemed to go into shock.

“B... but... how?”

“The Chancellor?

“A... Sith... Lord...”

Mace Windu spoke, and even the Senators could feel the charged air as the full presence of the leader of the Jedi Council manifested itself in the Force. Anakin Skywalker was all but floored - very rarely in the history of the Jedi had so much raw power been concentrated into one person. Windu's Force aura shone with an intensity Skywalker had never before sensed. The master was truly fit for comparison only to legend: there had been Nomi Sunrider, there had been Revan, and there was now Mace Windu. 

“Senators! A Sith Lord is the head of state of the Republic! You must enact Order 65. You must do it now.”

“Y-yes, Master Jedi,” said the chairman.

“I move that we enact Order 65,” said one member. Almost immediately another voice sounded.

“Seconded.”

“In favor?”, asked the chairman.

A chorus of ‘ayes' sounded.

“Opposed?”

Silence reigned, and the Jedi felt the third master die. Now it was a race against time; either the chairman or the Chancellor would transmit first, and the Republic and the Jedi would live or die based on a difference of a few seconds' time.

“Let it be done!”

The chairman activated the holocommunicator in the Security Council's table and set it to broadcast to all units of the Grand Army of the Republic.

“Senator, preface your order with these two codes,” said Windu, as he and Skywalker entered the command codes they had established with their units scant minutes before.

“I suppose Masters Fisto, Tiin, and Kolar's units will have to wait...”

“Let us hope that their sacrifice was not in vain.”

The chairman gave the order.

“Attention, all G. A. R. units. This is the chairman of the Security Council of the Senate of the Galactic Republic. You are ordered to enact General Order 65, effective immediately. The Supreme Chancellor has been revealed to be a Sith Lord; he is to be approached with extreme caution and overwhelming force. All combat-ready units not currently engaged in battle are recalled immediately to Coruscant, which is hereby placed under lockdown. No ships without military clearance codes are to be allowed to leave Coruscant, and all ships with clearance codes are to be boarded and searched before being allowed to continue. Lethal force is authorized in the enforcement of these measures. Be advised that the Chancellor's personal guard is also to be taken into custody. Security Council out.”

The transmission ended, and moments later the doors opened and several troopers whose armor bore the red decals of Coruscant Security entered. The Jedi's hands moved to their lightsabers. Had the Chancellor beaten the Security Council to the punch?

The leader of the clones spoke.

“Senators, please come with me. This building is no longer safe for noncombatants, especially the council commanding the Grand Army of the Republic. Generals Windu and Skywalker, your presence is requested in the Chancellor's office.”

“Certainly, troopers.”

The Security Council filed out as the Jedi breathed a sigh of relief. They had won. The Security Council had transmitted before the Chancellor. The Republic was saved, but they still had work to do.

The Jedi ran Force-assisted down the halls of the Senate building, leaving the clone troopers in the dust as they approached the offices of the Supreme Chancellor. As they closed in, more and more clone troopers followed them and took up defensive positions outside the doors when they arrived.

The Jedi paused. Purple and blue light shone reflected off of the polished doors as the Jedi ignited their lightsabers.

“Troopers, all friendlies in that office have been killed by the Chancellor. As soon as we open the doors, lay down fire. Skywalker, on three.”

Windu counted down, and the two Jedi blasted in the office doors with the Force. The clones poured forth a withering hail of blaster fire. None of it was reflected.

The Jedi cautiously entered the antechamber. Peering down the hallway to the Chancellor's main office, they felt powerful high-altitude winds sweeping into the office. It soon became apparent that the office's window was shattered, and that the Chancellor was nowhere to be seen.

Windu called to the troopers, who were still in position outside of the office.

“Commander! He seems to be gone! Shut down the sector and begin a search!”

“Yes, sir! Men! First squad,  search the Chancellor's suite! Second squad, with me! Let's move!”

**********

A few hours later, the clone troopers in the Outer Rim noticed an interesting phenomenon. The Separatist droids, which had previously behaved much as humans did, with all of their characteristic cognitive inefficiencies, suddenly stopped. The droids became unconcerned with individual survival; they no longer prioritized surviving over killing a clone trooper.  They networked, and command processing became decentralized and gained access to much more computing power. They stopped displaying human cognitive biases and became vastly more efficient processors of information. They, by and large, stopped missing their targets when they shot. In short, they became efficient and /hostile/ artificial general intelligences.

The Outer Rim sieges were over in a matter of days. The forces of the Republic were driven corewards in a slaughter the likes of which the galaxy had not seen for millennia. And the droids just kept coming; after all, it took at most a few days to manufacture and program them. The destruction of a droid meant only the loss of its hardware and some small amount of processing power, while the death of a clone meant the loss of years of training and expertise.

Unbeknownst to the Republic, Darth Sidious had declared the New Order in what had been Separatist space. The Sith Lord had been playing both sides of the war and thus had limited the might of both. But now the Republic was his no longer, and the Emperor was playing to win... 


** This is good as a “if they did everything definitively right” ratfic, with the weight of it resting on the punch at the end of them still losing because everybody in the situation gets to act rationally, and Sidious is in a very advantageous material position.

That said, the way Mace Windu perfectly navigates around the pitfall of Order 66 makes it feel almost more like a Peggy Sue fixfic than a ratfic. IMO a central pillar of ratfic is that characters doing their best are capable of being wrong for a variety of reasons, usually including bad prioritization, limited information, and personal blind spots. But Mace here lasers in on the one problem we, the readers, know to be central, but that he probably wouldn't focus on to such an extent without that privileged knowledge. Maybe I'm the only one getting that feeling?

It might just be the prequels not being rational causing this problem, because of course if Mace Windu is competent enough to adroitly avoid his final mistakes in the series, all of the earlier ones he made suddenly require more explanation than “the Jedi are a failing and corrupt institution blinded by dogma.”

It is especially notable because Order 66 can only be triggered by the Supreme Chancellor. Given that Palpatine is a Sith Lord obviously working against the Jedi who is Supreme Chancellor, Order 66 would completely cripple the Jedi and it would be reasonable to expect him to use it.

If I was preparing in case of an improper use of Order 66, I would already plan to shut down communications to prevent the order being received. There isnt another real counter to it aside from Order 65 which was also done.

They know the entire Clone Army is based on the personal bodyguard/hitman of Dooku who knows the location of the separatist secret base in the second movie. That alone is suspicious as all hell.

in the show they then figure out that Dooku is also the sith, Darth Tyranus, and that he worked with Sifo-Dyas, the man who commissioned the army. Once you have all these pieces, it becomes directly obvious that the sith are controlling both sides of the war.

According to the novelization of episode 3, Mace suspected Mas Amedda, the speaker of the Senate, of being the other sith lord. Even with that he doesn't have the control that Palpatine had. And without Order 66, it is unclear what the endgame is.

An alternate theory can be that the Sith are undermining the Republic for the separatists backed by the Sith to win akin to the old Sith empires.

Aside from Dooku giving the entire game away in episode II before the noir mystery movie becomes a gladiator/war movie for no reason, there are a ludicrous amount of hints around that the entire war is built on a sham and that Palpatine is deeply involved.

My personal headcanon of the entire Star Wars saga is that Palpatine had this really careful plan in episode 1 but then everything went to shit and yet he managed to get ahead even faster than planned. He starts doing dumber and dumber plans, giving him more and more outrageous victories. Finally he gets the Empire despite his own sabotage, causing his mind to snap. After years of rule he has toned down the crazy plans and gotten more serious, which proves to be his downfall. He rebuilds in secret and makes the dumbest plan possible now that he has proof that those always work, what he doesn't know is that this ability is genetic and he dies to Rey.

The main explanation I see for at least the short term is sabotage by Palpatine to keep the Republic from using droids just in case.

It probably wasn't practical before. As recently as The Phantom Menace, an army of battle droids required a huge command ship in orbit in order to make them effective. And, far from being "vastly superior" at that point, many of them were laid low by the comic relief of one clumsy Gungan.

In addition, rebellion was probably easier to put down when there was more coherence to the Republic. It sounds like the normal plan would be to levy various Republic worlds for troops to raise a Grand Army of the Republic if a war became necessary. By the time of the prequels, the Republic was already starting to succumb to corruption and fragmentation; a call to raise an army probably wouldn't have been heeded, and the secession might have happened without a fight.

But, yes, I would think that supplementing the clone army with droids is probably a necessary step towards victory in the scenario above. Not that the Republic should ever have been relying on a slave army in the first place.

***** I was speaking more of these newer capabilities with the networked killing machines. Something like that should have been doable beforehand. Although I suppose the central republic strength makes it not viable without vast investment and organization that could compare to the Republic itself without a clear benefit.

I suppose the Sith lying low may have held these droid armies back as they saved up these capabilities for when they were truly ready.

** I love how you explained all the quirks of the Droid being purposefully programmed to make human errors. Really seals up a questionable part of the canon for me.

Does anyone happen to have the link to that short story where the Jedi apprentice realizes the force has its own nebulous goals and then they are killed by Order 66?

** Love it - that the whole prequel required the Jedi order to never let go of the Idiot Ball was what drove me nuts about the series, especially the 3rd one.

When the curtain closed my final reaction was WTF - a 10,000 year old order of psychics don't teach "self fulfilling prophecy 101" as a required course? It was like whatever your head cannon, or fanfic was back in the 80s when you first saw the movies was for why Vader Fell... even if you were 8 at the time... that was better.

Is there support for droids networking? It always seemed odd that they were not all built with pre-installed wireless communicators (at least post Cell Phone it does) but it seemed a Star Wars Thing... Droids have always been a little problematic if you start thinking about them... apparently sentient, yet enslaved - act/interact like high skill people not computers. Maybe Star Wars had it's own Near Singularity event in the past and there are some absolutes droid rules now?

*** The droids in the TPM are controlled remotely by the Trade Federation ship in orbit of Naboo - granted, that isn't decentralized command processing, but it does require installed receivers and transmitters, and given high-bandwidth communication, it's not that big of a leap to imagine that the droids would have some degree of decentralized command and control.

*** Yeah I had always assumed there was some sort of cultural tabboo against empowering or arming droids due to a previous uprising.

** That ending... of course Palpatine would have yet another backup plan. Actually, canon kind of feels like Palpatine's already diverted from him main plan and improvised or used a backup plan several times. In the episode 1, I don't think he actually anticipated Padme getting that far. Likewise, the complicated hire a bounty hunter to hire a bounty hunter to lure the Jedi to get them to the clone army feels a bit convoluted to be the main original plan. Or maybe I am trying to hard to rationalize a nonsensical villain plan that worked because plot...

** Ha! Nice twist at the end, this galaxy might end up WORSE than the one we know, in spite of all. It would be a nice premise for a longfic, in fact. Though I wonder in what ways precisely can the Dark Side enhance the originally poor droids.

BTW this made me think of something relatively similar I'm writing in another story - more crackfic than ratfic, and with a later divergence point, but same considerations about the arrest of the Chancellor:

  "...and so here I am. You see why at this point there's no turning back for me. But if we can defeat Palpatine, at least-"

  "Now, you're rushing things," Padmé raised a hand, tapping the side of her cheek with one finger of the other in a thoughtful attitude. "Your situation isn't that bad, honestly."

  "Not that bad? Padmé, I was an accomplice in killing a Master from the Jedi Council!"

  "Anakin, honey, I'm a politician. People have gotten away with worse. Now, if you had also killed the children, that would have been tricky."

  "Sure, but-"

  "Look, from what you tell me, Master Windu was trying to perform an extrajudicial killing - he did not get a warrant or anything to carry out his little citizen's arrest, and the Chancellor has political immunity. You may even have done the right thing!"

  "Really?"

  "Sure. I'm telling you, if he had succeeded, he'd be in a lot of trouble right now. In theory, there's a rule that says Siths are exclusive Jedi jurisdiction, but there was no need of it for thousands of years, as most Siths these days are enemy combatants anyway, and there were no independent witnesses to certify that Master Windu didn't just kill a frightened old man and stick a red lightsaber in his dead hand. From anyone else's viewpoint it would have been just a plain old military coup."

  "I see. I did the right thing," Anakin's face brightened. "Huh, I guess the Republic does work, sometimes!"

  "Except for the part where we missed the Chancellor being an evil overlord and now he's just pulled a coup and is about to take over," said Padmé, shrugging. "We should do something about that."

**** Indeed, the Star Wars non-film material was filled with better writers trying to make the things George Lucas put on the screen make more sense. Like Stormtrooper armor appearing to be completely ineffective against the blasters used by Han Solo and various other Rebels. (If I were writing a justification, I'd say that the armor provides just enough protection to turn otherwise lethal shots into incapacitating ones, letting the armored trooper live to fight another day after being shot.)
