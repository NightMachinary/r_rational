*tl;dr: It was a graveyard smash!*

*actual tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the weekly challenge, post recommendations, ideas, or comments below.*

The wiki page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_Film_Productions#The_birth_of_Hammer_Horror_.281955.E2.80.9359.29][Hammer Films]] is actually a pretty good read, if only for how it provides a reflection on modern day criticisms of films as consisting of endless sequels and appropriations of source materials. Hammer was doing all that way before it became cool.

These days the horror icon tropes have been tread and retread so many times that it's hard to find new ground - and when that new ground is found, it gets run down really quickly as people attempt to jump on the bandwagon. In part, the classic horror icons suffer from being in the public domain, meaning that anyone can make their own derivative work and sell it however they want, which sometimes ends up in a tragedy of the commons type situation. There's a limit to the number of vampire movies/books that are viable at any given time, since eventually people will start saying "meh". Yet once something is firmly in the public consciousness, you can save a lot by reusing it; the specifics still need to be gone over, but everyone understands in the general sense what a vampire is.


** A challenge I'm looking forward to reading. Might I suggest A Night in the Lonesome October as an amazing short story and best example of Monster Mash I have ever read?

** I'd like to thank everybody (especially [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]) for participating in the writing challenge. I've had arresting anxiety over sharing fiction with others for years and years, and I got some upvotes without any strange personal nightmares coming true. I think it's the coolest thing we could use [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for. :)

** I'm planning to start a Worm fanfic sometime soon. Would the first chapter of that work for the next challenge?

*** Zombies are fine; they show up in many traditional monster mashes.(e.g. the zombie bellhops in /Hotel Transylvania/).

** Can I enter my 50,000 word supernatural romance novel in this one?

... I'm kidding!

But I might enter something I have lying around that's written in the same urban fantasy universe. I probably have /something/ interesting.

Previous work looks OK according to the rules so I might try and rustle something up!
