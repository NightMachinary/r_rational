*** The +1 Basement gem is a very effective force multiplier, in that it takes the entire suite of green gem effects applied to a building and says "These effects now also apply to /this additional space large enough to house a family/". You can't stack an infinite number of basements onto a fully greened location without running into access issues, but it's still pretty strong.

You do, however, still need a whole curated host of other green gems to meet the rest of Maslow's hierarchy of needs before you start a basement chain. The "+1 Nutrient per meal" gem will probably end up one of those. Put twenty or thirty of those into a space and people can live off of mashed-up cardboard. Then once you've got that suite, you need to copy it out to enough multi-basemented buildings to handle the population of a city. Which becomes a scaling issue---the general stumbling block for the Order in all its current attempts at world-shaking.

**** "We can do amazing things, but we can't do them for a billion people at once" is kind of the mantra for this entire book, honestly.

**** One fundamental issue in the hospitality industry for multi-floor hotels are elevators as fixed inputs. I imagine you'd run into the same issue pretty immediately with an infinite basement arcology.

***** I did mention access issues. But some of that could be averted with a "-2 min elevator travel time" or "+1 elevator car per shaft" orb that breaks physics to allow greater throughput on the bottlenecks.
