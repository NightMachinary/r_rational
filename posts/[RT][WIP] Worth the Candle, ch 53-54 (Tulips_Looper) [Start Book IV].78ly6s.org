** Fenn fears bond girl syndrome. Well, that is terrifying. Tough, there is also the hilariously meta commentary that Fenn is more popular than Juniper. Which, yes. I like her better.

Potential solves for the Bond Girl syndrome a: Marry her. Asap. Arthurs wife lived, so this might be a workable solve. b: Polyamory! The reason bond girl syndrome exists is that few writers are capable of writing compelling narratives about people in stable relationships. But you can have endless romantic complications if you ditch monogamy without having to kill off any of the participants. c: A /and/ B.

Problem is, of course, I cant really see Juniper think of any of those solution spaces.

Flower Magic: Uhm.. Well, its possible that Arthurs Merlin just rode the power curve of the companion bond way past the inherent limits of flower magic. But that does not mean there is no in-universe explanation. - I am, for example, expecting Fenns scars to magically regain functionality as the power of Juniper increases - , but most of the ways I can think of to cheese a bond with a flower you are not tending, should have been tried hundreds of times in the years since his passing.

But Utilitarian Princess Amaryllis probably will. I can see her trying to seduce either of them (likely Fenn) or encouraging other party members to do so once their relationship hits its stride in order to generate drama in a controlled manner and keep Narrative from fucking it up.

This didn't help in /On Her Majesty's Secret Service/. Weddings make a great stage for a tragedy.

Another solution might be punctuated romance. They come together, but then go their separate ways for a period. Both face their own challenges and when they meet it's new once more. On-again/Off-again romances like that can be strung out indefinitely.

*** Companion bond improved Flower Magic is a good theory. I was already thinking Uther's game layer abilities might have made it possible. Joon overlooking that it wasn't Uther but Vervain with the ability doesn't seem out of character.

My other guess would be that Vervain had an eidetic memory, which allowed for a greater number of connections. Alongside being naturally talented (likely as a companion character), it seems a rare enough ability to be plausible. I just don't think it's true because it would be an almost /unsatisfying/ answer.

** I'm sincerely impressed by the level of immersion you manage with this story, and the tangibility, credibility of the characters. You're actually dropping meta-commentaries, and having the characters litterally discuss the narrative and dissect it on screen, yet when I start reading I almost immediately forget it's a story and fabricated characters and not actual human beings trapped in a convoluted, but real, universe. It's even more astounding as my own thoughts and sentiments in fact echo those of Juniper, dream skewered and questioning the very existence of his companions, and still unable to not feel strong, real emotions toward them.

So, for this, hats off to you, and my deep thanks for such a captivating fantasy!

With that said, I'd like to complain that Amaryllis is getting the short hand of the stick, at least currently, and I find this deeply unfair. And I think Joon should too, but let's say it's the MEN affliction caused by hormones.

So while Fenn is naturally suave and playful and emotionally quite balanced (despite shitty early life, shitty boyfriends, etc.), Mary proved to be almost totally emotionally impaired (whatever the cause, for sure being an object of power and royalty didn't help). And maybe for the wrong reasons, she decided to warm up to the perspectives of a personal, intimate relationship, which I imagine most frightening when you've spent your whole life carefully, coldly avoiding that precisely. And there it is, of course, she made a real effort to change, she actually did and now it's all for nothing, or for worse even. The all important hero at the receiving end of her brand new, cumbersome feelings decided to ditch her for a flirtatious, attention craving thief, absolutely unappreciative of her development as a better person.

Note I have nothing against flirtatious thieves, it's just to underline the biting irony of it.

In short... Shit, I feel sad for Mary... It's like the only thing that could make her feel lonelier, with a little bit of crushed hope on top.

** No one is safe from the game's ever-present need to heighten drama and excitement. I've no doubt that Juniper's Fenn/Mary love-triangle has been carefully calibrated to produce maximum drama for the foreseeable future. And if that well of drama ever runs dry, well, kill someone off and bring in a new love interest.

If I was Juniper I'd seriously consider putting points in social skills for the sole purpose of navigating the rapidly increasingly complex social situation he's in.

"Of course", Amaryllis said. "The hexagon is the perfect shape. That's why the sun is shaped like a hexagon. Or a woman's breasts".

"Uuuuhh..." was all I managed in response.

Frowning at my confusion, Amaryllis continued, "Would you like to see them?"

 

Drenched in cold sweat, I woke up. Amaryllis was kneeling beside me.\\
"It's your turn to keep watch", she whispered. "Rough night?"

"I'm fine", I muttered, getting to my feet. The sky was now clear of clouds and covered with multicolored stars and... "Celestar", I breathed. Immaculately white and covered in geometric lines, the hexagonal moon shone brightly above me.

  But perhaps the strangest thing about female spotted hyenas is their reproductive anatomy. Internally, there's not much to set them apart from other mammals. But to say that their external genitals are far-out is to put it mildly.

  The clitoris is enormously elongated to form this fully erectile pseudopenis through which they urinate, copulate and give birth," says Holekamp. This is a sentence she has clearly delivered before because she fires this volley of explicit words at me in less than 8 seconds: I timed it. "It's the only female mammal that has no external vaginal opening," she adds, just to confuse me further. "That is something that is totally unique"

In my defense, dwarves being that far from baseline humans is what brought this to mind (iirc birds/reptiles/amphibians & platypodes have cloaca?), and this is another mammal species!

  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

Now wait just a druid damning second... is her garden her safe space for epistemological ruminations? Little bit of Socratic doubt me-time when she's had it with all the Kumbaya mumbo jumbo?

The narrative theory seems unfortunately credible. Are there ways Joon can hack the narrativium?

If we take the theory in light of the game's framework as a video game slash DND session, it would give Joon a dramatic (in the sense of drama) advantage.

More meta than I expected. I like it. (though this is just a theory at this point, of course, which I also like)

In fact, I like everyone's reactions at their romance, from Grak's grumpiness to Solace's sincere happiness/amusement. Even the locus seems to approve, though you can never tell for sure what that doe really is thinking.

It strongly focused on NPCs and kinda explored some of the implications of partying adventurers roaming around an doing whatever they wanted in an otherwise stable universe.

Incidentally, I have a happy canon in my mind in which Dave is actually speaking tongue-in-cheek, having actually read the module cover-to-cover before, and actively knows about the bartender's trouble-avoidance and is faithfully (and/or out of amusement) not giving hints to the players about who's behind the door if broken open.)

**** I didn't give full thought to it but if someone was a Herald, it could happen in a number of ways. For example, if the party is attacked by a group of townspeople while walking through the forest, it would be because a Herald went out and gathered them and then brought them to the party's location. Or if the party entered a town and were immediately greeted by townspeople with a welcoming feast or something oddly specific and out of character, it could be the result of a Herald.

Heralds are dangerous because the Signs don't immediately follow them. A Herald can be in a town and it will still look completely normal for a while.

** I like the 'loops' a lot! For us as readers, a more satisfying (than the non-meta ground-level threats) and more concrete (than the hovering strangeness of the Juniper-specific System) antagonist to be resisted.

The underlying question of 'Juniper-because-of-Arthur aside, /why/ Arthur, specifically?' still bothers me, but other than that it's really fun to effectively have characters within a narrative--an eternally cycling narrative!--trying to work out what to do with it. Especially this form, rather than a character wrestling with a beginning->middle->end narrative structure, I don't think I've come across before. ...Presumably upon death, there would be more cycles in that Hell... upon true death, maybe yanking someone new in? Hoping of course that the yanking here was from Arthur sticking a wrench in the gears. ...hmm, presumably even if the entirety of known reality were put under the protagonist's control, a new threat could come from a different 'universe', the scale expanding again and again (fractally) like the different books of Desolate Era...

It would have been convenient if the genre of the cycle/story could be guidedly shifted, the peace of one's domain protected through cycles of romantic conflict or the peace of one's marriage protected through cycles of army-based war. Unfortunately, doesn't sound like the case, though the nice teaser hints that perhaps one relationship could be protected by cycling through others in parallel.

Before I forget, it was fun to think of Hikaru Genji in those terms, unable to have a peaceful happy life with one woman and instead doomed to repeating cycles of chase and acquisition.

I groaned at first at the 'don't be a hero' relationship flag, but now it sounds like an intriguing instance of forced-cycling, relationship conflict (to disrupt a potentially happy, stable resolution) demanded by the narrative engine. Of course, if there's anything like that then Juniper is going to be horrified in the next chapter at the level of direct mind-control the System blatently displays (towards one's loved ones, of all people). Then again, maybe I could be misreading this and it's to do with death or other suffering from external threats, instead. (In which case I would be back to groaning straightforwardly at the aforementioned relationship flag immediately after attained potential happy stability.)
