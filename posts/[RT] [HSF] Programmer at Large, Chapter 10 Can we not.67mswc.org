If you think that having a story where the main characters are non-binary is pushing a non-binary agenda, I invite you to consider what a story where the main characters are male does.

You don't see the plot constantly remind the audience that the main character of /insert random book/ is a straight male/female constantly do you? Nor do you see the author running around reminding everyone not to interpret their character differently than they pictured.

On the other hand you are as of this chapter making it an interesting plot point instead of a meaningless one and it seems ripe for some sci-fi shenanigans. So I guess I'll just have to keep reading and see where you go with it and maybe you had more in mind than just trying to convince the readers that normal genders are wrong.

Being male keeps getting brought up in the plot of a lot of books too, it's just that you don't notice because that's just what you expect the background to look like.

******** The gender of characters gets brought up a lot in genres where there's a lot of inter-gender interactions, like in romances.

Gender is almost never brought up in genres where there isn't, like in historical military fiction.

That's not to say gender is /irrelevant/ to such genres; the social mores of characters in such genre works are heavily informed by their gender roles. But, since there's nothing to compare to, the characters themselves don't /notice/ this.

Becoming consciously aware of gender role-scripts in an all-male army on the march, would look about the same as [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/tax-the-tall.html][Robin Hanson becoming consciously aware of the fact that tall people have social advantages and that nobody cares.]] It's something that leaves everyone a bit baffled and/or miffed, because even when staring straight at the thing you're staring at, they /still/ can't differentiate it from the background---still can't see what's worth calling attention to in the direction you're pointing.

And I have a feeling that what people are feeling and calling you out on, here, is that---in a culture where everyone is the same /non-/gender---the resulting social landscape would be a lot more similar to the second example (stories where everyone is the same gender) than the first (stories where everyone is split along gender lines.) Just like in an all-male world, it'd be very hard in an all-non-binary world to /notice/ gender role-scripts.

I don't really understand this complaint is coming from. The resulting social landscape /does/ look like that. Every single instance of gender coming up in the story has been through the interactions of the crew with a gendered culture - either in universe, or implicitly through the readers.

Here are the places gender has come up in the story:

- the translation convention is that pronouns for the crew are they (a thing which is only obvious to readers and is completely unremarked upon by the crew)
- there is a popular TV show (of sorts) that the crew watch that comes from a gendered culture
- the protagonist has talked about it with someone who picked up the idea of gender specifically from their interactions with a gendered culture. They picked up on this because the person in question was very strongly non-conforming to the typical crew appearance. Missing that isn't like not noticing that tall people have an advantage, it's like not being able to notice that someone is tall.

********** These things are true, yes---I'm not denying that you're Doing It Right for the most part. My argument wasn't /exactly/ an apologia for the stance other people are taking that there's too much notice of gender /generally/; you addressed that to my own satisfaction in your FAQ post.

Rather, I think my complaint boils down to this: the /protagonist/ shouldn't be able to "obsess over" systems problems related to gender and sexuality as "naturally" as they're doing in the latest chapter. Noticing that something is strange about the world is rational; but noticing that something is strange about the world when /nobody else notices/, and when there aren't even words available in this society to use to refer to the /axis/ along which the thing is strange---it's a really hard thing to do. So I'm feeling like it's a bit implausible that this protagonist should be the one to be suddenly capable of noticing. Why should /this/ character, at this moment in the society's timeline, be the one to notice the sleeping social knot?

I mean, sure, your protagonist might be (presumably) on the autistic spectrum with a consciously-acquired social awareness. And sure, they look for bugs in systems nobody asked them to debug for a living. But that doesn't mean that they'll /notice/ a bug in a system they not only don't interact with, but don't understand the functioning of well-enough to distinguish intended behavior from malfunction.

To put it another way: I'd expect the protagonist of /this/ story---this conflict---to have pre-existing /beliefs/ about gender and sexuality. I would expect that the plot will then result in a /change/ to these beliefs, with the particular change---and what it was in response to---conveying a theme. But right now, your protagonist has a starting condition where they have /no/ beliefs about the system; whatever beliefs they /acquire/ will "go down easy", rather than being resisted, so the dramatic arc will fall flat.

If I were going to make up a character to exist in this setting and have this conflict happen to them, I would likely choose one who had, in the past, experienced either gender dysphoria or sexual urges, and then had their society respond to that experience in a way that left them with "incorrect" starting beliefs, so that the conflict could inspire a change in these beliefs. I could fully believe that such a character would /notice/ the flaw in the "human system", because they would've been touched by that human system.

It's also possible that having a sexually active counterculture is a long-term profitable thing compared to the social losses, especially if that also goes with a more nuanced approach to gender than "what's that?" Ambassadors to grounder cultures with heavy gender biases, for example, or a back-up of sexually active adults to keep a trade ship from dying out in a generation due to the artificial wombs failing, a crash landing, or something similar.

It's not that I'm ignoring this, it's that /whoever designed their system/ was ignoring this. (Or, presumably, the entire thing is just a tool of social oppression, but I'm willing to be charitable enough to not immediately conclude this.)

With a fuzzy, graded system, possibly discretized with random triggers, it /won't matter/ that people have access to the metrics, because there's no threshold to avoid.

This whole thing seems like it was designed by very old school programmers, who think in terms of discrete, deterministic events and flags. This /barely/ ¹ works for an unthinking adversary like a ship engine; it fundamentally /does not/ work for a human society for exactly the reason you describe.

Istm the system you want is not an alert system, but a priority queue of concerns. That solves both the spam issue and the threshold problem.

¹If you take action whenever a threshold is crossed, you're gonna end up with systems that barely avoid butting up against the threshold in normal operation. (Because otherwise you'd take action and fix it.) That is not a good place to be /even for machines/.

This is basically true. The system is designed more by way of a form of self-awareness for the ship society - it's there to go "Hey, this is a thing you should be aware of that you might not have noticed". It's not designed to be adversary resistant, because the crew are largely presupposed to be on the same side and social problems are presupposed to not be deliberately created.

There are also special circumstances here that will be made clear later.

I'm not sure it's possible to distinguish a sufficiently heavily designed society from a tool of social oppression.

  - Overestimating the difficulty of fooling neural networks
#+end_quote

I seem to recall an article about how a neural network classifier can be seen as drawing a boundary through a many-dimensional space (as many dimensions as it has inputs).

It went on to say that, contrary to hopes/expectations, those boundaries being so complex and convoluted meant that there would be a great deal of points that were very close to the boundary on at least one out of the many possible choices of axis, so a fairly minor movement along that axis could move you from one side of the boundary to the other.

So fooling such a classifier into a mistake would be a matter of picking the right input to change slightly, so as to twitch its analysis across the boundary, which was suggested to be more or less /always/ possible, at least if the classifier is sufficiently complex to be useful.

******* A hivemind would be much more fun, wouldn't it? On the subject of they/them/their as gender-neutral singular pronouns, though...

It's true that using "they" in a gender-neutral singular sense is common, and goes back hundreds of years. But I find that these usages are pretty much invariably in contexts where the referent is unspecified, or somehow non-instantiated (e.g., in "each congressperson gathered their staff," "their" is clearly singular, but it does not refer to any specific congressperson) or else where the speaker is mimicking this usage to avoid giving information away (e.g., a teenager telling their parents "My friend is coming over; I'm going to study with them in my bedroom" attracts less suspicion than if they used a pronoun that revealed their friend was of the opposite sex).

As far as I can tell, historical precedent doesn't really justify using they/them/their for referring to specific, named, individuals who are known to both parties. In fact, the established usage pattern has always lent they-as-gender-neutral-singular a certain concealing quality to me. That is, even when I'm not confused by the plurality, it never feels like it's referring to a person who possesses themselves some real manner of gender-neutrality. Rather it seems to be a polite way of having a non-gender-specifying conversation about a person who, by implication, has a definite masculine or feminine gender. I doubt this is the intent or desired subtext of people who use gender-neutral pronouns (or of those who which to be referred to by them), which is why I prefer ke/xe/ze/sie/whatever else people use these days. Neologisms imply many things about the speaker, but smuggle in a lot less about the referent than "they" does.

That said, inventing new words for such a central part of English does feel a bit like steamrolling over the language. I expect most people who choose "they" do so because it seems to be the least-radical alteration of language use, which is... probably true, and a commendable rationale. So on that basis, I can accept and respect the choice of "they", even though I think it's not the best option.

*** u/DRMacIver:

  at some points it feels almost like an "The SJWs won"
#+end_quote

It's definitely not intended as that.

(Though I will say our politics differ here and leave it at that)

#+begin_quote
  this doesn't get preachy later in the story.
#+end_quote

I've no intention to make it any preachier than it's been to date.

#+begin_quote
  Thanks for writing. Can't wait to see where this goes!
#+end_quote

Thanks, glad you're enjoying it.

*** It's the author's bias coming through. Arthur is female but doesn't identify as female because they live in the dystopian SJW society you just coined and Arthur was never taught that concepts like female or male exist.

What I'm really excited about here is that apparently our author is about to give Arthur a rude awakening into gender politics from the anti-SJW rebellion. Although that will probably get quashed because the author is on the side of the SJW society so I'm not sure how things will play out.
