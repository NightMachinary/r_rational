Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm looking for a work of fiction that explores what happens when half the population disappears in some supernatural way (e.g. a Rapture type scenario). Ideally the focus would be on the logistical, political, or economic aspects, rather than being a meditation on loss or about personal stories.

Similarly, and I doubt this exists on the scale that I would want, I'd like a story about those people coming back years later, all at once.

("Global phenomena happens" is one of my favorite scifi genres, but it's very often just about the individuals with little pagespace given over to the larger questions of how governments, media, etc. deal with these kinds of things, other than some vague allusions.)

*** Funny you should mention that...

Can you wait like, one more week?

E: A more serious answer- this is actually partially what I'm exploring in the story I'm working on right now. Though the time scale is such that the logistics and politics probably won't enter into the picture until like, the second year's worth of stuff. In the short term, a lot of people disappearing is probably the most survivable type of apocalypse (depending on /why/ of course). Infrastructure is still in place, but your population is vastly reduced, so you aren't in /immediate/ danger unless you depend on services (gas, in-home care, etc) that might not be available to you. I imagine that the mid to long term effects would largely resemble the aftermath of a severe war or great plague- a gradual contraction and period of social reshuffling followed by an enormous uptick in births. If anything, the overall effects re/inertia in societal change and impacts on global climate would probably be extremely healthy for humanity as a species. Pretty unfortunate about the half that has to go, though.

***** actually that would be pretty interesting. You have the earth split and you follow both timelines (slightly different things happens, like the president survives in one and not in the other and other such things, which maybe have cascading effects so they look very different in 5 years).

Then after they've both adapted... merge them back together again!

*** I'm told Michael Grant's /Gone/ is about very similar themes? It's about a small city that gets surrounded in a forcefield, and everyone in it who's above a certain age disappears.

On the other hand, it's meant for kids, so I don't know deep the writing will be. On the gripping hand, it's by the same couple who managed to sell a war story about shape-shifting teens fighting mind-control aliens to 10-12 years olds, so who knows.

*** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347397.The_Disappearance][The Disappearance]] by Philip Wylie. Maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but half the population disappears (twice!).

From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wylie][wikipedia]]:

#+begin_quote
  He applied engineering principles and the scientific method quite broadly in his work. His novel The Disappearance (1951) is about what happens when everyone suddenly finds that all members of the opposite sex are missing (all the men have to get along without women, and vice versa). The book delves into the double standards between men and women that existed prior the woman's movement of the 1970s, exploring the nature of the relationship between men and women and the issues of women's rights and homosexuality.

  (...) Some people have accused Generation of Vipers of being misogynistic. The Disappearance shows his thinking on the subject is very complex.

There is no obvious threat or reason that he can come up with for why this is happening to him. It's very reminiscent of /Groundhog Day/ where the protagonist is taking the time to grow and develop as a person.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] [Harry Potter] - Hermione and Snape are stuck in a day-long time loop where Hermione is fated to die at the end of the day no matter what.

Doubly so, in light of the fact that those actions induced a Trigger Event. The Protectorate was quite eager to score points with me by sacrificing you." I met her eyes; my power told me where they were, despite the mask. "But I plead your case, on the condition that you be watched more closely. You're scum, but your power is useful, and if I'm being honest I'm rather grateful that a cape was involved--the academic literature suggests that that's what made me a partial Trump.

Look at Mother of Learning as an example. Before it was added to royalroad the story had basically zero find-ability unless you already knew what you were looking for. Yet it had a huge fanbase.

As both a reader and a (sort of) author I'd recommend that you just focus on writing the story. If you can output consistently and often that will be enough of an advertisement.

I've never really thought of it as a rational story, so I've never posted it around here. The main character isn't stupid, but he definitely isn't a genius either. The world is only slowly becoming internally consistent as I write more. I make up limitations on myself as I go.

The MC gains 'perks' based on how they've lived their past lives. I've never really had the MC munchkin the perk system.

I do avoid Deus Ex Machina when it comes to saving my MC's life. Reincarnating is part of the story, so if he gets into an unwinnable situation he tends to either die or successfully run away.

** I was wondering whether anyone would have any recommendations for me? I have read and liked (in probable order of my favorites):\\
1. A Practical Guide to Evil\\
2. Worth the Candle\\
3. Mother of Learning\\
4. Worm\\
5. KR web novels (generally monster invasion with self-insert, wish-fulfillment edgy MC)\\
6. CN web novels (ultra generic xianxia stories that hit all the tropes)

I really like the greater meta-ness and characterization of APGTE and WTC over MOL, although MOL is still great. Worm was my first web novel, so it was mindblowing to me at the time, and I enjoyed the different tropes in KR web novels over those of CN web novels.

Would you guys have any recommendations for me?

*** The KR web novels I'm really into right now are The Novel's Extra (cool premise and I like the MC), and Solo Leveling (also called Only I Level Up, it's both a web novel and comic with AWESOME art). If you want a somewhat meta and funny xianxia-esque story try The Dao of Magic. If you want good xianxia without the shitty CN tropes, try the Cradle series by Will Wight. Other enjoyable webnovels include Metaworld Chronicles (awesome worldbuilding and cool magic system) and Savage Divinity (really funny at times, depressing at others, and good character development).

If you want to go to a different medium, some good anime's are Mob Psycho 100 (there are 2 seasons, it has great art, and is really unexpectedly wholesome), Now and Then, Here and There (fucking brutally sad but really good), One Punch Man (good art and action and funny), Psycho Pass (good psychological thriller), From the New World (aka Shin Sekai Yori, really good, pretty sad, explores post apocalyptic world after a certain percentage of people get psychic powers), Seto no hanayome (my pick for funniest anime of all time), Attack on Titan (everyone has heard of this, great action and art).

None of these are rational per se, but enjoyable reads.

Edit: Although Solo Leveling has fantastic art in the manhua, the story itself seems to be pretty meh. It seems like your stereotypical edgy OP MC who saves the world and gets praised a lot for it. Fun and enjoyable to read/watch like junk food, but not really in the same vein as APGTE/WTC/MOL imo.

Another few I forgot to recommend are With This Ring (a DC Comics, specifically Young Justice fanfic about a guy from normal earth suddenly appearing there with an orange power ring. It's pretty good and there is a LOT of it.) Also Dungeon Keeper Ami, a really good Sailor Moon fanfic (I know, but trust me, it's good). It updates very slowly now. A good rational story is A Hero's War, but it updates very slowly now as well.

***** So like finding the intricacies of the game? I mean stellaris still does that even if the random events are totally just flavor text for different flavors of resource. To be blunt the exploration is functionally for the finding of more resources. if anything the 4x genre is really good with reducing literally everything down into numbers and different numbers uhh.

​

Can you explain what you're looking for in more detail, like what would you describe is a good example of what you're trying to find? cause like i can't honestly think of anything that isn't just resources under a flavor text heading within the larger constraints of the finding certain resources to make certain things to eventually win with. Like within the constraints of most 4x games there is a limited amount of map to discover, and generally little besides the random or predetermined resource plots, to the point that the exploration is kinda within a bounded range if you know what i mean? like there isn't a lot of predetermined story telling or really anything besides the different land masses and resources?

- I personally haven't tried it, but my understanding of EVE is that there's a lot of conceptually 4X-themed things in it but it plays very differently because you control a single entity rather than order a bunch of mass-produced units. Maybe that could be interesting to you?
- As my first bullet point might suggest, I'm wondering if other game types could interest you outside of RTS and 4X. Roguelikes can often offer (replayable!) exploration, for instance. RPGs may offer a large amount of novel content to find. Open-world building games like Minecraft or Terraria also offer a large amount of space to explore and recipes to learn or gear to upgrade.

I /really/ don't like the way EVE does permanent asset loss. I've played that sort of game before, and having months of time and effort evaporate because you had the bad luck to be in a convenient spot for some asshole to fuck you over is infuriating.

I don't usually like roguelikes for reasons similar to above, though at least here it's usually only a few hours and my own mistakes.

**** Regarding exploration? Well, Fallout 3 is probably my favorite in that regard, though having interesting places to go is kind of a requirement for most good open world games.

The 4x games that hit the closest are Civ5 and X3. In both cases I think it comes from seeing how the various NPC factions have set up. So... maybe what I'm looking for is less, like, pretty scenery and more coming upon and observation of interesting interaction of systems. Which, come to think of it, kinda applies to Fallout 3's AI too.

They are pure popcorn literature - Mary Sue OP protagonist, wish fulfillment, action heavy, highly repetitive, and honestly not terribly rational.

But, they scratch a very nice itch for mutchkining a random piece science without going too deep into things (which almost always bogs down a story for me).

Funny enough, that book and The Living Dead were the reason I specifically asked for anything but short stories. When they came out, most of the short stories were professionally written but it was easy to tell that the authors were forced to adhere to the editors standards. That usually led to abrupt or unsatisfying endings, with the concepts just interesting enough to look into more of their work.
