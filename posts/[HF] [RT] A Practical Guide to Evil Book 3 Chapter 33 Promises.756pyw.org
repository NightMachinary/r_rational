*** I want to think that she can get through the legion ranks so easy thanks the hooks she have in every official mind, other wise she is on the same level of scribe and assassin.

**** Maybe, but she was originally a concubine. Maybe she has an Aspect that causes people to overlook her.

** This chapter needed to happen.

I like malicia being very clear that she didn't want to build a Callow that would be intact and able to declare Independence. I also like how she got pissed at cat for not letting the knightly orders die on their own.

That said, there was a lost opportunity in this chapter. We know that Praes is composed of three human cultures plus greenskins. It seems like Malicia's goal is to make Callowan the fourth human culture of Praes, like taghreb or soninke. Those two cultures are still distinct with different languages and homelands but both accept the tower and being part of Praes.

I wanted Malicia to explore that idea more.

*** I'm not very clear on the history (neither is the Wikia), but I think they were already part of the empire when it won [[http://abridged-guide-to-evil.wikia.com/wiki/Dread_Empire_of_Praes][independence]] from the invaders - Miezans. So I think circumstances are somewhat different.

**** What is now Praes was governed a single entity under the Miezans, and that survived the uprising that expelled them. Prior to the occupation, they were a patchwork of Soninke and Taghreb states constantly at war with each other.
