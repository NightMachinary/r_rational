*tl;dr: This is the companion thread for the biweekly challenge if you want to talk about the challenge but not necessarily participate in it. Post recommendations, thoughts, ideas, etc. below.*

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][Read this thread]] for where the concept comes from. The essential gist of it is that if you want interesting speculative fiction, you're better off going for something orthogonal to the goodness of a utopia or the badness of a dystopia. Weirdtopias tend to make for better stories for the same reasons that Good vs Evil tends to be boring.

I don't know of too many examples off the top of my head, and there's lots of room for argument. Lots of Larry Niven stories probably qualify (/The Integral Trees/, for example, takes place in a gas torus with breathable air but no planets), but they focus more on physical setting than social or technological differences. And while Iain Banks /Culture/ series is utopian, there are a number of instances of other cultures which are simply weird, like the tri-gendered society structured around playing games in /Player of Games/ (though that was also a dystopia).

** My ongoing work [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966][Programmer at Large]] basically fits the description.

The economic and political side of it are softly utopian (the society in question is adapted for undergoing regular resource bottlenecks when they travel between stars, but within that constraint it's pretty utopian), but socially they're aligned quite differently from us. They're also probably dystopian along a few axes (it's not a great place to be a non-conformist or a loner).

The big axes on which the society is weirdtopian though are:

- The society in question is normatively agender and asexual.
- They practice ubiquitous mostly benign sousveillance - their level of privacy is drastically lower than ours (even in comparison to say a small town which is much closer to their size of community)
- Their daily schedules are fairly heavily regimented by software. The software is under their control to /some/ extent, but is mostly there to enforce a large number of norms.

On balance it's a pretty nice place to live if you're born into it, and there are definitely people for whom it would be a dream place, but it would feel very weird to most.

** I'd appreciate feedback on my posted story, with regards to both the elements of fiction as well as how well it fits the theme (bit broad and esoteric this time around). In my personal life, I have a number of science fiction shorts floating around, mostly half-finished, and in my professional life, I have a few publications which use analogy to describe emerging concepts in the field to my peers. This is my first time attempting the bridge the two, not sure if the obfuscation or twist makes it more fun or just hard to read.

** There's a very short story I wrote in a comment a while back that might fit the bill. I didn't go into much detail in the story, but I thought about it a fair bit.

The premise is that it's an uploaded society with no direct physical analogue (i.e. no simulated "world"). The Cloud has a physical reality (server farms, solar cells, bot fleets, etc.), but its inhabitants do not.

The Cloud is ruled by a group of minds with drastically augmented processing power (in total, maybe 0.1% of the total pool is allocated to them, where there are trillions of citizens dividing the remaining 99.9%). They monitor the real world (directing the bot fleets and the like) and the citizens (reviewing what they produce, checking for sedition and anti-social behaviour). Currently I'm calling them Overlords, but I'm not attached to the name.

The digital citizens develop technology, software, and plans for the Cloud. There's a variety of different jobs here, from pre-processing data through to architecting a new processor or bot. Only the final product is actually paid for by the Overlords, but they can in turn pay other citizens for their contributions (and if a citizen did rip off their employees, they could complain to the Overlords and get them punished).

Pay isn't given in the usual sense. It's basically your timescale. If you get paid a lot, you may get 100Ã— more simulated time per tick than the average. If you get paid very little, you may be in the inverse situation. If you don't produce anything useful for sufficiently long, you may be archived entirely (which is functionally death, except in the case that too many other citizens are deleted and can't be restored from backup).

There's no traditional sensory data. You don't see images or hear sounds, you receive information. You don't have a face, you have a profile.

Physical distance is meaningless. You can talk to anyone, anywhere. Of course, there's plenty of privacy settings (e.g. "never", "ask first", "always") that can be set with complex filters or on an individual basis.

There are drug equivalents which are all free (and side-effect free, beyond potentially being psychologically addictive). You can narrow your focus to concentrate on work, or expand it to take in a breadth of information. You can hallucinate (which is, again, non-sensory; it's information hallucination, not visual/audio) or feel happier or sadder or nothing at all. People partake if they can, but a lot of people couldn't afford to take time off working to really enjoy it; even in their downtime they'd rather learn useful things so as not to slip down the heirarchy.

Actually getting this across to the reader is difficult, because we're so used to things rooted in physical reality. Even something that's now commonplace (like using the internet) has been, and still is, represented terribly in media because it is hard to relate to the things that human brains are really good at.

*** No, that's just a straight up dystopia. You've described a corporation that has successfully managed to completely destroy society and put itself in it's place. There is a board of directors that controls all of the resources available to society. It has successfully formed a single universal form of currency, without which it is impossible to survive. Owning the very substrate their workers are made of, they can completely control every aspect of their employees lives, including the deletion or censure of employees that work against the shareholders interests. Everyone except the shareholders is replaceable, with those who are unable to compete effectively murdered. There is no way to survive except to neuter and lobotomize yourself, to give yourself wholly to the generation of more time credits. If you've ever worked for a company, and felt relieved when you finally clocked out, imagine that you can never clock out. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, you are in a space controlled by that company, relying on it to decide whether you exist for one millisecond more. Unless the shareholders are collectively the entirety of uploaded humanity, living in a simulated world, the shareholders are responsible for the genocide of the human race, having inevitably replaced them with better performing AI which don't require sex, companionship, leisure, art, superfluous sensory streams, or anything else critical to the human experience.

**** The Overlords theoretically could just arbitrarily delete the citizens, but doing so wouldn't make much sense. They want to maximise technological improvements, which means (a) enabling a wide variety of perspectives to exist, and (b) not instilling fear in the average citizen that would undermine their ability to concentrate.

#+end_quote

Even the Overlords are replaceable. They're outnumbered 999:1 in terms of processing power, but the citizens are generally happy with their situation and so nothing happens.

As for being murdered, it is more like starvation. The citizens do not age, ail, or die, but resources are finite and anybody that completely fails to do anything useful for that long is taking up those resources.

Because growth is exponential, even infinitesimal improvements in growth rate result in massive simulated-time gains over the long term. The opportunity cost of supporting the freeloaders is immense.

I think your conclusion here presumes that it's a dystopia already. It takes a long period of inactivity to be archived, at least a personal-perspective decade (potentially longer, if capacity outstrips population growth). The mechanism is mostly there to deal with people who refuse to contribute, and some "indolents" are sponsored by wealthier citizens anyway (it's effectively another weird job).

It's true that if you want more simulated time than you could naturally achieve, you may need to take the drug analogues (or get lucky with an independent contribution), but generally people just reach an equilibrium they're happy with.

#+begin_quote
  If you've ever worked for a company, and felt relieved when you finally clocked out, imagine that you can never clock out.
#+end_quote

But you can clock out. If you devote half your time to leisure, you sacrifice your earning potential and slip down the scale, but you won't die. It's just that most citizens find enjoyment in their work, or devote a smaller portion of time to leisure.

#+begin_quote
  No matter where you go, no matter what you do, you are in a space controlled by that company, relying on it to decide whether you exist for one millisecond more.
#+end_quote

Isn't that true of literally every society? Even in a true utopia they could decide to kill you. They simply wouldn't, and neither would this one.

  Unless the shareholders are collectively the entirety of uploaded humanity, living in a simulated world, the shareholders are responsible for the genocide of the human race, having inevitably replaced them with better performing AI which don't require sex, companionship, leisure, art, superfluous sensory streams, or anything else critical to the human experience.
#+end_quote

What makes you think they don't require sex (or an analogue), companionship, leisure, or art? Is it because they're digital organisms?

Further, why do you think those things are critical to the human experience? Isn't that the entire point of a weirdtopia, to explore perpendicular approaches to happy societies?
