FMoC is an incredible story that has so many rational themes and an ever-improving quality. Thoughtful villains, trope awareness, sophisticated worldbuilding, machiavellian plots, genuinely clever tricks, thinking out loud, utilitarianist themes, economics, Yudkowsky's recommendation... this fic has everything.

The last couple of translated arcs have been by far and away the best (and most rational/ist) so far, in my opinion, so I thought weekly posts might have some value.

[[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10156763190259228][Here's a recent Facebook post from Eliezer]] for anyone doubting this fic's excellence. Mild spoilers.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/6838665402001705/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation][Official translations are available on Webnovel.]] Some controversy exists about the site, but I don't personally know much about it.


** Just a reminder: Many people in the chinese webnovel community (translators and readers) have boycotted Qidian, the owner of webnovel.com, for scummy and underhanded business practices, including but not limited to lying and massively unfair contracts.

[[https://weitranslations.wordpress.com/2017/10/21/qis-poaching-of-ccg-and-what-happened-between-me-qi-and-gts-slave-contract/comment-page-1/][Example 1]]\\
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/6plua1/qidian_has_issued_dmca_to_wuxiaworlds_hosting/][Example 2]]

Personally, I always read 40 Millenniums of Cultivation on the leecher site [[http://wuxiaworld.co]] (not to be confused with the translation website wuxiaworld.*com*) They usually get the most recent updates shortly after they're posted on webnovel.com

*** People have also boycotted them for stealing translations from others and posting them up on there site. If you want to read Forty Millenniums is Cultivation, I'd suggest a different site so as not to give Them any traffic or revenue.

As for the story itself, it is a pretty good story, (I have only read up to end of book 1) but from what I have read, it is definitely a top tier novel amongst the other translated Chinese Webnovels.

***** Very Unlikely, as a Chinese company who own the Original rights to the Chinese works that are being translated, even if Others tried to sue them, it would be on their home turf of China and we know who the Chinese government will side with already. Plus a long legal battle will not stop them today but maybe 2-3 years from now. For now, what we can do as readers is inform and boycott, hurting them where it counts the most; there wallet.

** Anyone else really bothered by the writing style of xianxia? I wish I could enjoy these (I did like Cradle / Sufficiently Advanced Magic), but reading paragraphs like these just makes me cringe:

#+begin_quote
  Sure enough, when Li Yao passed through a faintly bulging mound of dirt, the mound of dirt burst, shooting out countless rock fragments. In the midst of the rock fragments was a pair of dirt yellow Sand Wolves!
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Li Yao felt only a ferocious and vicious hurricane sweep over from behind his back. A powerful oppressive aura, nearly on the exact same level as Fiend Blade Peng Hai's, appeared behind him!

  The only difference was that... Fiend Blade Peng Hai's aura was earth-shattering in form of ebbing tides and waves. This aura was as if a tyrannosaurus rex had come crashing from afar, fiercely and viciously. A strong air of terrible beasts was mixed in the aura!

  All Li Yao felt was the tip of a spear pressing against his back. He could no longer bear the barbell, so he directly rolled forward, utterly miserably, to avoid the “terrible beast” assaulting from behind. He spun around like lightning with a strength that nearly broke his waist, automatically adopting the tightest defensive guard!

  Cold sweat rained from his forehead. His wild beating heart nearly ripped open his chest!

  “Who's aura could be so overbearing!? It's simply a tyrannosaurus rex in the form of a human!” Li Yao gasped for breath with a gaping mouth. He was trembling with fear as he sized up this “Human-shaped T-rex.”

It's like everything in these is presented in superlative, leaving no word space to distinguish things that actually matter. And the superlative is always told, not shown - extreme adjectives by the narrator, but you get maybe one sentence for something that's supposedly important, and then you just move on. You're supposed to care about it because of the adjective, not because you've been shown how it impacts the world or the characters.

​

It's a shame because I do feel like I'm missing out, but just don't know how to get over this :P

*** You're kind of mixing categories here. Your issue isn't with the genre of xianxia fiction, it's with poorly translated Chinese literature - though I suppose it's a moot point as those domains overlap fairly heavily...

For what it's worth I don't believe you're missing out, xianxia fiction has many of the same genre trappings as the litrpg genre.

**** I think it's a bit more than just 'being poorly translated'. I've noticed similar things with official translations of japaneese LNs, and western fiction that emulates these styles. There seems to be a consistent difference in writing - short paragraphs, a lot of exclamations, etc. But well, that's just guess work since I can't read the source :P

***** True, it's not quality writing. That said, for Light Novels at least, that's the point of them - being 'light' in terms of ease of reading, at the expense of detailed description, showing instead of telling, etc. They're intended to be written quickly and read quickly, and they are usually targeted toward a young adult demographic. It's the literary equivalent of junk food. Then on top of that they often go through a shoddy translation process. I tend to prefer watching the anime versions of popular light novels since then the lack of description doesn't matter since it's a visual format.

To a degree, I think it's a "non-Western" thing. Bollywood often similarly comes off as hilariously over the top to Western eyes, as do K-dramas or anime. South Indian flicks likewise feel way overboard by /Bollywood/ standards haha.

Most of it is trash. It's basically the equivalent of chuuni self-insert fiction.

**** It's the method of meditating to gain strength in this genre. They meditate and drink some potions or pills or bathe in some fancy liquid to boost their cultivation rate. Of course the main hero always cultivates waaaaay faster than anyone else ever.

It's not quite that different from gamerfics. Except that literally anyone can cultivate and be awesome martial artists instead of just one guy being the gamer and having those fancy powers. And the powerlevel of a guy is measured by just a single number instead of having all those skills and spells and stuff. Though they do gain fancy moves with a certain powerlevel by reading scrolls. They feel a bit like proto-gamerfics, but the genre seems to be so tight that when you've read one, you've read them all.

** I think the proper mentality to enter into when reading novels like this and ISSTH is to enjoy the nonsensical elements and let some of the bad writing wash over you. I find these light novels a break from more serious reading and they have their own genre conventions and tropes that you pick up as you read. They also hit tropes and get into situations that you don't see in Western literature, which can be fun. That said, I wouldn't force yourself to read any of it if there's no immediate appeal. This isn't literature, it's stress relief. I will say that this an d ISSTH are a cut above most Eastern translations, so if you know you can read this stuff, you should try them.

If I recall correctly, the fan translation made the story popular in the English speaking community, then the Qidian began bullying its way into being the only source of translations, as with many other fan translations. Alternatively, strivon has been focusing on the other story they are translating.

The protag just received his second completely unearned power up via him randomly stumbling across some powerful old cultivator guy. Kind of a red flag for me personally.

****** They are divided into volumes, so I would suggest starting from the first chapter of the second volume, [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/1068304.html][Chapter 98]].

Just understand that the protagonist has been spending the previous volume improving his strength in high school fighting competitions and completed his college entrance examinations. With some corrupt higher-ups who tried to oppose him now ruined for life.

Around chapter 95, it's where they start behaving more rationally than the norm for the genre.

Villain Boss to Minion about killing the Hero:

#+begin_quote
  Zhou Yin stared at him and even furiously roared, "Who do you think you are!? Do you think you some ancient cultivator from forty millenniums ago!? Do you think you can kill anyone at the drop of a hat? Don't you know about the federation's laws? Don't you know the punishment for a cultivator is even more serious than a normal criminal? Don't you know how many eyes are watching our Crimson Nimbus Sect? Don't you know the Crimson Nimbus Sect has eight Elders, seven of which are just waiting for me to make a fool of myself? If truly something happens to Li Yao, there will be no need for a police investigation---even an idiot would know that it was us!
