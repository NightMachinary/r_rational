“The city walls are falling even faster than projected, my Lord,” I said, sketching a quick salute. “Your tactics, as usual, are flawless.”

“I continue to insist that I am not your Lord,” said Peter. Another shadow took form in the corner of the command tent, ink claws reaching for his throat; he cut it in two without looking. “Do we have enough ammunition for the siege engines?”

I frowned down at the severed halves of the creature. The top half grasped weakly at my leg, mewling as its edges dissolved into black vapor. I crushed its head with a stomp. “You're getting very good at that. And yes, we have plenty of ammunition.”

Peter hummed, continuing to stare at a map of the city. “Good. I want the second and third Freedom Legions to move on the East Wall the second those sections of the wall are down. The Dark Emperor won't know what hit him.”

“Of course, my Lord.” I waited a moment, then coughed delicately when he continued to frown at the maps, moving tiny figurines around. “You will be joining them, of course?”

“Hmm?” He finally looked up at me. “Goodness, no, Celia. Why would I do that?”

“You are the Chosen One,” I said. “Selected by the Blade of the Celestial Dawn to cast down evil. It would be rather improper if you don't lead the column yourself, my Lord.”

Peter raised an eyebrow, balancing the Blade of the Celestial Dawn on his shoulder. It twinkled merrily. “So one of the Emperor's sniper-assassins can nail me with a crossbow bolt? I think not. I can direct the assault without issue from the command tent.”

“The Chosen One must be /seen/ to lead, my Lord,” I said. “Your prowess in battle is whispered of, but hardly any of the soldiers have seen it. How will you defeat the Dark Emperor if you remain in this tent?”

“With an army,” he said. “Which I have. Obviously.” Peter cleared his throat. “Well, which /we/ have, I mean. I don't want to imply that I am in any way superior to the other members of the Freedom Legions---”

“You can't stab the Dark Emperor with the Blade if you stay in your tent,” I said. “Our soldiers won't even be able to get into the Imperial Palace. Only the Blade can break the iron of its gates.”

“Which is why we're not going to enter through the gates,” said Peter. “Why did you think I had our supply wagons hauling eleven tons of alchemist's fire through the forest?”

I sighed. “My Lord, you cannot just blow up the Imperial Palace.”

“Yes, I can.” He looked at me incredulously. “What, you think I should fight through the world's best fortified building, filled with assassins, so that I can defeat the Emperor in single combat? That sounds like a good way to get filled up with crossbow bolts.”

“Stop saying that. Nobody is going to shoot you with a crossbow,” I said. “You've been chosen by the heavens! Look, the Imperial Palace is the greatest symbol of power for a thousand miles in any direction. The leader of our nation has always ruled from within it. If you destroy it, the people will riot.”

“It's a symbol of oppression!” said Peter. “But fine. I suppose it does contain the treasury.” He stabbed a finger at the map. “It looks like there's an underground river that feeds the Palace's wells. If we poison it, we can have the Emperor and his assassin-guards dead in a few days, tops.”

“Where are you getting all these ideas---” I put my hand to my face. “The Chosen One can't defeat the Emperor with poisoned wells. You could accidentally poison thousands of citizens. And you'll be seen as a coward.” I frowned at the empty command tent. I could still hear, in the distance, the sound of Freedom Legionnaires fighting to take the crumbling city walls, and the occasional scream as one of them was shot with a crossbow. “Well, more of a coward. My Lord. Please, you need to be seen /actually fighting/ if you want to have the political clout to lead the government to reform.”

“Poisoning everyone in the city would be nonoptimal,” he muttered. “Water tables are very confusing.”

“Indeed,” I said. “So if you'll follow me, I can lead you to the bodyguard squad I've handpicked for your assault on the Palace---”

Both of us reacted instantly as another of the Emperor's shadow creatures materialized in the room. Peter cleaved through its body with a sweep of his sword, the Blade glittering brightly as its arc severed an arm and both legs, and as it fell I shot it in the head with my crossbow.

“There really are a lot of those things,” I said, stepping on the bow's stirrup as I laboriously began the process of reloading.

“The Emperor's magics are pervasive,” Peter agreed. He sighed mournfully. “No poison, you're right. Too indiscriminate. But if we starve the Palace's guards out, they'll turn on him and we can take the Palace without a fight. Shouldn't take more than four or five months, no?”

I huffed as I loaded another bolt, blowing loose hair out of my eyes. “My Lord, this is ridiculous. You have the Blade. Just go into the Palace and stab the Emperor. You're overcomplicating this.”

He rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. “Yeah, it's just... well... that's what the last Chosen One did, you know? And then he executed most of his supporters and became another Dark Emperor. And the only reason he became the Chosen One in the first place is that the Chosen One before /him/ turned into the Dark Empress.”

“I'm not sure where you're going with this,” I said.

Peter sat down heavily. “It just seems like kind of a cycle of violence. The Chosen One keeps rising up and personally slaying the Emperor, and then turning into a despot. What if it's because the Blade keeps choosing violent people, because they're the ones it knows will succeed, instead of people who are actually good? I think we should try something different.”

“The Blade of the Celestial Dawn doesn't make mistakes,” I said. “You'll note that, in every case where a new Dark Emperor or Empress rose, they always lost the Blade before they started making evil decisions.”

“That doesn't mean the Blade is perfect,” Peter said. “You're the one who gave me the Blade in the first place, when it Chose me, so I know this is important to you. But I think that we might be placing a little too much cultural importance on it. It's mostly just a shiny sword.”

I rubbed the bridge of my nose. What a headache. “Alright, you're in charge. Final answer, then: will you slay the Dark Emperor, legitimize your rule, and fix these lands? Or are you going to go with the starvation plan?”

“I'm not going to personally kill the Dark Emperor,” Peter said firmly. “His crossbow-assassins are everywhere; it's too dangerous. We'll take the Palace as nonviolently as possible, force their surrender, and then hold a trial---”

I shot him in the head with my crossbow. Peter's body slumped over, slowly, before coming to a rest on the table. Blood pooled on the maps, staining the parchment red.

Outside, the battle continued to rage. No one had noticed.

I dropped into the chair next to Peter's, pulled out my transmission crystal, and tapped it a few times. “Avery? You there? It's kind of important.”

The crystal glimmered as it projected an image of the Dark Emperor over the table. I could see them shooing away guards and attendants as Avery realized it was me. “Celia,” they greeted. “You're reporting in early. Is my next body on the way?”

“Not exactly,” I said. “Bit of a hiccup over here.” I pried the Blade of the Celestial Dawn from Peter's cooling fingers and held it up so they could see it. “I couldn't convince the new guy to stab you personally, and his plans for taking out the Palace without fighting himself were actually kind of decent, so I thought it would be better to nip that in the bud.”

They sighed. “Very well. I trust your judgement. What about the army?”

“If you send over another shadow demon, we can make it seem like it assassinated him,” I said. “Then I'll let the army know the Chosen One is dead, we'll retreat to Boontown, and I'll whip up another Chosen One to take over. Easy.”

Avery nodded. “Good enough for me. Just make sure you pick another idiot before you do the rest of that stuff; I need the sword to be loosening up their soul for as long as possible to get a clean transition.”

“Anyone in particular you want me to go for? Someone who looks like Peter, maybe?”

Avery shrugged. “We already got someone smart enough to properly gather all the malcontents in this generation willing to fight. Any body will do.” They looked away from their crystal at something I couldn't see, mild annoyance on their face. “Try to make it quick, yes? I'm eager to get back to having my subjects look at me adoringly again. All the fear and suppressed hatred is wearing on me.” Their image made a few quick gestures with one hand, and another shadow melted out of the wall at my side.

I waved cheerily and pocketed the crystal as the image disappeared. Then I picked up the sword, jogged in place a little until I looked appropriately battle-weary, and sprinted out of the tent, leaving the chewing noises of the shadow behind.

“You!” I shouted, flagging down the nearest soldier. My free hand grabbed his lapel, clinging desperately, and pulled his increasingly panicked face down to my own. “Our Lord--- he's been assassinated! We must retreat! Here, take the Blade of the Celestial Dawn--- you must get it to safety---”

He caught the sheath I'd thrust into his hands, staggering back. The Blade started to glow. It cycled through colors, red to orange to yellow, before brightening to a blinding golden sheen. Nearby soldiers stared in shock as the sword settled on its new wielder.

“You,” I whispered, my voice somehow still carrying to everyone nearby. “You are the true Chosen One.”

Gods above, I loved my job.
