Cussing in front of children is not okay. Children watching fight potentially to the death is. The first read through I thought it was just some comic relief, but as I considered it something else occurred to me. Was this an intentional move to highlight the values dissonance? If so, well played author.

Edit* no wait it was glancing through the comment section that made me realize this.

** So... blowback. Tournament or not I can't imagine the Hyuga will take Hinata killing Neji lightly, especially seeing as how she's now technically not a Hyuga herself at all. I mean it might be unseemly for them to seek to revenge themselves against another Leaf ninja, and somewhat undignified to do so over the death of a Branch family member, but no more unseemly than Hinata killing another Leaf ninja in the tournament to begin with.

I suppose, however, that this might be causing some within the Hyuga to rethink the dismissal of Hinata as heir to the clan, able to beat their shining star Neji so simply, and showing the ruthlessness that she was believed to be lacking previously. I'm sure Hiashi has opponents within the clan who would love to rub his face in such a mistake as choosing the wrong successor.

That said, given that Hinata asserted herself by killing a Branch family member, the rest of the Branch family would almost certainly resent her being accepted back into the fold as a result. Such a splinter faction that would endorse Hinata being restored would have to come from within the main family, and the fact that she's been disowned would make that a bridge too far, I expect, especially given the reason she was disowned. If Naruto could reveal his lineage, and Hinata and her supporters could frame the Byakugan transplant as sealing ties between the Hyuga and the Leaf's jinchuriki who is also a strong candidate to become Hokage someday, then they might be willing to overlook that, but failing that I can't see any sort of internal Hyuga uprising in opposition to Hiashi in support of Hinata.

I expect we might be seeing the Hyuga taking the excuse Hinata mentioned earlier, refusing the revenge by citing the waiver, but that feels kind of... unfinished. If not just for revenge purposes, surely some will interpret this as Hinata threatening the Hyuga and will want to act on that basis.

Really, I think I'm just trying to come up with some scenario where Hinata isn't found as the victim of another perfect Hyuga assassination, but the outlook isn't great.

I mean, really, why go so far as to kill Neji? Defeating him without killing him, forcing him to yield would have gotten the point of her being better than she had been judged to be across, perhaps even more strongly than killing him. Protecting Naruto from Neji? I don't think Naruto's in less danger from the Hyuga than he was before - Neji's determination to kill them is certainly shared by some of the Hyuga and now likely exacerbated by this.

The explanation that feels most right is just that Hinata wanted to feel the exercise of power, to feel that she really did have the strength to fight back against the clan that had controlled, humiliated, and abused her, and to fight back in a definitive, absolute way. Which just seems, understandable, but stupider than I've come to expect characters in this story to be, but then, so was Sasuke planning to wander into the woods and shoot up on some special magic Uchiha power juice a foreign ninja had given him.

*** Quick note on the battle mechanics: chakra limitations meant that if she dropped shield layers to let Neji yield she mightn't have still been able to raise enough to win, anymore, and thus Neji might no longer have felt the need to surrender as soon as he was allowed the freedom to actually do so.

**** Could still have stopped at the point of incapacitating injury. Killing him was a choice, and at a guess, it's about taking the caged bird off the table. To get to a point where the house either leaves her alone, or kills her. Possibly also just not wanting to leave a humiliated Neji alive - he does not seem to have been the kind of guy who would have let that slide. Ever.

Fighting at all, I think was about the bracket setup and not trusting her opponent to not develop a sudden case of deafness - she is anticipating the winner of her match will be fighting Naruto. Given the theme of the tourney, if it is her, they can probably get away with sitting down and having a game of go - Because that would be teamwork! -

** Why didn't Neji use Kaiten (Heavenly Spin) there? In my opinion, it would destroy Kekkai really easy.

Also, looking at Neji-Kidoumaru fight, Neji could probably just slice Kekkai with his fingers.

EDIT: Also, constricting strenght of barriers stacks pretty strange. At least it's not additive, otherwise if 1 barrier could be stopped by leaning on him, 10 barriers can't constrict a human to death.

** That was nasty. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes][Beware The Nice One]], indeed. Nice to see Hinata win this -- the only two times I've seen her get a flat-out victory in fanfic are this one and one time when she activated Neji's Caged Bird seal.

On a side note, I've been a little worried about you putting actual numbers on chakra use. I'm afraid it's going to video-gameify the story too much. So far, though, it seems to be playing out pretty well. I do find myself wondering why Naruto chose to use "millichakra" as his base unit, instead of sticking to integers.

*** I'm not sure if they understand what "milli" means. I have a feeling they may treat "milli" (and other SI prefixes) as "holy words from the ancient time", considering mentions of game theory and algebra as ancient half-forgotten arts.

Prefixing milli is the most obvious way to show you're talking about "chakra - the unit of chakra energy" and not any of other other fuzzy meanings they have for the word.

Plus, I don't remember it very well, but maybe the scale for "1 chakra" was set at something sensible, like the amount of chakra a normal ninja regenerates during a day?

That also /could/ have something to do with author using them. I'd bet canon uses metric, like Japan.

The characters also speak english, and their language is weirdly just like ours even though a lot of time should have passed. Or maybe we just are the intended audience?

They also have walkie talkies and computers and everything. What techlevel would need something more advanced?

Canon may have computers, I don't know, but in this story they worship /a broken TV,/ and /algebra/ is an ancient art. So I've assumed they degraded to about medieval level, except in some areas where knowledge is lost, but technology is preserved as "ninjutsu" (e.g. medicine).

** First off: I was wrong about my prediction. I confess.

But now i have to ask, is this going a story where everyone has superpowers that make it extraordinarily easy to live a stable and well provided for, with only a bit of common sense, but in the end they don't because of plot or author decisions. So far I don't see a reason why Naruto hasn't just sent his clones to learn agriculture, woodwork and other useful self providing skills. And if Hinata is anything to go by, everyone should be able to make use of shadow clones, at least in small numbers and a small periods of time.

Why would this be a thing they would want? Stable and well provided for farmer life is hardly an achievement, doesn't help them achieve their goals (assuming they have goals other than plain survival; sasuke definitely does), and is not what the culture that brought them up promotes as a good life.

****** Nope. Your assumption is wrong, it's not a military camp, where everyone follows orders all the time and where there is no time to think or even a possibility for a creative idea.

1 its a commando camp, where they train kids to fight, but also train them to act on their own, to gather supplies in the wild, to build their own shelters, to make decision on their own when the mission takes an unexpected turn.

2 Glorifying personal sacrifice has nothing to do with being self sufficient and capable of providing for oneself and even thinking for oneself. Even if it were, if you were expecting a part of your zealot army to become jounin, team leaders, and even a Hokage, you would have to foster some level of creative thought.

I think there was an episode of the original series where Naruto actually uses clones to catch fish. Google gives nothing, but it's at least a step in the right direction.

And maybe a farmer life is to dishonorable, but there is no reason why Ninjas can't provide for themselves, either by catching fish, or gathering berries, or getting fallen braches for firewood, or getting water from a creek, or whatever it is you need. Hard work is hard, but when you have a power to jump over buildings, move faster than a speeding animal, kill things with pinpoint precision strikes(seriously kunai throwing in a bulls-eye is Op as hell) and do other kinds of magic, it stops being hard work and becomes easy living.

Excuses for lack of said behavior include but are not limited to: prevention by a Higher Power, lack of time to think for ideas and their execution (but somehow not lack of time for creating new techniques or training of the same), masochism, mental instability, author not thinking things trough, author purposefully not thinking things trough lest he spend too much time on making the economics and society work as it's supposed to, author madness and so on and so forth.

I might think of more things later.

Uhm..

Hold a sec, where are the genin coming from? Going on the casualty rates, and the requirement for a bloodline, each ninja surviving past genin would have to have about 10-15 kids. Per ninja, so that's over 20 for a couple. Errh... I think I just spotted one way this world sucks for civilians. The only way these numbers work out is male ninja are abusing seduction techniques on a massive scale. Or alternately, people are using medic-nin techniques to have random women carry their children to term.

Unless she planned to kill him and wanted plausible deniability. If she at any point ever wondered when she would know if Neji forfeited, she'd then plan to use the Byakugan during the final moments.

Also, Hinata totally talks through her bubble to Naruto. I guess ten bubbles is enough to obscure all sound? If she can talk through her bubble, you'd think multiple bubbles would just make the sound less coherent, not silent.
