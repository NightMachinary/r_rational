** Thanks again to [[/u/alexanderwales]] for giving me permission to riff off of his story, [[http://alexanderwales.com/the-randi-prize/][The Randi Prize]].

If you think that these chapters have been overly ambiguous, then let me know if you'd be interested in being a beta reader. I've been told a couple of times so far that a given passage was unclear, and I want to avoid that as much as possible.

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

Notably - if you're also meeting those criteria, you almost certainly want to meet the rest of the people who meet it.
