** Just some quick thoughts:

- I don't think purposely humiliating Afolabi is a good idea. I agree she was right to put him in his place, but outright bullying him after is just begging for a lasting grudge. I could see Black threatening generals, but I don't see him ever making them do petty tasks to humiliate them.

- What is a "jesha"? I'm assuming it's a rank or title or something, but I don't recall seeing it before. It's from this quote:

#+begin_quote
  He seemed displeased that Nauk was in attendance, representing my jesha from the Fifteenth.
#+end_quote

- On the first night when the fae start their guerilla tactics, it feels like Cat took a tenth of mages for some task. Was it putting out the fires? Because those got mentioned /after/ she said they were tired; and the manner in which she mentioned it implied it wasn't for the same reason the other legions were tired. I'm referring to this:

#+begin_quote
  When we camped out for the night I sent for a tenth of mages, half of what the Fifteenth had left -- the rest had all gone with Robber. More than once during the night I wished I had Masego or even Kilian along, instead of these ones. The difference in skill showed badly. I emerged only around morning bell, exhausted, and found I wasn't the only one in that state. The fae had hit us during the night, in a manner of speaking.
#+end_quote

- For that matter, what's Robber off doing with the rest of the 15th's mages?

- Dark humor, but near the end Cat said it took them 6 hours to get the army through the portal the first time, so they'd have to hold for that long again. That's not quite true; they've lost a couple thousand soldiers (maybe a bit less than that). So, hey! Faster exit time!

- I wonder what Cat's trap is going to be...?

*** A jesha is a kind of unit:

#+begin_quote
  Normally a full legion would be run by a general and their staff, under which stood two legates commanding a jesha of two thousand legionaries.

I think she was interrogating the Fae prisoner(s).

*** I think Afolabi is going to cause trouble for Cat although it may have turned out the same irrespective of Cats treatment of him. Also, it looked like Cats treatment of Afolabi sent an important message to Ranker and Kegan.

I can't wait to find out what Cat has in store for Summer. It's good that she can't rely on Masego this time.

I wonder what's waiting for Cat back in creation though.

*** Great chapter setting the next battle, I'm still wondering if she be able to talk with the princess of summer or if that plot line will have to await until akua has been dealt with.

Edit: princess of high noon

**** Do you mean the Princess of High Noon? I hope so, we've been hearing about her since Cat entered Arcadia the first time. I'm very curious what a fae with "a beautifully simplistic view of things" and Cat are like together. Sounds like a recipe for Robber to run circles around her TBH.

*** I have to wonder, was marching through Arcadia /at all/ worth it?

- It's the longest trip by far through Arcadia yet, and can't be that much quicker than just marching through Callow
- They're taking /way/ more casualties from the fae than they would in Callow, and the fae here are much more difficult to defeat (as this chapter reminds us, they're much stronger in Arcadia)
- They're not even getting the drop on Akua anymore

Sure, they've refilled their warchest during their most recent siege, but it seems like a poor tradeoff for such heavy troop losses...

**** It's a longer trip than the last one, but it's also a lot longer in Creation (about twice as long as Marchford to Laure): [[https://practicalguidetoevil.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wnkjrov.jpg]]

Also, these are pretty long distances. Per Nauk in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/chapter-19-order-redux/][Chapter 19]] that Marchford->Laure journey would have taken them over 1.5 /months/ of hard marching. Double that, and they'd be traveling for at least 3-4 months.

They might not surprise Akua anymore, but they're giving her a lot less time to prepare than otherwise, I think.

***** Ah, that makes sense then - that map helps make things much clearer. Still a pretty huge tradeoff, that many troop losses, but probably worth it if it saves 3 months of hard marching.
