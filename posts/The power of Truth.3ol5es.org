So, inspired by the liar in a truthful world post, I had an idea..

You wake up after a night on town with a headache, a very strange tattoo on your left arm, and a very funny (dis)ability.

First: You can no longer speak with deceptive intent.

You can tell stories - if it is clear they are stories. You can use parables and metaphors. - if you believe said parables and metaphors communicate your point clearly to the audience you are speaking to. You cannot intentionally mislead anyone by spoken or written word. Being "Technically truthful" just does not work for you. Basically, in everything you say or write, you find you are trying to communicate as honestly and clearly as your powers of communication and knowledge of the subject at hand allows.

This is not an oracle. You can be wrong. You cannot, however, pretend to greater certainty than you actually possess.

Nor are you compelled to talk to people - silence is always an option.

Now, for the upside. Everyone is compelled to believe you are telling the truth as best you know it. Cynical politican, jaded 4chan member, religious fanatic? Noone ever believes you to be a liar, no matter what you say.

How do you use this?


** I would become a news reporter or political commentator similar to Jon Stewart. Everything I say would be considered to be truthful, often funny/entertaining by revealing what others leave unsaid, and I'd be able to exercise an incredible amount of influence over state/national discourse.

If I could figure out a way to tattoo others and compel them to speak truths as well, I'd start a movement to have all public speakers pre-commit to receiving the tattoo before they address large crowds. Before receiving a tattoo, they'd have to take courses in logic, rationality, and they'd be tested for delusional tendencies as well as their ability to admit when they are wrong. The process for receiving a tattoo of truth will be open for revisions via a democratic forum and all of the tattooed will publically renew their vows on a yearly basis to adhere to the Principles. I think this will go far towards creating a group of reliable leaders.

Granted, someone could fake a tattoo and if everyone in the world has the tattoo... then we're in the Invention of Lying territory. Hm. I don't know how to prevent that from happening.

Your assertion that money doesn't matter and Internet is all you need runs counter to most of what I know about the election process in the USA. Could you please provide names of politicians who have gotten elected purely on the strength of YouTube and public speaking, without spending more money than a member of the 99% could afford -- let's say $10,000 to be very generous.

Oh, we're assuming this isn't a US election? You didn't say that at first. Okay, I don't know anything about non-US electioneering so I'll go with it. It still seems dubious, though.

I'm confused. Before, you asserted that "You don't really need money to get elected", but now you seem to be implying that it's very rare. Given the prevalence of millionaires in federal office I suspect that anyone who /does/ get elected to high office without taking outside money did so because they had plenty of their own.

Are you talking about only local offices, maybe? Small town mayor, town council, that sort of thing? Because that I would definitely agree with.

Even the mayorship of New York or other major city isn't a cheap campaign.

If you refuse to go from 99.7% to 99.9%, knowing that it is statistically likely that three people in the 1000 person audience will misunderstand you, have you "intended" that three people will misunderstand you, and does the tattoo therefore prevent you from refusing?

What's the reach of this effect? Can it work over the phone? Through writing? Through a video?

Don't tell anyone that you can't lie, or you will be taken advantage of. Get people you trust to lie for you. If someone asks you if you are able to lie, look really busy and preoccupied and do not answer. Most people are not going to believe that you have this weird superpower/hindrance going on unless someone asks you on public television.

People are compelled to believe you are telling the truth as best you know it. You can use this. People will be more willing to trust you if they always think you are being honest, which means you can give them advice and point out when they're doing something stupid, and they'll believe you.

This is assuming that the compulsion actually works. Can people resist the compulsion?

*** Reach: Yes, yes, and yes. As long as the communication has not been edited, the effects persist. It vanishes if anyone so much as adds a comma. If, for example, you wanted to write a book with the effect intact, that would be /possible/ but you would pretty much have to learn LaTeX and do your own typesetting and final edit.

Body language deception works, but is limited - if someone bursts into a room and asks where Martha is, you can point them in the wrong direction and that will work. ASL.. counts as speaking. Saying one thing and communicating something else somatically, will just result in people believing what you said, and also consider you a weirdo. I suppose you could use this for very effective comedy if you have talents in that direction. Re: resistance. No. They are not compelled to believe you are right, but the primary effects are symmetrical - you cant be deceptive, and people consider the fact that you are being honest a self-evident truth.

**** Am I understanding this right?

The effect won't manifest if you use body language, in other words, but if you use a language that you know is a real language, you are obligated to speak truth as you best understand.

Is this the case for any language?

can you lie in morse code, when you attempt to communicate in it?

can you lie in morse code when you forget it exists and tap your foot nervously, even though you do know it is a language, because you don't mean to be communicating in morse code?

can you speak nonsense that conveys no useful information, as far as you are concerned, even if it isn't part of a language?

if you're taught a language wrong, does the effect bleed through, even though you aren't speaking it with the correct comprehension, i.e. if you were taught: all statements in english are false unless you add a not in certain, grammatically correct places, would that still convey honest intention?

Does the trueness still apply when you speak a language the listener cannot understand or when they listen in the wrong language?

If so, you'd make a good diplomat, especially if you trust your government to be honest.
