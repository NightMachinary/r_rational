Any and all critque welcome.


** Was I expecting Neo Nazis versus vampires? No, but I enjoyed it anyway.

I'm looking forward to nick having a chance to reflect on the monster he's become (and the fact prayers affect him). He's taking all this pretty well.

Do you imagine he still has the mind of a child? Not intellectually, but emotionally. It's interesting how little he's wanted to visit his family...

Thanks for part 2, looking forward to the next chapter!

*** I'd say Nick still has a child's emotions, more or less. He's just... preoccupied, right now.

**** Not that the comparison is /unwelcome/ at all, but the title actually comes from an old Western flick. Seemed... thematically appropriate.
