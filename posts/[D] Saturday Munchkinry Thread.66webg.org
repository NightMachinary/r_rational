Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A representative of an alien race comes to you and informs you that, as part of a test of mankind's capabilities, you will be transported to an alien planet, and will be tasked with escaping from that planet. You have one year to assemble a team, at which point you will all be teleported to this new planet.

*RULES:*

- You're not allowed to bring anything with you, just your team. You arrive naked and carrying nothing, and will have to work your way up from very simple tools.
- It's heavily implied that the survival of the species is on the line, so you more or less have your pick of anyone you want to join your crew.
- Because of the gravity of the situation, things like state secrets aren't an issue; you have access to any classified information which you can give a reasonable justification for needing.
- However, because you can't bring anything, the information you take with is limited by how much you and your team can collectively memorize.
- The destination planet has been selected as one that can easily support human life. It has a mostly temperate climate, and most of the flora and fauna are edible, but exactly which ones you'll need to figure out for yourself.
- There's no hard time limit, but escaping quickly will result in a higher score, and therefore a higher chance of survival.
- There's no strict cap on your group's size, but a group that succeeds with fewer people in the same amount of time gets a higher score. In addition, there are the typical difficulties with scale as the size of your group increases.
- Simply getting out of the atmosphere, or even into orbit, doesn't count; you need to escape the planet's gravity well.
- Furthermore, you have to be alive when this happens, and your aim is to get as large a percentage of the team off the planet as possible.
- In the event that this becomes a multigenerational effort, "the team" will be considered to consist of the entire human population of the planet. You're free to reproduce like mad in an attempt to up your labor force, but keep in mind that this would also mean you need to transport that many more people off of the planet.
- The aliens are watching, and don't take kindly to cheaters and wise guys. If, for example, you genocide everyone but the pilot just before launch and try to argue that 100% of your team escaped, humanity will be immediately disqualified, with whatever consequences that entails.

How would you plan your escape? Whom would you add to your team, what information would you endeavor to collect, and what steps would you take upon arriving on the alien planet in order to eventually get off? You have the benefit of modern science and engineering, but don't start with modern equipment.

*EASY MODE:*

Disregard the memorization requirement. The aliens provide you with a read-only archive of the Internet as of the day you left Earth. This isn't intended as a "tool" /per se/, but rather as a catalog of humanity's accumulated knowledge. As such, Google Calculator won't work, but a lookup table will.

*HARD MODE:*

Your team arrives scattered randomly across the land of the planet. You need to find each other first before you can get much done.

*** Escape the planet's gravity well? Hmmm. I presume we don't need to escape it in any particular direction - that is, as long as we don't aim ourselves at the nearest star, we can pretty much point ourselves any-which-way and just pour on enough speed? That already eliminates a /lot/ of tricky mathematical difficulties at the end there.

Alright. So, basically, the aim is to build a box - with air and food - big enough for everyone, and then throw it really hard off the planet. Ability to /land/ again is kind of optional.

But getting off the planet is not the /difficult/ part of this challenge. The difficult part is surviving the first few months. Once we've resolved the issues of food, shelter, and dangerous creature(s), the rest is more or less just a matter of time - especially if I bring along a geologist and a metallurgist. So, at first, I want a few Survivalist types - the sort of person who are actually /happy/ being thrown into an alien wilderness with nothing - to help the rest of us through that starting period.. Then, as I'd mentioned, a geologist and a metallurgist - they should between them be able to figure out how to get hold of and handle metals. Add in a chemical engineer to solve the problem of fuel. And then, just because, I'll volunteer the entire staff of NASA - they have a lot of experience with getting things into space. A lot of fitters and turners and so on. Mixed gender, around 50% male, 50% female, if any of the team is married their spouse comes with as well (this might very well be a multigeneration thing). Cooks, farmers, architects - all the people who, in one way or another, keep our civilisation working.

And when we build the ship, we'll leave behind us a viable Earth colony. Because having humans living on two planets is better for long-term survival of the race.

(In easy mode, I can afford to be less picky about my team's qualifications. In hard mode, I might try to volunteer the entire human population of Earth - it shouldn't be too hard to find enough people to form a group and work together (No, wait, on second thoughts that's a bad idea. We don't want small babies being randomly shuffled to random locations.)).

*** As others have pointed out ansibles allow infinite computing and anti telephone communication to any point after you create the first one.\\
However if you're using it for infinite computing you can also pull some hypercomputer anthropic tricks. For instance running many simulation of yourself that are the same except they are being deluded about the external world, and really they live in a universe that is much more convenient in some way. Basically this lets you have near total control over external reality (except for the one top level iteration of you, but they can just keep making more simulation and running them at infinite speed since as a FAI you're not selfish, hell even let the humans at top level emigrate to these lower levels and you will be basically totally safe from external threats).

Also having an antitelephone can be leveraged into free energy. Just use energy to get information about a system a-la Maxwell's Demon, then send that info back so you can use that info to get free energy without having to spend any energy obtaining it. With the right setup I'm confident you could get arbitrary energy this way, maybe with the end result (perfected over many iterations) looking like a bizarre butterfly effect exploit. As you slightly nudge some gas and suddenly have it sort itself into hot and cold portions.

*** Arbitrarily large, you say? My first thoughts are:

- Free energy: Any time I can cheat gravity by producing more energy going downwards than it takes to move me back up, there's potential for free energy. Even something as simple as a type of revolving platform where I stand and spawn / despawn a huge boulder would work.

- Efficient transportation: Rockets are very weight sensitive, could I be used to bring massive quantities of rocket fuel out of earth's gravity well for free? Can I bring massive containers full of food and water to areas that need it?

- Put stuff in stasis: Does stuff in hammerspace experience time? How about environmental effects like oxygen? Can I save a dying person or organ by putting them in hammer space and bringing them to a hospital? Can I transport sensitive instruments, medicine, and other things with special conditions without disturbing them?

- Illicit activities: Someone with this ability could become a perfect smuggler, get past any kind of security checkpoint, perform all kinds of spying / corporate espionage. The criminal route could be used to make jaw-dropping amounts of money, which could then be put to whatever other kind of use you need (buying political influence?)

- Messing with material physics: What /exactly/ happens when I put stuff in hammerspace and take it out? How does it interact with gasses? Can I abuse it to fuse things together? Can I take reacting thermite and put it in the middle of an enclosed space to cause an explosion? I'm sure there's a lot of things that I don't know about here, I'd consult a real material physicist and get them to develop good experiments

- Learn the secrets of other-dimensional physics: By getting help from real physicists, experiment to find out exactly how my hammerspace power works. Make devices to replicate it, if possible. If things get put in hammerspace instantly, figure out to abuse the FTL transportation to make some kind of signalling system that can get information from the future and win at everything. If not, the idea of inter-dimensional spaces is interesting enough. Maybe we could learn to fold space in interesting ways, that has more than a few uses.

Probably, though you have to do the work to move the boulder. Since I was asking this based on my personal urban fantasy universe, you're a supernatural creature with an unimaginable amount of inertia, so you can physically lift it. But repeatedly moving it might wear you out. Still likely possible on some scale though - though all your own energy comes from the sun, so it's probably not /proper/ free energy, but it's away to use the "arbitrarily powerful solar panels" on your body to make electricity, so that's pretty neat.

Yes, in 1:1

#+begin_quote
  Is it one large space, an arbitrary number of pocket universes, one for each item, or something in between?
#+end_quote

It is one large space, but you can e.g. create an arbitrarily large number of bags to put your items in (but the bags have to be large enough to fit the items: the bags aren't hammerspace)

#+begin_quote
  Is there an atmosphere in hammerspace, or can you change that?
#+end_quote

Not sure on this one. Things in hammerspace don't get destroyed, they are put in a sort of suspended animation. If you put a living thing in hammerspace it would asphyxiate, so it's definitely not a breathable atmosphere.

#+begin_quote
  How does gravity work in hammerspace?
#+end_quote

Not sure. I'd assume it wouldn't exist, or if it did, it would cause things you're carrying in hammerspace to want to fall towards the centre of the earth if you were to "let them go".

#+begin_quote
  What's the topology of hammerspace?
#+end_quote

Hammerspace is a 4D hyperplane(???? I can give you a proper answer if you really want, husband's a mathematician) upon which the 3D universe is one "slice" - so you store things in hammerspace by putting them "perpendicular to reality" and holding them there (you yourself are a 4D being who is living in the 3D world, so your items in hammerspace are being stored elsewhere on your 4D form in a series of backpacks/etc). The 4D universe is barren though; there's nothing of interest to you there. It's just been constructed by Magic because it can let you do a bunch of magical things (e.g. hammerspace). i.e. the 3D universe is where it's at.

#+begin_quote
  Does it have an entrance, or do thing's simply appear?
#+end_quote

You make things appear and disappear by pulling them into and out of hammerspace using your 4D arms

#+begin_quote
  What happens when an entrance intersects something, or when something tries to appear where something else is?
#+end_quote

Basically, you wouldn't be able to pull something out of hammerspace and into something else anymore than you can park two cars in the same parking spot. That is to say, you could probably displace the thing you want to displace, but you'd end up with a damaged car in the next parking spot over.

#+begin_quote
  What is and object? Is an explosion an object?
#+end_quote

Anything you can grab and manipulate. Weight is not an issue, though - as a 4D being you have unimaginable inerta. So an explosion is not an object, no, since you can't pick it up.

#+end_quote

That's useful, and definitely a point of interest for further research. Cars are the most dangerous things people interact with on a daily basis, after all. It's pretty much an instant ko for anything you drop something on, and since large rocks are not rare, it's not like you'll have a lack of anything to drop. Also, it's likely to be useful for resolving aoe effects. The colision obviously imparts some kind of 4 dimensional momentum onto whatever gets hit, but how does that eventually resolve? Does the boulder and whatever it's sitting on start chemically fusing together? Do they slide off each other? Do they just sit there, locked in place?

Gravity in 4 dimensions follows r^{3} instead of r^{2,} so unless you invoke magic bullshit^{tm} gravity shouldn't bleed into the 4th dimension.

my husband has assured me that using the particular type of 4D physics he has in mind means you can basically do any magic you want. I'm not 100% sure how this is, but I'm not trying to make the magic too logical, just logical enough that it's not obviously problematic: tons of stuff can still happen under the hood.

  The colision obviously imparts some kind of 4 dimensional momentum onto whatever gets hit, but how does that eventually resolve?
#+end_quote

I always go back to Flatland to inform my intuition here. Suppose I have a poker chip on my table. If I press on the edge of it, the opposite edge will be displaced upwards (so: 3D object would have its other side "disappear"). If I press on it down and sidewards, it will move in the direction I pushed it (so: 3D object that is displaced will move in whatever direction the displacing object was moved in from). I press down on the centre of it with my finger, perfectly vertically with no horizontal component, and I'm strong enough, I end up punching a hole through my table that the poker chip falls through (so: a 3D object that is displaced with velocity ONLY in the 4th dimension will seem to disappear altogether [really: floats around in hyperspace] and be replaced by whatever displaced it.)

#+begin_quote
  Does the boulder and whatever it's sitting on start chemically fusing together? Do they slide off each other? Do they just sit there, locked in place?
#+end_quote

So, per the above, they slide off each other. I think it would be very difficult to impart force in such a way as to be able to "pop" an object out of the 3rd dimension, as e.g. pushing a rock down, the shape of the rock would be enough to impart a lateral velocity on whatever it was displacing.

** You are a group of vampire hunters in an Urban Fantasy version of 2017 Chicago.

Vampires are a shadowy power controlling government, law enforcement and the letter agencies by manipulating or enthralling humans from behind the scenes. So they have access to all the tools of these institutions - warrants, arrest orders, satellites, undercover agents, forensics, cell phone tracking, internet surveillance, GPS trackers, SWAT, black ops teams, media spin, etc. etc. They will spend considerable intelligent, rational effort to eliminate you, including "enhanced" interrogation and faking gas explosions to destroy entire buildings full of civilians. Going to the media or scientists with proof of the supernatural will get you nowhere but six feet under.

Vampires occasionally take direct action in which case they are about three times as powerful as a well prepared and equipped hunter, or six times as strong if the hunter is poorly prepared and equipped.

Vampires can be found alone or in small groups when they are out getting some blood.

You have these goals:

- Maintain a headquarter where you have the equipment, books and mystical artifacts needed give hunters what they need to be considered "well-equipped". This could be but does not need to be a fixed location. The HQ is considered to fit in a shipping container or eighteen wheeler if needed. Hunters need to restock after each fight.
- Avoid detection as your hunters dispatch vampires and visit the HQ to resupply. The vampires are as smart and knowledgeable as you are, have numerical advantage over you and have access to the above mentioned human resources and technology.\\

For this exercise we ignore magic, both hunter and vampire.

*** This question was rather open ended, so I hope you'll excuse a diverse response.

Problems: * Equipment stocking * Communication/Coordination * Avoid detection over time

--------------

Communication Solution: Block-range Wifi Hub/email box that is dropped off and picked up 3 days later. GPS coordinates are given to one hunter, they hide it nearby, other members access via phone while in the area for daily messages. Multi-factor authentication for users (login information + /see below/). Communications role switches based on random computer algorithm, next three locations are given ahead of time (to allow downtime and require 3 compromised operatives to ruin the system). Each hunter has their own hub which they update if they are on the next three. Hunter deaths are reported to the hub to allow rerolls. Upside: hunters never have to meet in person, information system segemented, distributed, asynchronus. Downside: even two GPS tracked hunters will give away current location, no method to verify information after it's in the system.

If no hub shows up for the full 9 days at all 3 locations, the entire system is assumed compromised and must be rebuilt from the ground up out of city.

Equipment Stocking: Using the above system, equipment can be distributed among members, rather than centralized. Since the HQ was only listed as a equipment storage, this dispells the need for one. New equipment would be added to the system via drop locations choosen randomly by the GPS algorithm, as would equipment transfers between members. Other than personal notes and initial "New Equipment Availible" communications, there is no central list of who has what equipment. Hunters must remember who has what they need, or request it of the group. Upside: distributed equipment means no HQ weakness. Downside: Every death could also be a lost of equipment, a system breach can propogate bad equipment.

System Compromise/Long Term Viability: This distributed system is vulnerable at creation time, but barely at all afterward. Destroying a Hub or killing a hunter has minimal effect. The biggest difficulty will be in deciding the authentication factors in such a way that one is individual specific (so that basic social hacking fails) and another that is destroyed on capture (so that interrogation doesn't work). Since magical means are off the table, biometrics (fingerprint) for the first. The second is very difficult, but something like an encryption key USB that is easy to destroy and has a switched mode that requires a button be pressed every 20 minutes or else it wipes itself could serve.

Additionally every hunter has altered login information that, on entry to the system, lists them as captured. They are encouraged to give this information under interrogation. On entry, other hunters are informed of their capture as well as a pre-recorded message (which might include their equipment storage location for retrieval).

--------------

The main weakness of the system described above is that it only takes one very talkative hunter to be interrogated and the vampires can introduce a mole + bad equipment into the system. It's likely the first few captures wouldn't result in a working USB key, but once the vampires knew what to look for it would be possible. If the anti-capture authentication could be strengthened, I'd suspect this type of distributed network to be secure for years.

Secondary weakness is that satellite surveillance of a known dropbox and known members can lead to all hunters eventually being tagged as members due to repeatedly showing up at the correct coordinates (similar to what would happen if they staked out an HQ, but delayed). I don't know much about anti-satellite protections. This could be partially solved by having "cells" centered around a single Hub, with multiple hubs running at once in the city, and using Hub to Hub communication for updating other cells so that members of two different cells never have to meet in person. Downside is communication between cells would be very slow.

**** Thank you for a ton of good ideas! I especially liked the alternate login as a flag for capture.

I also like the "temporary private wifi" solution for communication off the normal internet/phone systems that can presumed to be monitored.

I originally wanted the headquarters to be a location for character interaction, and a cool setting with old books and strange objects in glass boxes, but perhaps a distributed solution is more plausible. It would also be a very different setup from most similar stories.

I have a few spontaneous thoughts/questions:

Not all members of the organization will be trusted with the most valuable assets (ancient books and artifacts). Perhaps not a problem - for example the "library team" could have the books split between them in vans or small trucks and be isolated from the most exposed members by layers of increasingly more trusted members.

I do need opportunity for characters to have interactions face to face. Meetings, mission planning/debriefing, socializing etc.

Since vampires are best confronted in an ambush type of situation and with numerical superiority of around three to one. I guess instead of individual hunters there could be small hunter teams of 3-4 people instead. If they minimize their group activity outside missions and switch clothes and phones often (and other counter-surveillance tactics) they could be almost as safe as a single hunter, have more equipment on hand at short notice and also have face-to-face knowledge that can spot imposters that would otherwise look credible from just wifi chats. They can also redundantly report missing/compromised/rogue hunters.

You have given me lots to think about!

***** Glad you liked it! It definately is a very different and modern way to house a vampire setting. I've put some more thought into this since, I hope you don't mind me spouting more thoughts xD

Regarding sensitive/valuable artifacts: The longer running this organization is, the more seniority and rank can play into things. After all, if you've been participating in raids for a decade without capture, it's rather unlikely you're compromised!

Regarding Face to Face interaction: The main problem with this is the possibility of being tracked by satellite. I've put some thought into this specifically. You'll want a large underground area, the bigger the better but minimum a couple block to a side. Members use random entrances, there are multiple meetup locations inside. Even if the vampires were tracking one member, it would be difficult to figure out who else in a multi-block area they were meeting with. Keeps one compromised character from compromising others :).

Anyother thing is that you could use such an underground system for is housing. Enter underground, take an elevator up into an apartment building on the surface. You could even have multiple hunters living in the same building for team/companionship reasons. Nnever more than 3-4 I'd say, and never knowing where other groups live. If one person moves out, everyone switches building.

This solution somewhat depends on how realistic a Chicago you want. Less realistic and I'd say have the majority of the underground be hollowed out with subways and tunnels and caves. More realistic, and you might have the docks area and it's underside be hunter living grounds. I still argue face to face interaction should be minimized, but (and I'm assuming this is to be a book/rpg) you do want character moments.

Ambush parties: You could definately run this exact same system, but replace individual hunters with small groups and have it work exactly the same. Basically, you get better capture reporting and coordination traded off for worse survivability outside of combat. Which one is better depends on a lot of factors, and if you're writing it you can easily make small groups make more sense than individuals :)

Unrelated improvements/thoughts:

I think it would be safer to change the box movement time from 3 days to directly after a raid. Milly reduces the chance of a capture being use to get into the system.

One of the things I was thinking about was that your hunters would benefit from lots of individual/small group transportation options. Motorcycles galore, I would expect (handlebar mounted shotguns optional).

Another danger is that adding new groups/members to such a system is by design very difficult. Only the most trusted hunters should be able to do so, if it's allowed at all. Safer would be to remake the entire hubs system outside the city every few years. Also would be safer to only recruit new hunters from outside of city, and have training facilities outside the city.

That's basically my way of giving feedback myself :) Brainstorming is great for tickling the idea nerve.

Senior members keeping the "good stuff" is a good idea. They can either be elite squads that handle tougher cases, or perhaps cooperate with regular (trusted) teams as needed.

Regarding satellite tracking, staying indoors/underground, changing clothes and group size, traveling in vehicles/trains etc. can all be used to at least complicate tracking.

For hand-offs and brief meetings, large crowded places are good, and can also be used to see if a member is being followed. If only one member is compromised, the others can safely observe them before making contact. For longer meetings/socializing, paths can be taken that makes following obvious or at least extremely difficult/risky for the pursuer.

Definitely going to go with small teams of 3-4, that work solo some of the time but gather when needed for non-trivial missions or as backup when things go south. Teams make sense for many reasons; standing guard while sleeping, identity verification, human contact/bonding/loyalty, different people can go get food to avoid patterns, etc.

Motorcycles are good, but cars have the advantage that you can't see who's in it from a satellite or rooftop, so both are useful.

New members could be recruited either by very trusted hunters (which exposes the most valuable members) or by the teams themselves, and access to the network granted only after multiple successful missions. Until they are accepted they communicate with burner phones, notes, or a specific "recruitment wifi" that is handled much in the same way as the main network but is separated from it and only used to communicate with new recruits.

Thanks again for the good ideas!

Empower a handgun, with the possible prerequisite of moving to the US and getting a concealed carry permit.

Also empower an undershirt (for armor) and dress shoes and a belt for other utility.

** You are capable of generating a substance that instantly implements all non-mental processes an organism would undergo over some span of time given healthy conditions. So if you give ten years' worth to a one-year-old, you'll wind up with an infant mind in an eleven-year-old body. If you give the right amount to someone with a fresh wound, then if they were capable of recovering from it, they will (at the cost of physically being older by however much time it would have taken them to recover naturally). The substance can't regenerate, say, amputated limbs in humans, because humans don't naturally regenerate their amputated limbs; however, if you, say, find a lizard that regenerates its tail when it's chopped off, you can use it to regenerate that, and you can use it on humans to regenerate things that humans naturally regenerate, like blood or the liver.

There are several obvious health risks posed by the substance: of course it can kill you if you take enough of it to age to death; and amounts that naively seem safe can still give you any health problem that could randomly develop in the equivalent amount of time, like cancer. Also be careful giving it to pregnant women - it'll skip over time for both the mother and the fetus, which is good within reasonable bounds, but leads to body horror stuff if you go over those reasonable bounds.

How do you optimize benefit to society from this substance? There are surely some good uses on humans, but there seem to be much more unambiguously good uses in food production.
