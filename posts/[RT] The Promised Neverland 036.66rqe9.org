** ... That's pretty cool. Honestly, I feel like the story could totally end here. Add a few pages, or a short epilogue that says "Now everyone is safe", and it would be basically okay.

****** I was going to say /no/, given several of these things have broken at fairly low stresses, but I have a few spare so I thought I might as well test the theory. It held my weight for probably 10-20 seconds before breaking, with mild wriggling (I estimate in the range of 1.2-1.5g). So probably yes, actually.
