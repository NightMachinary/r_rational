** This chapter was actually rather pleasant- with all the crusading and battles it's been a while since we've had a real conversation between Catherine and her band of merry men that didn't revolve around killing people.

** I was originally a bit disappointed when I realized this is just kind of intermission before negotiations. But it turned out to be actually quite a great chapter. I really liked that author has shown more about Cat's thought process and reasoning.

Even since first time her idea of Liesse Accords was mentioned, I seriously doubted their feasibility. They could work, if she fought traditional war. But what she has against her is religious Holy Crusade, backed (and directed?) by angels them self. And it has been shown that Choirs are not really that big on forgiveness or compromise.

This chapter also got me thinking about Malicia again. I'm actually starting to like idea of Cat getting back into some sort of alliance with her. If she could negotiate some kind of equal partnership. Like it or not Malicia is actually kind of mild and rational villain. If Praes gets destroyed and population purged, there could rise someone much more worse from the ashes.

** I always get frustrated by Cat's arc right now. It's well written... It's fun.

But it keeps on showing that she and Black should still be working together closely.

Black broke with Malicia because she tried to pull a capital E EVIL move for the first time.

This is also why Cat doesn't like Malicia.

But here's the thing... it's a sunk costs fallacy. Liesse is gone. It's done. There is a crusade coming.

Why does Cat still hate Black?

***** Black lied to her repeatedly, gave Assassin the code phrase she and Black use to determine they are each other so that Assassin could fool and manipulate her to further Black's plots.

Black deliberately drew up a battle plan which would end in her being enslaved by Diabolist after Akua murdered an entire cities worth of Callowans. Catherine ultimately had to resort to abandoning her humanity and Name, becoming a magical construct with an imprint of the old Catherine's personality instead of the values for which she was willing to sign on with evil.

Even the crustiest, saltiest old bitch in the world can't help but wince at the sight of where Black's mentorship has led Cat. She has mutilated her own soul in ways that that impress fucking /Diabolist/. Because of Black's influence.

** For this entire story I have had no idea what's coming next. But I might know now. An agreement is reached. Procer returns home. Heroes head off to another fight, maybe against Black. Both are promised safe passage by Cat. Larat betrays Cat and attacks the army, now without heroes to protect them.
