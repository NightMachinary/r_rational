** Tsukuyomi (the ability to put someone in an illusion/simulation which you control completely for long subjective periods of time which take place over a sidereal instant by making eye contact with them using your magical red eyes) is a great example of how different authors can take the same idea and do radically different things with it.

In [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhM4cEbYlUU][/Naruto/]], which is where the concept originated, the power is used in a rather boring fashion; Itachi nails Kakashi with Tsukuyomi in the middle of combat, then simply tortures Kakashi by crucifying him and sticking a sword in and out of him for three subjective days. As a result, Kakashi is left comatose and requires the aid of a medical expert to heal the damage to his mind before he recovers. The exact same thing would have happened if Itachi used some technique that did disabling physical damage to Kakashi's body; the only difference is flavor.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/4/Time-Braid][/Time Braid/]], which is the greatest of all Naruto fanfictions, the power is used /much/ more creatively. Sasuke makes eye contact with Sakura in the middle of a classroom, which allows him to place her under Tsukuyomi. First, he tortures her for information, obviously. But then he uses pain/pleasure conditioning to brainwash her, rewarding her when she follows orders and punishing her when she doesn't. He forces her to commit disgusting and embarrassing acts to break her will. He tricks her into thinking she is out of the illusion and tortures her horribly when she attempts to escape or ask for help. In the end, Sakura is left a brainwashed puppet, and only escapes with the aid of some loophole abuse. Then she goes to the same medical expert that heals Kakashi in canon to learn how to heal her mind, but is still unable to fix herself until she resorts to human experimentation on a willing volunteer to refine her techniques.

And here, of course, Tsukuyomi is used to set the scene for a battle of wits. Baroness Kohl traps Missy in the illusion while in the middle of a supposedly non-lethal duel. Kohl doesn't quite have the intent to kill that the Uchiha brothers do, so she just tries to frighten Missy into insanity at first, then when that doesn't work she drops in to investigate in person and gets her world turned upside down. After a whole chapter of argument, Missy is able to escape the illusion by convincing Kohl that its in her own best interests to release her.

**** [[/u/erwgv3g34][u/erwgv3g34]] is using rot13 to hide the text since the plot points being discussed are major spoilers.

Just copy and paste the text to [[https://rot13.com/][rot13.com]] and it will be readable. Don't know why it couldn't have been covered by regular reddit spoiler black boxes.
