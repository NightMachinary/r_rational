Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Starting in January, I'll be running a new D&D campaign, and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1myLJHKWlukHTvJQuVMC0AxEj93i1xr1Te3xQpJ6K5jE/edit?usp=sharing][here is the provisional worldbuilding doc]]. It is, as usual, hampered by my unwillingness to write custom rules for everything, and by my desire to be accommodating to whatever races or classes people want to play, and it will undoubtedly expand in whatever direction the players push it in. I don't really /need/ feedback, but would appreciate anything you think might be cool, given what's there.

*** Whenever a setting includes gods of conceptual niches, I imagine a god of ignorance that nobody knows about, and a goddess of secrecy who's kind of jealous of how much harder she has to work than he does. This plays out interestingly in a world as thinly known as the one you describe.

The intersection between D&D necromancy and copyclans seems potentially fertile for all kinds of shenanigans. Can you animate a copyclan corpse as an undead? Can you shave off a bit of copyclan soul using a soul jar and killing a few bodies? How does vampirism or lycanthropy or such things work?

I'm imagining a copyclan (or several) being employed as a musical instrument, sort of like a pipe organ, except instead of pipes you have clan members instructed to sing their note when the contraption's hammer taps them or whatever. Could a bard use this arrangement as an implement to cast spells?

The weight- and friction-manipulating metamaterials could be rigged up to make pretty intricate counterweighted elevator systems, particularly for getting up and down the wizards' towers. I can imagine having to interact with one of those in detail could be lots of fun.

** I've been wondering, in an Isekai-like scenario, what if the physical laws as you know them from this world aren't the same over there?

Sure, things on the surface level look the same - anything else would be exceedingly hard to write and even more so to film - but we regularly see things in fiction that would be physically impossible in the real world. Flying creatures with wing spans wholly insufficient for their prodigious mass, superhuman strength allowing you to throw a punch orders of magnitude stronger than a calculation on mass and speed would suggest, swords that cut through plate... (I'm deliberately only listing things that appear mundane without the "It's magic!" handwave).

Someone trying to introduce chemical warfare(or of course its less violent applications) in a pseudo-medieval world might run into an impenetrable wall when it turns out the basic building blocks of matter aren't atoms but the classical elements of fire, earth, wind and water. Or even phlogiston of all things.

How would a transplanted, rational person adjust when they have no guarantee that the laws they know still hold true. How would you even test that for example conservation of energy still applies? I touched on this in the fic I started some months ago and currently the protagonist assumes that the atomic model doesn't hold true but the basic building blocks of creation can have inherently magical properties, mainly because of the existence of alchemy. Mix some common flowers and foodstuffs and suddenly you get a magical substance(Skyrim, if you're wondering).

*** Hmmmm. First question - how is the /protagonist's/ body still working? If the universe runs on different rules - then how does that affect the flow of his blood, the beating of his heart, the firing of his neurons? Human bodies are made to work under /our/ laws, not theirs.

I can see four options:

- It doesn't. Protagonist dies. Unless the rest of the story is going to be about people in the other world learning things from his body, this is probably not the way to go.
- It just works. Somehow, for no easily apparent reason, his body remains healthy under the rewritten rules of reality. The question of "but /how?!?/" is never explicitly answered.
- For some reason, there's a skintight field around Protagonist inside which the laws of his home universe apply, and /not/ the laws of This Place. This allows for various shenanigans, where he can put things in his mouth to prevent local laws from applying to them. (Example: Evil Wizard makes a potion of Bad Stuff. Protagonist drinks it, but magic in the potion instantly stops working because it wouldn't work in his world...)
- Protagonist has a new body. There may be visible differences (his tattoo is gone, his skin is all a single colour without shading, perhaps he isn't exactly human anymore and merely humanoid...) but his body is simply running entirely on the new rules, and his brain was copied over (he /thinks/ it was copied without change, but really, how would he /know/?)

**** Hm, for most Isekai it will be the new body route, though often visually indistinguishible from the original.

As for my fic, it's a bit more complicated - what we know as the real world is a simulation run by unknown powers, who then transfer the protagonist into another simulation modeled after Skyrim. So the only thing he can be sure of is his own consciousness.

** A sci-fi tabletop setting has been brewing at the back of my mind for some time.

Basically, FTL is extremely cheap and fast as long as there are relatively few gravitational bodies around. Therefore, a civilization from outer systems of a galaxy can easily travel to other similar systems, even those from other galaxies. Travel speed and cost rises exponentially with star density so inner layers of galaxies are largely unexplored. This satisfies Fermi Paradox in my mind. Central star systems are also more resource rich to incentivize exploration.

FTL capable ships travel using complex navigation systems to avoid gravitational fields and park at the outskirts of their destination system. Smaller vessels with sublight engines are then used to reach planets and moons. Such travels usually take days or even weeks to enable space opera type shenanigans.

This type of FTL also makes space +dungeons+ stations very important since you can simply jump on top of them.

*** One of the problems with FTL in a post-discovery-of-relativity world is that either relativity is wrong in some unknown way, /or/ FTL is functionally equivalent to time travel.

(I won't say impossible. Relativity makes it take infinite energy to reach the speed of light, but if you can somehow bypass that exact speed and just transition instantly from sublight to FTL in some way - well, relativity doesn't have anything in it that prevents you from doing so with finite energy. Not that I know of, anyhow).

And what do I mean by time travel? Simple. You can take a ship to Alpha Centauri, spend some time visiting the tourist places there, buy a few souvenirs, then return to Earth... a couple of months before you left. What happens if you then /prevent/ yourself from leaving is an... /interesting/ question.

Now, the trope of "our FTL isn't functionally equivalent to time travel" /is/ a well-known and well-used trope in sci-fi in general. And there's nothing wrong with making further use of it. But... why /not/ explore the consequences of all FTL travellers having access to a time machine?

The funniest way to take care of the FTL problem would to just make everything smaller. Now you don't need FTL to get across the galaxy, because the galaxy is only a light minute across!

It all comes down to simultaneity. Consider this; when it's six in the morning here, what's the time over at Alpha Centauri?

--------------

Now, one of the central tenets of relativity is this: as long as you are not accelerating, and as long as you are far from any sources of gravity, then you can assume that you are at rest (and everyone else is moving).

So. Let's assume you are in a spaceship, and you want to know what the time is on Alpha Centauri. You can assume that you are at rest; so you fire a beam of light towards Alpha Centauri (where, fortunately, someone has set up a mirror). Two hours later, the reflection gets back to you. Then you know that exactly halfway between when you fired your laser and when you saw the reflection, that moment was simultaneous with the moment that the light beam hit the mirror (that is, it spent one hour going towards Alpha Centauri and one hour heading back to you). Since light always travels at the same speed, it's forced to go the same speed there and back. Neat, simple, and straightforward. Similarly, and assuming you have enough mirrors set up, you can figure out the time conversions between you and any other point in the universe.

However.

While you're sitting pretty at rest, I'm zooming past you in my own spaceship at (say) 80% of the speed of light. Specifically, I'm zooming away from Alpha Centauri (having left the mirror behind...) Since I am not accelerating, I can also assume that I am at rest, fire a beam of light at the mirror, see how long it takes to get back to me, and figure that the moment the beam hits is simultaneous with the moment halfway between. Just like you did. In fact, if we both release our light beams at the moment we pass each other, then the beams will travel exactly with each other all the way there... and back. At least until they get to your ship. You see your beam... but in those two hours, I've travelled 80% of two lighthours further out from Alpha Centauri. So you're going to see that my beam of light has to spend a whole lot longer catching up to me. In fact, according to you, my beam of light spent one hour travelling towards Alpha Centauri... and /nine/ hours catching up with me on the way back.

So, we disagree about which moment on my ship is /simultaneous/ with the light hitting the mirror on Alpha Centauri.

--------------

As long as we can't travel faster than light, this is little more than an odd peculiarity of the universe. But if we /can/ travel faster than light... let's say that we can travel from anywhere to Alpha Centauri in five seconds. If you go from your ship to Alpha Centauri - a distance of one lighthour - in five seconds according to the reference frame of your ship, then I just saw you step back into the past. If you then go from Alpha Centauri back to your ship in five seconds according to the reference frame of /my/ ship... well, then you get to meet your younger self.

** What are some historical figures that it'd be interesting to make a rational!character out of?

Preferably ones that haven't already been done and staying away from those who are heavily saturated in alternate history. I'm sure rational!Hitler, rational!Joan of Arc, rational!Lincoln, or rational!Caesar have been done in some form. Plus they should be figures where making them a rationalist would heavily change things one way or another.

"Great Man" historiography is appealing, and I think that it gets too much of a bad rap. That being said, a rational approach to history would acknowledge that history isn't just the actions of individuals, but also largely caused by collective social and environmental forces.

There are many iconic people whose choices one way or another wouldn't create nearly as many butterflies as one would think.

Still, there are plenty of figures whose actions or inactions created waves that shaped human history as we know it.

It gets a bad rap because, in its original form, it completely ignores the social and environmental forces which you acknowledge as also influential. Any other formulations of the Great Man theory are defensive revisions along the same lines as a theologian who is trying to incorporate scientific discoveries without giving more ground than necessary.

Yes, the actions of particular individuals can have a marked influence on the course of history, but we risk confusing our terms if we conflate that admission with the idea that history is solely determined by the actions of specific individuals whose unique genius had little or nothing to do with their environment.

*** How about a rational [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)][Julian]]?

He was the last emperor of the Constantinian dynasty and grew up in a treacherous environment that saw many of his family members killed before he reached adulthood. Nevertheless he managed to become emperor and by many accounts was a solid one.

To my mind, he had a mostly solid grasp on the problems surrounding Rome's decline, except for a decidedly nonrational religious streak that put him at odds with the existing christian power structure and arguably led to his death.

A more rational take of the character would be a great way to explore the Late Roman Empire and all the struggles that led to his decline. I tend to see his reign as one of those big inflection points where it could have changed directions, but instead accelerated the fall.

Ripe for exploration, but generally overlooked in historical fiction.

*** One idea I had was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawus][rational!Kawus]], the more politically/militarily experienced and socially radical brother of the much more famous Khosrow I. This was a highly malleable time in Iranian history and Old World history as a whole.

They were contemporaries of Justinian the Great. The sun was setting on Antiquity. Less than 75 years after Khosrow's death Islam was spreading and the the Empire was collapsing under the Umayyads.

Without getting too long-winded, the idea I had was Kawus managing to seize and consolidate power instead of being passed over and brutally destroyed. Becoming a more fanatical Constantine for the Mazdakite movement which already had sympathies in the establishment, including Kawus' father, Kavadh I.

Many of the reforms under Khosrow would be common sense for any relatively ambitious king and some of them would feed more into a Mazdakite revolution. Plus a rational!Kawus would avoid some of the more egotistic posturing of the OTL and could take advantage of diplomatic and economic opportunities.

Keep in mind that despite brutal repression under Sassanian reign, the Mazdakites had successor movements that persisted in Iran for centuries afterwards.

I assume you mean if they were /more/ rational as individuals, which certainly applies to someone like Hitler who was straight up bananas. Rational Joan of Arc doesn't go out of her way to leave the village and take the incredibly low probability path of “holy virgin that inspires and leads armies to victory”, and not sure Lincoln or Caesar deserve to not be considered fairly rational in the first place.

What about rational!James the VI of Scotland and I of England, “the wisest fool in Christianity”?
