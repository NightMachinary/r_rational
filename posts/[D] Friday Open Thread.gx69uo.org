Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

** I have been on mandatory 50-hours-a-week overtime for about 3 months now (energy sector "essential" work). There have been times in the past when I exceeded this by a fair margin, but never mandatory and never for this long.

This combined with canceling my regular weekly sports because of COVID has had a very detrimental effect on my mood. My wife said "I miss my husband" last night, and I can't say that she's wrong. Even when I'm home I feel exhausted and moody.

And now the workload looks like it may be increasing, and they're wondering if they'll have to increase hours worked further. I'm thinking of bailing out, and I'm actually considering getting into programming/coding instead. I noticed that I love building excel worksheets to automate all the things I have to do regularly at work, and I figured that's pretty similar to coding.

With an eye toward employability, would you guys recommend taking a "Coding Bootcamp" class? Or is just knowing how enough? I finished all of the challenges at [[https://www.learnpython.org/]] a few years ago, but when tried to do The Python Challenge, I got stuck on the 3rd one because I couldn't figure out how to make Python interact with another program on my computer or the internet.

Anyway, just wanted to vent and say a month of "quarantine" sounds really nice about now.

*** Unless you're sitting on a huge nest egg or your wife can shoulder the family's expenses for the foreseeable future, giving up your job is a very risky gamble right now. Worrying about employment is way more stressful than any 50 hour week.

If you're thinking about a major career transition, it's safer to first give yourself time to sleep on it and set up foundations. Don't bail out on a "grass is greener" mentality.

In the meantime, look for ways to wind down after a long day/week. Maybe ask your wife for her input? It sounds like both of you are honest with your feelings and there's a lot of stress relieving activities that are made infinitely easier with a partner.

*** In my personal experience, Coding Bootcamps are a gamble, but also the fastest way to switch to a programming career.

The more you need out of a Coding Bootcamp, the harder you will have to work AND the less likely the gamble will pay off. If you just need work experience to put on your resume so companies don't skip you over, (Coding Bootcamps should have a big capstone project), it honestly isn't much of a gamble. You are trading in money for time.

If you need to learn actual coding/need help passing technical interviews/etc., then it depends on how badly you want to get out of your current position. It will require a lot of hard work and constant networking to make it pay off. I'm not sure if it's worth it in general, but it may be worth it for you.

#+end_quote

Sure. Rules exist for the purpose of either actualizing a desired outcome or preventing the actualization of an undesired outcome. "No discussion of US politics" is intended to prevent threads in this subreddit from being derailed. That's an undesired outcome. It's understandable that you would want to prevent that.

But I feel like the reason the Friday thread exists in the first place is to give people a chance to go off the rails and discuss things that aren't appropriate in the rest of the subreddit. Obviously there are more appropriate places to discuss politics, but there are also more appropriate places to discuss different ways to plot meteorological data and the cost of living in Portugal. Sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here.

  I believe that Black Lives Matter
#+end_quote

This subreddit has a blanket ban on US politics. Read the rules before commenting.

To answer some obvious objections: yes, "black lives matter" is considered a political statement, in the same way that I would consider any slogan of a political movement to be itself political, even if the slogan itself is obvious or anodyne when considered by itself.

And yes, a blanket ban on politics favors the status quo, or if not the status quo, then whoever is winning a cultural, ideological, or political war. That said, the cost of allowing politics is that this subreddit becomes yet another battlefield, which it's been in the past. People need places to take care of themselves, escapes from the constant anxiety and tension of the real world, and a subreddit that's primarily for the discussion of fiction /should be/ one of those places.

Yes, this means that it's also a place for odious people to not get confronted about their odiousness, and no, I wouldn't want every place to adopt our policy. I'll also note that this subreddit has a lot of readers who aren't from America (though they might still be impacted by or care about American problems, or have their own similar problems).

On a personal note, I live in Minnesota and have been feeling stressed, anxious, angry, and helpless. I have friends and family living in the Twin Cities that are helping to organize and provide aid to those who need it, both with the protests and riots. This will probably be the last mod note that I write on the subject, and I'll let the other two mods handle reports for a bit, since this particular topic has been wearing pretty heavily on me, and I doubt my ability to remain objective and/or mentally healthy.

**** Understandable. I did not check the rules of this subreddit before I made my comment, just the text in the Friday Open Thread post.

I understand why there is a rule against US Politics in this thread. Other subreddits I frequent have become battlegrounds, with ideological partisans entering on both sides and leaving the subreddit worse for the wear.

With that said, I think that this subreddit should address what is going on outside the boarders of [[/r/Rational]], in a single stickied thread or a one-time post if an ongoing dialogue is not attractive.

Denounce Racism. Denounce Whataboutism in defense of Racism. I believe equality and equity to be the only rational stances on this matter.

We would then have an influx of people here, not for the subreddit, but to argue and complain about the topic, which would require moderation vigilance not only in that thread but on the whole subreddit (in contrast, we get like one report every two weeks, usually).

Heck, even *without* brigading, there's a whole spectrum of political opinions here. It doesn't come up nearly as much anymore (because we banned bringing it up), but there's plenty of people who would be willing to argue the point, and that spills over into vindictive behavior in the whole subreddit.

It is so easy and morally certain to issue a simple statement denouncing racism and state violence.

Surely a rational person can investigate why some people feel they need places away from messages about racial injustice.

Why should we be uncomfortable with discourse on the issue? What do we fear, unmasking those in our midst who hold antiquated, scientifically indefensible biases?

It is easy to halt dialog on an issue, when it doesn't affect you or your community.

"Stick to sports" indeed.

I can't imagine the moderators want to deal with that. I certainly wouldn't. And I doubt that they'd be willing to give you mod power, even if you were willing to volunteer (and you haven't) to do the vast amount of work to keep such a discussion civil.

And I don't blame them: even as someone who agrees with the point you're making, I wouldn't trust someone who starts the discussion by staking out an ideological position to moderate that same discussion fairly.

So, if there's no one who is both deemed suitable and willing to moderate such a discussion on this subreddit, the solution is to take the discussion elsewhere. Which you are free to do.

Look at [[/r/themotte]] or [[/r/slatestarcodex]]. It is no given, at all, that the rationality-adjacent won't have atrocious politics [ I mean even you are a one of those dirty neolibs after all :) ] And at least my own experience has been that in subreddits with nearly a unified voice on the topic, you still get trolls and unwelcome, insane, brutality-apologist posters.

AlexanderWales has made it pretty clear above, I think, that he does not have the energy to deal with that, and I don't think he owes this community any responsibility to do so, even leaving aside that I'd defer to his wisdom on just how bad it might get if it were opened up.

I really get that you may want to engage in political discussion with people who share some of the rationality-adjacent background that's common around here - you might try out [[/r/leftrationalism]], which despite being a socialist sub, would probably make a better political fit than this place anyway.
