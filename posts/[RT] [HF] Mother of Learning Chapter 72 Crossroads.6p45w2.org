** This is perhaps a bit outside the scope of the story (which presumably will not extend long past the time loop), but I've put a bit of thought into Zorian's education of Kirielle -- and education in MoL's magical system in general -- and this seems as good a time as any to discuss it.

Essentially, I think that with the right strategy Kirielle would have a good chance of being well on her way to becoming an archmage before ever entering the academy. There's obviously a great deal of uncertainty in that claim, but I don't think it's as far-fetched as it might initially appear.

Let's talk about shaping skills. We see Kirithishli say this in chapter 15:

#+begin_quote
  Mages of old didn't have the sort of shaping skills modern mages have, so they compensated by making their spells long and hyperspecialized
#+end_quote

I don't think I need to convince anyone that shaping skills are important, but based on this I'm thinking that shaping skills are the foremost distinguishing feature of the Ikosian magical tradition. They're what have allowed it to assimilate techniques from other traditions, and give its mages the flexibility to adapt general-purpose invocations to their needs rather than having a multitude of special-purpose spells. Furthermore, while shaping skills take a long time to hone, once mastered in a variety of areas it's relatively trivial to learn even extremely advanced invocations, so long as you can find someone to teach them. It's also a reasonable assumption that mana control is a fundamental skill that translates between exercises, meaning that all shaping exercises are useful and make it easier to learn others, even in completely different fields of magic.

However, most mages don't seem to attach all that much importance to them: seeing them as useful and a necessary prerequisite for high-level invocations, but not of fundamental importance and a goal to be pursued in and of itself. Ilsa, for example, is a master of her fields but her unstructured telekinesis was outstripped by Zorian in a relatively short amount of time and with less-than-optimal training techniques. Zorian's dedication to honing his shaping skills is seen as something of an eccentricity by others. For example, consider Tinami's reaction in chapter 41:

#+begin_quote
  "Is he as bad as they say?" she asked.

  "He had me do shaping exercises for two hours straight today."

  "Ouch. Okay, I guess that justifies being a few minutes late," she admitted. "We should probably reschedule our future meetings, just in case this keeps happening."
#+end_quote

Also, in chapter 10:

#+begin_quote
  How many people could afford to focus all their energies on shaping exercises? There were so many things vying for the typical student's attention that shaping exercises no doubt ended up near the bottom of their priorities.
#+end_quote

If shaping exercises were considered a core competency, doing two hours of practice a day should not be seen as extreme. Since most shaping exercises take little mana, all mages should be practicing their shaping skills whenever they have a free moment, just like Zorian ends up doing.

In light of this Xvim seems much more reasonable. His "secret test of character" is still a stupid idea, but when he says:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, it is criminal how badly the classes are failing our students," Xvim said. "Such a simple variation of a levitation exercise should not be beyond the grasp of a certified mage. No matter, we shall correct this deficiency before we move on to other matters."
#+end_quote

In chapter 5, I don't think he's being melodramatic or unreasonable. Instead, he is one of the few mages to assign shaping exercises their proper importance in developing a mage to their fullest potential.

So, back to Kirielle. I'm not proposing Zorian goes full-Xvim on her (though by now he can do a pretty impressive Xvim impression); that wouldn't work too well. She is nine, after all. But he should focus on fundamentals: shaping; mana perception; and that technique for assimilating ambient mana. In particular, he should focus on shaping exercises she would find fun. Remember how much she enjoyed the glowing orbs. Unrestricted telekineses is pretty cool as well. If he does it right, she'll be doing shaping exercieses pretty much all the time because she wants to. Since Kirielle is an unregistered mage he can't teach her first-level invocations or higher, but that's okay because I don't think he should teach her any invocations at all. If anything, he should give her the impression that unstructured magic is the normal way of doing things and invocations are more difficult and advanced. Once her skills are good enough he can teach her enough alteration and illusion to get her painting, sculpting, and other artistic things with unstructured magic. At that point, the sky's the limit, especially as shaping exercises don't seem to be very restricted (if at all) and generally don't require much in the way of mana reserves.

Zorian seemed to develop good mana perception in the space of a couple of months with the help of enhancement potions from the grey hunter. Since Zorian's mana perception was so rudimentary, I don't see why Kirielle couldn't learn it in much the same space of time. Zorian should be able to ward against ambient mana. Also he could make puzzles that require mana perception to solve, and give them to her as "toys".

It also might be a good idea to use blood magic to activate her as a mind mage (I suspect this should be somewhat easier in someone with it as a dormant bloodline) and train her. As an "inborn" ability, that also shouldn't be restricted (though it would be ill-advised to tell anyone about the blood magic).

Zorian's had a lot of motivation to improve his abilities, but by following this path, especially with developing mana perception early, I think Kirielle could reach close to his current level in five years or so. In particular, I suspect that developing the fine control to do art with unstructured magic would do wonders for raw mana control. There also may be a underlying link between artistic ability and shaping skill.

Even if their parents keep Kirielle away from Zorian in Cirin, once she has the fundamentals she can keep practicing them herself. She's already pretty adept at keeping her drawing secret. If possible, it would also be useful to get her some training from their grandmother (in secret, obviously).

I'm not quite sure why I put so much thought into this, but I find the image of her mother trying to keep her out of the Academy a few years down the road once she's demonstrated her abilities to Xvim. She would be a vindication of all his arguments with the faculty about the "poor state of magical education".

*** I think 5 years is a stretch due to maturity/diligence, but I do agree with Zorian's guidance, Kirielle is set on the path of greatness. Zorian already knows to a certain extent the best teaching method for Kirielle, due to having insight into her own magic breakthroughs.

If magic utilization follows like most mental skills, picking it up earlier in life will also be easier and set a better foundation, e.g. language.

*** the biggest issues are just discipline and temperament. even if Zorian can give her things that she finds interesting to do, she'll still have to do the more boring stuff at some pt (and the boring stuff are also pre-req to the more adv and interesting things anyways). even then, no matter how interesting something can get, if you're still incompetent or even if you did find it interesting, doing something repetitively for 2 hours straight (especially everyday) can get old real fast.

the reason Zorian could improve so much is a couple of factors that Kirielle doesn't really have. as mentioned, discipline. he was already naturally a more studious and serious person. he knows what he wants to do and needs to do and follows through with it. Kirielle's a lot more random and free-spirited and whimsical, especially as a nine year old. second, Zorian had other motivations keeping him going, both intrinsic and extrinsic. intrinsic, he finds a lot of the exercises fun by default as long as he doesn't have to go ham with them. he also had a bunch of goals that he /had/ to achieve and shaping exercises were somewhat necessary for that to happen

so unless Kirielle turns out /very/ serious about learning magic and sticks with it and/or turns out to be very naturally gifted, 5 years reaching Zorian's /current/ lvl is quite frankly insane (remember, Zorian's been in there what 10 years in loop now was it? or was that Zach's timeframe)

**** In Chapter 62 Zach mentions Zorian has been in the loop for roughly five years. There's also about five years left in the loop.

You're right, Kirielle doesn't have the work ethic or motivation of Zorian, and she's starting from scratch. However, she pursues her drawing with a great deal of dedication and one of my main points is that Zorian could leverage that with shaping exercises that appeal to her artistic inclinations. If she got to the point where she was capable of that, I could easily see her spending many hours every day essentially doing shaping exercises without thinking of them as tedious practice. This alone wouldn't give her the same variety as Zorian, but it would give her excellent raw mana control.

The main reason I think this might be plausible is mana perception. It's clear that the grey hunter potion can speed up the acquisition of the ability greatly, which makes me think that with the appropriate training techniques (e.g magical training toys) it might be possible for her to acquire it, even as a neophyte mage. Mana perception makes it much easier to learn and refine shaping exercises, but it's not clear just how large an effect this is. I'm guessing it would make practice somewhere between two and ten times more efficient. Also, with instant feedback -- by being able to see the mana -- it would likely be rather less tedious.

If the advantages of mana perception and Zorian's guidance roughly balance out her lack of Zorian's single-minded dedication, I think the timeframe could roughly match up.

***** Hindsight is 20/20, sure, but he didn't do too badly. Xvim's laser focus on shaping exercises led to his discovery that shaping skills make everything better, and he also used impressive shaping to brand himself as precocious and get extra mentoring from Ilsa.

Granted, he eventually found out that the very best foundation would have been focusing on mana sensing from day one. But his "all shaping, all the time" approach was still quite effective, miles ahead of standard academy material.

**** I disagree with this. Drill-based arithmetic and algebra training is not the most efficient way of creating children with a talent and thirst for Math, but it is very good at destroying most children's love for math, as well as teaching many skills that are not terribly important---being slow adding numbers or not being terribly good at my 7--12 multiplication tables, as far as I can tell, does not hinder me my Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry classes.

And yet, this drill-based method is the de facto method of training in our world, which is a world where the internet makes the sharing of pedagogy methods very easy. In our world, especially in the US, teaching methodology is hardly optimized. If that can be true of one of the richest countries in the world, then it can certainly be true of Zorian's world.

*** I'm really with you on this one. Zorian has spent time teaching Kirielle in the past and has taken notes on what methods she responds well to.

If he begins with mana control, mana sensing, and using unstructured mana to create art of some kind, I bet you her control would be astounding by age twelve, thus opening up things like early mastery of high efficiency combat spells, divination, work with dimensional barriers, and so on. He really could help her a lot.

********* Fair enough about the possibility of someone carrying off the crown, but this seems like a problem that would be solvable by just adding a few more restarts - purple-beam the Lich, rush to Ibasa at the beginning of the next restart to see what happens to it (he seems their main combat asset, and they probably don't have much of a contingency to deal with what amounts to him simply collapsing without warning all of a sudden) and purple-beam everybody you encounter. If you do it right, by the third restart, the island will suddenly and inexplicably turn into a wasteland of corpses so conspicuously that they will have greater worries than looting the Lich's body or organising any sort of defense.

(To me, this more generally makes the choice of "present these five items that exist inside the simulation " as the Gate's access control system appear a little odd - the Controller is already given nearly divine powers with respect to everything in it, which would only be exacerbated if they did in fact have the full 100 years' worth of looping available; in the worst case, a sufficiently ruthless Controller could just wipe every living thing but themselves from it, leaving spatial separation and any inanimate security systems as the only thing standing between them and the access token.)

** Did Zorian just send a simulacrum of himself on a date with Taiven?

About the part with Kirille, she does need to stay in the same village as her parents, she could move to Cyoria where nobody knows about her grandmother being a witch, so the argument that she will be hated is a moot point, although Zorians mother might disagree.

Some remarks about earlier discussions and Red Robe: Red Robe probably left as soon as possible after the confrontation with Zorian, which explains why he cannot be tracked using the marker method Zorian uses, since by that time, RR has already left the time loop.

On an afterthought, Orissa does not really sound like a nice person to me, quite a lot as Zorians parents, but that might be exactly the reason why Damien likes her so much.

edit: I got the idea that the Zorian who went on adate was a simulacrum since the break introduces the new Zorian as Simulacrum number two, which looks like the part before was simulacrum number 1.

***** Good point, but Zorian has also expressed that he wants to reform how natural mind mages are trained, since he doesn't want others to have the same shitty experiences that he had.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian decided that if he ever managed to escape from the time loop alive, he was going to write a book about psychic powers to make sure people like him don't have to jump through the same hoops he had to in order to master their abilities. He wasn't sure how much of his knowledge would be transmissible through a simple written medium, but he would try.

Being an old witch, she is likely to be useful to Zorian; at the very least, she can prepare him for a future contact with Silverlake. Not to mention that it would likely to be an important step in repairing his family and improving post-loop relationships, which is something he probably would not object to.

Also, while his mother has every reason to be freaked out for Kiri being perceived as a witch, it's only a matter in Cirin, a pretty backwards town. Should she move to Cyoria, a homebase of the /House Aope/ among other things, and people wouldn't care. So it's not a good enough reason to ruin her dreams.

***** If I'm understanding your first question, you're wondering if Zach dying somehow kills the other controllers instead of resetting the loop? It doesn't, it just resets the loop.

The primordial isn't the usual trigger for ending the loop, despite the attempt to summon it. The loop ends around 2 or 3 AM (can't remember the exact time), and this chapter is an example of how it doesn't matter if it's even being summoned, the loop ends at the time regardless of that.

If Zorian is paying attention to his marker, he can actually tell that the reset switch is activating automatically as it happens. It was noted in the chapter in which the primordial was summoned.

For your 2nd question, chapter 55 sums it up pretty well, the energy expenditure is per iteration, it's not dependent on the length of the restart, there had been 967 iterations, and 52 remained. Since they weren't used fully (Controller died early), Zach has only been in there for 30 years instead 80ish. This also links with your 1st question, as to how we know the loop doesn't continue on without the Controller (Zach only, possibly RR, but unlikely).

** So, I started reading MoL a week or two ago from a recommendation post in this thread.

I saw, oh, it has tons of chapters, was started a while ago, and the way the guy is talking it up, it must be complete, right?

...nope, as I discovered yesterday.

Argh, I'm gonna have binge withdrawal soon. Great story.

*** :D My dad finally read it recently on my recommendation and hit the same thing.

Updates are pretty regular though. If the third arc is of similar length to the first two, I estimate completion in March next year.

**** Arc 1: 26 chapters Arc 2: 28 chapters (54 total) Arc 3: ~27 chapters? (81 total)

That means 9 more chapters, which indeed would put us in 2018 March. I don't see a thorough wrap up in nine chapters (and I do hope this arc goes on quite a bit longer. I'd like ~35 chapters in Arc 3, which would put the end in 2018 August. However, if only one key is needed for root access to the Sovereign Gate, I don't think that will be necessary.

I'd also like to see a bunch of chapters after they exit the gate just to show where things are going with everyone.

** Wouldn't Zorian's gainz be reverted when the cycle ends? He hasn't been physically aging this entire time, so we know his physical body isn't sent back, but his mind is - how does he know working out would, well, work?

*** Yep, he's explicitly planning for when he gets out of the loop

#+begin_quote
  Once he was out of the time loop, he'd probably end up working on his physique on his own initiative, just so he could maintain the sort of pace he was used to by now

Work out plans are for after the loop ends.

***** Psychologically, that would get old fast. Can you imagine going to the gym at the start of the month and only squatting 135 lbs, and in 2 weeks you're strong enough to squat 185 lbs...only for the reset to happen and you're back to 135 lbs.

****** Well, I would go full-bore while in the loop. More like getting in the habit of getting up a little early in the morning, and found for a run for five minutes. And doing, like, one push-up.

The point is you get your mind used to exercising, that's all.

** By the way, an earlier chapter mentioned that Zorian can't fully integrate his simulacra because it would take too long, so he just gets summaries. Maybe that's part of the reason they can't easily pass on language learning.

But he does have spare time each restart with not much to do and no simulacra currently running, in the three Black Rooms. Might be a good time to digest comprehensive memory packets.
