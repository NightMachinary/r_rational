** Most of the background information on Aeria will come from Aeria itself in the form of in-world texts and things of that nature. The inhabitants of Aeria have a specific perspective on their world, which may not perfectly map to the world's true nature.

I'm curious what sort of munchkining this magic system will allow. Its very powerful and its /known/ to be very powerful, but there are probably still 'cheeky' uses for it that I haven't thought of.

** This is probably minor, but I dislike how the term magic is being used to represent both the 'motes' that are manipulated to perform spells and the spellcraft itself. I would have used 'mana' instead.

*** I can see how it might be grammatically confusing, I'll try to come up with a name for the motes themselves, but I really dislike using 'mana' because of the cultural weight already attached to the word. People have specific ideas relating to mana, and I don't want how they view Aeria's magic system to be handicapped by use of terms that occur in other works of fiction. At the same time, I don't want to use something completely out there, I could make up any word that I wanted for it, but doing this too often clouds reading clarity once you go past a certain threshold, wherein the characters just start talking in what sounds like technobabble gibberish. I dunno, any suggestions?
