** Wow, that ending was great. At the start of the chapter I was like "What if Kirielle interrupts the soul healing, did he seriously forget about that?".........I like what he did much more

Massive catharsis though. Also if leaving means you wake up normally, then we really have no clue who red robe is. Assuming it is not veyers attendant. And i seriously doubt that.

So plans around plans. We are on to the start of the final battle. Also I wonder were silverlake went :D

Remember the primordial said that RR couldn't get out without him, implying that he incarnated him in a new death-seal-marked body rather than just shove him back in his old body. So he could be anywhere.

***** Yeah, this pretty much opens up RR to being practically anyone again.

Zach's observation that both Silverlake and Zorian were present in later loop iterations means that someone else entirely would have needed to Soulkill Veyers. We know it wasn't Zorian, so that limits it to Zach or (non-Veyers) RR. Zach may seem like a stretch, but we don't know exactly what's hidden as far as any compulsions on him are concerned.

The main hint we got this chapter is that RR evacuated Veyers and Jornak, which is odd, because those two didn't seem to have much value to anyone. They did minor work for the Dragon Cultists, but I didn't feel that they were too important.

****** Not necessarily, remember that Zorian considered the possibility that RR had worked with the Lich, but that the Lich hadn't been able to be made permanent, perhaps because the mark could only be modified in such a way in the first loop it existed in. RR could have given the Lich (or someone else) a temporary mark, and tasked them with soul-killing him the iteration after he left the loop, before their temporary mark lapsed.

That would require a great deal of trust, as the helper would have to carry out the task without RR's presence. It would also require quite a bit of power, as the helper would have to acquire the artifact that does the loop ejection without RR's help, and with only a few loops to practice.

It's definitely more likely that Veyer is simply a link between Zach and RR that RR cut some point soon after becoming permanent, but since both Zorian and Zach avoided the rebellion and Cyoria in general for many, many loops after RR left it's technically possible that a helper got him, without Z or Z noticing loop differences from another actor having loop knowledge for a few loops.

******* Not even remotely likely. First, that's not how the time loop works. If RR didn't have a marker, he wouldn't have been preserved. Whoever got the marker must have had QI's help. Second, Zach wasn't proficient enough in soul perception to make a simulacrum. Third, simulacrums don't have souls, so none of that is possible anyways.

Plus, most of your justifications are already explained by the fact that RR fucked with Zach's mind in order to keep him from figuring out what was going on. The soul killed Veyers was intentionally misleading.

***** That makes sense, although the inference so far was that RR thought that someone exiting the loop would immediately end the simulation, as he didn't do anything to work against them before leaving. That might be explained that he thought there was too big a network to fight and their chances of getting out after him were nil anyway. Which hints at Veyers having been excluded from much earlier, likely when Zach's memories were taken.

The big question is how did RR start, a similar accident to Zorian, already hinted as impossible to reproduce.

Zach might have been captured early one loop by someone affiliated with the invasion but not apart of it, getting QI's help without having him loop as well doesn't sound that doable though. (For either the crown marker being corrupted or splicing the true soul marker intentionally.)

Not had any hint toward it, but I think that leaves the primordial as the only enitiy other than QI likely to have achieved a second marker, some corrupting of the monitors laws.

RR as some one who entered the gate with Zach's help or other means and was contacted by Pax, explains why he was so set on optimizing the invasion without being a direct member.

Theory:

Zach, in an early Loop, went to Red Robe (or an acquintance of his) seeking help - for whatever reason. Presumably they were introduced to each other by Veyers. Between Zach and Red Robe, they managed to provide Red Robe with a Marker. Red Robe then betrayed Zach, swiss-cheesed his memory, covered his tracks by removing Veyers from the simulation, and went off to do his own thing...

******* That's very tidy and likely mostly correct, (barring soul clone or simulacrium shenanigans). Big question is how did they replicate a 'true' marker, QI's crown or skill are the likely avenues but doubtful as QI wasn't looped.

The other big question, why was RR so invested in optimizing the invasion without being a member of those factions, this hints me towards a Panaxath deal requiring it's release.

**** I actually think it could be Jornak, think about this, starting every loop with veyers in the house is sure to get on his nerves after the first few times, ending in him using the dagger to soulkill him, so he use the loops more effective. Also Veyers being the only thing linking him to Zach makes it easy to just erase those memories to go undetected. And he took instant charge of protecting the original Jornak and Veyers after coming out of the loop. Which again points at their importance to him. Bevore he left the loop he had no idea if the house was found out by Zorian and Zach, so why protecting it first thing out of the loop if he is not RR. Then again could still be a false lead. But i dont think so..

Then again how did RR get the dagger... something which took ZZ forever... and he knew about the exit...

Maybe Veyers because of his poor marks got some help from his friend Jornak to enter the TimeRoom , so he could study and catch up. While doing this they got assaulted by Panaxeth or got in contact with the one, who got corrupted and brougt into the timeloop by Panaxeth. in Chapter 54: its said "the royals are afraid someone is going to steal their sovereign gate and check up on it constantly " . Which could be the necessary connecion to the dagger. Kinda weird that Zorian never tried to meet one of those royals and mindslave him to bring him the dagger... maybe even Krantin? He is the one doing research on the sovereign gate and thus the most vulnerable to Panaxeth.

Oh, lets not forget that a primordial is also going to be released and likely kill the majority of the cities population if Zorian fails.

**** Disagree. There are some important story beats set up / continued here.\\
1.) Zorian feels A LOT of guilt about being the sole survivor. He's burying his trauma of that and says as much. Before he got out he felt he owed everyone that helped him in the loop, but now it's become acute by recent trauma. You're going to see this affect his decision making going forward, at least in the short term.\\
2.) Zorian cares for Kirielle and respects her wishes even when they may be inconvenient for him. That is growth even if it isn't perfectly rational growth in this moment. He should be more of an adult, but guilt is clouding is judgement.\\
3.) Despite Zorian using the hydra-hive-mind and all of his simulacrums being in alignment sharing thoughts often, they are still independent and have independent actions. The Zorians who were not just playing with Kirielle and are not looking her in the face in this moment would not make this decision, but that is because they literally have distance from it.

The issue is that none of the points work to induce a touching character moment whereby we feel good about how far Zorian has come as a person and brother unless the fact that he is making a really poor decision, based largely on guilt and putting Kirielle in great danger, is supposed to not be spoiled by the fact he cares for Kirielle. You can see how the likely outcomes of his decision work against what the chapter intended from this moment, right?

This is a moment the story has spent innumerable time building up to and having that moment be 'Zorian makes a really poor decision that greatly reduces the life expectancy of Kirielle because he has clouded judgement and feels guilt...but he wouldn't have made this poor choice if he didn't care!' is not satisfying, in any way at all.

Zorian is close with Imaya, Kael, Kana, Nochka and her family, and Taiven, none of whom stand much of a chance of living if all hell breaks loose in Cyoria. He likely had already made plans to evacuate people like them from Cyoria, so if he leaves Kiri with them then evacuates the lot of them to a safehouse, they'll be fine.

He is only able to ignore his parents because he only has a few days before they are unreachable in the middle of the ocean. Unless he arranged for Kirielle to go with them she'd be stuck all by herself with some family friend in their home town.

***** The most important point in response to this is that even if this were true, the text (namely the last four sentences of the chapter) clearly indicates that this is not a factor in Zorian's response to this. You can't read 'it was all worth it for that smile' and go 'Zorian realises he is bringing Kirielle into a situation where she could well die but if i, Zorian, fail, then she will die anyway so i might as well bring her into the epicenter of a soon to be disaster zone because she will surely appreciate the magical fireworks'.

So the character moment is still spoiled because Zorian is making a decision that is reckless and irresponsible and Kirielle is actually about to be in a great deal of danger and the intended warm fuzzies have shrivelled to nothing.

I also disagree that Zorian with all his power could not hide his family from QI if that was his goal but it's not of great relevance to how the character moment was spoiled so i'll leave it at that.

Okay, first of all, it's not magical fireworks, it's magical explosions sent between the various dueling archmages that sometimes look like fireworks. Second of all, stick her at Nochka's, which no one on the opposing side has ever heard of, only visit her in disguise, and stop caring.

******* I don't see a world in which Kirielle is safer in a city where all Zorian's enemy reside and a primordial may soon be released and Kirielle needs to be dropped off at a safehouse (an additonal risk, even when in disguise) and then visited in disguise (a risk each time), than a world in which Zorian simply goes 'Hey, i really care about Kirielle, how can i best ensure her safety and wellbeing' and then does almost /anything else/ than bringing her into Cyoria. I mean this very chapter mentions that Zorian believes his family will be safe when they're on a ship at sea.

He is clearly not prioritising her safety but instead her short term happiness and, to bring this conversation back around to the fundamental point, this ruins the intended effect of the character moment.

And things are going to change a lot following the battle, so much so that a future visit might be hard if not impossible. Everything is unpredictable because there's no longer the safety valve of a restart.

Sure, Zorian could do the rational thing and let Kirielle go with their parents. But most likely that would mean that he can't keep the promise with her time loop self, at least not completely. He knows he might die in the coming battles, it's a real possibility. And if he does, no one will ever take Kirielle to see Cyoria.

This likely won't be the last chance that Kirielle gets to see Cyoria in all its glory, but it might be the last chance that /matters/. (There's also the whole arranged marriage thing to consider, which will likely be another headache Zorian will have to deal with).

******* Silverlake is not using simulacrums, but she has her familiar which kinda of can act as a single simulacrum.

Her soul magic is so advanced that she detected Zorians simulacrum attached to golem frame straight away.

To cast simulacrum one needs to have soul awareness / be familiar with the soul so it can be copied. It is not a matter of skill. I'd say it's related to the paranoia - there's a chance that a simulacrum would try to attack her/overwrite her personality via mind magic, something like this. There were some horror stories Alanic told Z&Z. But the SG-Silverlake has a time limit which may force her use steps she's not doing otherwise. To avoid the death by not getting Panaxeth release, she might resort creating simulacrums (she might have borrowed golem blueprints Zorian uses for his simulacrums).

To that end, no amount of desperation will allow her to create useful simulacrums even if she can make simulacrums in general.

She can only use her familiar which hasn't been thoroughly explained, but based on the concept of familiars in other works of fiction, would be an animal that is more intelligent and powerful than usual with some magical connection to it's master. In this case, a bird with enough skill to appear as her (whether that's polymorphing or illusion hasn't been determined) and possibly enough intelligence to speak (though this could just be Silverlake puppeting the creature, that also hasn't been determined). However, unlike a simulacrum, it most likely does not have her power and couldn't be used in the same ways a simulacrum could. It MIGHT, but that isn't the way familiars generally function. We can also surmise that it doesn't work that way based just on the fact that she largely doesn't use it in the story up to this point.

  Thankfully, amazingly, the lich reacted just as Zorian expected him to: he extended his hand and snatched the coin out of the air. Zorian had figured the lich would do that instead of knocking it aside with a shield or something, as he seemed to consider himself invulnerable -- not an unwarranted assumption considering those weird bones of his. In any case, the moment the lich's skeletal hand closed around the silver disc he froze in place for a moment before collapsing to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

I think they hold up well when taken with the rest of the series. Dichotomy might not have been the best word. I liked the throwback, the characterization, and the contrast we had with these scenes.

Quatach-Ichl is an immortal, Silverlake is nearly an immortal. They both plan to live forever. They're presented with near identical situation: To catch or not to catch?

Silverlake is paranoid, but not cautious. Caution would have kept her inside her well defended, invisible house when some potentially dangerous stranger started making a racket outside. But she's paranoid and she needs to... define and manage the problem. The same way she needed to harass the time travelers by sending investigators after them, or booby trap her mind and house, or refuse to finish her youth potion in the time loop.

Quatach-Ichl is straight-forward, and, for whatever reason, is always ready to strike a deal. Maybe he runs a pawn shop in Vegas in his spare time, I don't know. Willing to trade a few divine artifacts for tutoring? Let's deal. Offer to set up a bank heist to rob the Imperials? Deal time. Ambush him and steal his crown? He's mad, but deals will be made.

Silverlake's paranoia brings her outside to confront Zorian, but it has her dodge catching the stone. She'll poke it with a stick though, and she'll probably fiddle with it later.

Quatach-Ichl's inner PawnStar has him catch the silver disc and lose his body. Yeah, he let his guard down. Yeah, it won't happen again outside of those very specific circumstances. But that one scene shows us so much about who he is as a person.

It couldn't expire naturally though, right, so I'm just saying there's uncertainty there. I dunno if the algorithm for the Guardian is:

1. Check if any valid marker left (controller or temp) - in this case none apart from Zach
2. Save Zach's soul and continuing temp loopes (none)
3. Kill everyone else
4. Recreate everyone
5. Put Zach's soul in

If this were to have happened in the 5th restart of the 6 allowed to temp loopers, then it would mean something for soulkilled Veyers. As is, it's another piece of the puzzle that's not enough to explain everything.

** God, I'm so hyped for more of this, there is likely only a handful of chapters left and it's JUST SO GOOD. I can't wait to see how everything plays out, how we conclude this very last month, the story should end on the day of the festival, or the day after, and then get a snapshot into the future that the survivors create, who survives and what occurs is going to be essential for that future.

My hope for the ending is a future where Zach manages to do something within the nobility of their country while Zorian rises to power withij the mage Guild, with their knowledge and power they could make a HUGE difference in the world, Zorian's connection to the Arenea and his ability to basically unite them under his rule would be absolutely world changing. Zach's sheer power could make a huge difference, Zach could basically be a nuclear deterrent, he could stand in the middle of court and say, "hey y'all, Don't fight each other, if you do my friend and I will stop you, period."

Part of me wants some kind of follow up, not a story but something interactive, not a videogame (though that would be awesome), but perhaps a roleplaying game rulebook, the early chapters were heavily DnD influenced but I feel like by now we could write a fully original game based on this world.

With all we know of familiars, we know that they're bonded by the soul. We also know from how Zorian's soul perfectly fit his real body, the souls are a complete match, so loop SL is likely also bonded to that familiar and possibly others.

In a world where Silverlake isn't also a threat, things are much simpler for our dear heroes. Yes Red Robe has an army, but they have a +Hulk+ Xvim. The allies and information Z&Z gathered over the course of the loop are resources RR wouldn't know about and wouldn't have much of a way to counter, so far as we can see.

Silverlake being out, about, and aware of all of those allies and plans makes things a lot more touch-and-go, in a good way.

2. She has a new, freshly made body courtesy of Panaxeth.
3. She found somebody young and fit, and took their body for herself. It sounds like this would be painful because the soul and body don't match, but... this is Silverlake.

Silverlake didn't go back to her home because she didn't want to have to fight herself, or deal with an ambush.

Alternatively, her new body isn't quite aligned with her soul, so she's not ready to get into a fight yet.

Silverlake isn't a fighter, so I don't think we will see her in combat unless she's desperate. Considering her paranoia, she wouldn't contact QI either; at best she will feed Red Robe the updated intel she has on their common enemy.

If I was her, while everything was going down with the aranea and Zach, I would be stealing the Sovereign Gate. Why? To prepare the ritual all by herself. She is great at dimensionalism and knows more about the primordial prison than Z&Z. She can likely do a better job than the cultists, who she has little way of trusting or influencing.

The storm here might be Silverlake in her new body. Why is she not doing anything yet? The scariest thing about Silverlake would be - she's adjusting. She's adjusting to her new body Pan had crafted to her. She requested to craft a body with mana reservers like Zach, empathy/mind magic potential like Zorian. Physically very fit. Young. She's not doing anything because he needs to adjust to her new body. Adjust to immense mana reserves, adjust to new capabilities on natural mind mage...

**** It is not. It is linked to the soul. However when RR was looping with modified temporary marker it was either QI and Pan who modified that marker. It somewhat likely that Pan is both Flesh and Soul warper - so it might be able to modify a soul somewhat - to increase mana capacity or some ability.

And there might be some body-soul level interaction which could influence those things.

It's a wild guess. Not too likely. Either way, increased mana pool would need some time for Silverlake to retrain herself - some of the spells would be harder to cast. And for mind magic she would need a lot of training (which she might be able to do somewhere in background as well to increase her chances - like kidnap some arranea and practice on them).

Since this ability gets attached to the body, it makes sense to Pan able to do it itself - a better alternative for doing via unreliable blood magic/ritual.

The most kick-ass body we've seen was dragonoids. We've seen some shifters as well.

So SG Silverlake could have asked for dragonoid or dragon -shifter body (most of the shifters used Pan's essence and that's why shifter kids were used in ritual). In addition to that body, throw in aranea natural ability tied via blood magic (psion or natural mind mage - whatever you call it. Also maybe some other ability which gives larger/max mana pool). If possible, apply copy of divine blessing as well - and here's the Silverator ready to kick some ass.

****** Well, body/soul are very closely related.

Yes, the stuff I'm talking about is related to both soul and body. But the soul is a battery of sort, which powers up various abilities. The bloodline ability is like external item which is being plugged into the soul.

It is impossible to understand bloodlines/abilities without understanding the soul.

If Pan can warp the body in any way, it has to possess the ability to make sure that this new body is compatible with the soul.

Also it is possible to have more than one bloodline. (albeit with limited success). Suldomir - owner of soul well - tried to merge dragon/troll something else and got it working in the weird fashion.

As a fleshwarper, Pan should have an intimate understanding how those abilities function. It should be possible for him to extract/plug in several such abilities on request.

So the dream Silvelator might have:

Dragon-shifting abilities. (At at least dragonoid body). With Silverlakes paranoia/strive for survival the body should be as touch as possible.

If dragon is lacking regeneration for survival, why not thrown in capability of salamander to regenerate as additional bloodline.

I'm pretty sure in the whole world there would be an ability which would increase mana pool. Let's say some sort of weird whale which uses mana to gather plankton and feed on it. The larger mana pool, the more plankton it can gather. Anyway, the point is that if you start to imagine any abilities, there could be one which would actually increase mana pool.

So with such ability available, one could add several more abilities which would complement Silverlakes abilities.

She's a very powerful soul mage (even Kael had a book on soul magic). She easily detected simulacrum attached to golem frame. So if she had additional soul ability from soul flower which almost got duo killed or the ability from monster which killed Zorian just by looking at him, she would gain ability to just slaughter anyone without soul awarines/defense.

She's dimensional special as well. So something like Zach/Zorian were using to improve their abilities - it would allow her easier to break into dimensional prison/release Pan.

Add innate ability of aranea - she would have another card to be used - but it's more long term plan, but there might be some additional tricks here as well for Silverlake.

What I'm trying to tell - Silverlake could have asked for something like this from Pan and as I said - since it's plethora of new abilities, she's just trying/testing her new abilities to be comfortable in her new body.

The bottom line, there's gotta be a nasty surprise from Silverlake. Why not Silverator - OP - mode enemy :)

assuming there'd be such a convenient creature with an ability such as increased mana reserves sounds highly convenient and breaks too many rules too easily and so I /highly/ doubt such a thing exists. and this is also crucial to all these other abilities (which I doubt Panaxeth can do anyways), and thus she'd cannot plug as many abilities as she would like

As for such animal - if it is arctic whale where there are no people going to fish. There's a limited amount of them, they are very hard to get to and to kill - they can just dive and go away. Also this capacity is not known. It is just very hard to perform such ritual in the ocean.

******** I mixed up a bit about clothing. It was indeed the talk about transformation potions in chapter 31:

#+begin_quote
  You see, when you cast a regular transformation spell on yourself you are essentially putting clothes on your soul. Don't look at me like that, it's what it is. Yes, the official term is 'transformation shell', but they're basically like soul clothes. You can put them on, see, and you can take them off. Even if you mess up the spell and can't turn back or you get locked into an alternate form by a malicious opponent, you are still just a dispel or a curse-breaking session away from returning to normal. Your soul is still intact and unchanged beneath the transformation shell, and once the spell is gone you revert to your base form. The problem is that sometimes people overreach and end up transforming too far, so you end up with a mage, say, transforming into a troll in both mind and body and killing his entire family before the spell runs out of mana and he reverts back to normal. Or they attach the transformation shell too firmly to their soul and can't change back, and are then stuck in the form of a sparrow or something and can't talk to people or meaningfully interact with their environment. That's why a lot of people don't do transformation via invocations and rituals any more, and just buy transformation potions from people like me who know what they're doing -- no chance of messing up, just drink a potion made by an expert and you're golden."
#+end_quote

The main reason I've put shape shifter form is the ritual used by cultists to break Pan out of prison (they are extracting Pan's essence from young shifters and are using that essence in summoning ritual). Panaxeth helped to create those shapeshifter clans (willingly or not - the essence might have been given or stolen). So that was the main reason I've put a shape-shifting body as viable option.

If Pan's whatever essence acts like grease between animal and human soul - this counts an argument that Pan might be able to work with souls in some fashion alongside the flesh since Panaxeth is a natural soul-mingling creature.

** Wait, doesn't Zack meeting up with Silver lake in the loop mean Veyers probably isn't RR? Veyers was soulkilled in the loop, which they took to mean that his exiting messed with the template used to recreate the loop each iteration. If Silverlake survived in the loop, then unless the specific way he achieved permanence soulkilled his template upon exit, then Veyers probably isn't RR. RR obviously wouldn't be able to soulkill himself while in the loop, and no one would have the ability or motive to soulkill Veyers once he left.

Zack should make some simulacra immediately. Since only his body is damaged, the simulacra won't be hindered, so it would be fairly close to having Zack be at full effectiveness.

Also, thing that either I'm not understanding or is a mistake: Zorian said he could sustain 4 simulacra in his hometown (I'm assuming his proficiency with the spell has improved so that he can now sustain another copy with his regen). The whole point of locating Cyoria on the Hole is that it's a massive mana well, meaning mages regenerate mana faster. The author has said elsewhere that the regen is substantial, although I don't remember the numbers. Shouldn't he be able to sustain more simulacra when he is able to absorb mana from the Hole?

***** I'm not sure it's been explicitly stated in the story, but they say their magnitude from before they started training for it. Their mana reserves consistently plateau at about 4 times their initial mana, so it makes sense for them to compare that number. Because of how shaping impacts spell cost, it would be hard to reliably measure a mature mage's mana capacity quantitatively.

** Just wanted to update and memorialize my predictions for red robe (in order of likelihood):

1. Damien - I think it would be very well foreshadowed if this was the case. Some examples: he's a latent mind mage and Zach was mind raped, Panaxeth did not even bother offering him a deal because Damien is already his agent(or possibly panaxeth intimated to Damien that he was already the agent, neatly explaining Damien's uncharacteristic resolve in ch. 91), and finally, remember that anyone trying to collect all the artifacts would almost necessarily come into contact with Damien. From the very beginning of the story Damien was built up a lot as a famous explorer/treasure hunter, that is exactly the kind of person you would give a temp marker to if you were trying to collect the keys to the Sovereign Gate. And it would even be kind of ironic given that without his sacrifice in ch. 91 Zorian could not have escaped the loop.

2. Zach's rebellious simulacrum(or some other kind of Zach doppelganger) - There is not much evidence, other than some stories of rebellious simulacrums and the unfired zach mind rape chekov's gun, so mostly a pet theory. It would be interesting though.

3. One of the female classmates - Goes along with the 'Zach was evil/powermad and mind raped into being good' theory. Would square in with the Veyers thing also, make it not a red herring (maybe Zach soul killed Veyers and this caused RR to rebel?). It would be dramatic, but not very satisfying.

Anyone have any off the wall theories?

*** Oh, sure, I might as well do that too.

List of things we know about Red Robe:

- has a fancy magic robe worn by inner members of the cult, even when Zach is still waking up
- has access to the dagger in Eldemar's treasury
- can make simulacrums, has soul sight, and can do some mind magic, at least after looping for a while
- might have needed a temporary marker placed by Zach, which would also mean Zach having access to the crown

Here's my own list of suspects, roughly in order of most likely to least:

Whats-his-face, head of the mage guild and known to be a leading member of the Cult of the Dragon Below. We have good reason to suspect RR is in the Cult's inner circle, and if I recall correctly, this guy is the only one of those who was actually mentioned by name. +He would almost certainly have found out about the time loop when Zach was telling literally everyone+ (edit: that was after RR had wiped Zach's memories, so nevermind), and quite likely has the magics that we know Red Robe has. As a high-ranking person, he might have had access to the dagger, though that's a bit of a long shot. The main things against this are the lack of connection to Veyers and the way he hasn't been mentioned enough in the story for me to remember his actual name. (There's a small chance Veyers leads to Jornak which leads to the Cult of the Dragon Below, and RR scrubbed Zach's mind just because him using Veyers as a link to the cult was inconvenient in some way, even though it didn't actually lead all the way to himself, but this argument applies equally to pretty much everyone except Jornak.) For another point against, Zorian does say they've investigated all the high-ranking members of the cult and none of them are obviously Red Robe (ch 63, near the end), though this doesn't necessarily rule anything out.

Any other high-ranking cultists - all the same arguments for, but pretty unlikely narratively because we haven't even heard of them.

Novelty standing on Notchka's shoulders - we never saw it coming.

Quatach-Ichl - He'd have to be pretending to be two separate people, himself and a looper. I'd be surprised if he couldn't cast a simulacrum, and as far as we know all we've seen of Red Robe could be simulacrums. +(I wonder, do simulacrums of QI look like flesh-and-blood people rather than skeletons?)+ (edit: We saw QI's simulacrums in CH 83 when he was helping steal the dagger, and there was no comment about them not looking like a bag of bones, so presumably they do. This doesn't really tell us much though because we know QI can disguise himself.) He also probably wouldn't have too hard a time getting the dagger. One point against is that he doesn't seem like the sort to enter a death pact with a primordial, but then again, he wants to release the primordial anyway, so he has basically nothing to lose by accepting. It's a choice between dying at the end of the month or surviving to reach the real world and be able to affect stuff that actually matters. +(It occurs to me, for any of the temporary loopers who thought Panaxeth was the only way out, accepting his deal would be strictly advantageous. You get to live for one month longer, and can work against him the whole time, then die at the end of the month after helping stop his plans. (edit: Hah, I thought I was clever for figuring that out all on my own, but turns out Kyron thought of it first.))+ Now that I think about it, the complexity penalty from all the pretending he would have to do is really the main thing keeping this unlikely. (edit: The pretending might be harder than I thought, if he wasn't lying when he said "Personally, I'd have gone crazy in a matter of weeks if I had to impersonate a complete beginner at magic for several years" in Ch 81. RR is pretty close to a complete beginner compared to QI.)

(edit: forgot about Zenomir. Being able to recognize the necromancy spell makes him a little more likely than average, but we don't have too much information either way)

Sudomir - we've only ever seen him after RR left, so we don't know enough either way. Given his obsession with his wife, he probably would have been more focused on other things, so not a likely RR candidate.

Jornak - all he really has going for him is Veyers and being a member of the cult, but he does seem like the single most likely person to soulkill Veyers.

Tesen - he has no reason to let Zach beat him up every time except as some sort of elaborate cover. He's lacking enough in the morals department, and as a seventh-circle mage and a member of a noble house he might have access to the dagger and spells RR was seen using. He might even have gotten a temporary marker before Zach found out what had happened to his inheritance.

Anyone below here I rate as *less* likely than a random mage to be Red Robe:

Xvim - too competent. That mind magic attempt? Not good enough. Start over.

Alanic - doesn't seem like the sort of person who would make that bargain with Panaxeth

Silverlake - surely Panaxeth wouldn't have sent a second copy of her when she already has so much trouble getting along with herself.

Taiven, her friends, Ilsa, Imaya, Kael, Zorian's other classmates - too much interaction with them while Red Robe was still in the loop

Fortov - what a failure at life.

Veyers - doesn't explain how he got soulkilled (edit: come to think of it, it might be possible for the Guardian of the Threshold to have sent him back Zach-style rather than Silverlake-style, in which case there would be only one of him in the world, and we don't know whether he would have looked normal or soulkilled afterwards in the loop)

Daimen - wrong continent, no motive, and quite unlikely to have encountered Zach at all before Zach and Zorian met up.

Zach's simulacrum - I would expect the gate to recognize it as not a real person and refuse to recreate it in the next loop, plus we don't even know that Zach was able to cast simulacrum before meeting Zorian, plus it doesn't even have a separate soul to put any sort of marker on, plus Zach doesn't have soul sight and RR does, plus both Zach and RR seem to both have pretty good control over their simulacrums

***** I'm not quite sure I understand what you're suggesting, but it sounds like it involves real time travel, which is as impossible as drawing a square circle. Also after Zorian got out of the loop and cast that spell to connect to Zach via marker, that should have shown him anyone else who had the exact same marker too. So however Red Robe got into the loop, it wasn't by the same method as Zorian, which means he can't be an older version of the current Zorian.

Even if you propose that RR is one of the older copies of Zorian, there's a lot of problems with that idea too. I think it's most likely that RR is a separate person entirely from either of the main characters.

*** i want it to be the academy's principal - there's surprisingly no interaction with him which is strange as i would imagine he's a fairly competent mage to have attained the position. zach would definitely have tried to convince him. it is possible the principal is away or something but it would be strange because of the merry-making that is going to happen due to planetary alignment.

also, this would certainly explain why RR had the ability to subvert all the academy's wards neatly (although this could just be from years of being in the time loop) and explain the robe itself: many of the order of the celestial dragon were highly placed mages in the city.

this would make veyers sort of a red herring which is pretty funny. veyers might have been soul killed for annoying the principal about trying to get back into the academy and taken out just for that. (doesn't explain why he would bother putting effort into helping him the real world though)

finally, it could explain the cranium rats (as RR was a mind mage). it was mentioned that there were several swarms around the principal's office. what if it wasn't to spy on him but because that's where the swarms' leader/handler was?

the biggest flaw of this theory, however, is that zorian didn't mention the principal when he found out who the leaders of the order of the celestial dragon were. if anything, zorian mentioning the mage's guild leader makes him a suspect for similar reasons (zach would have tried to recruit him in the past as he is a strong mage but is little mentioned until finding out he is part of the order of the celestial dragon, explains how he has his signature robes so quickly at the start of a restart as well as why veyers was soul-killed if that is how he initially was introduced to zach, he would probably know the academy's ward scheme as the highest ranking mage official in the city), but it just doesn't feel as clean.

**** We don't know what unknown capabilities he might possess. Damien was shown/told to be more talented than Zorian. Imagine Zach meeting him while searching for the keys and (as Zach does, he's shown himself to be reckless like that) giving him a temporary marker.

Damien then has a year of looping. Maybe Zach comes to him, maybe not. Then his time grows ever smaller, and he searches for a way to extend it. He either contacts or gets contacted by Panaxeth.

At that point, we can safely assume that distance is no longer a factor - especially if Panaxeth /wants/ RR to be in Cyoria, for some reason. Such as, perhaps, to have RR learn how to optimize the invasion.

Even if we assume that it's not that convenient and Panaxeth cannot just will Damien to start elsewhere inside the loop, then Damien would still have 20? years to deal with that issue. Zorian mostly solved it within 5?.

But what's most convincing for me is the mention of Damien's latent mind magic. /Someone/ screwed with Zach's mind, and we know of no other way to do it. Now, it's quite possible that there's structured magic for that, but we haven't been shown it. So I /think/ that that's good evidence for Damien being RR.

(Of course, any other candidate for RR would also have those ~20 years to find some other way to erase memories. But that would be so unsatisfying, wouldn't it?)

Kind of? Zorian originally thought there had to be a better way but when he sat down with it he realized that it was actually insanely hard to improve and it would take him months/years just to make it take less time than before, let alone fewer people.

I think it might be the man that Veyers was staying with. Besides shape(Which can be changed), he fits some of the criteria for RR candidate. Veyers can't be RR because he was soulkilled. SL was moving around in the following loops after she left the loop. Whereas if it was this man then he was also moving around as well in each of the following loops.

Next Veyers and the man in the real world made different actions, so something must've changed. It has to be directly related to them.

I think that once he left the timeloop and he went and found himself and Veyers. He probably showed up as himself in front of the real him and Veyers and spooked them a bit, but told them they need to go into hiding or to follow him to a safe place.

Kinda disappointed that everything conspired to slow things down and stop them from doing anything for a few days.

Maybe he just wanted ZZ to have to be defensive (checking up on Alanic, and stuff) at the beginning of the loop so they wouldn't get around to other things as quickly? Maybe he noticed that Silverlake's teaching was pretty important to the group (they did have to get QI to replace her, iirc), and figured she wouldn't do as much harm outside of the loop as in it? Or maybe he just really didn't take a close enough look to see she was a capable soul mage beforehand, after all, he did make that second offer to Zorian claiming he hadn't noticed he was that good a mind mage. I suppose he might even have deceived them about releasing her at all, if there were any way he could get rid of her soul (maybe put in the real world after his best effort to sabotage it, or somehow abuse whatever mechanism the time loop has of destroying souls). Sometimes I wonder if Silverlake was just a complete distraction, and he actually just modified Ilsa's marker so it wouldn't run out and she could escape in a future loop, or something. (If we're assuming that's how RR happened, then he's capable of that.) Too many possibilities. (edit: forgot one more: Panaxeth thinks she'll release him despite not being forced to because of the interest she's been taking in his pocket dimension.)

As for Silverlake, I think Zorian really did meet old Silverlake, but new Silverlake had already snuck into the pocket dimension or something and was just waiting for that meeting to occur before taking over. There's some risk from her perspective that Zorian would kill her old self, but she does think of him as squeamish. Of course, that's all just guessing.

This is my theory. Panaxeth doesn't care about humans - humans are mere insects in comparison to him. So he doesn't care enough to bother to take too close a look.

Kyron explicitly asked what stops people from taking his deal and then working against him, and was promptly and quite abruptly exiled from the conversation - presumably because he doesn't want to give his deal to anyone who thinks of that. Silverlake no doubt /did/ think of that - but was presumably sneaky enough not to ask Panaxeth directly.

Combine that with the fact that Zach received a divine blessing to increase his rate of mana production, and it looks likely that one of the angels initiated all of this.

** I think dismissing his old soul was a mistake. An understandable one, but a mistake.

Zorian is pragmatic - more so after the loop, but even before that. I'm pretty sure that the original would be able to mentally and emotionally adapt to being around his post-loop self, because /this is his own potential/. This is what he himself can become, given a few years of intense training. And post-loop Zorian is in a perfect position to provide that training. He spent about 8 subjective years in the loop, right? Maybe 10; with all the Black Room usage it's hard to be sure. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he can pass on most of what he learned in five or less.

Making a body for his old soul should really not be all that hard, either. The author has confirmed that with soul sight, it's possible to cast the simulacrum spell on someone else's behalf, and he has plenty of experience making golem bodies. Might need to tinker a little, but he's tackled much harder problems before.

And the benefits? Well, they still have the same mana signature, as evidenced by Xvim testing it to confirm his identity. They would be able to share mana really easily. And with his hive mind techniques, they should be able to cooperate really well, even though they wouldn't share a soul. Basically, Team Zorian would end up twice as big as it is now.

But it's a moot point :(

**** One: Zorian still had the same mana signature, so any change from Zach likely wouldn't have a big impact on their ability to share mana.

Two: Original Zorian would certainly have had enough of a shock, I would think, to get him out of his comfort zone. Being self motivated is fine.

Three: Zorian was fine with the idea of leaving his family and going independent. He wouldn't miss anyone but Kirielle, and if he knew that loop!Zorian was taking good care of her, I expect he'd be fine on that front too.

Four: Living as a golem probably wouldn't be too terrible. They're strong, durable, and by now I gather they can be pretty lifelike. Since the alternative is for him to die - if not at the start of the month, then at the end of it - I don't see this as "stealing everything" but rather helping him to retain something. And it's not as though loop!Zorian has nothing to compensate him with.

Five: Loop!Zorian has pretty much hit the limits of his mana reserve growth. Original!Zorian isn't nearly there yet, but once he's grown, that basically doubles their pool, which means twice as many simulacra. That's pretty valuable.

Six: Given good enough evidence and good enough reasons, I think I'd accept those things instead of a quick death.

For that matter, it might even have been possible, in the longer term (post primordial), for loop!Zorian to move out into a golem and put original!Zorian back in his body. Alanic could probably have found a way.

***** to clarify then

one: this is in reference to Zorian having the emotional capacity to accept and adapt, mostly

two: original Zorian's not going to be driven by self motivation. it'd be "forced" upon him by loop Zorian. or what, is loop Zorian going to offer then what happens to original Zorian if he rejects? if he accepts, it'll be begrudgingly and will impact his learning capabilities. loop Zorian also had time and room to calm himself and analyze the situation. original won't have room to do his own thing to distract and calm himself and would be very limited in what he can do to do so, too. loop Zorian was in a state of denial and went for normalcy for a while while original does not have that option

three: there's still a difference between distancing yourself and having yourself completely replaced. there's also a huge difference in finality, where one he can technically go back whenever and the other, he'll be forever an outcast. there's still Taiven for friends, and he can't verify his identity in anyway without piggybacking off of loop Zorian so government and getting certification is going to be very difficult (or he'll be forever chained, legally, to loop Zorian and thus he's basically enslaved). plus the fact ofc that one is of his own free will vs not

four: the point is he's not *human* anymore. and there'll be many things he cannot do anymore, many of which can affect him very deeply, like sleep, food.

five: but why does Zorian need that many simulacrum after this month?

six: Zorian is 100% not going to be rational about this. and imo you're vastly underplaying the emotional aspects of this

why wouldn't there be competition over the body? in normal life, it's 100% the inferior option and leads a very different feeling of life (sleep and food at the very least). it'll also be time and effort before they can make a golem body that's not too awkward to move in (and reduce this gap of inferiority)

there's also a difference (potentially) of memory downloaded as packets vs memories you experienced. there is a distinct difference between knowledge memory and experience memory irl. maybe memory packet download would still make it experience memory, with it being able to attach emotions and all but that's just an if. but even then, *time* is a factor in shaping a person and I'd imagine original Zorian with same memories would still not be quite the same. not to mention original Zorian wouldn't be able to process the memory packets 100% efficiently until after some mind training

Pretty sure the golem bodies are already well designed for long term use. He's had a simulacrum researching that full time for quite a while, ever since he invented the technique. And by now the hive mind has a lot of experience of living in them. Note that an ordinary simulacrum still sleeps, so there's a good chance that golacrums do too.

there's still just basic need of eating. while a burden of life, it's still very much a part of living and makes a difference in how it is experienced and lived.

​

also in regards to your response directly to SearchAtlantis: they meant the opportunity to use original Zorian as a mana battery was a choice that loop Zorian missed out on and is the amoral action. meanwhile, presenting original Zorian choice of death or golem life is also a false choice forced upon him and thus also potentially amoral, or at least a gray area and hence they said "more ethically acceptable". but that's a whole big philosophical debate (in similar vein to euthanasia)
