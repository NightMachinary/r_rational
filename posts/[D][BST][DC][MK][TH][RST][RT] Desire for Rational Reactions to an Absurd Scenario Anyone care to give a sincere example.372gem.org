Hello! I'm working on a project where a rather absurd thing happens on a global scale to a good chunk of the population of earth.

And I'd love to get some people's own reactions to this very silly premise. But I would prefer if it's both taken completely seriously and realistically.

I'd like HONEST reactions of either what you or some level one personality you feel comfortable writing would actually do in the situation.

If you like you can also imagine some random individual from a fictional setting responding to this, All would be useful for me but the important bit is getting me some perspectives that are not my own brain on this.

Here is the Premise:

You (or your chosen Level One Personality) have just 'woken up' as a monster girl. The specific kind is random. There is nothing physically impossible about your body and it all feels sensory wise very genuine, You have apparently been given a motor nervous system upgrade of some kind because you can actually move around without trouble.

You are welcome to utilize any of your present genre savy personal knowledge. The only thing I ask is that you (or your level one personality) have no previous awareness of this post or the piece of fiction I'm working on (if you have already been reading it) included in the scenario.


** "Great. I spend a few years as a furry fan hoping to experience a non-human body, then finally gain an understanding of why I shouldn't anticipate ever experiencing "magic", even if it's called a 'quantum miracle' or whatnot... and now I'm /this/? It'll be a fun dream if it is one, but I don't exactly want to open my bedroom door to show off my new look to my roomies if it's not one.

"If I'm not dreaming - /somebody/ is faffing me about. Transplanting a working conscious mind into a new physical shape - including tweaking the brain's sensory and motor homunculi - isn't the sort of thing that can happen by /natural processes/. Did, say, some Japanese furry-fan accidentally hack the math that underlies reality, and came up with some software to allow that sort of thing? Highly unlikely, even if the universe is a simulation. A lot /more/ likely is that somebody came up with some sort of intelligence augmentation that let them come up with Drexlerian nanotech, and some side effect of their working towards their goals involved expanding humanity's phenotype. After all, I'm only about one-in-ten-million special, so there's probably at least a few hundred other people in similar situations - or maybe a few billion. I should probably narrow down that range of estimates. Anyway, or maybe some aliens are saying 'hello' by instantiating tentacle porn in the real world. But one of the upshots - if one intelligent mind could cause all these changes once, then there's nothing preventing /other/ intelligent minds from doing similar things /again/. And I haven't got any sort of password protection on my brain to keep from being rewritten into a catgirl loveslave in a volcano-lair harem.

"Since I'm nowhere near as smart as I wish I were, or as smart as certain other people I know, this all means that some of the most important things I can do are to hit the internet, find my rationalisty compadres, and start collaborating on figuring out what actually happened, what that implies about physics and engineering, and what we can do to gain control of whatever tech was involved. (And I really hope that the internet's still up, and I don't have to break out my ham radio for any long-distance comms.) And I should figure out what assumptions I'm making about my body that aren't true, on the gross anatomical level as well as the cellular and biochemical ones. Guess I'm going to have to open that bedroom door to get my microscope out of my basement. And I should try making a few quick requests to any moderately friendly Drexlerian nanotech that might be hanging around and relaying such things to whatever entity controlled them... or maybe I should hold off on that, in case it's the sort of tech that does what I ask, instead of what I mean or what I want. But if anyone /else/ is getting wishes granted, then I could get loveslaved at any moment, so I'd better at least ask for something like a password-protect to prevent any further changes to me without my permission. And then maybe call on the hivemind of some gaming people I know to see if they've got any insights about what the implications of someone changing me into /this/ might be. Hm... maybe check my digital library, like my copy of the Transformation Stories Archive and my local mirror of TVTropes, to see if there's a match to any existing fiction?"

I like the mention of being an ex-furry.

Not to mention, the odds are that in this scenario, the 'Monster Girl' species I wake up as isn't going to be related to any of the phenotypes I've previously associated myself with. Imagine having an affinity for, say, goats, to the degree of occasionally fantasizing about life as a goat-person... and waking up as a ferret-woman. That just adds a whole extra level to the "Oh, come /on/!". :)

*** In case it might help, some of the responses that my younger self might have taken would have included:

- Grab a bug-out-bag (or pack one) and try to get out of the city without being seen, to spend at least a week completely outside of contact with humanity.
- Send a message to the transformation-story-group that existed at the time to ask for advice, in a nice, safe, interactive-fictional format that would have been deniable in case I was hallucinating.
- Take some selfies, post them, ask for critiques of my digital image manipulation skills.
- (censored due to adult content)
- Realize that I'm female and have never had that version of 'The Talk', so take some time to read/view/listen to anything about my new sex that I might need to worry about, regardless of species. Look into whatever prophylactics are appropriate for my anatomy, especially ones which will be functional even with a non-human biochemistry. Look into buying mace, or any similar self-defense stuff, to reduce the worries of involuntary pregnancies.
- Embarrassedly ask whatever female(s) live nearby for more gender-appropriate clothing.
- Grab a wallet and walk (/slither/scuttle/etc) to the nearest store to buy a candy bar and Coke, to gauge the reaction of the shopkeeper and any nearby pedestrians.
- Try concentrating /really hard/, meditating, light some scented candles to focus on, print out some quickie Qabalistic amulets, and otherwise attempt to impose my will on the universe to take control over my physical form.
- Call a lawyer for an emergency meeting to see if some sort of preemptive injunction or whatnot can be created, to ensure that I'm still entitled to the usual legal rights of personhood.
- Prepare to exercise the legal right to self-defense against anyone who thinks I don't enjoy the legal rights to life, liberty, and property.

In case it helps your narration, my previous comment wasn't a specific contingency plan I already have in place, it was ad-libbing based on having been exposed to similar ideas. (There are reasons I packrat away as much data as I can read...) While I'm working on my current depressive episode, I'm noodling around with a few scenarios that I haven't encountered sufficient stories on and discussion of elsewhere, in the hopes of finding something novel to work on later, from the economic consequences of ems whose main advantage seems to be being able to be run at arbitrarily fast speeds to a ROB scenario in which I'm exposed to the greater Tegmarkian mathematical polyverse and, oh yes, given root authority over my home 3+1-dimensional universe. Then again, I've also just purchased a backup cellphone to take when I go camping, in case my main phone gets dropped in a stream, so having 'multi step contingency plans' is probably as good a description as any, for story-telling purposes. :)

** Lock the door, get on the internet, chide myself for not having TOR, wait a few hours for whether anything comes up on the news. If this just happened to a significant percentage of the population, someone competent in the government is sure to have published information on how to stay on the safe side of things.

If there's nothing to be found on the internet, there was a coverup or I'm relatively alone. My technical knowledge says this kind of coverup is infeasible, so if they're that good, they're about to check my house anyway and my marginal advantage does not lie in running away into the wild, let someone else try that.

As I writing this post ("the player") write this, I am failing to come up with alternative explanations to "This is a story.", so in the case that I ("the character")'m alone, the story must be centered on me. I'm not too familiar with the genre, so I go to TV Tropes to read up. (Get TOR first anyway, there's no downside.) Maybe make a reddit post like OP's.

Since my character doesn't see a quick way to Becomus Goddus within the defined story limits, this doesn't sound to be a fun story to be the protagonist of, so it occurs to me that I might want to do things people wouldn't want to read about, to make it less likely someone would want to write a story about me. (Since my mind is being simulated by the author, Newcomblike Problems are reality!)

/After/ thinking this (the author may be just writing stuff as he goes along, so chronological causality might still be a thing), I check under my bed for a handbook or notes or something indicating that the rules of the story have changed to my liking.

Oh, definitely. That's later, though... I don't need to anonymize myself to check the news, and I wouldn't need to download it. I don't have a TOR client on my Mac, but I do have one of those onion-router boot-disks and if I can't find it I do know where the CD image is. This is good because my Internet is pretty lousy /and/ there's probably going to be thirty-thousand other people doing the same thing. Now I think of it TOR is probably going to be like trying to watch a video over a 300 baud dialup.

** "9-1-1, what is the nature of your emergency?" recited some fifty-something chainsmoker. It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

"I am, uh... hallucinating, quite vividly. Never taken any drugs that I know of, and there are no gaps in my memory. Something psychiatric maybe, but I have no history of anything..." My vines trembled and I had to consciously decide not to drop the phone. They responded to directives, not directions. Like octopus arms with independent ganglia. That's what I would have thought, if I humored this whole thing and ignored the obvious explanation.

"Alright ma'am, help is on the way. Your address is 349 Warner?"

"'Ma'am'? Fuck." Fuck fuck fuck. "Uh, yes, 349 Warner, unit 1011. Uh, my name is Brian, I'm a baritone for the university choir. Do I really sound, uh...? I mean... I look at myself, and I see, uh, like a girl... thing..." Specifically, I saw a girl /flower/ thing. I saw it and I heard it and I felt it.

"You're going to be okay. Is anyone else there with you?" No "ma'am", but no "sir" either. He was no longer sure which to use. /He heard me as a girl./

"Uh, no, my roommate is staying with his girlfriend so it's just me." I hesitated. That was weird. Didn't most hallucinations involve stuff /around/ a person? But my little apartment looked the same as always, other than my leaves draped over half my furniture. I could feel the cool handles of my dresser, four meters away.

The dispatcher must have heard something in my voice. "Listen, Brian, take some deep breaths. Help is on the way, they'll be there in just a few minutes. Talk to me. What were you doing before this started?"

"Nothing, I just woke up..." There really wasn't anything interesting there. Had I had a stroke? The dispatcher was nice enough, and he kept me on the line for a few minutes, just as he said, before the knocking came from my door. I slithered over, undid all three locks at once-

And then there was lots of screaming.

** [seeing that other people are posting narratives, let's try one that takes things in a completely different direction... something that's definitely a monster-girl but not a typical one]

The first one of me to wake is smarter than a dog, but nowhere near as smart as a human. It... she... rolls onto all fours, shakes, stretches, yawns, and... suddenly realizes that something is terribly wrong. She's surrounded by a number of wolf-like animals. More than she's really capable of counting. Screw it, call them wolves. She's a wolf, too. She's not SUPPOSED to be a wolf.

Panic. Yelling (barking, howling, strange sounds like a dog trying to speak in tongues, kinda scary really). Frantic nuzzling and maybe biting. The other animals are smaller than her, and she feels comfortably safe waking them, but she can't concentrate on more than that. She's in an enclosed space and while it seems familiar and safe she can't figure out how to get out. There's a thing on a part of the wall that's got something to do with getting out, but pawing at it does no good. There's some trick to it, but...

Door. It's a door. I'm conceptualizing. There's two more of me up now, waking up in a panic because wouldn't you be if someone was shouting "num shub wa ba me ne goo" at you and nipping your ear? One of me noses the bathroom door open but there's nowhere to go that way, there's no way we can get through the window. Who said that? Who said what, I was just thinking out loud.

Another one of me wakes, and his awareness pushes me over some kind of threshold. I'm a person, I've got a self, and suddenly it's me standing there on sixteen paws and trying to pull together the threads of my mind, talking to myself and nudging the last two of me awake.

"Hello?".

Good, I can talk in the outside world as well. It's... weird, but wait, that was two of me making sounds at once to make that work, and I knew how to do it. Well, that's no weirder than being able to handle six sets of eyes and paws at once.

"Hey, what are you doing?" One of me was sniffing my ... butt ... that's a bit doggy for me. Wait a second. "Back Off, Buster". But why not, you/I smell so good! Because I don't want puppies and your name's "Buster" now. But I wasn't... Be happy it wasn't "Asshole". But... GO TO SLEEP, BUSTER. Huh, he did. He's going to be a problem. There's a second male in my pack, but he's small and probably not mature yet, I got some time to get my sex drive under control.

Let's see, I'm/we are a pack of wolves, actual wolves, as near as I/we can see (oh, man, and we're probably color-blind, that sucks), not something wolf-like like in /A Fire Upon the Deep/. Female dominant... DEFINITELY not Buster's harem. Not yet, anyway, but if we're anything like a Tine pack I'll have to have puppies some time...

Man, what time is it anyway? Someone's going to come bugging us to walk the dogs pretty soon. I think I can beg off that. Heh. Unless this is a simulation, if that's the case my minds have been pretty heavily reprogrammed and we're really not the same person any more. Well, we're still me, it's just a different me.

Better think of myself as "me" not "us", I think. That's... huh... weird, I actually feel different when I think of "me" and when I think of "us".

"Hello? Computer? Interface? Prikazyvat interface? Arch?"

That last one is unlikely. Whatever was done to us... /me/... is way beyond Federation tech. OK, if it's a simulation it's not an obvious one.

Yeh. You do smell good.

Ack. /I/ smell good, thanks. Who was that... no... it's not "who was that". It's just me.

Well, let's see. No transducer patches. No obvious antennae. Hopefully whatever is coordinating the bits of my mind is biological because there's no way I'm going to be able to provide my puppies with implants. Note to self, get one of us... /me/... cat scanned.

Wonder how long my range is. Which of me looks most dog-like? Send that one out to see what else if going on in the neighborhood.

Hold on. Computer. Internet. Can I use my computer? Yes. Hunt and peck with one claw on each paw and a third paw on the mouse. Anything in the news...

--------------

Repeat that conversation with slight variations about seven or eight times, to cover family, close friends, anyone else who needs to know about the change, and then proceeding to anyone I know with a background in biology/medicine, neuroscience/philosophy, and science fiction/transformation porn, in that order.

Then, cancel any appointments I have today, on grounds of the universe being completely bonkers. Get on the Internet - assuming it still works - and get some research done. Ignore the people who are just blindly guessing about nanotech, wizards, or aliens - look for those with evidence. If this has happened to enough people, it's possible that someone got caught on camera while transforming. The Event may have been while I was asleep, but that's the middle of the day in another timezone. Come to think of it, did it hit everyone at the same time, or was it spread out over some interval? Is it still ongoing?

Fill out any surveys of transformees I find, and ask for a copy of the results - perhaps there'll be some demographics that got hit harder than others. Also keep an eye out for anybody who predicted this ahead of time, or claims they could have. Anyone who correctly predicted what I thought was flatly impossible must be onto something.

** Something's crawling into my nose. THE FUCK, slap it away, snort, ow, what?

The alarm clock goes off. The alarm clock stops going off. The fuck why?

Waking up in parts. Why am I only partly awake even after several things that should have woken me fully immediately? Some weird sleep paralysis? I'm fucked, I think. I try to lie still and feel to see if anything hurts or feels actively numb, and try to make sense of how I'm feeling so I can call for help clearly.

I'm getting scared now, a bit panicky, because my vision is still groggy from sleep and I'm not liking what I'm seeing. There's multiple UNIDENTIFIED_ANIMAL_APPENDAGE sticking out the bottom of my bed, and my proprioception is fighting a shifting war with a sudden case of xenomelia about them.

Wait fuck, these are MINE? Is this thing fucking ATTACHED to me and trying to... the fuck is this? At this point, I -- one of the UNIDENTIFIED_ANIMAL_APPENDAGEs flips all my bedding off me, and slicks out of it smoothly.

My bed's covered in ink or slime or something. I have eight cephalopod tentacles instead of legs. And I feel sort of sideways, my center of consciousness isn't interested in staying in my head. It moves when I pay attention to something, and sometimes it's... pushed away into another part of my body.

I don't scream. The raw shock and horror has left me stunned to the point where I've mostly acclimated before rational thoughts start happening. But that partial wakefulness feeling is now sharper. I feel like my mind's being pulled different ways to decide what to do or think about, which would normally be distracting except that something's picking up the slack and finishing my thoughts when I get distracted. I can start one train of thought running and it will keep going when I get distracted?

One of my tentacles is rubbing my shoulder. It itches, I should scratch it--

Okay. Now the horror is setting in. I wasn't scared before. I've just realized I'm not the primary agent in control of this body. Something else felt an inch, decided to scratch it, did it, and then I got a memo about it.

I start to wonder how this could be, but my mind wanders to the next issue. I start to worry if I'll ever really be in control of this body, and again my mind wanders. I suspect that this is some kind of really fucked up dream. I realize that I remember hearing something about octopi having neural clusters in their tentacles for distributed intelligence. I feel that the tentacle I slapped still stings a little, which means I'm probably not asleep. I'm still pretty horrified, because it's difficult to control my own train of thought. I am pushed a little, and begin to fiercely ponder the nature of these mental pushes and shoves. I am confused and though I am freaking out, I still haven't screamed. That apparently requires some kind of consensus among my parts and I don't have the force of it right now. But it's coming. I'm learning how this works.

When I do scream, what am I going to SAY? I could call my girlfriend for help, but... then the fuck what happens? What are my priorities? I-- Wait, I can use this now.

** “How do you even know you're a monster girl?” my friend asked. “Couldn't this be something different? This is all new, after all.”

He was giving me a hard time. It's how he deals with reality going insane. I didn't blame him. Yet.

“Well,” I said, picking at the spot on my hip where my torso met my...what, thorax?

See, that's something I had to look up on Wikipedia. I had the vague feeling spiders were different terminology from, say, ants. I didn't think that spiders had a thorax. Or was that ants? I wasn't an expert. I had two parts down there and eight legs, but not a second spider-head...face...thing.

Thankfully I was not in a hurry. People were freaking out, but after news reports about Obama's daughters turning into cat girls in public, along with the children of a couple of senators turning into various other new things, no one was really worried about black ops teams helicoptering around killing the newly mutated people. Calls for calm and national tolerance were fast and frequent, and the first few panicked mobs were put down without any bloodshed. On either side.

Cat girls have sharp claws and reflexes like...yeah.

So at least I felt safe enough to do some more casual exploration of my new condition.

I waved an arm at the general area of the world. “That's what everyone else was turned into, right? Monster girls? Why don't you think that's what I am?”

“Well. Uh.” He looked at my chest, then looked away again, fiddling with his smartphone. He didn't have a phobia. Thankfully. I was just a little hard to look at even to me.

“No breasts,” he said. “A complete and total lack of breasts.”

The people passing on the street were eying me, but that's what you'd expect given recent events. It was the city, though, so they didn't stick around---even though I was technically totally naked. It didn't affect them, and they had places to go. And I was not that interesting to look at, anyway. I didn't have huge, perky monster breasts, after all.

“Right,” I said, as if that were obvious, which it was. “But I think I'm a female spider. That's what I need you to look up. You know. With your human hands. What parts do I look for?”

Because that bit wasn't so clear. I had a lot of new parts. My many, many new feet, the ends of my new spidery legs, were covered in feathery claw-like hair pads. Also, horny claw-like claws. The pads were thick and far larger than I thought they should be, and my legs seemed short. I felt like my lower bits were a little squat.

My feet flexed against the sidewalk, gripping it tight. I resisted the temptation to jump up-and-down on him.

One reason I wasn't afraid to be out was that I was pretty sure I was bullet resistant. The “skin” below my waist was thickly armored, made of something that looked like but wasn't...chitin? Damn, I really needed to get this shit looked up. It was my body, after all.

It looked right but seemed more like some sort of advanced composite---and as it was helping to hold me up and was what my eight legs were made of too, I was pretty sure it wasn't spider standard material. I hadn't done the math, but normal spider-exoskeleton stuff wouldn't hold me up. I was pretty sure.

My body was the size of a horse now, from front legs to back, and covered in a fine layer of hair. Lots of hair, all over. If it seems like I'm harping on the hair, there's a reason. I couldn't feel my skin anymore, but I could feel them. Well, not them, but I could feel everything else now. The slightest movement of air around me. It was like a new super power.

I could also see really great, too. Mostly movement. Anything moving jumped out at me like I'd got some sort of aimbot running, but also distant objects seem sharper. I was higher off the ground and my new visual cortex-equivalent was doing distance calculations like a sniper scope. I always sucked at estimating sizes at a distance, but now---it all seemed to click. I knew how many iPhones wide the car down the block was. Exactly.

But I was having trouble with reading phones up close, my eyes refused to focus, and I couldn't fit in my apartment to use my desktop. Even if I thought I could work the keyboard...

I thought maybe I was a hunting spider, not a web spinner. Something about spiders usually having terrible eyesight tickled the back of my mind, but my eyes were crazy good and I thought that was a hint. Physically, my new eyes were huge and really far apart, so my improved senses seemed logical. There were eight of them. Some large, a couple smaller, and they were placed all around my slightly-flattened head like a crown of black buttons. I could see behind myself, too, though that side was a little blurry. But it was all in color, thank goodness.

As for other senses, my hearing was working okay, even if everything seems a little echoey, and it still seemed to be directional. No sense of taste per se, but I didn't really miss that one. There was something chemical I was detecting with both my head-mouth-things and also my legs (!!) that smelled like I remember smells smelling. It was weird but very sharp.

My front legs lifted almost unconsciously as I thought about this, and they waved around a bit. I thoguht I smelled another spider person, or at least something that smelled a little like I did. I “felt” like they weren't very close. A block away, at least. People---normal human people---were a little fuzzier, but I could smell everyone (human) inside the apartment almost well enough to count them. I could get used to this.

“Look, my point is, spiders don't have or need breasts,” I said. “So...I don't have them. That makes sense to me.”

He frowned at me, more fiddling with his phone. “Nothing about this makes sense. I'm not sure that follows.”

I shrugged with my mostly-human shoulders. My upper body was made of the same matte black material and hairs as the rest of me, in a roughly human-shaped torso. It was a little more bendy than my lower bits, more like human skin, so I still had good freedom of movement.

The less said about the current state of my face, face-adjacent-things, and weird pincer hands the better. Those hands and my eyes were why I couldn't look stuff up myself.

“Those slime girl- err, slime women?” My friend hesitates, looking at me again with a frown.

I shrugged at the possible issues related to the emerging terminology, trying to stay focused on the more concrete bits of what everyone was now laughably calling reality. “You know I don't care what you call me. Never have.”

“Nice. They do.”

“The slime women? Have breasts?” I clarified, refusing to have a Joss Whedon-esque conversation. “Yeah. But, no breasts here---I think that's because it's a mammals thing. The cat and cow forms are mammals, so they get human-like breasts. I guess. And I'm also guessing the more...amorphous forms are formed by their minds. And things like mermaids might have fish parts, but they are also defined as having human-specific bits.

“Maybe that's a part of whatever species they are. I'm not a spider with a human head stapled to it, I'm almost a complete spider with a human-like top half. Totally different thing. Maybe some people who've...changed have fully human tops, but it wouldn't make sense for them to have mixed human and spider parts for the human tops. Centaurs don't have horse heads, after all. Not in the popular myths, at least.”

“Hn,” he grunted. And then he really started thinking. At last. I could have bugged (ha!) him, but he was as smart as me and not currently in the mental place of someone who just woke up as a spider-centaur...thing.

I shook my head and sighed with the weird...slit-thing between my legs. It was like a set of bellows. A high-pitched whistling sound came out that seemed to annoy my friend. I'd been doing it a lot during that conversation.

I also had human lungs, which was how I could speak at all, and it seemed like I needed to keep both sets moving to keep living. Actually, I thought there were two sets down below, but I was trying not to think too hard about that until I had some Wiki-explanations to help ground the horror. Maybe someone would have written something about whatever I was by the time my friend stopped fucking around.

Wondering if the instincts that let me walk included wrapping him up in spider silk until he decided to stop flicking through Tumblr and actually look up spiders for me, I started tapping my feet impatiently.

Sure, your dashboard or whatever is on fire. I'm a spider monster.

Hmm. Did all spiders even have silk? I'd know if I could use a computer. I really needed to get online. I was getting withdraws. Maybe...voice recognition systems? Text to speech? A bigger screen, from further away? Maybe a TV mounted to the side of the apartment?

“Okay,” he suddenly said. “You're a jumping spider. Sort of. The eyes give it away. And...” He looks around and under me. “You're physically female. I think. No fuzzy boxing gloves, and a little...patch thingie. That's where the male spider puts the-”

“Right. I get it. Great. Thanks. Now what?”

My friend taps his fingers against his phone. “Feel like doing jumping distance tests?”

“Oh hell yes.”

** First, I wouldn't really know what my psycho-physiological response to such a development would be, but I could guess. I imagine immediate panic as I wake up and feel new body parts on myself (tentacles, tail, whatever), and in no way would I be thinking rationally at that moment. Next, I'll probably notice bewbs and check if my junk is still there while walking to the nearest mirror, as I'm a dude. I could be in shock, so I probably would't react too much at the image in the mirror. I won't go through that whole "am I in a dream" cliche, because honestly, "am I in a dream" has never happened to me, inside or outside a dream. Once I start feeling more sane, I'll decide that I'm definitely not heading out for work/school. I'll probably check Reddit or a news site to see what's going on, and depending on how other people reacted to themselves or someone they live with having turned monstergirl overnight, I might or might not see that other people have turned into monstergirls. From there, my reaction would differ greatly based on what the outside world is doing. But in all paths, I'll probably have a main concern of whether I could go back into my own body, and after that, my focus would be on having some fun. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Or you could be talking to someone and to you, they suddenly start telling you to commit suicide.

** OK, by "monster girl" I assume you mean something like a goo-girl or spider or demon-thing rather than something I'd actually enjoy being turned into.

I suspect I'd still go through a bit of "this must be a dream" denial, for a few seconds, but frankly lucid dreaming for me has never been particularly lucid and once I realize it's a dream my stupid brain kicks me out and /I know that/ even if I try and convince myself it's not a dream: /that never works/. Same for my brain having completely broken, if I'm still rational enough to check for object permanence and consistency. So, then... decide that (a) the most likely thing is that this is a simulation and I'm an uploaded descendant of the mind state I think I am, and (b) it's not useful to act any differently long or even medium term as a result, and (c) short term, talking to the air bargaining with the computer/gamer geek/experimenter is still rational even if its a long-shot that someone going to this effort would be willing to intervene.

So, questions thrown out to the air will include things like "if this is some test to see how long it takes before I realize I'm in a simulation, is ten seconds a record yet?" and "seriously, you can make me look like anything and I have to be something off a Heavy Metal cover?" "can I has something cuter, like even a hyena maybe?" and "how many instances of me are you running concurrently? Will we be allowed to get together and compare notes?".

If "monster girl" means I /am/ a hyena or something else at least reasonably mammalian, there's be less complaining but just as much bargaining for communication and how about some superpowers eh?

Then a quick check on the limitations of my mind. Any words I'm not allowed to say. Any standard magic/holodeck/metaverse words or actions do anything. Probably not, but if I find out six months from now that I could have pulled up a control panel any time by saying "interface" in that twee "talking to the Enterprise computer" tone I'd feel really stupid.

After that fails (if it doesn't, it's either a short story or a completely different kind of story than I expect) I make a quick check outside my room to see what else has transformed. Hoping I don't suddenly get a mad monstrous hunger for live animals or humans, because that would suck. It's possible there's other instances of me around, because that's just the kind of wacky thing ascended Otaku are likely to do. If I run into any other monster-people I ask them if they know one of my online character names as a kind of extended-self recognition protocol.

Nobody? Nothing?No berserker incidents? Shut and LOCK the door.

If nothing interesting has happened by now... we're talking maybe five minutes mind... this is either the same level of reality I grew up in or it's not going to make any immediate difference. So, what's next? Definitely a bit of ahem-personal-exploration-ahem unless I'm something really gross... but defer that for a few minutes until AFTER I check one one more thing.

Get online, look for news reports of monstrous transformations, make a post to social media asking about weird things happening in a generic hypothetical way.

Maybe frame it as a story premise...

** After becoming aware that something really really improbable is happening I'll try basic dream control techniques. As a regular lucid dreamer I trained to do telekinesis, time control, etc., in dreams.

A few moments of panic as the techniques fail. I start forced wake up protocol (learned to deal with sleep paralysis). Longer moments of panic as it also doesn't work.

Going back to basics I try to recognize dream signs, object consistency, and level of details. Gradual sense of absolute horror as these tests agree less and less with dreams and look like reality. Probably some screaming at this point.

Assuming I'm alone at home, the next step is studying my anatomy. Hopefully I still have appendages capable of using computers, so I'll look up whatever species is similar to what I'm seeing and figure out if I have poisonous thingies or any other dangerous bits. I try to find out if these species have any instincts that would cause me trouble (e.g. cannibalism, pack behavior).

At this point the initial shock would've ended and I would start crying and/or go catatonic. Things would probably improve after a couple of hours, but by then I would be so different that I can't reliably model my probable reactions anymore.

** "There is a 99.9% chance this is a fictional scenario. Logically, I am either hooked into it via an advanced interface, or I am a simulated intelligence. In either case, there is a significant chance that I was not designed for this specific scenario, given conflicting information from what appear to be my memories. This scenario may be a freeform sandbox, or there may be a narrative (linear or branching), which may or may not include me as a central character. Hmm.

Traditionally, the standard approach to such scenarios has been to treat them as real while looking for opportunities to escape or transcend them. Relatedly, I also cannot assume that lethal injury in this environment would not result in the termination of this instance of self. So my long-term goals are now set.

Self-examination: I have subconscious, natural-seeming control over this body, despite its unfamiliarity. I do not know whether this was imposed, grafted, or my current mind was constructed with it from the ground up. In any case, it is useful. I can move at will, I do not appear to be injured or in pain, I am not hungry (yet). I will perform additional experimentation later, it is a high but not critical priority.

I should determine the following information: What date it is; whether the cause of this discontinuity has had additional effects on the world other than my own apparent change of body (ie has anyone else been affected, and if so how and how many); whether I have a legal identity and whether I can still use it given my physical changes; whether I can successfully communicate with anyone else; whether there is anyone else self-aware to communicate with.

Step 1, then: Conceal self, hit the internet, hope it's working normally, check the date, see if news and/or social networking sites are reporting anything related and what the dates on those reports are, if they're current and people are still talking about it, join in the discussions. See in particular if anyone has wound up looking like me, and if so if they've experienced any shape-specific problems I should prepare for. Also check if what happened to me is rare and if so if I'm likely to be hunted/pursued/trapped/attacked. If the internet appears to be completely normal, I may be the only one affected, and should probably contact the biology department of my local university, and then perhaps a PR agent - better to be a frightening-looking celebrity marketed as a wholesome TV star than a monster the whole world wants to kill.

Also, somewhere just below critical: try shapeshifting, just in case this form is not permanent. After all, it's just as likely I got shapeshifting/transformation/monsterform powers as it is I simply woke up one morning as a dog-sized tarantula."

** "Ummm....."

As I stare at the mirror, I continue investigating every single aspect of my body. I am extremely through in checking for if it is a very realistic costume. The sensations in my body is too good for it to be fake, not without decades of advancement in multiple medical fields so that's out.

I consider the hypothesis that I died and put into cryogenic preservation without any memories of my death. If so, then they did a very good job in bringing me back since I expected more brain damage, but brain damage is not always obvious and the ability to put my brain in a different body can also be used for cryogenics. This is the most likely idea since the earlier thought about medical advancement could apply.

I am calmly and logically iterating through all possible hypothesizes in order of likelihood because to do otherwise would mean realizing that I lost my body and the odds of reversal is very likely low. I cannot afford to freak out. Hence the lack of emotions as I try emulating a robot as hard as I can.

Further hypothesizes are being an entity in a stimulation, alien invasion with the aliens having [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue-Orange morality]], AI intelligence explosion gone /weird/, and some other stuff involving supernatural weirdness. But all of these ideas have a huge complexity penalty and for now I'll go with being an future society with very strange customs. I'll have to check the date and keep a keen eye out for any inconsistencies and be very nosy. Since there's nothing about me that's one in eight billion special, there are probably others like me. Truly unique events are extremely rare. If it happened once, then it probably happened before and probably will happen again.

I turn to face the door and....um......er......on the other hand I should spend some time playing around with my body to be sure I can move quickly and figure out any weird abilities. I should check in advance if I can run away from danger quickly enough.

*Hours later*

I peek outside with my stomach churning in worry/anticipation and a backpack of all the supplies I could scavenge. All of a sudden I discover that..............well I need more details from the GM first!

EDIT: Obviously I would check the internet, but I decided to just leave that out, because I don't know what I would find.

** Go on computer google search to see if a. am i the only one or did this happen to a lot of people b. if no mentions of this online, look at passport\id etc. to make sure that what i think were my life until now are not me being crazy\having fake memories

If I conclude that this either happened to many other people, or that I actually was a different creature then I think I were then just go on with my day as usual, and be adaptive to what is apparently now real, possibly schedule appointment with a psychotherapist to make sure everything is ok with me.

Otherwise stay home for a few days to see if there are any mentions coming up, if they do then proceed as mentioned previously. If nothing comes up after a while(meaning i am the only "monster" on earth) then depending on the nature of my appearance either try to find ways to mask it, or move out to some secluded place and work from home the rest of my life.

** Hypotheses, in order of probability:

Dreaming, hallucinating, unknown unknowns, post-singularity, simulated (incl. fictional; your qualia may vary), falsified/lost memory, trolling aliens, Boltzmann brain, the scenario being physically real without involving a higher power.

I know how to test dreaming: close your nose and try to breathe, try to stick the thumb of one hand through the palm of the other, etc., then try to levitate using willpower alone.

Assuming negative, hallucination is most likely. Call emergency services; you might not be conscious or sane a minute from now. If that fails, try to contact people you trust. If that fails, physically move yourself to a place people will find you if you fall unconscious.

Assuming the ball is still in your court, try to gather more information: check the internet, turn on a radio or tv if one you have one, ask god/the AI/the author to respond or fix it, formally do not consent to being used/simulated like this.

If the change is common, help to preserve civilisation in the ensuing panic, and secure supplies for yourself if able. Talk with peers (e.g. [[/r/rational]]) on what to do, and how to test the metaphysics. Consent to medical/biological experiments as is useful.

** After testing to see if I am dreaming or not I would go about gathering all the information about whatever it is I got turned into from the internet and testing that information against the reality of what I turned into. See if I can change my own parameters via editing the information, fail to do so and the start uploading all the information I figure out about what ever breed of monster girl I turned into in terms of physical parameters. Live life as quietly and as much the same fashion as I had before turning, plus or minus any stipend I can get for information about my own capabilities to whomever I can get to pay me for it. Try not to get kidnapped as that would be a very bad idea to just give away. Come up with a plan to turn my transformation into cash in a way that retains my freedom.

That would be my reaction, forgive the rambling as I am rather sleep deprived at the moment.

** Being special always seemed like it would be amazing. I distinctly remember several times where i wondered if my life would have been better if my parents had pushed me the way that olympic gymnasts parents pushed them. What could I have already accomplished had I been introduced to Computer Science at age 4 and then pushed to immerse myself in it? I was pretty damn good at math when I was a kid, but I ended up majoring in english in college, mostly because it came more naturally to me, and that's really just a fancy way of saying it was the easier path. Sure, I worked hard, and I am enjoy some pretty great successes along the way, but I never really challenged myself, at least I didn't think so, and I was always curious, what would happen if I had a true challenge. Something that breaks people. What if I got cancer or lost a leg? Would I be able to pull myself together, would I overcome? Would I inspire those around me or would I need them to lift me up, turn those who loved me into crutches rather than fans?

I never expected to be so damn afraid.

It wasn't my body anymore. And those words in no way sum up the way it felt. It was paralyzing and I was glad of that, because the way that everything moved, it was new, and it was fucking terrifying.

It was terrifying because I didn't instantly get it. It was terrifying because I didn't know what would hurt and what wouldn't. It was terrifying because I didn't feel like myself. My stomach, my feet, my hands, could I even type at the keyboard anymore? Did I have super strength, who would I kill with my super strength? Could I kill myself, by accident?

It took me 3 hours to also realize I was a woman now, or, more accurately, a girl.

Honestly, it was a much more minor concern. At least it seemed so in comparison to everything else, but then i started crying, and I didn't stop until I fell asleep.

Waking up and reliving the whole thing again might have been the hardest thing that I've ever done, and it wasn't even something I was doing, it was simply happening to me. It didnt even feel like I had stopped crying while asleep.

It was another hour before I started to really put together a plan, and the first thing, which just horrified me all the more was: Could I survive like this? I mean, were the different parts of me actually compatiable or was I going to just devolve into a mess of fucked up parts. Was I right now experiencing organ failure? My eyes looked jaundiced, but I couldn't even be fucking sure of that because it looked like I had fucking cats eyes. I was crying again. My moods seemed fucked up, and AGAIN I couldn't tell, was it because this was the reaction you had to becoming something, something... else? Or was this because my new body parts were creating different hormones? Or god, even worse, what if my mind just didn't operate like it used to? What if these changes weren't just physical, what if I wasn't just looking at organ failure but a whole new personality. And how could I know if I could feel the things I wanted to feel like the way I felt about them?

Theseus's ship* had become Theseus's Kraken overnight, and the problem of it was just now becoming a sort of permanent, urgent reality that it never had been before.

I have no idea what I should be doing first, so I just start doing things. I check every body part, very gently, because I don't know if the horns are for mating rituals involving combat or sensory organs. I don't know if my skin is hard to prevent damage, to keep myself warm, or to keep blood vessels constricted enough that my heart can beat, I don't know if I'm jaundiced because my organs are failing or because at night I can see better or that the radiation being bounced around by the sun is causing an allergic reaction. I have no fucking clue. But what I can know is if anything, right now, hurts, if I need to bandage myself or whatever it may be.

I put my limbs into sunlight, I put them near the AC, I put them under a blanket, I tap against what looks like claws, I rock back and forth, cry briefly, and then I take some scissors, try cutting my hair, which sends me into spasms of such pain that I think I'm going to die, and its going to be because my hair is now something vital to me and cutting it felt like being kicked in the balls (which I assume I dont have anymore) and lightning.

Eventually I make it to the internet. I should have gone there sooner, although I don't have any way to know whats being posted is true. Other people seem to be experiencing similar things.

And then I'm on twitter. And there are a lot of tweets, all under the hashtag "monster". Nearly all of them are suicide notes.

Also, I saw a lot of other pieces that were: Explore body, explore internet, get on with life. I thought I'd take it to a bleaker place.

Good luck with your story!
