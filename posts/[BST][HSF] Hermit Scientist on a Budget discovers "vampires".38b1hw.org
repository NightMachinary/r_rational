So I'm working on a story. The main character has pretty much abandoned society due to painful interpersonal conflicts, but is an educated scientist with a broad education (PhD, biomedical engineering, Masters in Cybernetics). Early in this story he meets two people with superhuman strength and speed who do indeed feed on blood. The character continues to publish and do online consulting but doesn't have a high degree of disposable income. What kind of a lab might he have thrown together in the few years preceding and what should his first experiments be?


** /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts, mentioned on the TV Tropes Rational Fic page, involves scientifically consistent vampires. Watts made a [[http://www.rifters.com/blindsight/vampires.htm][fictional documentary]] describing the efforts of the research team that discovered the extinct human subspecies responsible for the vampire myth.

So wait, does he actually have a vampire he can run tests on? If not, consider that step one.

Things to research:

- Vampires need blood. What does that mean? There are multiple components to blood, and multiple types of blood. Do vampires need red cells, white cells, platelets, plasma, or some combination? Can they subsist on animal blood? Can they subsist on blood substitutes like PolyHeme? What is the minimum level of blood that can sustain a vampire?
- Vampires are (usually) weak to the sun. What does that mean? Are they weak to a specific type of light, like UV? Are they weak to reflected sunlight? Can their weakness to sunlight be negated in some way, like high SPF sunscreen?
- Vampires are strong and fast. What are the limits of their strength and speed? What mechanism provides them with this strength and speed? Does their strength and speed surpass their caloric intake (in the form of blood)? How close to human-normal are their vital signs, and how do those vital signs change with exercise?
- Vampires can (usually) make more of their kind. What physiological changes occur to make someone a vampire? Can vampirism be induced in flesh absent a connection to a human (say, a fresh organ)?

Depending on what rules are immediately apparent, there are a bunch more tests that you would want to do. Some vampires exhibit seemingly psychological conditions, like an inability to cross running water, recoiling from a cross, inability to enter a home without an invitation, etc. Some vampires can't be reflected in a mirror. These are all things that you would want to test in various ways; the experimental models would be pretty simple in the beginning. Some of the experiments you would want to do would be ethically questionable, or at least pose safety risks to your vampire, but the vampires would have a fairly high incentive to cooperate in order to expand their own knowledge and gain some sort of advantage.

Some people on tumblr found out that coconut water has been injected into people's veins as a substitute for blood plasma in extreme circumstances. This naturally sparked a discussion of tropical coconut vampires.

Naturally, coconut water is a terrible substitute for whole blood, and any vampire that could live on coconut water could probably live on plain water, bananas, and a salt lick. But it's still amusing to think about.

I would suggest a type of bacteria/parasite that coexists with humanity creating a complex "vitamin" thats not known to other apes(assuming that vampires were "intelligently designed"/breed, I can't think of a an example of a subspecies being so radically different, besides dogs) this vitamin "v"(?) could be used to explain the super strength, and other abilities.

This vitamin could be tied into explaining human domination over nature(humans being having only a tiny amount of this vitamin v, could have evolved to use it in brain function?) but also why vampires gain power over time (it builds up in their system)

*** Yes he has a pair of cooperative vampires. An apparently 16, 16 year old and an apparently 24, 85 year old. The older one sometimes provides murky information but the young one will better explain that a very large majority of vampire weaknesses are psychological. For instance while most vampires find sunlight unnerving, the 85 year old seems to experience severe pain - but only if she knows she's been exposed to it. Similarly she seems to have a unique form of claustrophobia related to being in a home uninvited. It's easy to see with a back of the envelope calculation that their power output vastly outstrips their caloric intake. The minimum amount of blood it takes to sustain a vampire actually varies wildly. Some occasionally resort to feeding on themselves though they experience a dramatically reduced satiation. The younger one will admit that there is a small group of vampires that feed on each other.

Vampirism cannot be induced. They reproduce sexually with humans. A child is either born a vampire or a human. (Standard lore is that their must be a human involved since vampires are technically dead). Misunderstandings about turning come from the fact that if a human drinks vampire blood, they gain vampire-like abilities but only temporarily.

Most of this information could be gained through a simple interview (the energy-in vs energy-out could be done by having them lift weights or run around a track).

I'd already thought of most of these, but I already knew the answers so I figured I should give them to you to see if you see an obvious next step where I don't.

Edit: I missed the part about red-cells vs white-cells, etc. That isn't something that could be done from a simple interview, even harder since they probably wouldn't accept samples that you gave them. Drinking stored blood is generally looked down on, and drinking blood without the consent of the donor is a high crime in their society. The minimum penalty varies, but the maximum penalty for a repeat offender is death. Even if the offender didn't kill or otherwise harm the human(s) involved. Providing a processed sample of your own blood is also problematic for social reasons as well. Apparently to be socially acceptable, humans and vampires enter into life-long pair-bonded units. (Minor spoiler: this will become less of an issue after the main character saves the older vampire from social censure by pair-bonding with her, but that doesn't happen right away)

No need to answer these, but I would try to see: What exactly can they eat? Will any blood do? Does the creature have to be alive at the time of feeding? Does blood taken while the victim lived work after they are dead (probably easier to test if they can feed off of non-human blood). Do victims suffer worse effects than mere blood loss? Can vamps survive without blood? What about raw meat? Cooked meat? Vegetables? Do their powers vary in strength depending on how much they eat? What does their blood look like under a microscope? What happens if they get a blood transfusion? Do blood types matter? What exactly can their powers do? Can they overcome the frailty of their bones? Punch through metal? Heal wounds well? Do they get scars? Can they be in the sun? How quickly do sun-burn-wounds accrue and heal? Do they have any mental powers? Can they use those on each other? On a prepared and resisting target? Can they make me into a vampire? (Not gonna say no, unless there is some reason to think souls are real and somehow affected by the change) Do they remember their previous lives? Did their personalities change when they turned? Are they more charismatic now? Do they appear in mirrors? Can they go outside during the day if they are not struck by sunlight? Do UV lamps hurt them? How do they look on an X-ray? Can they reproduce sexually? (Might not be testable at this point, and they might not volunteer even if they are different sexes) Do they have power over any spawns they create? Is there a limit on how many new vampires they can make (There are reasons not to test this, since I can't trust them. Which is why they should turn /me/ and let /me/ conquer the world)? Do Vampires age (Ask and also examine their cells in culture)? Have they heard of other vampires aging? Or growing more powerful in terms of vampire power with time? Can they make Renfields (thralls)? Can Renfields be restored to freedom and sanity? Do they then remember everything that happened? Are vampires hurt by crosses, holy water, garlic, etc? Do objects of faith from other religions work? Do you have to believe in it for the objects to work? Would ideology work as a substitute for religion? What about new religions like Wicca or Scientology?

I'm not even sure what that means.

#+end_quote

But I will anyway. I'm realizing partially to my relief partially to my frustration that I pretty well covered all the basics. I'm giving out the answers to see if there's anything else that I might have missed. Being an author and knowing all the answers makes investigating hard.

Vampires can eat anything a human can eat and quite a bit more. Going without human blood generally turns them into jittery, ravenous fiends who will do anything to feed. A few vampires will have been known to feed on the dead, but they are social outcasts and most find it repulsive. Feeding on nonhuman sources is generally taboo but a few vampires pair bond with and feed on each other (and tend to hide that fact). I'm not sure what their blood looks like under a microscope though I do know what's going on there. They /can/ do things like overcome the frailty of their bones (or rather, their bones are much stronger than a humans). They heal perfectly unless they have a vampiric disease, only get scars in odd circumstances. They tend to avoid the sun, though some do so more than others. One of the interviewees notably experiences extreme pain when exposed to sunlight but only if she /knows/ she's experiencing it. (This is a known mental disorder common among vampires).

Most importantly, vampires are born vampires and they cannot turn humans. Thank you for the X-Ray idea, I'll have to figure that one out. What sort of things might you be looking for in an X-ray?

They don't have direct power over their children, but their society is still pretty feudal. Vampires seem to age but very slowly and there's anecdotal evidence that suggests they can reverse their age. Vampires do seem to grow more powerful over time, but some grow more powerful faster than others. Being older than someone else is no guarantee you will remain superior forever.

The creation of Renfields/ghouls is a sticky issue. Vampires /do/ seem to have some mental abilities, but there are hard limits on what a human can be made to do. Memories can be tweaked. They can be put to sleep or in a "trance" but they can't be made to kill themselves. Often a human might claim that they were subjected to The Gaze to avoid responsibility for something they did (in a vampiric court) which often works. Other times vampires will attribute a humans devotion to vampire they don't approve of as a use of the Gaze, but this is mere gossip. Both of the vampires the main character has access to are from the most powerful bloodline on earth and they are incapable of such things.

Vampires are also deeply religious and deeply conflicted about their place in their own belief systems. Most in the West are Christians, and don't know whether or not they can be redeemed. Thus when you shove a cross in their face as a means of defending yourself, they tend to panic and run away, afraid they might have offended God by doing whatever it was that they did to upset you.

Vampires have pretty good memories, though only a few have hyperthymesiatic level memories. Holy water and crosses only affect vampires (and western vampires at that) psychologically, but silver affects them all. Any sort of cut or stab with a silver edge is highly incapacitating to them and extremely painful.

Nothing in particular, although if their bones are harder then that would probably show up. That's probably the only thing that would show, unless they have organs we don't have, or some of their organs are changed in some way. Which reminds me: How do they get energy from blood? Is there something magical involved? Because in real life, blood is not that great of a food source (albeit an excellent source of iron). There might be something weird with their organs to accommodate the magical feeding or something.

Gotcha. Is there a mechanism here, or is it left vague? Could you poison someone by putting silver in their tea? With humans, you can poison someone over time by putting lead or gold in their water, although it'll take a while. Would vampires realize something was wrong immediately, or would it be harmless unless the silver was applied directly to the blood by a blade or something? What about a syringe with some silver in a solution? That'd be extremely bad for a human. Or what about a silver tipped club? Or running into them and hugging them while wearing an armor coated with silver? The silver weakness could potentially be very exploitable, although the main character might be hesitant to ask the vamps to let him study how he can hurt them.

And unrelated, can vamps get hooked on normal human drugs?

#+end_quote

To make stilted an analogy, I have the atomic layer of this setting fleshed out as well as the galactic layer. The middle layers are harder because I only know so much science. I imagine some of their organs would be quite different. For instance I /do/ know that their heart is dramatically different producing a constant flow of blood instead of a beat and leaving the systolic and diastolic bloodpressure always equal to each other. Beyond that, Their stomachs are probably larger. Their liver is probably tiny (but vastly more efficient). There's at least one entirely new organ, but while the main character could probably convince his new associates to take an X-ray rather easily, getting access to dead vampires for autopsy would be harder. Eventually he will think to see if anyone had done these kinds of investigations in the past and discover some Renaissance era journals. Relevant entries suggest that vampire muscles are not made out of meat but are made of some black substance that shines like metal.

#+begin_quote
  How do they get energy from blood?
#+end_quote

I'm not quite sure how to investigate this. Infrared cameras can confirm that, at rest, a vampire is radiating about 1/2 of what a human would. (Meaning their rest metabolism is probably around 40 watts, about half of which is used by their brains. And while vampires can eat human food, they don't need it. They seem to be subsisting on a few hundred calories a day, even when their peak power output can be hundreds of watts, even into the kilowatt range for short bursts. When feeding on only blood they produce almost no waste. (even less than what would be expected based on the small quantity).

#+begin_quote
  Is there a mechanism here, or is it left vague?
#+end_quote

There's an explicit mechanism. The only easy investigations here are historical documents. Vampires rarely stoop to using silver against each other, but there are accounts of humans using powdered silver against vampires as a poison. Almost any amount is debilitating (also the effect seems to be all or nothing), and the only cure is human blood (legend has it, the blood of the poisoner). How would you investigate further?

#+begin_quote
  Or what about a silver tipped club?
#+end_quote

I'm trying to imagine if there's any historical precedence for this. I can certainly imagine a human in the 1800s hitting a vampire over the head with a silver candlestick. In the short term, at least, the effects would be worse for a vampire than a human. A human in silver chainmail hugging a shirtless vampire would probably burn him a little, but nothing worse than a sunburn on a human and it wouldn't last particularly long.

#+begin_quote
  And unrelated, can vamps get hooked on normal human drugs?
#+end_quote

This is another one that I'm not sure if his two interviewees would know for certain. They would say they've never heard of such a thing though.

I appreciate it. I've been fleshing this setting out for years, but after reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, it inspired me to up my game. I know precisely the why and how behind vampirism and a great deal about their society and culture. I'm a little uncertain about the direction a professional scientist would take and if there's any obvious questions I haven't thought of. Another issue is that while sticking a blood slide under a typical optical microscope is an obvious go-to, I'm not sure what you would see even though I know what you'd be looking at. I suppose I should go to another sub and ask, (just don't stalk me. I mean, I could just tell you, but I think that would ruin the process for both of us.)

Once you get a handle on their culture it's pretty easy to talk them into a corner. They're too damn honorable for their own good. Also most of the story will see the main character pair bonded to the main vampire-character.

** This is an incoherent background. Someone with that level of social phobia would have found acquiring that breath of education very difficult. What you do instead is simply state that the character became a hermit because he or she discovered vampires, and reacted with an appropriate level of paranoia. Because the existence of vampires without that being common knowledge implies an insane level of control over society or information. So the formerly brilliant academic now avoids all contact with everyone lest they get dealt with by the time-traveling death squad or wandering band of mind-controllers.

** A few more tests:

- What is the mechanism for vampire reproduction? (In many cases it's "vampire bites you, then makes you drink its blood, then kills you.") Does the method give the vampire control of you? Does it freeze you at your current age / condition, or restore you to youth / health?
- What effect does vampire blood have on living humans? Does it heal?
- If vampire blood heals humans -- or at least doesn't hurt them -- do their organs have rejection factors?
- Are all vampires in perfect health? Are there vampires with allergies, or bad eyesight?
- How do vampires heal? Like normal humans, or are they on the "drink blood, maybe sleep, poof all damage repaired" model?

*** So I managed to get really sick immediately after making my post so I'm just going down the list of comments in the order they now appear.

I can imagine most of these tests can be done with a simple interview. Are there tests you would do that would that would require say, blood samples or any kind of lab equipment?

Edit: I'll go ahead an answer those since I answered someone else

Vampires reproduce sexually with humans. Vampires cannot turn a human into a vampire.\\
Vampire blood grants humans a small measure of the power of the donating vampire, including healing. According to the interview, there's at least one legend of a vampire who regenerated from just a skeleton. Vampires are immune to human diseases but have maladies of their own.\\
Vampires heal at a steady rate, as humans do, only much faster.\\
Vampires can regenerate bone, though it takes some time an a great deal of feeding (most go on a diet of animal organs to speed up the process) Vampires cannot turn into other forms quickly, though some vampires have the ability to do "fleshsculpting" which I am /totally/ not ripping off from Tzimisce Vicissitude. All vampires can feed their blood to an animal and gain the permanent obedience of that animal (they seem more intelligent afterwards as well). Vampires cannot fly, but the 85 year old can run at 60mph over open terrain and stick to walls like spiderman. She also has some mind control-like abilities. They seem to operate a bit like stage-hypnosis with the exception of being effective on almost anyone. Most interesting is the apparent clairvoyance the younger one has.

Virtually all of this information is relayed through a simple interview with no tests necessary aside from actually clocking the older one's running speed.

** Off topic but I want to rant.

Vampires, seem to be the antithesis to virtue/disgust ethics (much the same way zombies are the antithesis to individuality); and quite frankly virtue ethics are not popular at the moment, they've been declining for a while now; this isn't india where its rude to eat with your left hand or the middle east where its rude to point your feet at someone(or throw a shoe at say an idiot president), or the bible and shellfish, etc; arguments form disgust are rapidly falling out of favor(gay marriage and abortion for example) for this story to ring true, the main character is going to display virtue ethics "virtues" much the same way someone in a zombie apocalypse /MUST/ show the main virtues of individuality: intellect, carefully judging who to associate with, functioning without order(and the zombies failing with the opposite of course), etc.; and I'm not actually sure what those are.
