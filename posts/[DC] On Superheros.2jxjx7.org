  (As a side note, those superheroes who develop or invent entirely unique powers, and then hoard them? Screw those guys. When Edison invented the incandescent lightbulb, did he keep its secret to himself, and then bust nocturnal crime as the Illuminator? Fighting the nefarious Doktor Lightning with the help of the Amazing Flight Brothers? No. Because, as a man of Science, he was familiar with Newton's statement about the shoulders of giants.)
#+end_quote

Edison did, however, engage in extensive litigation around the patent rights to the incandescent bulb, and was fairly notoriously litigious about the use of "his" inventions. Edison /absolutely/ would have hoarded his inventions if he could have made money that way. Tesla was the one who eschewed patents and shared his discoveries and inventions.

**** From Tesla's Wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.
#+end_quote

Which is what I was talking about. There's also this quote from him about Marconi's use of his patents:

#+begin_quote
  Otis Pond, an engineer then working for Tesla, said, "Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you." Tesla replied, "Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents."
#+end_quote

Though the Patent Office reversed their decision and inexplicably (though probably through bribes or use of political power) granted Marconi the patent for radio, which made Tesla furious since that meant that Marconi could sue him. (The Supreme Court later reversed that decision.)

There are a number of other instances as well.

***** Again, this positive thing about Tesla on the internet sounds shaky. In fact, it sounds shaky at nearly every point. Wikipedia has no citation for Tesla forgoing patents (particularly relative to other inventors). The quote sounds too snappy to be verbatim. Impugning the motives of the patent office sounds like motivated reasoning. The fundamental principles of radio predate both Tesla and Marconi - calling anything "the patent for radio" sounds like it's obfuscating important technical details. I seem to recall something about the Supreme Court case being more complicated than you imply, and there being a third patent that predated either Tesla or Marconi.

**** Given that Tesla had an order of magnitude fewer patents than [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Edison_patents][Edison]] did, It's probably safe to say that relative to Edison he eschewed them, unless he invented fewer things or had fewer opportunities to patent.

***** Agreed. I would actually compare him to Newton - a brilliant man with a huge number of flaws that people often overlook due to the breadth of his practical work. Tesla had an obsession with a lot of what looks like quack science, and Newton with alchemy (and religious stuff).

****** There is very little reason for nearly everyone to fight/cause crime (though there's a bit of authorial figleaf for this one). Given that everyone is going to choose violence rather than profit or productivity, there is no reason for everyone to forgo guns (I've heard attempted justifications but it's a moronically unstable equilibrium /at best/). Secret identities are an inherently stupid, impractical idea; de-anonymizing someone is not that hard in our world, and with elevated stakes there would be a lot more effort/research put into it, making it almost trivial.

The entire setting is founded on some ridiculously implausible conceits, and it is possible to write interesting, high-quality superhero stories without those implausible conceits. This doesn't necessarily make Worm /bad/ fiction (though I do dislike it), but the degree to which the worldbuilding requires everyone to be holding the Idiot Ball all the time should heavily disqualify it from being considered rationalfic.

  And if you do, somehow, develop a special power or device that allows you to anticipate crimes or teleport to the scene... well, then you have the choice of either becoming a superhero with it, or patenting it, mass-producing it, becoming insanely rich, and putting it in the hands of the police who are already equipped and motivated to fight crime far better than you can anyway.
#+end_quote

My desire to put that kind of surveillance network into the hands of the police is /pretty/ low, even if I could build one using off-the-shelf software-defined radios and a bit of hackery. There are better things to work on.

Let's face it, that pretty much exists already - at least to intelligence agencies who can be less accountable than police.

If it could be build cheaply, I'd give it to /everyone/ and then start working on actual security.

*** To be fair, it doesn't have to be actual surveillance- It could easily be a black box that, somehow, can alert you when a crime is occurring and then teleport you to the scene, which can be made again, if not understood, ala the Machine of Death.

Is it then better to hoard it or sell it?

** /upvotes/

May I also recommend the same writer's webcomic, [[http://leftoversoup.com/][Leftover Soup]], which consists of 1)pretty good rapid-fire jokes 2)pretty good rapid-fire amateur philosophy 3)realistic, intelligent characters with very different viewpoints on the world 4)slow, detailed plot (time progresses fairly slowly in-comic) that progresses in a sensible, usually predictable way.

It's not necessarily /rational/ (the most-main character has hit several diabolus ex machinas), but it has many properties in common and is likely to appeal to this sub.

It's worth noting what the fairly common real life superheroes do- some do activism of some sort for a cause like environmentalism, some hand out food to the homeless or clean up litter, some patrol an area to keep it safe. It's very possible.

In the UK with me, there's this fairly well known superhero group which agitates for father's rights.

  I'm also not talking about the growing community of "Reals", people who dress up in spandex and walk for breast cancer or something. Some of those guys are very serious about what they do, and it's usually either heart-breakingly lame or frighteningly sociopathic. We'll ignore those guys for the purposes of this article.
