Given the Pathfinder RPG rules as written -- not counting any third-party content -- how far from the classic peasant dirt-farmer feudal system can we get?

My motivation is this: I am building a campaign in which a benevolent rational lich-king has taken the reigns of society for the public good. Things like Create Food and Water "traps" are the obvious first step; can we go further? What would such a society look like?


** [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][Here's a link to the Definitive Guide to the Tippyverse]], which might share some similarities. Crafting doesn't cost xp in Pathfinder, so you can basically ignore all the stupid xp harvesting schemes. IIRC, an automatically resetting /Wish/ trap only takes 100,000gp. Less for an automatically resetting /True Creation/ trap.

Better, you can use [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blood-money][/Blood Money/]] to get around (most) money requirements, and /Restoration/ will get all your Strength back. Depending on whether you're allowed to pay more Strength than you have, you can make permanent teleportation circles for the low cost of having a cleric cast fourth level spells on you.

The end game is a total elimination of scarcity, every important location linked to every other important location so that travel times are negligible, and no real need for a labor class because you can make golems all day, every day. Anyone important is going to have +5 to all stats from the /Wish/ traps, magic items are handed out like candy. [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/simulacrum][/Simulacrum/]] removes the need for real work, given your nigh-infinite money supply.

*** Note, however, that Blood Money can't be used by undead for bypassing the cost for expensive material components. So not as directly useful for the example lich-king.

As well as top-of-the-line Belts of Magnificence, giving them another +6 to all stats. (Or, if that doesn't exist in Pathfinder, then equivalent magic items.)

** As it was already said by alexanderwales, Tippyverse is worth chekcing out, as it's one of the rare examples of what would probably happen with world of such magic.

Another thing that you should check out is this greentext from 4chan: [[http://i.imgur.com/q6NwLbl.png]]

  2YE is now being published on Amazon.

  In accord with their Terms of Service I need to take it offline at all other locations.

  You can read it for free by creating a Kindle Unlimited account (free trial at: bit. do /ku-free-trial) and then going to the book at bit. do /amazon-2YE

I've paid for your stuff before, but if you're going to do stuff like that I'm not going to do it again. Natural monopolies are a lot worse in the tech world, and it's even more important that one company doesn't use anti-competitive practices to own humanities books, and how humanity is allowed to use those books.

**** Seems like kind of a raw deal for readers, even leaving the deal with Amazon aside. There are a bunch of links to that story that now basically say "go jump through these hoops if you want to read it", which doesn't feel great. I get the desire to monetize, but I would way rather have that monetization be upfront instead of after-the-fact.

***** Well, I had a few options:

1. Don't monetize, which means don't write full time which means don't produce nearly as much stuff for you to read for free.
2. Take the story down completely. This would have been the easiest option for me.
3. Publish on something other than Amazon that doesn't require exclusivity but also doesn't have the audience to be worth it
4. Publish on Amazon with the exclusivity-not-required option, which pays 35% royalties ($1.09 on a $3 story) and requires that the story be purchased instead of borrowed.\\

With the way I've done it you get to read the story for free. To do that you need to click one link to get to the story, a button to borrow it, and then a link to go to your cloud reader. (Yes, you need to set up a KU account /once/ but that's pretty trivial and amortizes over everything you ever borrow.)

I get roughly $1.34 (it varies) when you read it for free or +$1.94+ $1.76 (EDIT: just checked the actual value) when you buy it. (70% of $3 - "delivery charge" of $0.15 per MB because Amazon is a bunch of bastards.)

So. Given those options, what would you like me to have done?

****** 3 or 4.

I've got no problem with monetization. I do have a problem with monetizing something that owes much of its popularity to the fact that it was free in the first place, in such a way that you're removing it from easy access, and introducing barriers for people to read it. The 30-day-free-trial-then-upgrade-you-to-paid thing is a sleazy business model invented because businesses know that they have your credit card on file, and a fair number of people are just going to forget and get auto-billed every month without realizing until at one point they think, "Hey, what's this charge?".

It feels like a bait-and-switch to me. That's what's unpleasant about it. Removing the story entirely would be even more of a bait-and-switch, but you know that. This is how I feel. I don't expect you to change your mind, but you did ask.

**** This seems like an odd place to post this -- in public, on a site that isn't the one where the message was posted, in a thread about something else -- but I'll respond here.

First of all, I'm sorry to hear that you're offended by my choices and I'll be sorry to lose you as a customer. I hope you'll keep reading Team Anko and any other things that I write for free, as well as subscribe to [[http://bit.do/dks-list][the mailing list]], where I give away everything I write for free before posting it on Amazon. In the meantime, see below for a way to protest more effectively.

As to why I'm publishing with Amazon, it's simple: I need the money. Not too long ago I stopped being a computer programmer so that I could be an author. The reasons aren't important here, but they make sense to me.

Being a professional author is hard, and it's even harder to get started. There are a lot of places to publish online, but based on the research I've done, Amazon is by far the lion's share of the revenue. Personally, I have some moral problems with them as well -- I boycotted them for years over their 1-click patent. At the end of the day, though, if you want to make money writing eBooks, it's Amazon or go home.

There are still a couple ways for people to read my work without giving money to what I think we both agree is a predatory company.

First, you could join [[http://bit.do/dks-list][my mailing list]]; as mentioned above, everything I write gets given away for free to the mailing list before it goes up on Amazon. That may not be sustainable forever, but it's my current plan and I've been following through on it.

Alternatively, you could sign up for Kindle Select, which I suggest would be more effective than your current position.

The [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Kindle Select]] program lets you read unlimited books for free. It costs $10/month, but that link gets you a 1-month free trial. It's basically a library; you borrow books, return them, and borrow more. You can read them on any device (Kindle, iPad, etc) [[http://read.amazon.com][or online in your browser]]. As long as you read 10% of whatever you borrow, the author gets paid.

If KU is the only way you give money to Amazon and if you read at least 8 books a month then Amazon is losing money on you as a customer. (Note that when I say "read" I actually mean "open, then scroll through the first 10% of".) If you really don't like Amazon, I suggest that instead of boycotting authors, a more effective form of protest would be to sign up for KU and spend a few hours a week checking out books, scrolling through the first 10% and then returning them and doing it again.

Boycotting authors hurts them (and, arguably, you) but does nothing to affect Amazon. Taking my KU suggestion and encouraging others to do it would be a more effective way of punishing Amazon's bad behavior -- of course, you should really send them an email notifying them of what you're doing and why. It might get your Amazon account banned, but you presumably weren't using it anyway.

Once again, I'm sorry to hear you are so upset at my choices, and I hope that this has helped you understand why I've made them and given you some tools to make your objections heard by the people you're angry at.

EDIT: I just realized that maybe what you're irritated about is that you followed a link here to something that was pointing at a redirect to Amazon. My original post went up two days ago, but the first chapters of 2YE were removed only a few hours before you posted. The chapters that are NOT on Amazon are still available for free.
