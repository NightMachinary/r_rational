Hi [[/r/rational]], I thought you might be interested in a new serial I am starting. This is the first story I've ever written, so it will be a bit rough around the edges.The story will take place in a high fantasy world full of magic, powers, and all that goes along with that. The story follows a girl named Juliette who want's nothing to do with the Passions that grant these powers.

It will be written with rationality in mind, but it won't be 100% pure rational. I've got the first chapter done so far and will be updating the story twice monthly - around the 1st and 15th of the month if you are interested in continuing.

If you do take the time to read it, first, thank you! Second, please provide some constructive criticism. I want this story to be enjoyable to read, so your input really matters.

Again, thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy.

EDIT: Thank you for all of your help [[/r/rational]]. I've re-written the chapter (you can read it on the link above). I hope it's much easier to read and more enjoyable. Thanks again!


** Some technical thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  No mother.
#+end_quote

No, mother.

#+begin_quote
  You've seen what can do to people.
#+end_quote

what *it* can do

#+begin_quote
  Juliette, I understand your fear.
#+end_quote

In real life, people barely ever refer to others by name during conversations. The context makes it obvious who is being referred to.

#+begin_quote
  The Administrators
#+end_quote

That's a lot of Proper Noun Names used in quick succession with no real explanation.

#+begin_quote
  how I felt and helped
#+end_quote

*they* helped

#+begin_quote
  They are as thoughtless than an Ox
#+end_quote

*as* an ox? Also, weird capitalization

#+begin_quote
  Do you still have you're Para?
#+end_quote

*your.* Also, Para is yet another concept that's dumped on the reader in the first three hundred words.

#+begin_quote
  forbit
#+end_quote

forbid

#+begin_quote
  Right mother?
#+end_quote

Right*,* mother?

#+begin_quote
  Though Oliver was much younger -- barely into his teenage years, Alton and Oliver has a strong relationship.
#+end_quote

Weird mix of a comma and an en-dash to separate a parenthetical. Use either commas or dashes on both sides.

#+begin_quote
  Other's thought that
#+end_quote

Other*s*

#+begin_quote
  Upon not receiving a Passion they seek to destroy the Heart
#+end_quote

comma after Passion, else the "passion they seek" can be read as its own thing.

#+begin_quote
  Or turning into something, worse.
#+end_quote

No comma there. Maybe an ellipsis if you want a pause.

#+begin_quote
  she said outloud.
#+end_quote

out loud

#+begin_quote
  ignoring the stares of her /neighbors/
#+end_quote

I'd advise not using italics. The less you have them, the more impact they have, and here it would be more impactful to describe why she thinks of them strongly enough to warrant italics rather than leaving that up to the reader to decide.

#+begin_quote
  His hard, features now made him intimidating
#+end_quote

no comma

#+begin_quote
  to make due
#+end_quote

make *do*

#+begin_quote
  Even at this early hour her eyes were bright
#+end_quote

comma after "hour"

#+begin_quote
  She was wearing a new yellow tunic, that fit her form perfectly.
#+end_quote

no comma necessary

#+begin_quote
  I just don't feel right about it Jane.
#+end_quote

When referring to people by names or titles, those are separated with commas. Again, I'd skip them here entirely because nobody talks like that. If there are multiple people talking, then it makes more sense.

#+begin_quote
  “But...” Jane said
#+end_quote

Missing period. Could also use some description to let the reader know it's a leading question.

#+begin_quote
  She grabbed me lightly by the elbow
#+end_quote

weird perspective shift to first person.

#+begin_quote
  It was a draw of luck
#+end_quote

Luck of the draw?

#+begin_quote
  Hastings and Doyen's
#+end_quote

Doyen*s*

#+begin_quote
  the mornings conversation
#+end_quote

morning*'*s

#+begin_quote
  You can fold the clothes husband,
#+end_quote

You can fold the clothes*,* husband,

#+begin_quote
  while I fix the wagon!”.
#+end_quote

No period.

#+begin_quote
  If this is going to change our lives, I want to share that moment with you."
#+end_quote

Feels a bit abrupt given how we just met Jane. Also, comma instead of period at the end.

#+begin_quote
  I could tell she was getting restless
#+end_quote

another perspective shift to first person

#+begin_quote
  she'd have princesses and Leader's
#+end_quote

Leader*s*

#+begin_quote
  “A rock.” Jane responded.
#+end_quote

"A rock*,*" Jane responded.

#+begin_quote
  a blemish on within the glow.
#+end_quote

Remove "on." Also, maybe explain more that she's no longer in the room, at least mentally.

--------------

More generally, there's a lot of dialogue and not a lot of description going between there. Another thing I noticed was that there were a lot of concepts dropped in in very quick succession, and while a lot of them can be inferred from context, it's somewhat overwhelming.

*** Thank you for the detailed feedback. I'll pour through this and clean up my chapter. I was worried about the overflow of concepts to be honest, and it sounds like that was warranted. I'll see what I can do make it easier to understand and flesh out concepts when they are introduced.

When you say, “a lot of dialogue and not a lot of description.” What do you mean? Do you mean description of characters or the concepts themselves?

**** I'm just a random pleb so take it with a grain of salt, but reading through it didn't feel like it pulled me into the scene because dialogue alone doesn't carry a lot of tone. Not seeing the ticks, mannerisms, reactions and in general all of the nonverbal communication between the characters makes it harder for me to give a voice to the dialogue in my head.

Just a head's up, in the description of the story, there is is small typo

#+begin_quote
  She has to decide either to *joining* the system, or become the first to live without a Passion.
#+end_quote

Should be "either to join the system" or "between joining the system."

I am a bit confused about this part,

#+begin_quote
  They say the Heart amplifies a person's true self. In a moment of rage, the Heart might amplify that and twist the person to fit their true form. But Oliver? The boy had never fought, didn't even raise his voice.

  Back when he yelled for Juliette's attention when the Slick entered the city gates. She had been out making a delivery Alton had missed, and not even noticed the commotion from the guards that a Slick had gotten in.
#+end_quote

Was there supposed to be something in between the two paragraphs? I don't know if I'm missing something, but I feel like there's a piece missing here.

*** I'm rewriting chapter one to make it more palatable. There were too many pronouns, mixed perspectives, tenses and ambiguous parts. Basically I got excited and tried to cram too much at once. I'll be rewriting it and will probably have to increase the chapter length. Hopefully it because less jarring. You didn't miss anything. It was a quick way of describing Oliver as respectful, right minded boy. But it missed the mark and I've taken that portion out. Would you like me to let you know when it's ready?
