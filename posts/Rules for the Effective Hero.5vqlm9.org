** But being rational you lose the plot armor. Are the benefits you gain are worth the power of the storyteller being on your side? I don't think so. Statistical evidence that in heroes adventures where the hero does stupid shit the end result (number of loved ones severly hurt) is much better.

*** Alternatively, behaving sensibly increases the chances of you being in a rational!fic significantly, which tend to end up with the hero achieving some form of godhood, and thus a long run much more beneficial situation.

*** As I've mentioned before, this is because the stories which end "...and thus perished our hero" don't tend to get retold. Legends are evidence, yes, but they're too infected with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias][survivorship bias]] to be used as proper data.

Plot armor is an artifact of poor sampling methodology, not a superpower.

*** u/LeifCarrotson:
#+begin_quote
  (number of +loved+ ones severly hurt)
#+end_quote

The hero's loved ones aren't the important thing. Did Superman or Batman actually act the hero when civilians died off screen as the results of their actions or inactions?

From the article:

#+begin_quote
  20 Collateral damage is bad PR.
#+end_quote

Collateral damage to people is tragic. Not bad PR, people /died/. Collateral damage to property - say, a skyscraper collapsing - is probably a more expensive than the income that your mild mannered alter ego will earn in their entire lifetime.

**** It is funny, because now that I think about it, a lot of heroic stories make more sense if the hero's goal isn't really to save people, but to defeat the enemy.

** u/Kylinger:
#+begin_quote
  Give weapons and combat training to the beautiful damsel as soon as possible. Give the same training to the cute kid.
#+end_quote

Only do this if you want to turn yourself into the tragic backstory of a YA fantasy novel.

** I disagree wholeheartedly with "why did you do it" being a useless question. If you know the why of something happening you can prevent it happening in the future.
