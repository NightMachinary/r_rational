#+begin_quote
  The world called out for a hero to purge it of a great evil. It received Broccoli Bunch, explorer, expert cleaner, occasional ghost-buster, and full time Cinnamon Bun.

  *Features include:*

  /Talking enemies into becoming friends/

  /Hugging menu boxes/

  /Awesome overpowered skills (such as Cleaning, and Gardening)/

  /And more adventure than you could shake a stick at!/

  Follow Broccoli on her personal quest to make all the friends. /All/ of them.

Hello [[/r/rational][r/rational]]

This is Cinnamon Bun, a comedic take on the typical LitRPG, where every trope is played backwards. The main character is happy and doesn't know the first thing about angst, she gets exactly no overpowered skills, and her luck isn't all that incredible.

The idea was to take every staple trope and cliche and do the opposite while still keeping to the core of what makes a story a LitRPG.

It's currently available on Royal Road, where it will be updating every weekday (Mon to Fri) until it drops off the front page, where it will continue to update three times a week for a long time (I hope!)

No, but playing them /backwards/ does make it a deconstruction.

****** Deconstruction is one of the tagged categories for the sub on the sidebar, so I think it's pretty reasonable to post one here, personally. LitRPGs tend to be hard magic, too, which is another valid tag for the sub. I haven't actually read this one, but I don't mind seeing things that aren't full rational here as long as they're properly tagged (and this one seems to be).

******* Read the opening chapter. This feels like pretty much like the oppiste of rational. The deconstruction makes it go future into the oppise diaretion of what rational fiction is. Unless the story changes in other chapters it is based around an airhead mc who the skill box littearly describes as niave and too pure. All the signs point to this being a deconstruction of a the niave mc whos super luck and friendship powers lead them to defeating the bad guys, which is anthore way of saying the oppist of this sub.

** Fun, and I'll probably read the whole thing, but Cinnamon Bun is really not a human. They don't give their classmate a message for their parents? Or feel angst, or starvation (concerns about poison should decrease after getting Identify)? They practice cleaning rather than trying to grind for Stealth or other plausibly-useful skills? They don't notice the weird domesticity of their assigned class and immediately try cooking, sewing, etc.? They don't even think about signalling the airship?

The story would be a lot different if these sorts of things were fleshed out - and not necessarily better at being what it is. But the protagonist would definitely be more of a person, and less of a doll animated by the needs of the plot.

** My hot take:

I have been reading Cinnamon Bun and I like it a lot. It is very good and I will gladly recommend it to everyone. I am just not sure its rational fiction. This is not a negative thing either, I dont think the fic would be nearly as good if Broccoli was a very rational protagonist. Now, this might of course change later if Broccoli for example starts to think more critically about some of her priorities and wondering how these classes might be effecting her mental state. So depending on how meta you are going to take this (the Erogamer is good nsfw example of taking all the implications of being a protagonist of an erogame to its logical and terrifying conclusions, with out making the protagonist some avatar of rationality), the fic might eventually fit in here, but I just dont know if it fits right now.

Generally if its good and people upvote it, that seems to be okay with everyone though so I hope some people see this thread and find something they like.

*** Yeah same - I like it and it's fun, but I don't think it belongs to any of the specific definitions of "rational" in this subreddit.

However, I do think this story falls into a lot of the themes that people who like rational fiction also like. In my head I think of it as the "sensibility porn" genre; classically, it's exemplified by things like the way Ankh-Morpork deals with invaders: by welcoming them in and selling them things.

It's not rational, but it is reasonable and sensible in extreme situations - just because you got Isekai'd to another dimension doesn't mean you should automatically assume everything wants to kill you. Why not talk to the monsters before resorting to violence?

******* I don't know how much you already know, so I'll define some terms first, because it's hard to explain Erogamer without those terms.

A Quest is a kind of interactive fiction, where the audience votes to decide what direction the story will take next, and the author continues the story in the direction that the audience has decided. An example of a Quest would be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gac3jc/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/][Legacy of the Goddess]].

A LitRPG is a kind of fiction (often portal fantasy) where the protagonist finds themselves in a role-playing game, with stats, and levels, etc., and has to discover the rules of the game, and find a way to survive and win. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/galt0r/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_196200/][Worth the Candle]] is probably the most popular LitRPG in [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

There's a subgenre of Quests that overlaps with LitRPG, called Gamer Quests. It's a LitRPG where the direction of the story is decided through audience participation, so pretty much just the two previous concepts combined.

Finally, there is a genre of game called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroge][eroge]]. I'm not going to go into any depth explaining that; if you want an explanation, click the link. The TLDR is: erotic anime videogame.

So, The Erogamer is a Gamer Quest where the protagonist finds that the rules of reality have been rewritten so that, while she's still living in the same city, with the same family and friends, she's also the protagonist of an eroge, and her life has accordingly taken a turn towards the surreal.

As you might expect from an Eroge Gamer Quest, it's decidedly, explicitly, over-the-top NSFW. Like, so NSFW that you have to register for the forum where it's posted, in order to get access to read it, because they don't want people stumbling across that kind of thing accidentally.

And it's very, very well written. Not just "well-written for a NSFW Gamer Quest," but well-written /in its own right/. It deals with themes of depression, body image, transhumanism, consent, and more, and does so in a sensitive, thought-provoking way, yet without losing any of the fun of its premise.

If that sounds like it interests you, [[/u/MisterCommonMarket][u/MisterCommonMarket]] has provided a link.

One last caveat: it is currently on a coronavirus-related hiatus, so don't expect updates for a while. However, it's pretty long, so you shouldn't have to worry about that right away. I guess my point is: don't rush through it.

******* Oh you are in for a treat.

First of all The Erogamer is erotica, so written porn. But it is so much more. The best description i could give is that it is an erotic rational existential horror comedy. It is funny, scary and sexy in all the right ways. It tells the story of a girl who wakes up one day as an erogame (like a japanese porn visual novel/ or porngame) protagonist. There are silly and funny arcs, but the story also deals with very heavy topics like power, individual rights, body image, rape and consent in a very intelligent and considerate manner. Saying anything more would be a spoiler. The only reason I have not suggested this to my friends, is that suggesting porn to people you know is embarrassing.

You can find it on questionable questing, the nsfw section. It is honestly amazingly good and the writer puts in so much effort.
