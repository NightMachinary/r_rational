** Interviewing Leather was the work that convinced me that serialized prose fiction in an original superhero world was worth writing, and inspired me to start 'The Fall of Doc Future'. Recommended.

**** Short answer- I doubt it. I've been waiting at least two years and although the author posts on the blog section occasionally, no fiction has appeared.

I still think Trey is worth reading but really it's just a teaser, at this point.

Ah well. Shucks, just when it was getting good too.

If you haven't read it already I'd suggest Worm. Really good superhero webserial.
