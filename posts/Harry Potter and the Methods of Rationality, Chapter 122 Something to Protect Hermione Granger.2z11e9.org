** Consider that Mr.Yudkowski [[#s][CH 122 spoiler]]

I'll try to read and leave reviews on all spinoffs that are attempted and shared, and I'm down to bounce ideas and drafts. This seems like a golden opportunity to dip toes into rational/rationalist writing.

**** Ye, I am aware of these marvellous compositions. But with the Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort story complete, there's now a sandbox world of a rational universe that can be explored in any way desired. One could have humanist, rational but non-rationalist rebels fighting against a utilitarian dictator Hermione, the political career of the Girl Who Revived could be a story, or one could spin a tale of a super-powered unicorn Heroine wandering the earth, doing moral deeds and scratching lethifolds. It's like we finished the main campaign in Skyrim, and we can now do whatever we want.

******* I'd offer to write it but apparently I can't write short stories -- I can do ~flash fiction ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10069991/1/A-Wizard-Named-Harry-in-505-Words][around 500 words]]) and I can do novellas, but I seem to suck at being in the middle.

******** /Of course/ someone wrote and performed a minor rock-opera about that whole bit of fictional history. And unless I missed quite a lot, they animated it themselves, too.

Also, all the jokes about Luna being /really bad/ at socializing are now really obvious. /Who the hell/ shows up to a party in a magically-enhanced Grim Reaper costume designed to closely imitate the real thing?

******* Doesn't really matter in this case, as if she can cast the True Patronus Charm the Dementors will not even notice her as they die. The risk of death comes from the loss of life energy or whatever the equivalent is in HPMOR!Core, and that would likely have no issue vis a vis Horcrux.
