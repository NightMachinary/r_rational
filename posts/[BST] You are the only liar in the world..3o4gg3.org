You can lie. This is special. Nobody else can.

It's not as simple as that, of course. Liars have existed in the past. Everyone knows about them. They tend to climb and climb, drunk on power, and then their lies crash down around them.

No-one ever says it, but they must be thinking it: Of course, the successful liars would never be found.

Here is what truth is: If you say it (and aren't a liar like you), you believe it is the truth. If you swear it, you are obligated to attempt to achieve it to the best of your ability - physically obligated, not just "I should really" obligated.

You can't do this. You can lie. You can say, "I'll get you that paper by Thursday", and then /not actually try/ to get that paper by Thursday. And you can say "I couldn't do it" and they don't really suspect you of lying, because liars are not Nice People. Not like you

Or, at least, seem to be. You can lie, after all.

So, yep. You're a baseline human in a world of people with write access to their own utility functions and an inviolable compulsion to tell the truth.

How do you exploit this? How does this bite you in the ass? What does society (apart from you) look like?

Also everyone is better at polit-speak than Hillary Clinton - if you stil want to be able to communicate without committing you need to be extremely careful what you say.

"I will go the gym every day for a year for at least one hour". BAM everyone is fit.

I will not every again steal - bam no prisons-

I will not order my military to fire nuclear weapon on your country unless you do any of the following: -not reciprocating, defecting etc etc- bam no nuclear war

I'd disagree with this being able to write your utility function... Saying "I will be attracted to mewtwo-kin starting from next friday" does not mean you will be attracted, only that you will make an attempt at conversion- by reading porn/whatever- but it is no more or less successful than our world today is.

So liars... They probably get caught early in life, and brandmarked- and then special pressganged into roles that need liars- giant corporation negotiations, war negotiations etc- so you'd first have to avoid that.

** I try to avoid lying whenever possible. I may share with a single trusted confidant my ability to lie, after getting them to promise not to tell, and talk with them about it from that point on. I record the promise, just in case they, too, are a liar, in which case we have a mutually assured destruction. I then tell them that I made such a recording, either after the promise, but before I tell them my secret. I always ask them for guidance before any lie. lying is like necromancy (well, most representations,) or diabolism... it can be used well, but generally shouldn't be treated lightly.

I try to avoid using my powers, prefering to use wording where even if it is a lie, it could be mistaken for twisty wording that is technichally true. there's probably a concept like this- not liars, but twisties, or some similar, but better, name. people who try to make you think they said something, but actually said something completely different, much like the fae or characters in pact.

generally, I would avoid making promises. I would lie about the past on occasion, but never about the future- getting that paper by thursday is difficult. If I made a promise, it would be as vauge as possible. not "I'll get you that paper by thursday" but "I'll get you that paper as soon as practical, without interfering with my ability to function on the other tasks" or "as soon as the other deadlines are fulfilled." or just "I can get you that paper by wednesday".

I would claim that my hesitation to make specific promises is because I don't like being dragged into awkward situations, like pulling an all-nighter four days straight to finish said paper. given that honest people actually don't like stuff like this, i wouldn't be looked at that oddly- everyone hesitates to commit, genuinely pausing. it's ingrained, and after a few slip ups in elementary, middle and high school, most people don't make the mistake again. people include a lot of conditions in their promises for that reason.

I suspect that there will be people who suspect i'm a liar, but given that i'm the only one known in 7 billion, they may hesitate, excusing it away, or react the same way they would if they told someone else i'm an alien.

(my family probably knows about the inability to pre-commit, though... 5 year olds have poor judgement. unless kids are generally exempt, which would kinda make sense... commiting to do something literally impossible may make you push yourself far further than you should. maybe self-deception works, or your body shuts down automatically before when ours would if we tried that? or there's just a precommitance every child is told to make, where if their path to the commitment seriously endangers their health, they won't do it,and this commitment last until they're [16-18?])

** The "write access to their utility functions" - their /economic/ utility functions, not their stated preferences - is a superpower in it's own right, and maybe a better one than mine. I'm pretty lazy.

Presumably delusional people still exist, so I can't claim just anything and have people believe it. I'd probably still have trouble starting a religion or becoming President.

This society would have no need of credentials of any kind, which means I can pretend to be a cop or any other kind of official.

I suspect most people would abuse the ability to edit their utility function and mess themselves up. I don't just mean simple screwups, I mean things like suicide bombers, I'd-kill-for-you /true/ love, and deontological rules. So this society *has* to have found a way around that; it might be as simple as an unrealistic oath simply feeling like a lie - "huh, I guess I actually don't care that much, sorry" - or it might not have evolved into anything even vaguely resembling our culture, something more like a society of self-modifying AIs, in which case I'm not going to be much help.

I can probably scam people out of their money fairly easily, if I'm careful. Or murder them.

It's probably much easier to argue people into things. I don't even need to lie, really. Just ask them what they really care about, why they really object to something, why they really believe what they believe. Then construe or twist the evidence and fast-talk that thing away, or into supporting me instead.

Depending on how humble I'm feeling, I could set up a bunch of Effective Altruists who've sworn oaths, or a bunch of EAs who've sworn oaths and will obey me without question.

There's probably a good way to hack this into really good scientific/rationalist "cells" of a few people, who've sworn to listen to each other, pay attention to niggling doubts, try and test their beliefs, maximize utility, stuff like that. Basically a Bayesian built out of three or four people.

Potential converts /may well be/ selected at random, at least in part. (edit: /and/ I threw that line in at the time to fit the genre more than as a practical suggestion. If they were selected based on specific criteria you researched ahead of time, you can tell them that, too. Or skip the justification entirely, whatever, they're still /at very least/ as gullible as real-world people.)

How "standard" a procedure is is fairly subjective; it's certainly true enough for our purposes once you've done it a /few/ times.

And that last line is of course optional in the case that a subject is, for some reason, /not/ perfect for the organization (by way of being a normal, /programmable/ member of productive society). How you cover your tracks in such a case is left as an excercise for the reader.

So either declarative statements like "I will get you this by Friday" are commonly understood to mean that this is your intent and your best guess of what will happen - or languages evolve such that "It is my belief that given an expected sequence of events and accurate knowledge of both my own capabilities and the difficulties ahead that this will occur on Friday" will take much less time to say!

If you plan to trick someone into saying "this will be done by Friday" and they had a normal human understanding of risk and chance, consider that for most people a strong declarative statement like that would actually be a lie!

Or worse yet, something that was really easy but has become really hard ("I'll kiss your cousin Jimmy tomorrow" and cousin Jimmy drowns in the middle of the Atlantic).

How does memory work? Can you forget parts of your promises over time? If someone has amnesia will he try to fulfill all his past promises without knowing what the hell he is doing?

Honestly, it seems like every promise about the future will make you into an automaton. Because fulfilling "I will give you that paper on Thursday" makes you not only write it till Thursday but also try to evade every mishap that could happen and minimize the chance that the paper will never reach its destination. That includes things like making as many copies as possible, minimizing the chances of both your own death and that of your recipient in any way you can think of and probably hovering near the recipient so you can give him the paper on 00:00:01 Tuesday.

I think you should rethink how the future statements part works.

"I also agree to the terms of the contract."

"No, officer, I have nothing to do with that person. We are not related in any way."

In a world where lying is impossible, the law will change to reflect that. It's probably legally impossible to convict a secret lier for a crime - if you say that you didn't do it, the law sees that as very strong evidence that you actually didn't.

Contract law would reflect that, too. Agree to a contract verbally, and everyone will trust that you'll keep to the terms.

Plus, a regular person might literally be bound to be unable to explain or justify their actions.

You can also impersonate anyone - ID means asking someone to introduce themselves. Identity checking means asking a short series of carefully engineered questions, and arresting those who refuse to answer.

All combined, you could rob banks just by talking to them. You are also the only person in the world who can be a spy - an amazing advantage in any kind of conflict. Don't worry about being bad at it, because counterintelligence doesn't exist and no one can doubt anything you say.

With money, military victory, and the ability to betray others, you will be able to gain power and set yourself up to rule.

However... Compared to others, you're lazy, weak willed, and unable to truly commit. You might get stuck with bad habits, incorrect beliefs, or unwanted emotions. You will never receive any help for or even understanding of these problems.

You will casualy ask questions that force people into months-long comitements, you will tell much too much about yourself and your plans, like you are some superhuman selfassured boasting jerk.

If you grew up there - you will probably be a loser - just because every other kid HAD to do their homework, and HAD to learn for exam, and you didn't. Are there even exams and do they ever check homework? It may be very late when they discover how far you are behind, because the society isn't prepared for kids that can pretend they do their work. In this respect your special ability is a huge disadvantage - everybody will be better at everything than you, unless you are 100% motivated to be good at that thing.

Anyway - at some point you will fall behind, so you'll probably learn to give good excuses, and eventually nothing external will work, so you will probably be considered dumber than average.

Also there is no fiction teaching people how to succesfuly deceive others on this world (and probably no games with imperfect knowledge and bluffing) so you will still be quite naive compared to a human from our world.

I'd say you should pracits small scale deception, and then completely change einvoronment to leave back your "loser" image and all suspictions people who knew you have about you, before you use your deception skills on fresh victims.
