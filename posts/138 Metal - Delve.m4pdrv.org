  *1. Only post rational fiction links or discussion*

  If we're not on-topic, what's the point? If you just want to talk to likeminded people, we have a variety of weekly threads for that.

This post breaks Rule 1 from the sidebar. If only there was something we could do about posts that break rules.

** Some might call it a bit of a do-nothing chapter, but by those standards it was pretty fun at least, leagues better than the bastion-fest last week. Of all the random POVs we get at various times Tallheart is one that didn't seem random and wasted.

Honestly, I would love if the story experimented with restricting POV to like, Rain, Tallheart, and Amelia. Whatever the flaws they have at least they get consistent focus, offer decent variety, and all interact with each other frequently.

** Rune system is a pain don't see a way to exploit it since the only explanation of cap linits are "runes won't allow it" and "cap determined by metals used". It doesn't explain how different metal caps is explained either.

Since he's using different metals with different caps that means caps are using the highest cap as long as you have enough material for it. Meaning you could slap a plate of very high tier cold resistance armor and get a high cold resistance cap as long as you have the right rune combination and material for it.

** #+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Nope, see below.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

Nope. Let's start a company because...

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Nope. Look at the most recent fight, and judge the "intelligence" on display there.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Nope, but that's a high bar to pass.

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

Yup. The system of adventurers and the Watch broadly makes sense, along with plate hunters, organized empires, etc.

1/5 features does not make the story rational.

*** I think you should stop posting this. Regardless of my thinking on this particular topic, it's clear to me that if you hadn't posted this comment, the engagement this link generated would be reduced by half or more. If you want this story out of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] your best bet is to downvote it when it appears and not comment.

*** 1. Rain uses his knowledge of programming to improve his interface and get greater value out in of his auras

2. Rains has multiple goals that are explicit stated: he wants he help people affected by the rank shift, he want to keep himself and his friends save, he wants to create a way for driven individuals to awaken.

3. On this point we can argue all we want. If you think the creation of ascension was dumb and useless this point isn't fullfil es, if you like it you do. In addition it seems to me that some people seem to think a rational fiction needs an mc that power wanks everyone while functioning like a computer.

4. No rain doesn't spend time going is rationality. But he is spending a lot of time on introspection and his clarity induced memory could arguably be counted in that direction.

Edit: hurr durr numbers don't go big, story bad

** 1) Delve chapter gets posted

(pick one)

2a) Complaint about level cap

2b) This is not a rational story

3a) when the level cap is raised on patreon there *will* be someone who posts about it. Until then, read other shit.

3b) Recognize that early Delve (1-50?) likely brought more people to this subreddit than anything not on the podium (HPMOR, etc)

4) do it all over again next week

Until then, I think everyone who isn't a patron should have recognized that this is not a story worth reading every week. Hide these posts and move on.

Huh? Just out of curiosity, how long have you been here? Or by ‘podium' do you mean some tautology like ‘precisely all stories that brought more people here than Delve.'

As an aside, this community is mature enough I don't think ‘work which clashes with its values and causes contention brought a /bunch/ of outsiders here' would be a plus anyway.

**** Idk, Probably ~8 months? I don't know how to check besides going back through my comments.

Early Delve chapters generated a ton of comments and upvotes, consistently. I remember reading through them after I read each chapter when I picked this story up. It started falling off and now interaction is the lowest it's ever been.

As far as the podium comment I made, it was half in jest and half what I actually believe. I think HPMOR clearly generated a ton of interaction on this sub/for rational writing, from my POV maybe the most? Delve did the same, to a lesser extent.

I don't agree with your comment on outsiders. More people on this sub -> more people writing rational stories -> better rational stories for me to read. That's my opinion.

It sadly doesn't work that way. The more it deviates the more likely the community is to split. [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is supposed to be about stories that follow what we consider rational fiction, the moment that deviates too much people will go / create better places for finding those types of stories.

​

The sub should grow, that's beneficial and something most people should want, but it should grow because more people that enjoy those stories learn about it. Not because unrelated deviating stories get posted here.
