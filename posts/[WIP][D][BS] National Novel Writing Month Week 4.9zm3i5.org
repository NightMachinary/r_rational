This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]], which started November 1st.

- Want to check in on making some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?
- Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

** well, as I predicted, it was a pretty craptastic nano for me because I was so busy with schoolwork this month. That said, for thanksgiving break I found some time to polish my third "arc".

I feel like this arc kind of got away from me. I didn't really have a good picture of what would happen going into it. I had the rough idea that I wanted to start introducing certain characters, with some scheming and plotting simmering in the background. But then the scheming sort of exploded out of control. I think this is probably good, though, since it's the result of my characters doing what they think is best at any given moment, and the arc ends in a good place. I'm sort of worried it's too convoluted, though, and that nobody will be able to understand what's going on (especially since there are a bunch of crucial mysteries underlying people's actions that aren't revealed yet).

There's a tension between trying to make my characters properly paranoid and getting them to actually do exciting things. The overwhelming pressure of trying to be properly paranoid and maintaining a mask all the time is supposed to be a running theme. But if things feel too stifled, then they'll be boring.
