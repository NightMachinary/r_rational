** I like it despite not being into libertarian stuff usually. I was very disturbed by the offhand comment "technically women can't rape men" because I'm not sure if it was supposed to be irony or not, seeing as how the men were mind controlled and clearly raped.

*** If "technically" was supposed to mean "legally", well, that's been the case in a fair few places where the legal definition of rape involves penetration. Other than that, asinine.

** I don't think the whole thing is online anymore, but I read it while it was being written. The whole story is well written and a nicely rationalist take on the SuperHero genre. It dips into the politics of being a SuperHero with an (obviously) Libertarian bent. Overall it's a lot of fun.

*** The evil government somewhat weakens it. The government is holding the idiot ball, factions are clearly defined by good or evil, and the character solves problems through unlimited application of her omnipotence.

*** The libertarian bit turns me off a bit. Depending on how it's handled. Libertarian is one of those words that can mean anything or nothing.

**** In this case it means "the government is super evil." Mildly annoying, but sure whatever we're in an alternate universe where the government is super evil.

There are politics endorsed in the comic, but they're not particularly libertarian - if anything they're Green Party. Except that, of course, the government is super evil, and the role it would normally play is instead played by our perfect hero.

**** I'm generally skeptical of the quasi-utopian claims that many libertarians make, but this comic was quite good.
