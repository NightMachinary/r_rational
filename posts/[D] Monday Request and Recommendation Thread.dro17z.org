Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** So, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][The World As It Appears to Be]] by [[/u/Benedict_SC]] is an amazing piece of Overwatch fanfic. Let me count the ways:

1. It succeeds /as writing/. The characters have depth and chemistry. The dialogues are on point. The plot twists are well done.

2. It succeeds /as science-fiction/. It takes a decent stab at hardening Overwatch's hand-waved soft-SF. It has non-silly AI. It has an SF device that I had never encountered before (and I've read a lot of SF), that raises interesting questions.

3. It succeeds /as fanfiction/. All characters sound just like their Overwatch canon selves. You just naturally start hearing them talk in their voices. (With the unfortunate exception of Mercy. Though to be fair, Mercy has shown very little of herself in canon; in all her lines, her two emotions are detached heroism and doctor baby-talk.)

4. But more than that: it takes characters which, in canon, are largely two-dimensional caricatures, and /gives/ them depth, richness, and [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][intelligence]] - all the while remaining true to the caricature. Same with the setting, which is faithful to canon but adds elements that just feel right. Almost everything about this fic slotted right into my headcanon.

 

So, having read this jewel, I got hungry for more Overwatch fanfics. And I got forcefully reminded of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's law]].

Most of what floats to the top of AO3 doesn't even succeed as fanfic. It's just some (gay romance) story with characters who share a name (and /usually/ species and /maybe/ job) with canon but are nothing alike personality-wise. I have nothing against Hanzo/McCree slashfic if that's what you want to write, but dammit girl, McCree has one of the most recognisable voice in Overwatch, would it kill you to write your dialogue to match?

I've lowered my standards considerably but I'm still disappointed. Does anyone have recs?

**** Hmm, the fic does reference Overwatch canon a /lot/. Much of the plot points and surprise character appearances might seem a bit... random, without the background.

So I do think that the more you know about Overwatch, the more you'll enjoy this fic. (There's even subtler references to game mechanics and cosmetic items, for the enthusiasts.)

That being said, there's not that much Overwatch lore altogether, and at least some of it is accessible through competently made animated shorts. If you have half an hour and don't mind being marketed to, I'd recommend watching:

***** Oh, yeah, I wrote a thing about a dude with save scum powers trying to avert the apocalypse for NaNo last year, but I felt like it sort of fell apart at the ending (which I rushed because NaNo) and I've been meaning to rewrite and expand on the ending and actually put it up somewhere (outside of a google docs link on my Tumblr), but I got this full-time job eating my time. It's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/edit][here]] if you really want to read it, but it's not really up to my standards since I was forcing it to the end to hit the target. Plus, while I try to be clever, it's probably not proper rationalfic since there's surely ways an optimizer who was really trying could have done considerably better (as opposed to the protagonist, who's kind of a slacker.)

Also, thanks for the TWAIATB rec! I... don't have any real recs of my own, unfortunately. I read a decently IC McHanzo fic once that had a pretty compelling B-plot for a while, but it's not rationalfic and it kind of lost the plot after the sexual tension resolved and it switched over to being mostly smut and angst. Don't recall the name off the top of my head and I can't unreservedly recommend it, either. It's a dang shame.

Wait, no, I remember, it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127210/chapters/16186526][Hang the Fool]]. I never actually finished it, but yeah now that I found it again, I can confirm that it's, like, pretty darn well-done for what it is, but the what-it-is definitely traded off against my enjoyment and I kind of lost interest once it took the foreground.

** I wanted more places to discuss one of my recent favourite webnovels, so I'm going to recommend [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] again here and hopefully get more people reading.

The story takes place in an alternate universe Europe in early industrial/colonial era, and the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories. After a relatively slow start where the background of the world is methodically fleshed out (until the MC joins the equivalent of magic Scotland Yard), the plot begins accelerating from one story arc to the next with minimal filler and minimal "idiot balls required by plot".

I think one of the things I appreciate most is how the Chinese protagonist being from Earth actually is significant to the plot, both to his advantage in surviving the world of mysteries as well as in how he reacts to little things other writers usually skip over. From little things like his love for trying out local cuisines, to his empathy for colonised natives / poor washerwomen / lead-poisoned factory workers common to that era, trying his hardest not to get innocent lives involved despite that being riskier for himself and his goals, and the feeling of going home alone while gazing out at the stars and bright lights shining out from the windows of other houses. It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory and because someone already did it before him.

He's also one of the few main characters that goes to the toilet often and consistently, funnily enough.

However, one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names. There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often.

*** I'll give this a tentative rec. By the standards of it's main selling point as xianxia by way of hermetecism it does an excellent job. Well researched, several fleshed out characters, and an interesting world.

The MC has clear, thematic, and limited powers that reward creative use and is decently intelligent, and the magic system is very consistent as of chap ~550.

By the standards of normal fiction, not so much. Translation jank, aggravating transphobia, and a good deal of as yet unjustified plot armor make it a harder sell to anyone outside the existing audiences for translated webnovels.

But seriously, if you do read this stuff, definitely check it out. IMHO its on par with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and Way of Choices

***** Can't pull up a direct quote, but basically one of the cultivation routes, in addition to incentiveizng the user to act evil (on the order of wanton blood sacrifice), turns them into a woman. The thing is, whenever this pathway is mentioned, whoever brings it up will condemn or mock them for this trait. It's on the order of 1 sentence every ~50 chapters so only grating if you're archive bingeing.

I'll also specifically note that in setting it mostly been the case that people grudgingly accept it as the price of power, not bc the're actually trans. Almost certainly just authorial bias shinning through and not a deliberate plot point.

There's another pathway that turns the drinker male, who is similarly mocked but to a lesser degree. Also, there is an actual trans character (gender dysphoria) who pursued the turn-into-woman pathway for the effect, but she did not yet appear in the currently translated chapters.

I've read ORV and I found it interesting. However, I find ORV's tackling of nationality-based superpowers rather unsettling, and the MC's obsession with martyring himself hard to understand. ORV also has one or more characters change genders as one of their superpowers.

For the former, every country would have had equivalents, it's just that Korean incarnations were unreasonably successful.

For the latter, while it is a reasonable outgrowth of how stories/tales work in-setting, it's also undeniably unpleasant. Thankfully, that arc was relatively short.

Regarding the MC's martyr complex it might be some combination of access to resurrection abilities, trauma from his family situation, genuine affection for the other people involved, and his (incorrect) self-perception as the only person able to change the story But honestly I don't get it either.

I find the entire premise of putting "objectional author politics" warnings troublesome. The author's politics shouldn't really be relevant, the question is the content. Trigger warnings should be reserved for disturbing content, and even then my understanding is that studies indicate they cause people with trauma more distress, not less. Regardless reading an author with different politics is not traumatizing.

Moreover in this case the author hasn't said or done anything objectionable. Even the characters haven't done or said anything objectionable. Igigigif is just inferring that the author is unsympathetic because some of the characters had a slightly mocking reaction to learning that a group of villains were forced to turn into women if they wanted to continue down their magical path to power (the magical paths being unswappable, incredibly dangerous, and each step a secret). These people are not trans in any real world way. They accepted magical sex change in order to gain magical power, and the issue of their gender identity hasn't really come up. Igigigif may be correct about the author (china is not known for progressive views on trans issues), but their evidence as described is definitely lacking, nor did they even actually link such.

*********** In the interest of discussion, I have linked some of the relevant chapters for review. If you guys don't mind spoilers, I think this should help clear up things.

For some background: the power is associated with a villainous cult who worships an evil goddess, where those higher in the cult become more and more alike their deity (thus the change in gender for male followers). Few if any of the cult's members are portrayed as sympathetic as a result. However, every single cultist that became female was described in the text as supernaturally attractive (to both genders).

I think the first instance in which the involved character's POV is shown is [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-66][Chapter 66]].

The MC is aware of the involved character's new existence in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-125/][Chapter 125]]. She has shown up twice earlier without the MC realising her change in gender.

The MC finds another, kills her, and finds out some information regarding why they change into women in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-195][Chapters 195-200]].

An important person's diary talked briefly about having sex with someone from the cult in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-290/][Chapter 290]], but he might be unaware of the fact many of them are former men.

The same diary writer mocks the other pathway that turns women into men in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-484/][Chapter 484]].

The MC meets the first escaped cultist again, now a fugitive running away from being a mistress of a Prince and being subjected to supernatural brainwashing in [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-470/][Chapter 470-471]].

This is quite a large topic, and only tangentially relevant so I will just say that worldview may inform content, but you don't automatically know how (or what someones worldview actually is). If you can't point out something wrong with the actual content, clearly it hasn't been 'informed' in a damaging way. So why condemn it just because you don't agree with the author on everything.

So? Having a trans character proves what? Someone said there is a trans character outside the current translation (I don't know about that part, and presumably you don't either), they didn't say they were portrayed poorly.

You are claiming the author is a bigot. The evidence for that is that someone on reddit said that they thought some of the characters in the book written by the author would think negatively about hypothetical trans characters because these characters thought something slightly negative about some other non trans characters.

I read the story, it's very long so maybe I missed something, but to my recollection it just had, as I said, a few characters express surprise and amusement. The MC has a few mocking thoughts (schadenfreude) about the surprise these (evil) men must have had at learning the secret that they must transform into women. It's complicated because these people didn't want to transform, but they still chose to for magical power. It's unknown whether they identify as women or men. The main plot point was simply that this transformation made tracking one of them very difficult. The scenario just doesn't really map onto real life.

This is really insufficient to accuse the author of bigotry, much less post said accusation on every mention of his book.

***************** Being transformed to a sex not your own is treated as a painful/difficult thing by the MC, that's not transphobic.

To my recollection the male transform potion is mentioned in one line, with just an offhand thought that it wasn't quite as bad for the drinker -- a pretty clear fact in victorian fantasy land.

You post a tag "Objectionable author politics" that links to a post saying there's transphobia, and in sub comments say that you think the author is a bigot, and some people don't like supporting bigots. I don't see how that isn't an accusation. You really don't see a problem with posting that on every mention of the book?

Once again you have nothing at all from the author himself. You are entirely assuming the opinion of a character is the opinion of the author. Moreover you are assuming the opinion of the character, because that's hardly clear. Moreover you haven't even read the supposed problematic parts yourself.

Of course the author might be bigoted, I do think this is very slight Bayesian evidence of that, but I think you are way overstating it, and that's not a trivial accusation.

***************** I have, in the past, written a short story in which one of the characters was Adolf Hitler. Now, I think we can all agree that his politics were highly objectionable.

More generally, is there any good reason to assume that an author's politics must always match the politics of the characters he writes?

This is actually very hard to do, usually resulting from very small snippets of text, which /really/ isn't the case, because when an issue in mentioned more than once and in more than a very offhand manner, the author's actual opinion tends to shine through.

That's reasonable. So, let's consider the case where the author is silent on the matter.

#+begin_quote
  If that's not viable, you look at their culture and see if they've explicitly denied having X position.
#+end_quote

Um... if they've denied holding X position, then that's something written when they're not writing a story. So, this really folds into the above.

#+begin_quote
  Then you look at what's implied in-story, look at the tone, how the narrator treats X issue.
#+end_quote

This is where it gets /super/ tricky. In-story implications, especially about a subject that the /reader/ feels intensely about, can easily be seen where they were never meant.

This goes double when the author and the reader are from different cultures (or different time periods). And /triple/ when there's a translator in the mix. Potential sources for confusion include:

- The author uses terms which have become slurs in Culture A. However, the author himself is a member of Culture B, which has different slurs.
- The translator has a bias which the author does not share; this shades the translation one way or the other.
- The author uses what he considers to be natural language (e.g. using the phrase "all the guys" to describe a partially-female group). A reader is expecting extreme correctness of terms and calls that sexism.
- The author is /not/ trying to write all his characters to be extremely politically correct, and is rather trying to imply that they are flawed in various ways. Some of these flaws are assumed to reflect on the author by an oversensitive reader.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Hey now, don't put words in my mouth. I can't tell you the /precise/ worldview of someone given only indirect information. However, a writer does put a lot of themself into their works. Little glimpses past the curtain build up, become evidence of one idea or another the author may have. So while an author using slurs /may/ be an innocent mistake from someone with another culture, and their characters may just be written to be terrible people, and casual bigotry in language or action could just be the author showing how bigotry manifests, it's a bit harder to excuse it all away when you put a lot of evidence together. So while yes, the translator could have subtly shaded the story in such a way as to promote a false version of the author's actual intent, such a thing is pretty unlikely. And while the casual sneering going on about how other characters are trapped in the body of the wrong sex could just be showing how our everyman self-insert protagonist is actually a bigot, the lack of anyone calling out that behavior makes it doubtful. And while a casual reference to X social group could be, just by chance, coded in a way that people who irrationally dislike X social group tend to code them, when it happens multiple times, it's very unlikely. These stack up.

********************* Apologies for reading too much into your words. (But do you see how /easy/ it is to do?)

A writer puts a lot of themselves into their works, yes. But not /just/ themselves. A writer also puts in what they observe of the world around them.

A writer who observes bigotry can include it without being a bigot. A writer who observes bigotry not being called out by society can include bigotry without calling it out for multiple reasons; including the possibility of being a reflection on society, a subtle commentary on societal reactions, and so on.

Indeed. However, it's one more data point. For Lord of the Mysteries, there is enough data for me to pretty conclusively say that the story is taking a side on that issue, and it is not a positive one. While a statement can have unintended implications, especially if an author is not very skilled, there's just too much here to dismiss.

I would recommend you to keep reading, at least for a "novel" experience involving the work of a writer from another culture. The writer's plot ideas and weaving narrative definitely shines through despite the occasional bad prose, I guarantee.

Part of the prose is because of the translator's choice of words, but the Chinese language (like other East Asian languages actually) favours a lot of quirks in writing like repetition for emphasis, off-hand references to idioms (that comes off as long-winded in English), onomatopoeia, and words with double/triple meanings which are all relevant in context.

If I have to rate the translation, it turns what should be a 9/10 story into high 7/10. Not as great as it should be, but still definitely worth reading.

*** I'm reading it, and I like it, and it helps that new chapters get translated pretty much every day (sometimes a few times per day). To follow up on some of your comments...

#+begin_quote
  the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories
#+end_quote

You're not kidding here! Bloodborne especially, as one of the aliases the protagonist is using is Gehrman Sparrow, which is a combination of Gehrman the First Hunter from BB and Jack Sparrow from Pirates.

#+begin_quote
  It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory...
#+end_quote

Well, he does kinda get a photographic memory eventually, as well as the ability for others to create copies of things they have read. And another part of the reason he isn't able to uplift the world is because oil essentially doesn't exist, so a lot of the technology he knows about isn't something that is feasible. It is a refreshing take on the trope, though.

#+begin_quote
  one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names.
#+end_quote

I have never seen so much lampooning before!

There's also some amount of cultural differences too. The protagonist seems pretty disgusted by trans characters, and mocks gay people. It took me a long time to figure out, but "curly-haired baboon" is a an awkward turn of phrase that seems to be a translation for a gay slur of some kind. Originally I just thought it was a generic insult, but later on it is used specifically to refer to a gay character.

It definitely isn't the worst kind of work for these things, and they are fairly rare. But each time they kinda caught me by surprise.

#+begin_quote
  There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often.
#+end_quote

I'm not in this camp, but if I had a criticism it would be that the protagonist doesn't really seem to focus on getting back to his original world, nor does he miss his friends/family/old life. Yes, you can argue that his eventual goal is to ascend to godhood and hopefully have enough power to send himself back... but it really doesn't intrude on his mind. It's like he claims he wants to go back because the author feels like that's an obvious thing to want, but by not focusing on what he's missing it just feels like an excuse. It also stood out to me that the protagonist refers to himself by the name of the person whose body he took over, not as his original name. Even internally he thinks of himself as Klein, not Zhou Mingrui. I feel like this is a common isekai problem, where the protagonist being pulled into a new world is just a simple plot device so that audience understands where his references come from, but it isn't how a real person would likely act or think.

Those minor quibbles aside, I second the rec. It's an interesting world with a neat power system that gets used in creative ways.

I did find in chapter 624:

#+begin_quote
  In accordance with Admiral Amyrius Rieveldt's traits, he decided to first use work as an excuse. After that would be the excuse of him not feeling well, him losing the ability to have sex, him needing some time to digest any medicine he had just taken, and how he had suddenly realized his true sexual orientation, making him find curly-haired baboons extremely attractive.
#+end_quote

A few chapters later he uses the phrase again, though it's less overtly about being gay:

#+begin_quote
  H/e's a gentleman who's of good bearing and garners the affection of women. Eh, this point is open to debate. With his standing and status, even a curly-haired baboon would garner the affection of men and women, no---perhaps even more. At the very least, a curly-haired baboon doesn't tell dated jokes.../
#+end_quote

Much earlier, in chapter 462, we have this part:

#+begin_quote
  “23rd April. This bunch of aristocrats really are a mess! I even thought that Ma'am Karen had seduced me for sex because she had taken a fancy for my inner self. But who knew that her husband, the Earl of Champagne, was peeping in the opposite room. He was even thrilled and even f**king wanted to f**k me!

  Klein was momentarily speechless. He felt that the private life of Emperor Roselle was really filled with excitement and that many of the Intis aristocracy were also sufficiently eccentric.

  /If some aristocrat tries to seek novelty and finds a curly-haired baboon, some kind of disease might even be born.../ Klein sighed and looked down.
#+end_quote

Rereading it now, it seems less clear that it's a gay slur. But a good number of the times it gets used, it is as part of a situation discussing non-heterosexual sex. It doesn't come up often, but much of the time it does, it's basically comparing non-straight sex to being as eccentric as having sex with curly-haired baboons.

From the three passages quoted, I believe the slur isn't referring to gay characters, more a generic insult comparing humans to simians. Also, the last passage is likely referring to HIV originating from monkeys (beastality) as well as the rather eccentric cuckold/voyeur fetish.

It's often hilarious, extremely well translated (especially after the first few chapters) by Chinese webnovel standards and is notable among its peers for having a protagonist who, for once, is just a Tom Hanks-level nice dude who tries to help people.

** This week I watched:

/The Lighthouse/. Very artsy and allegorical, sometimes at its own expense. The horror elements were understated. I confess I don't think it lived up to the hype it's been getting. Pattinson and Dafoe were excellent, but the movie was overlong and, after a fashion, under-resolved. 8/10; if you liked Robert Eggers's other work, /The Witch,/ you'll like this.

/The King/ on Netflix. An amalgamation of Shakespeare's Henriad and the real history of Henry V, I think it tried too hard to hit a middle ground between the two and failed to live up to its promise on either side. I liked, among other things, the reimagining of Falstaff's character and basically everyone's performance. The combat scenes were brutal. Making a Henry V movie without the St. Crispin's day speech is attempting too much to subvert expectations, though. 7.5/10; wonderful cinematography, acting, and sound design that carries a slightly thin script quite far. Undermined a bit by a whitewashing of Henry's motivations and his lack of agency in some ways and a cartoonish depiction of the Dauphin (although Pattinson is magnificently over the top).

And I read J. M. Coetzee's /Disgrace/ in one sitting on a flight. Absolute gutpunch of a novel. A tight and gripping first half that turns exhausting yet held me hostage until I finished it. An interesting meditation on apartheid, reparation, gender relations, and language set in racially divided South Africa. Coetzee's prose is as excellent as always, and the religious symbolism and political commentary manages to be simultaneously overt, explicit, and impartial. 9/10, but I'm never going to read it again.

In terms of web fiction, I'm continuing to be disappointed in the LitRPG / Gamelit stuff out there. From RoyalRoad's offerings, /Azarinth Healer/ was poor, and /New World/ too; the stories available for free trend towards endlessly introspective garbage with more time spent on character stats and bland fight scenes than narrative substance.

/He Who Fights With Monsters/ was quality, though, and I would recommend it (which makes it amongst the only gamelit stuff I would that I've read, along with /Worth the Candle/ and /Threadbare/). I can't quite call it rational fiction, but it is somewhat internally consistent and the main character's social intelligence is higher and better written than you often see in these kind of stories.

/Azarinth Healer/ involves a protagonist who behaves more like a video game character then a real person tossed into a dangerous person. Reckless and not at all like a person. But there is math, if you like that sort of thing.

***** Yeah but for me, the numbers/math is a pro, and it does some cool stuff with it. By having the main character figure out the formulas behind his stats and skills, he can use it to figure out the fastest leveling speed and best skills to buy.

It makes the specific numbers actually meaningful instead of the nearly meaningless stat increases in say, Azarinth Healer and Legend of Randidly Ghosthound (no links because I recommend against them).

If you really want some litrpgs with the stat pages and numbers a rarity, try [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B074C9P3YF/?ie=UTF8&fp=1&pc_redir=T1][Way of the Shaman]].

There's a focus on the game but it's on skill usage instead of increasing the level/skill number. Stat pages are shown like once per book.

#+end_quote

Genuinely curious about the meaning of this statement. Are we requiring protagonists in rationalist fiction have rationalism as their sole defining character trait? Or that they think and talk about rationality? This could be one of the missing pieces that explains why what I think of when I read the official criteria diverges so much from what the group suggests. Personally, I find the idea a protagonist has no personality beyond "rational" a bad thing. I'm also not a super fan of characters who preach rationality...it raises the stakes, makes it more obnoxious if the character does act irrational down the road. Nothing worse then a Murder Hobo preaching logic. I kind of like a character who is quietly sensible.

There is a serial I've been following that features a rational protagonist and which seems to be developing a semi-hard magic system. The protagonist also has a reverence for mysticism, whic makes sense in-universe because the world seems to be set up to reward a certain level of mysticism. Is that rational fiction, and would it irritate people in this community?

Anyway, Street Cultivation is unique in that it deconstructs the Cultivation genre. Nobody does that...the super hero and Epic Fantasy genres are deconstructed all the time. The Cultivation genre tends to be very ritualized and the exact opposite of rationalism...the standard Cultivation universe doesn't quite make sense and the standard protagonist is a reckless gambler with some huge blind spots.

****** Sure! I guess... If you look at the canonical examples - HMPOR, Origin of the Species, Shadows of the Limelight, some characters in Unsong, - there's a, I don't know, /flavor/ to the internal reality of the "rational" characters that I'm not finding present in the MC of SC. Dunno how to describe it, but it's more-or-less present, and pretty similar every time it shows up.

There's also thinking-about-thinking and/or scope-of-goals. These characters are all looking at the entire /world/ they are in, and usually have extremely long-term and/or far-reaching goals. That's the itch.

In SC, he's stuck with very short-term, very small-scope goals. He does a very good job of being both intelligent and creative within that scope, and, honestly, he's kind of /too/ well-adjusted. "scratch the itch" rationalist characters are kind of crazy people.

To name some other parts of it, many high-appeal rationalist characters have "rationality" (or some aspect of it) as a terminal value of their own identity, in SC, the MC's terminal values are his sister and climbing out of the almost-poverty-hole they're in. He applies intelligence in service to that, sure, but that intelligence itself is not one of his terminal values.

To be clear, I don't think this is a /bad/ thing, it's just a different thing. I play 4X games for the feeling of exponential momentum, I play story games for the feelings a good narrative engenders, and I play clever indie games for the novel puzzles they present.

Totes point us (me?) at this serial; I think the only time I've seen this sub respond poorly/meanly to posted fiction was that trollish parody of a rational DBZ that got posted a long time ago.

And yeah! I do like how SC deconstructs aspects of the cultivation genre; I'd actually really like to see a lot more of that, and I'm happy we're learning more about the larger world in this book.

I totally agree that the most popular characters in the genre are "crazy people". The thing is, one of the core reasons I got into this group is to search for protagonists who are not "crazy people". Crazy people are the opposite of rational, and far to common in fiction. One of the core requirements I have of rational fiction is that the protagonist NOT be a crazy person...I'm willing to compromise on other points. Reading someone who acts like a crazy person think about rationality is just weird and annoying to me.

  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

And I do agree with the earlier post that lots of "Rationalist" protagonists are kind of crazy if judged by their actions. Aspiring Rationalism is often paired with surreptitious use of the Idiot Ball...and I tend to dislike the second more then I like the first.

  There is a serial I've been following that features a rational protagonist and which seems to be developing a semi-hard magic system. The protagonist also has a reverence for mysticism, whic makes sense in-universe because the world seems to be set up to reward a certain level of mysticism. Is that rational fiction, and would it irritate people in this community?

*** I like Will Wight's Cradle novels. They're written in English (so no amateur translation - which is my number one problem with other cultivation stories), have good popcorn action plots, there's quite a few of them and the story advances at a fair pace. I enjoyed them a lot. If you're looking for a competently written progression focused series, Cradle is a good place to start.

The quest Forge of Destiny / Threads Of Destiny by yrsillar is also worth mentioning. It stars a young street urchin who joins a cultivation school - the Argent Peak Sect. Power growth is keep in check. While we see the upper reaches, the MC is still steadily working her way through the first and second years of her school. No young masters causally knocked down. Features an engaging plot, likeable characters and a /lot/ of content written so far. Also notable for the MC taking at least partly a support focus. She uses a magical flute that plays haunting magical music.

The series is a slow build but the protagonist is very careful not to get involved in conflicts without a reason and to only start fights with overdetermined outcomes given how unpredictable xiaxia combat is unless the benefit is worth the risk.

*** The divine dungeon series is sort of demi-rational, the main character is non human though if that's a turn off. It's all in original English, and there's a sequel series that is neither cultivation-based or rational, but if you find yourself wanting for more it's there. Writing is very solid, 9/10 rec.

*** Cultivation Chat Group is probably the best one out of them. Like most of them, the start is a little slow, but stick with it. It's a slice-of-life sitcom about a Chinese college student who accidentally gets invited into the eponymous chat group and after a brief period of thinking that they're all crazy LARPers posting in-character, realizes this shit is real and becomes a cultivator himself. It's often hilarious, extremely well translated (especially after the first few chapters) by Chinese webnovel standards and is notable among its peers for having a protagonist who, for once, is just a Tom Hanks-level nice dude who tries to help people.

**** How far did you get in OP before you felt it got too hectic? Luffy starts his adventure in East Blue, meets friends and enemies while traveling the world. I wouldn't say it's very rational as too many people have crazy powers and aren't using them optimally, but it's definitely a fun story with some truly fantastic world building and character development.

I think my favorite part of One Piece is exploring this crazy world of superpowers and seeing our protagonist+crew travel from island to island and righting the wrongs they see. It's got some genuinely funny moments and surprisingly dark scenarios (children being abducted for research, a villain whose power makes the victim forgotten by everyone, etc.) for a shounen series.

It's been a long time since I read/watched HxH, I think I stopped around when the chimeras were introduced, but I feel that if you liked HxH you should definitely give OP a try.

Let me know if you have specific questions, I'm pretty bad at just selling something haha. I have spent way too much time reading OP so I'm pretty confident I can answer any question you may have, though.

****** Oh yes past plot threads definitely recur, but there's definitely a "formula" of (crew travels to new island, encounters conflict, gains new skills/allies/strength). There is this overarc-ing goal of becoming the Pirate King, and you can definitely see progress being made and roughly where the end of the story would be (which should end in like, 10 years...).

Also, to add on to what someone else wrote, definitely read the manga instead of watching the anime. The anime has a lot of pacing issues.

** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954189-scythe][The Scythe]] was an excellent read. Well thought out post-singularity YA novel. It's technically utopian from the general perspective of society, but despite the constraints of living under a strong, friendly AI, still managed to /feel/ dystopian; not because the AI fucks up, but because humans do, and the AI is programmed not to stop them.

It simultaneously benefits and suffers from the YA imperative to keep novels short and condensed. On one hand, the plot feels a little rushed and a lot of woldbuilding is condensed, but on the other hand, I never read a scene that I think the book could have done without. If I wasn't used to webfiction's sprawling works, I'd probably think it was the perfect length.
