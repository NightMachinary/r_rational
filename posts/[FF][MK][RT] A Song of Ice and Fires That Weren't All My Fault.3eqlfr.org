** This looks interesting but I'm having real trouble working through the writing :( The word choice is often awkward and almost every paragraph has a run-on sentence :P

*** I'm the same way, I've been pushing through it, because the concepts that it's exploring are interesting, but the writing feels like it's either a non-native speaker, or just someone with a weaker grasp of the language. It's... tolerable, but far from ideal.

** This was linked in a comment in the Rational!ASOIAF thread a few days ago by [[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld][u/FuguofAnotherWorld]], but I thought it deserved greater exposure. It's ASOIAF/Dresdenverse crossover (Harry Dresden + his daughter in the ASOIAF universe), but I've never read a Dresden book and was perfectly fine (though I googled a few things as needed).

Besides the setting/munchkinism/tone, one of the things that I really like about this fic is its ability to cover long stretches of time all at once (not via montages, more like changes in scope). These types of serials can easily fall into the trap of covering everything with the same time resolution and thus either having really boring episodes or implausibly making important events happen in quick succession, but the author here is good at avoiding both of these.

*** I (obviously) support this recommendation. It's a fun read with daily updates, a consistent world where actions have consequences, a magic system that has specific limitations and a decent hack at bringing the braavosi into the industrial revolution. Each of the actors also seems to be capable of at least level 1 thought and planning, which is nice.

What I particularly like is that building a particular technology leads to far ranging effects as people explore its uses, completely changing many historical events from the series. This makes the world feel fleshed out and real. Also, the writing has a fun witty tone which I enjoy.

*** This is golden. Not sure if it's really rational fiction, but any Dresdenphile should look into this.

**** My major concern with it is that it doesn't feel as though there is any conflict. There might be some more later, but one of the defining characteristics of the Dresden series has always seemed to be continually cascading challenges. Here, it seems to be more a series of continuing lack of challenges, and when he encounters any, a simple application of the easiest magic he knows makes it go away completely.

***** It seems likely that as the magic of the world waxes in time with the dragons, the challenges he faces will also increase in difficulty.

The Others, for example, and the Warlocks.

***** In fairness, the only Dresden fanfic that I've come across that manages to capture Butcher's "ever-escalating shitstorm" style of narrative construction was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8005922/1/God-s-Eye][God's Eye]]. It requires a deft hand to keep the ramp-up going without either losing tension or becoming self-parody.

****** Glad to hear you're enjoying it. See if you can predict how those inventions will effect the world, it's fairly brilliant in retrospect but requires thinking like a 13th century sailor. I think the way to describe it is that the world is rational, and the characters are mostly rational.
