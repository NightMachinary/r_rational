** Wow, this interview was great and like Klein says, you can hear through his answers why Chiang's writing is so compelling. The themes that they discuss (and that are popular here) are moving more and more into the public mainstream, but often when people talk about them I'll feel "Yeah, alright, I've heard this. Tell me something I don't know." I rarely felt that way while listening to the podcast. During most of it, I was either impressed at Chiang's ability to clearly articulate things I've had vague feelings about (e.g. how superhero stories all work based on the principle of maintaining the status quo) or blown away by a point I hadn't ever considered (like how we should not be working towards creating sentient software because of the incredible amount of suffering we'd impose on the initial creations on the way to morally autonomous machines).

Highly recommended read or listen. Heads up that the audio version includes Facebook propaganda (ads) on how they're so invested in bringing comprehensive regulation to the internet.

** I don't see why it's more difficult to describe a superhero society with interesting conflicts after a progressive revolution than it is to describe a superhero society with a beneficial status quo in which conflicts regularly reemerge.

*** I assume that there's two core issues. The first is that it's easy to place an unknown in your reality and observe/interact with that, because you have familiarity with your reality, so you are better able to envision what "your town but some kid can shoot lasers from her eyes" might look like. It's much harder to envision what an entire world that is fundamentally different from our own, even in mundane ways, would look like, which is what a "actually fix problems rather than maintaining the current shitty status quo" would likely end up looking like.

The second is finding an audience - most people seem more interested in consuming media that they can see themselves in, and the more speculative and weirder it gets, the more easily they're likely to find problems with and/or simply not be interest in it.

(On your note about a "beneficial status quo", I think the comment made about constant threats to personal safety in order to justify perpetual violence in those stories is indicative of the status quo clearly not being beneficial for everyone, even if it's given a backdrop claiming as much.)

**** To my mind, coming up with good, believable specific ideas about how to improve society seems like it lives at about the same level of difficulty as coming up with good, believable specific ideas about how to rationalize the status quo.

The point you're making with the parenthetical is partly what I was hoping to get at. We suspend our disbelief to entertain the idea that a good status quo would have problems. So why would we find it harder to suspend our disbelief to entertain the idea that a good future would also have problems?

I agree that it's easier to describe existing things than it is to imagine and then describe nonexisting things. However, if we first condition on someone imagining a system in detail, I don't think that remains true.

If someone can't imagine interesting conflicts occurring in a dramatically politically improved society, to me that suggests they aren't really thinking about that society at all, only fantasizing about it. I would not expect such authors to become more successful if they switched to writing books about more conservative political societies, because the real problem in such scenarios is a lack of respect for attention to detail, and that problem would persist in other ways even after a change in setting.

***** Iain M Banks' /Culture/ series has many great examples of conflict and drama occurring in a far, far more utopian society than anything a superhero genre author would ever present.

This is why I found /Worm/ much more engaging than /Ward/ (though I still liked /Ward/); at the end of /Worm/, Wildbow broke the world. The sequel is set in ... somewhere? It's not exactly clear where, maybe some sort of hastily planned city in some parallel Earth, the point being that it's not anywhere we naturally would know or care about.

Whereas Brockton Bay has meaning. It's not a real-world place but it's an obvious trope-soup of real-world places.

***** Agreed, that's also (one of the reasons) why I like the Flicker/Doc Future series so much.

*** Heh, give it a try!

Constant re-emergence of the same conflict is a trope of supers stories, eg supervillains escaping custody, or some other villain with the same powers threatening the hero. Not having that trope, having genuine resolution of problems in continuity, would be a different kind of story from the standard.

Genuinely progressive superheroes would inevitably feel the need to similarly empower others; the notion of raising /everyone's/ quality of life is a fundamental of progressive political philosophy. Progressive Steve Rogers would make and train more supersoldiers, progressive Green Lantern would expand the corps, and so on.

Individual exceptionalism wins out in the stories whenever they do, but in my view that's the authors' hand on the scales.

** Thank you for sharing.

Ezra's comment on interviewing some people as “painting with watercolors” reminded me of the Six Eyed Doe, whereas the comment about talking with Ted Chiang was like carving with Marble --- sounded like how Juniper talks at times.

Speaking with heavy, weighty and thoughtful words.

Rationalist Authors carve their words in marble, I guess is what I am trying to say --- and most people just say things with flighty fanciful flavor.

  That's someone who we would very likely label a terrorist. And that's not something that any big media company is going to really feel comfortable doing.

/V for Vendetta/ is a thing, and even if the comic series is old they were comfortable enough to turn it into a movie. Hulk against the army? The Punisher against the police?
