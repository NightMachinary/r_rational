** So, a few thoughts in this chapter.

I'm a little confused about the lack of immortality. The flesh domain cannot affect organs, but there are other body domains so it would be a bit arbitrary to not have those. We count the skin as an organ, but I can see why a pseudo-renaissance culture may not.

That said, such an arbitrary distinction could suggest that the underlying mechanism here is belief rather than simple volume of fame (a la discworld), which would also put Vidre trying to spread the sorry she can detect lies into a new context.

But back to the topic of immortality, it seems that an amazing way for an immortal to get and maintain fame without any effort or input would be to hide their their method of immortality, and pretend to die. From that point onwards they would be referenced in almost every discussion of death, immortality, hubris and wasted effort. Bonus points for a "deathbed conversion" to religion, which now makes you one of the go to arguments of the religious. Double bonus points if you leave an eternal reminder if who you are on the side of a mountain.

What I am saying is that King Laith sounds like a story, and in this world that usually means it was intentionally created to serve some purpose.

The evidence against Laith being alive is the meta knowledge that Alexander is a better author than the "mysterious enemy is a callback to the first chapters" trope.

*** The domains are conceptual or symbolic in some way. You have ones that are based on materials, like water, wood, iron, but you also have ones that are based on reactions, like fire or rust, and then other not-totally-physical things like sound, shadow, and light. All the domains are thematic in some way. While that might be for Doyalist reasons, it might also be that this is also the Watsonian reason. ([[/u/xamueljones]] gets credit for this basic theory [[http://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsOfTheLimelight/comments/34n4e4/shadows_of_the_limelight_ch_3_nighttime_ballet/cqxjwyo?context=3][here]].)

You get access to your domain by being famous, but it's not too much of a stretch to think that the domains themselves exist because the domains are famous. It kind of makes sense for there to be this "gap" in the domains around the internal organs if they're not thematic or symbolic enough.

Laith probably died from pancreatic cancer or something, since "pancreas" doesn't seem to be a domain.

**** The thing is, if you can repair the rest of the body and starve tumours to death with vessel constriction, pancreatic cancer isn't actually a big problem.

I am really wondering if the only reason they don't have near complete disease immunity at the moment is because of an unexplained difference in physiology compared to the real world, or because of a lack of knowledge of the flesh users.

If physiology is normal, almost any surgery should be pretty trivial. Flesh users can change muscle, fat, vessels and connective tissue (the last two implictly).

If you keep the vasculature tuned up (atherosclerosis free) and don't smoke (you can fix bronchitis, but not emphysema), and remove any tumours as they arise (detected by smooth muscle invasion at the capillary level) the only [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey#The_seven_types_of_aging_damage][real problems]] you have left are build up of inracellular and extracellular junk. Living for a long time should be possible for the majority of people. I can even think of several ways to set up an Alzheimers slower/partial fix.

I'm going with lack of knowledge in universe for now, see how it plays out. In the right hands, flesh domain is super broken.

***** Lack of knowledge is probably part of it, especially since Gaelwyn seems to be on the leading edge of knowledge and the things he's discovering are pretty basic. It's not really stated how long ago Laith was living, but I'd guess within the last hundred years? So these are probably people who are having legitimate arguments about what the functions of the internal organs are, nevermind being able to diagnose problems, nevermind actually being able to fix those problems with good consistency. (And yeah, flesh is OP.)

** An interesting point is raised by the fact that Fame can be directed towards fictional and historical figures. Is that really true? How could they have possibly tested it? Perhaps it's incorrectly attributed.

For instance, we know that a person gains power when more people know about him. If people in the past had more power than people now, and that's confirmed and not an exaggeration, then perhaps it's because, I don't know, the system works with the /percentage/ of people who know about you, rather than the /number./

Anyone else have theories or criticism?

*** It's not that people had more power back then, I think, but that people /now/ are wasting their thought-minutes on stories about dead people. The thing with the 10 000 audience focusing to exaggerate childrens' domains shows that it's not who knows about you, but who's thinking about you. If I'm thinking about Hercules, I'm not thinking about Brad Pitt.

On the other hand, the author indicated somewhere that absolute numbers matter, so I imagine that it's a case of "power increasing, but not as fast as it could be because of all these dead assholes who carved their faces into mountains."
