  Aziraphale, like many Soho merchants who specialized in hard-to-find books for the discerning connoisseur, had a back room, but what was in there was far more esoteric than anything normally found inside a shrink-wrapped bag for the Customer Who Knows What He Wants

  He was particularly proud of his books of prophecy.

  First editions, usually.

  And every one was signed.

  He'd got Robert Nixon, and Martha the Gypsy, and Ignatius Sybilla, and Old Ottwell Binns. Nostradamus had signed, “To myne olde friend Azerafel, with Beste wishes”; Mother Shipton had spilled drink on his copy; *and in a climate-controlled cabinet in one corner was the original scroll in the shaky handwriting of St. John the Divine of Patmos, whose “Revelation” had been the all-time best seller. Aziraphale had found him a nice chap, if a bit too fond of odd mushrooms.*

** Awwwwww! I was right about them being kabbalistically married! That is the sweetest thing ever, and I'm so relieved that Uriel is still around despite having been killed.

(I wonder why he made the ritual only work "properly" with opposite-gender partners. It clearly wasn't even intended as a romantic ritual, since A. that would be gross and B. he calls Sohu his friend. Maybe there's some other reason it wasn't as strong between Ana and Erica. Or maybe he could only get it to work by repurposing a marriage "framework" that still had the original RAM-conserving restrictions in place.)

That whole chapter was badass. It was so satisfying to see all the factions we've met over the course of the story rise up against Thamiel together. And the knock-knock joke was /perfect./

I groaned at "strong arm" though. God /damn/ it.

*** I think the reason the link between Erica and Ana was because they flubbed the ritual. Or maybe it was just one of those inexplicably bizarre bugs of Uriel's, like Boiling A Goat In Its Mother's Milk. Uriel had just a day to design and implement the ritual; he probably didn't have much time to debug it, and he probably only cared to make sure it's going to work between him and Sohu. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design][Wouldn't be Uriel's first flawed creation.]]

As for whether the ritual was meant for Platonic or romantic relationship: given this exchange from chapter 52

#+begin_quote
  “IN THE OLDEN DAYS, THE ANGEL SAMYAZAZ AND HIS FOLLOWERS FLED HEAVEN TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM ON EARTH, WHERE THEY LAY WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN. I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN WERE SO INTERESTING. UM. BUT. UM. YOU ARE VERY INTERESTING.”

  “Um,” said Sohu.
#+end_quote

...I'm not sure if Uriel understands or cares very much for the distinction. Though ironically, this may mean that contrary to what the exchange between Aaron and Ana in chapter 5 suggests, 'marriage' really /is/ 'just a word' even in the Unsong universe, of all places.
