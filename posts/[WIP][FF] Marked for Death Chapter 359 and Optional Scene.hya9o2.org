The optional prequel scene is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OfWHvVuM8jYWghml8scZcLDaSKjshQhdmuw493pjRUU/edit][in Google Docs]].

The main body of the chapter is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-6953#post-16504933][on SufficientVelocity]].

You can skip the optional scene without losing anything necessary to the quest. It's optional and kept offsite because it contains romance-novel style sex (i.e. not graphic) with morally grey implications about power imbalance, and the SV mods can be testy about random things. Lord knows, we can't have characters that are less than morally perfect or someone might get offended.

There is a pointer at the top of the chapter that mentions the optional scene but does not link to it. That exists in hopes that people will get curious and join [[https://discord.com/channels/196309529850281984/238847581445292032][the Discord]], where they can get the actual link from the pinned messages.

**** The Gōketsu (the MC's clan) made a deal with the Uchiha clan: The Gōketsu would adopt a bunch of civilians that the Uchiha could not afford to support and would receive assorted political favors. In exchange, some of the women who were changing clans would be required to have a certain number of babies with ninja (meaning the babies were likely to be ninja-capable). The babies would be adopted back to the Uchiha, who desperately needed more ninja.

- Everyone involved was over 18 and giving enthusiastic consent to the whole thing because it would make their lives objectively better.
- The parents and babies were not being separated. Everyone involved would be free to visit back and forth between the two clan compounds at will and the women could probably have been adopted back later once the Uchiha were on firmer financial footing.
- Any woman who changed her mind about the deal or showed any signs of health issues as a result of birthing could beg off and a different woman would be found who was happy to take her place.
- Having a ninja parent, the babies were almost certainly going to be ninja themselves. This would have made them incredibly respected and set them up for the best childhood possible in a 12th-century feudal death world.

The mods went bananas -- not at the idea of eugenics, oddly, which might have been a reasonable accusation even though I'd gone to some pains to make it clear that wasn't what was happening. No, they were angry at the idea that I (and, by association, the other two QMs) was dehumanizing the women by writing them into a consensual relationship that required them to voluntarily have a certain number of babies who would then be raised as (effectively) princes and princesses in a building two miles away from where the mothers lived to which the mothers would have free access at all times.

They locked our thread with no warning or explanation, dragged the three QMs into a Discord channel for a 4-hour inquisition that turned very repetitive and featured phrases like "I need to hear you explain what you did wrong" despite having already been told "Okay, got it, the issue was that we were dehumanizing the women by making their childbearing transactional. Also, I had a character use the word 'brood mare' and this is bad despite the fact that this character is shown to be a little bit crazy and morally dark grey at best. Won't happen again."

While said inquisition was going on, two of the mods came into the quest's Discord channel. One of them had good intent, the other was there purely to stir things up and insult the authors and the players, which they did very successfully.

So, yeah. I'm not anxious to go through that again.

EDIT: In the end, the mods decided we had some nothing wrong and the QMs were not infracted. Then they went through the remaining (1900, I think?) messages in the thread to see if any of the players had said anything naughty. They found five or six comments they didn't like, several of which required IMO a /very/ uncharitable reading. Those people for infraction points and threadbanned for 1-2 weeks.

Were I being uncharitable, I might suspect that the mods were embarrassed to have made such a big deal and then found nothing wrong, so they went looking for something with which to save face. I would also point out that [EDIT: This segment invalidated by [[/u/faflec]] finding the exact quote: +the same mod who has come into our channel to stir up muck one of the mods involved in the inquisition, when asked why the player comments were being reviewed, said something to the effect of (quoting from memory): "when you turn on the lights you usually find cockroaches"+] one of the mods involved in the inquisition came into our thread afterwards to discuss it and had the following conversation with one of my co-QMs. Names redacted for courtesy:

[QUOTE]

/QM: The whole "eugenics" issue began with a particular update. Let's call that time point X. At some point later, someone reported an alleged rules violation. Let's call that Y. Without knowing the future, the reporter could only have been reporting a violation taking place between X and Y. There is no need to catch up on the thread, or lock anything, in order to investigate something that happened between those two points in the past. Either a violation took place between X and Y or it didn't. If it did, fine, standard SV sanctions apply. If it didn't, case closed. Investigating past point Y is looking for fresh violations knowingly based on a false report./

/Mod: [QM]: Suppose you see a cockroach in your house. Do you assume it's the only one?"./

[/QUOTE]

In other words, he dehumanized our players by comparing them to cockroaches.

+EDIT 2: As to the cockroaches comment, I remember it very clearly but I've looked around for it and can't find the source, so perhaps I'm mistaken and it's a false memory.+

EDIT 3: Aha! The almighty [[/u/faflec]] has found it. He is all the wonderful. Prior comments updated with correct details.

***** That sounds... /way/ less sexually coercive than stuff you see casually dropped into [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/The_Kunoichi_of_Nadeshiko_Village][random filler episodes of the anime.]] It's honestly kind of funny how canon Naruto manages to get away with having such an incredibly dark setting by giving it an optimistic tone and making sure there are enough fart jokes.

***** Wait, the content of quests is moderated? I thought the mods on that website only made sure discussions didn't get out of hand. Should just have trigger warning tags and let the authors write whatever they want.

****** Everything posted anywhere on the site must conform to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/][the site's rules]]. That includes things like "don't be hateful", which is probably what we were being infracted under.

I'm actually fine with (eg) neo-Nazi comments getting punished, and with individuals being punished for insulting each other. I simply think that I'm no way was this an infractable event.

On a separate but related note: I briefly played in a quest where the MC was portaled into the world of Worm. It was made clear in the first update that the MC had been in their 20s before being portaled. It was therefore creepy af when he started dating Vista who at the time was 12. (11? 13? Something like that.) Multiple people complained to him, he dug in his heels and refused to change it, even though it would have meant deleting or modifying one line in the original post. He even threatened to threadban anyone who raised the issue again. People, including me, reported him for it. The mods looked at it and went "Nah, you're good."

In fairness, nothing sexual happened between the two, which means it probably was within the bounds of the site's rules, at least technically. Still, if we were going to get pasted for the Uchiha deal I would have preferred to see a little more consistency and objection to what can only be considered a lead-in to sex with a child.

****** There isn't really a great option. I refuse to go to SpaceBattles because every interaction I've had there has been negative to some degree, and the mods are much quicker and more random on the trigger than on SV. Some of our main contributors didn't want to go to QQ, and QQ has its own issues like "If we think this relates in any way to modern politics then you get the hammer." As a general rule, SV is a good candidate.

******** Excellent point. I really like the nuanced rating system.

Also, SV offers the (paid) option to let your collaborators have edit access to your posts, on an opt-in per-post basis. This is really helpful when co-writing.

***** The mods in question deserved to he reported and the Council informed (though it had less power then than now), but I understand how such stuff was not at all what you signed up for when you decided to run a quest.

I myself actually got hit with an infraction and threadban. I managed to get all infractions repealed in full, but that took long enough for the threadban (of a few days) to have run its course anyway.

****** The muck-stirring happened right in front of one of the other mods so reporting it seemed unlikely to matter.

As to the cockroaches comment, I remember it very clearly but I've looked around for it and can't find the source, so perhaps I'm mistaken and it's a false memory. Bleh. Stupid fallible human memories.

Were you threadbanned as part of The Incident or something else?

******* Part of the incident. The reason my appeal took so long was mostly my fault though. I wanted my arguments to be ironclad, but I was also working at the time. And I used an Advocate who themselves is just a volunteer forum user with their own time constraints and in a completely different time zone to boot. So I actually asked for continuances on the appeals process. All that only to have the Arbitrator completely agree with me and remove all infractions roughly a week after my threadban ended anyway. But I mostly did it on principle and in the hopes to have the next mod think twice about whether they are being fair.
