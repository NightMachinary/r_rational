For those who are unfamiliar with PB, it's a six-month-old dark fantasy serial set in a grim Near Eastern themed world where human civilization has had to adapt to an endless, unstoppable cycle of magical disasters. A small-town boy leaves home to help his family make ends meet, only to get swept up in far weightier matters.


** Looks like the problem with male indwelt is an obsession with soup.

*** Strictly speaking, he might have preferred an equal-temperature cauldron of something with a higher specific heat than water. If you can come up with a plausible reason why they would have such a thing handy at that place, in that time, I might feel compelled to swap it in.

EDIT: Possibly not, now that I think it over. The interaction between physics and magic is a ticklish business. I may have to ask my science consultant.

SECOND EDIT: Science consultant (meaning "longsuffering friend of mine with a BS in Astronomy") confirms that a material with higher specific heat would have been more valuable. Now I just need to find out why they'd have a giant pot of (consults Wiki's list of specific heat capacities) ammonia, I guess.

**** Is it heat, or the symbolic and physical connection to the suns lifegiving energy?

That is, the fire burning wood, coming from trees, nurtured by the light of our sun, with the broth having plants grown under the suns light, both bringing a connection to the life giving properties that the pyre channels and the haranu (probably?) looks for?

Plus the only alternative to food I could see would be clothes washing or something, and i am not sure that wash water would be hotter than soup.

***** Pyrelight is pure heat and light output with few limitations, which is why the handmaiden can heat the soup by channeling it right into the center of the broth. It doesn't need a symbolic connection to life, though a giant pot of broth is probably more appealing to Ram on a visceral level than a stinking mass of boiling ammonia.

*** But only if it's hot. You'll notice he lost all interest when he realized the soup had gone cold :P

*** Glad you like it! I've only been writing it since January, and self-promotion makes me anxious, so I'm not surprised it's new to you. It's always good to have another reader.

**** I will definitely be sharing it along - love the writing style and the metaphorical world exploration! You do a good job of slowly teasing out lore/world knowledge. Glad you did so so I could discover it!
