**** That's because every chapter has kabbalistic implications, which is not a coincidence, and is therefore kabbalistic.

For example, to 'traverse' an array of some information is to visit each item in the array, such as chapters in a story. An "eda" is a norse epic story, and the person identifying kabbalistic implications of each chapter is Named [[/u/traverseda]]. This is not a coincidence either.

*** I had the exact same reaction.

I've tried to analyze my own reaction, and I think in my personal case it possibly boils down to tribalism and near-far perspective stuff - I see a lot Singer's effective altruism stuff as benefiting people unrelated to me, those foreign to me who are not part of my 'tribe', while the destruction of Hell I view as benefiting me and my 'tribe'. Plus the goal seems somehow more concrete & achievable. Plus of course the tendency to love a martyr. However, the first bit is probably what persuaded my emotional reaction the most. That's just me, though.

**** Destruction is not just easier than construction, it's easier than maintenance:

Hell is something which /can/ be defeated. It's a standing edifice, ready to be torn down. It would likely collapse on its own without constant influxes of time, effort, and energy.

Starvation (to pick one of our real Singer's sources of suffering) happens through a /lack/ of time, effort, or energy. It would require all of those, in perpetuity, to prevent starvation entirely.

Removing a wicked edifice is always easier than establishing a virtuous one. Not only is the construction expensive, the result is often less effective than advertised, or less efficient, or even ultimately counter-productive. Genuine virtuous edifice are so rare that most effective altruism doesn't take them seriously, and goes after lower hanging fruit instead: Saving individual lives, one bed-net at a time.

Genuine wicked edifice? Also more nuanced than Hell, and possessed of better funded Public Relations departments. They're still more popular as rhetorical targets (Big Tobacco, Big Oil, The Media, Communism) because destroying them sounds like a winnable fight. It has an easily conceivable end.

Fights against suffering are, by and large, eternal.

***** I don't actually endorse the tribalistic position from any sort of conscious/logical point of view, and never have. Nonetheless, the acknowledgement that this reaction is logically flawed and not supportable, fails to move me emotionally towards either liking the real Singer more or liking the Unsong singer less.

I have noticed that my emotions are often not tied particularly well to my logical / cognitive parts. I try to make my actual executive function and decisionmaking more by the logical/cognitive results than my intuitive feelings which are often wrong.

** So how powerful is Thamiel? One would think he would be on the level of an arch-angel like Uriel, but he needed to put a price on Singer's head in order to have him killed. Even if he couldn't smite PS, you'd think he could dispatch some agents to kill him in some more demonic way than a car bomb. Furthermore, Hell could apparently be laid siege to.

On the other hand, we don't know how powerful the Comet King is to be able to threaten Hell, and the fact that it seems to literally have billions of tortured souls suggests other biblical facts about it and its ruler may be accurate.

****** Absolutely. If the Christian deity were real, I would consider it a moral duty to try to figure out a way to obliterate him. Due to Hell, God would be a source of infinite disutility, an infinity which is /not/ countered by the nightmarish mind-control eternity of Heaven. A universe with infinite suffering can't be allowed to exist one second longer than necessary. I would even consider it moral to obliterate the universe, if that was the only way. Null utility is better than negative infinity.

******* I guess it may depend on your philosophy (that's a purely utilitarian argument) and expectation of afterlives then, making this a rather fruitless conversation- for example, I think most people would say that the vast majority of people go to heaven (or if they never had a true chance of being Christian due to, for example, living in a majority Shinto/Buddhist country, then they go to purgatory, which is portrayed as pretty null utility) and would disagree that heaven has any kind of mind control... Which would make the situation a net positive by utilitarian standards.

******** The problem is that descriptions of Heaven are not logically consistent when you consider some fairly common edge cases. For instance, theist parents of atheists (like my own) would find themselves in heaven, and not find their children. They would know, for a fact, that their own child, who they love, is being infinitely tortured. Heaven is supposed to be infinite bliss, but knowing that your loved one is suffering infinitely would make bliss impossible unless God was either forcing you to think about other things or just straight erasing your memories of the damned. The first is mind control, the second is killing you to replace you with a shallow mockery, remembering either made-up things or having inconsistent, patchy memories.

So yeah, I don't think heaven makes sense as a concept, and therefore something must be wrong about the idea.

********* Is making a place so wonderful that you have other things to focus on than your atheist son (who when you arrived was still alive) really mind control? I would think you could it's a more extreme, long-term example of taking someone to a theme park or going out on the town to help distract them from something depressing in their life.

I also think I could come up with scenarios where the same effect could be had without violating identity/free will and don't think there's anything inconsistent with an omnipotent/omniscient being having the capability to do more than I imagine.

To be clear, if your scenario was the true situation I would agree that's the correct course, I just see no reason to think it's any more likely than any utopia scenario.
