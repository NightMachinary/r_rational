******** Precisely. Fiction is the base case, fanfiction is the first layer of recursion, fanfanfic is the second, etc.

If you count fiction as the first layer, then meta^{3}fanfic is the fifth, which is worse.

The point is that "fan^{n}fiction of fan^{m}fiction is fan^{n+m}fiction" holds for all positive integers n and m. This is a simple and obvious rule, and clearly it is the way things should be.

****** The real question is, where do /HPMoR///Friendship is Magic/ crossovers go on the chart? Level 2 by one parent, level 1 by the other.

It's an /HP/ fanfanfic, so it's a fanfanfic. Yet it's not a /FiM/ fanfanfic. Interesting that something can be /FiM/ and fan^{2}fic, but not fan^{2}fic /of/ FiM. That seems like an important distinction for any classification scheme to make.

Hm. Talking about this - fanfics from the database engineering perspective - has made me picture a hierarchy of stories sorted by their mutual canon status. On top of fanfics and crossovers, some books appear /as books/ in the background of films, other times characters from other stories will get walk-on parts that imply a shared universe. The potential has been noted for transfictional loops where the book of a story should appear in that story's universe, and several such loops have been found. Perhaps I'll automate that one day when I'm looking for a project.

  Humor could be embodied as life; a hopeful message might be a species mastering fire. Dark humor would be a planet exploding and killing all of the (for the context) highly advanced beings thereon. If one wanted to add a soupÁon of hope to the darkness of the humor, perhaps the physical laws might be established in such a way that the resulting brain-state of one of those doomed creatures would induce him to send a single escape rocket to carry the last of his race into the void.
