*** This site is pretty popular and it's focused around fantasy/VR/isekai/Xianxia stories. It has quite a few great novels in the speculative fiction genre that our rational fiction community largely overlaps with. If MOL's popularity wasn't enough already, this posting will push it even higher. The previous first place on RR had 15 million views.

I guess the name comes from the VR game in The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, a korean novel.

***** Just to make sure, speculative fiction = fantasy + sci-fi. RRL is mostly fantasy, but there are occasionally sci-fi stories as well. I'm going to soon make a post about two recent ones that I've found. Other ones that I've found there:

- The Good Student
- The Dao of Magic (genre-savvy)
- Shoulders of Giants (not /high/ quality, but I'd put it as rationalist-adjacent)
- Threadbare (very fun)
- The Worldforge: Warlock Rising (amazing until it was dropped, and I still recommend it. What drew me in at first was the perfect show-not-tell to describe the main character's personality)
- Universe Online (VR, scifi, realistic engineering+space survival, now on amazon only)
- Flight of Icarus (YMMV)
- Eye of Adventure (My favorite VRMMO story of all time, for doing over-poweredness right. If you can ignore poor grammar. It's on an indeterminate hiatus, but it has > 1 million words already, so that's not a problem)

And those are just my favorites that I found on RR. Most of RR is niche fantasy stories, the good ones being most enjoyable for those who like the genre(s) already. There are more that I enjoyed, but aren't high quality, so I left them out. There are also a lot of hidden gems on RR, but they're difficult for the algorithm to sift through. Luckily, it's easier for readers to find them because you'll usually find reviews saying that it's a hidden gem. There are also stories that I've found elsewhere, but that you could also find on RR if you hadn't yet (eg. MOL now).

**** so let's discuss what should be on a cover image!, personally if every arc was divided into a book, the first one i'd have show a spider or marbles, the 2nd a glass globe with a palace inside of it and the third either the gate or the crown.

the marbles are probably what i'd go with for image if there was just one for the entire series, because they reflect the name nicely.

oh, wait, there already is fan art! here's a book cover, i'm sure any artist would love it if it were used, but we should check with them first:

down below are some geometric images that are licensed under creative commons, and free to modify and reuse, even commercially, without attribution.

[i started by searching for icosahedra, fractal icosahedra, sponges, etc, since the dimensional gates and stabilization frames were icosahedral skeletons with a sphere in the middle, and i thought it would be a decent symbol of the nerdiness, structure, and recursion of this fic without needing an artist to actually design something. what i linked isn't exactly that, since the sponge icosadron i found didn't actually look that good, but i think it's a gesture in the right direction, as well as looking like dimensional portals.]

Maybe akoja too. -second cover: zorian and Zach but not too close,alanic and zedomir with some skeletons and monsters. Red robe too -Third cover: zorian and a group composed of each and the others looking toward a gate with quatach-ichl in the background wearing the crown

The glass orb is from the third arc too

yea you're right about the orb, the 2nd arc could probably better be a piece of crystallized mana, or alchemy eqipment due to all the Kael stuff.

It has only just now occurred to me that I don't have any idea whatsoever of what any of the characters look like.

Strictly speaking, I never form a /image/ of characters in novels I read, but I usually have a vague collection of attributes that I associate with characters. After your post though I realized that everything I have for Mother of Learning is personality traits rather than physical attributes.

******** There IS descriptions for characters but only the first time we met them. For example, I remember alanic is a bald mage with an eye of another color or something like that. They all got their description pretty detailed but nobody103 never use these descriptions again later exept when plot relevant so when tend to forget them. In my first reading i forgot quatach-ichl had black bones shining for example

********* yes they get a description the first time you see them but even that one is not especially elaborate, it's usually pretty basic rather then detailed, for example all Raynie is described as is a hot "red-haired goddess" and later by Tinami it becomes clear she have at least significantly more in the chest area then Tinami herself. and that is all the description you get for her.

and Kiana's description is "she's as beutiful as Raynie but black haired" that's all, so no the most detailed i'd say.

Kael who get a fair it more screentime is a bit androgynous and have bone-white hair and intense blue eyes, i would not call any of the descriptions very detailed, they give a physical trait you can build your image around but very few details overall.

******** you get a few physical attributes for example Tavien is fit, Kael is Androgynous (or as described "not female despite some nasty rumors" and so on, you get one or two traits to build your character image around but not very much.

Raynie is just described as a Red-haired Beauty so that image varies a lot depending on what you think a "beauty" looks like.

i wonder if s/he could reprint it without the caption "Caught in the Web" because i think that is a fan-added title.

** Unpopular Opinion here:

I actually think its bad for the story and the author to be on royalroad. I like the site dont get me wrong , but the focus there is mostly on xianxia / LitRPG storys and not on real original works. Also, if MOL should ever be published as a real book, it can be very important for the author to have the best possible control over which parts are freely available on the web. On royalroad there are quite a few trolls that will make it more difficult to maintain this level of control. I think MOL has the potential to be really successful as a print release and as an ebook, and I'd hate to see this success hampered by the release on RoyalRoad.

**** [not op] If an author decides to publish exclusively on Amazon, I think they get a much better deal. For this, Amazon requires that only up to 10% of the novel is available from outside Amazon. I'm not sure if this applies to all writers and their deals, but I know it applied to the author of Threadbare (it's still on RR, so I don't know what happened). So if his story is on Royal Road, he has to take it down, either suddenly without warning and getting the ire of everyone and their mother, or with a warning after which everyone will just copy the book for themselves and more than a few of them would re-upload it elsewhere. I don't know about any other publishers, or any other details about publication.
