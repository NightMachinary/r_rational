#+begin_quote
  Seems stupid they've run no experiments trying to get Mewtwo to heal itself or other humans. Seems like too big of an upside not to try.
#+end_quote

I'm going to edit in some info that explains this a bit more: the gist is that Mewtwo has been studying his own biology through the researchers and testing his powers to see if he can fix what's wrong with him, but so far has had no success. He thinks that it's because all the machinery and environment is interfering, but Giovanni thinks letting him out to try is too big a risk, both for himself and for others.

***** Heh. The terminal illness idea is one I haven't considered, since Healing Pulse is the only pokemon move that lets them intentionally heal something other than themselves and it's not a move Mewtwo can learn. They have no reason to know that of course, but if he can't heal himself they're probably less likely to think he can heal someone else. Still, it's an interesting idea, especially since the security risk is self-contained: if he can't fix them, they'll be dead soon anyway!

**** Not necessarily. Mewtwo.351 seems to think that the scientists think that they have a better understanding of it's psychology than they really do. It's keeping them from knowing how much it hates them.

The whole "not using it to heal itself or others" thing could have a number of reasons behind it. Like Giovanni actually being evil.

** I was so confused with the first few paragraphs. And then the line 'who am I' came along and that was my first clue as to the direction this chapter was going.

All in all its a fascinating chapter. The progression mewtwos thoughts is actually pretty logical in leading up to how he turns against humans (assuming your going that way).

Curious as to why Alakazam was dumbed down so much? It's said to have an IQ of 5000 if I remember correctly, and I understand that would be hard to fit in with a realistic world, but a 3 year olds mind seems a bit too dumb for the smartest Pokemon.

Great chapter and loving this fic. Keep up the excellent work

*** Thank you, I'm glad you're enjoying it!

The internet abounds with comics making fun of how ridiculous pokedex entries are, like machamp punching a thousand times in two second, or slugma's skin being 18,000 degrees F (!!!). The best explanation for it that I've heard is that it's literally written by (particularly dumb) children who just kind of write in whatever they think makes sense, since pokedex are open wiki-like tools :) In my world pokemon are all roughly animal intelligence, because the games for the most part show no indication of them being sapient, so pokemon like alakazam, which are considered the smartest, are about as smart as our smartest non-human mammals, chimps.

**** I think it's Magcargo with the skin temperature of 18,000 degrees F, but I agree, it's pretty ridiculous. How can we live with something almost twice as hot the sun? Edit: I normally prefer the games to the anime, but it has come in contact with many other pokemon in the anime. I think the others would have noticed if something /that/ hot hit 'em.

** Hey all, welcome back! Big announcement to make: after lots of suggestions and feedback, I've finally made a Patreon. If you want to check it out and contribute some sandwich money to show your appreciation, feel free to check it out [[https://www.patreon.com/daystareld?ty=h][here.]] Becoming a patron gives access to info about all the other writing and projects that I plan to put up at my website soon. I've also begun putting up posts to answer questions other patrons ask, and have blog and info posts there, like a team roster for Red, Blue and Leaf, which will be updated monthly!

Thanks in advance for any patronage, but more importantly, for your fandom. It's been over two years since I started writing this story, and I'm as glad as anyone to still be at it. Consider the patreon my commitment to continue for many more to come. I write the stories I write for me, but the hours of editing and research and fact checking to make sure I write the best quality I can, that's for all of you awesome guys and gals.

As always, any feedback is welcome, whether on the story or the patreon. Enjoy!

*** So, what are the legal variables to keep into account when collecting Patreon or other forms of money (commercial activity?) for fanfiction?

**** Simply put: don't offer fanfiction for money. Don't offer anything fanfiction related for money, if you want to be super safe.

I got a lot of great suggestions for Patreon rewards that I wish I could do, like letting a patron suggest a pokemon and I write a short scientific paper on them. But it brushes way too close for comfort, so my patreon is very explicitly about supporting /all/ of my artistic efforts, and rewarding with all of them. If people come there for the pokemon, great, but it's not the focus of the patreon.

That's also why the donation schedule is monthly. I happen to publish a pokemon chapter monthly anyway, so that works out nicely, but if that ever changes I'll still be doing the monthly donations, because having the payments coupled to putting out fanfiction is risky.

*** For food I recommend [[/r/soylent]] and competing products. Very good price, very good taste, complete nutritionally and takes 30 seconds to make and 2 minutes to drink.

Regarding the rewards, I warmly recommend switching the $1 and the $3 rewards, since many people (like me) won't start a long story if there is no epub/pdf available, and you want as many people to read your product as possible.

*** It was actually very challenging to write, aesthetically. The content was fairly straightforward: it's a chapter that's been rattling around in my head for over a year (as impatient as any reader is to see more of the story, believe me when I say that I'm at least as impatient to write it!), so I already knew most of the points I wanted to hit on, though a few new ones popped up while writing, as they always do. But the choices of how to convey his psychic abilities and developing mind were harder than I originally thought.

I also was caught up a bit on the technical side of writing: using a first-person perspective without using "I" or "me" for half the chapter was pretty challenging, and I spent quite a lot of time editing to make it all work reasonably well. Glad to hear I succeeded at least somewhat :)

** I only have a question? From a rational point of view, I don't quite understand why Red hasn't devoted more time to exploring/developing his psychic powers. The emotional drawbacks seem severe, but psychic powers seem like an incredible tool for understanding Pokemon (which is Red's main goal), especially after the release of this new chapter (for example, maybe being in the mind of a Spinirak when it uses its dark attack could help Red determine how that attack works?) . So why isn't Red/ is Red going to push his psychic powers? He could be the first psychic professor! Maybe what the world needs to withstand Mewtwo is for a psychic professor to study it.
