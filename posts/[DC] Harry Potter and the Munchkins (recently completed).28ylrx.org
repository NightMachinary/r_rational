** It's not as much completed as discontinued. Interesting read though, I liked the idea behind it.

*** I /may/ have posted this part way through my reread when I saw that it was marked complete, but hadn't finished yet.

Still an amusing read in the way it plays with some conventions, and the meta commentary in the notes.

** Interesting read, but it started to be kinda boring and repetitive somewhere after ch6-7

** The ideas were fun for a while but each chapter started to feel less and less connected to the last, culminating in just a mishmash of loosely connected thoughts.

** Discontinued, bleh.

I found Harry telling Draco that he was Tom Riddle absolutely [[http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Picture_14_6545.png][/hilarious/]].

** The concept reminds me very much of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8052743/1/Harry-Potter-Game-of-the-Year-Edition][Harry Potter: Game of the Year Edition]] By CaseyW.

**** You're welcome! I just never really thought of it as a 'Rational' fic - Harry's certainly not munchkining, or power-gaming.

** This does make me wonder about the possibility of transferring data between saves, a la Time Braid.

If all you get to bring with you are memories, and you don't have access to mind/body magic, any body upgrades are out. What about digital files? One could conceivably jump back and forth between saves, memorizing as many bytes as possible, then copying them in the other save, repeat ad fini. But that seems tedious and error-prone and would sleep deprivation add up across saves?

Is there anything short of trying to improve one's memorization and mental compression algorithms that would make transferring large files practical? (Heck, when you're copying by hand, anything bigger than a few kilobytes starts to sound like something you should get paid for. Hm, if there are multiple protagonists that can jump between each other's saves like this, I can see data transfer forming the new stable economy, what with normal economies being shot all to hell.)
