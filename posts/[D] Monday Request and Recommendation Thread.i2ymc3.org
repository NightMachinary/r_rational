Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

***** Author here.

In short, from chapters one through fifty,the MC accompanies the heiress of a dying kingdom across the world to her home, Malten. Along the way, he learns basic magic that can be modified with scientific knowledge, of stone behemoths called heathens that invade from the coasts, and meets a faerie that can read emotions. He doesn't become OP in the strictest sense, so he has to rely on building infrastructure and connections to survive.

The uplift isn't particularly well done - even in universe - as it pretty much all depends on the MC's ability to generate an infinite number of golems, but he does at least use his over-powered abilities well.

It's very HFY-heavy, basically in order to enjoy it you have to stop treating the humans as main characters, and look more at how /humanity/ is developing in the aftermath of the contact with the galaxy.

An original fic that's very heavy on the subject is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design][Grand Design]]. Basically, humanity was wiped out some thousand years ago, and civilizations have developed in their abandoned space stations. The protagonists are two human-ish gynoids who are still searching for the cause of Humanity's extinction and a means for revenge. The mind upload stuff only really starts to appear about a third in, and becomes increasingly important. This is an /actually/ good story, not just compared to most of RR.

Also, I should probably add that although the MC starts out /trying/ to do the right thing using necromantic tools, things don't always (or even often) go as planned. Events escalate, bodies pile up, evil masterminds plot, supposed "heroes" are not exactly paragons of virtue, etc.

In other words, it's pretty close to the canon /Worm/ universe, although the body horror aspect is not as pronounced and the pacing is not as suffocating. Bonesaw would find it somewhat underwhelming.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][r!Animorphs]] has multiple main characters, with a 5:2 ratio of male to female, although it starts 3:2 in the first few chapters, and each chapter is from a different person's perspective. The characters all have feelings, and undergo constant emotional struggle throughout the plot (moderate spoilers: they struggle emotionally with the harshness of war, make human mistakes in heats of passion, mourn losses, etc.. also, be warned, just because the characters have emotions doesn't mean they don't make harsh decisions). This one is not yet complete, but it does have 64 chapters, and it took me a few days to catch up.

Edit: if you want something a bit more fun, then I suggest [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world][I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!]]. It doesn't have a female lead, but there's no hard decisions, and it's pure escapism.

It was done well, in part because it was never stated explicitly. But the game also tried to do a lot of other things, with less success.

It's really enjoyable in that Joffrey takes the time to enjoy his loops, going to the different parts of the world in different roles. This results in short 2-3 chapter arcs that flesh out the world of GoT really well. The author also does a good job of showing Joffrey's descent into madness, ascent from madness, reconstruction, and development throughout the loops. And I'm surprised to say, but Joffrey becomes really likable! Highly recommend.

Also, it spends a lot of time in parts of the world that are mostly unexplored even in supplementary material, so knowing the series doesn't help much there to begin with.

Looking at a map of the known world probably wouldn't hurt though. Especially once the story gets past the initial sequence and he begins exploring more.

An original fic that's very heavy on the subject is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design][Grand Design]]. Basically, humanity was wiped out some thousand years ago, and civilizations have developed in their abandoned space stations. The protagonists are two human-ish gynoids who are still searching for the cause of Humanity's extinction and a means for revenge.

Likewise, if you're fine with budging on the rational bit, I can reccomend some isekai stuff I enjoyed. But the best I can do with the overlapping venn diagrams is get "sorta close."

Youjo Senki has some themes you'd often see in rational works, and I enjoyed it, but its structure is more of a misunderstanding comedy. It seems to be fairly popular among people here as well, from what I've seen, so insofar a rational fiction is a tallying symbol of "things people on R/Rational like," it's there. It's not rational, though, and everything else I can reccomend is even further from the search criterion.

*** The first arc of [[https://mangadex.org/title/19531/yakusoku-no-neverland][The Promised Neverland]] is possibly the most rational story in manga ever. From there on it switches genre but it stays good, or at least it kept good as far as I've read.

Not a lot of people seem to recommend it, but I think [[https://mangadex.org/title/9570/ajin][Ajin]] is the most rational manga I ever read as a whole.

Besides that you can probably take your chances with betting manga, such as [[https://mangadex.org/title/3148/tohai-densetsu-akagi/chapters/4/][Akagi]], [[https://mangadex.org/title/1874/tobaku-mokushiroku-kaiji][Kaiji]] (both from the same author) and [[https://mangadex.org/title/104/liar-game][Liar Game]] all of which I've heard a lot of praise but haven't actually read yet, so, take your chances.

If you actually want to forgo the high stakes, fantsy and sci-fi and actually want some slice-of-life romantic comedy, then I can recommend [[https://mangadex.org/title/1171/koi-dano-ai-dano][Koi Dano Ai Dano]] and it's prequel [[https://mangadex.org/title/1708/warau-kanoko-sama][Warau Kanoko-sama]] (read the prequel first; it's not as good as KDAD but you need it to understand it); [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru/][Oregairu]] is also a good recomendation for slice-of-life romcom. Obviously, been romcoms, the rationality of these last few titles is not exactly in the same level of the first few, but they are enjoyable nonetheless.

Most of the recomendations have animes which you may or may not prefer, but, with the excetion of Oregairu, which I've only seen the anime, I haven't seen the anime version of any of the others, so I can't speak for how rational the anime is. Most anime will be just a straight up adaptation from the manga, but I know for a fact the Ajin anime is different from the manga, so you might want to be on the lookout for that.

**** Absolutely not recommending /The Promised Neverland/. It went so incredibly bad in the latter half, it can only be rec'd as a prime example of fucking up what started as a good writing. First arc is great, but I recommend dropping the story after finishing that arc. There is still good stuff after that, but only to get your hopes up so they can be violently crushed by the later chapters.

/Liar Game/ is awesome, but its finale is a bit underwhelming. Still, I enjoyed it a lot. The main character is a trusting, innocent cinnamon pie abused by smart participants of the Game; she gets a very intelligent friend who quickly starts using her naïveté to trick people in very imaginative ways. It's a great example of an otherwise annoying trope done right.

[Edit] Content warning: one of the /Liar Game/'s deuteragonists is trans, and it's not handled as well as a person spoiled by modern Western media might expect. Yet, it's one of the better representation pieces in manga.

The author of /Liar Game/ has also done [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/11327/One_Outs][/One Outs/]] which is a rule-breaking wank. Not rational but somewhat adjacent in a sense that one of the main characters superbly munchkins the rules of baseball.

/Kaiji/, I think, is as rational as manga gets, though there were some parts which I disliked.

As for rational slice-of-life rom-coms, you can't go wrong with /[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen][Kaguya-Sama]]/.

It's a short completed series, that picks up steam after playing with it's concept at the start to barrel headlong into the consequences of the ability the protagonist acquires.

For those who don't want to go blind,

Essentially a time looping optimization story, with the ability to traverse 'alternate' quantum realities only tangentially related to the starting universe. So one universe is normal, one universe the protagonist is a Magical girl, another her own Mother, another the head of the evil organization after her ability, etc. All of this wrapped around a fairly generic love story that serves as the end goal of the loops more than the plot focus.

20th Century Boys and Monster by Naoki Urasawa are really good mystery mangas. Monster is about this surgeon who saves a kid, but later on the kid turns out to be a serial killer. 20th Century Boys is about this group of adults that start to realize that the story they wrote in their childhood is happening for real, and they try to stop it.

The world has weird but consistent rules that are slowly getting broken by higher powers in weird but consistent ways; the story is fueled by readers' suggestions which leads to sometimes absurd, sometimes very rational choices (with very few in-betweens); readers are a part of the setting which leads to some fascinating interactions; tons of foreshadowing; characters have well-defined goals that they pursue.

Not rational, but a very fun read regardless, IMO.

*** I binged it all in one day and absolutely second this recommendation. I'll add that while there are many cardboard cutout characters as a necessity of the choose-your-own-adventure MSPA-style format, there are rational actors with complex and even sympathetic motivations, both antagonistic and allied to the main character. It also does a good job of justifying certain absurdist aspects that seem counter-rational at the beginning, namely that the reason the Hospital is so awful and dysfunctional but still functions and receives patronage is that a conceptual, antimemetic corruption has taken root in the facility as well as the greater uni/multiverse to a lesser extent.

** I'm looking for physics data on the hardness of materials, average strength of human thrown javelins, how to calculate penetrative power and damage levels etc. Can anyone point me out in a helpful direction ? Maybe a forum or subreddit where people know these things and can answer questions.

​

Been making due with speed of thrown baseballs, force equations, and armor protective levels given projectile speed and mass but it's been quite convoluted, and I can't be sure it's accurate..

​

I'm trying to build a magic system that's very grounded and low powered but with high utility for a story and I'd like to check some number so I can put the proper limitations in place without having my characters becoming more powerful than I want them to be, while also having tools be physically useful to mages.

*** Course textbooks for forensic ballistics, maybe? They'd be mostly talking about gunshot wounds, but if they provide formulas for armor penetration that could be a starting point.

I've had a class in ceramics, and the prof talked about a ballistic vest project they had, I can dig it up if you're interested. But we didn't cover javelin impacts, I'd have remembered that.

**** What I was doing was looking up tables on the ratings of armor based on what weapons and at what distance they can protect from what weapon, with projectile speed, mass and density.

To get the forces applied to a javelin and how likely it'd be to penetrate said armor I just imputed the data from javelins, mass, speed, material density and doubled the minimum required force to penetrate because the javelin has a higher surface area than a bullet.

With the forces I was using things got confusing and I'd need to determine the damage it'd be likely to inflict if it didn't penetrate, effective range etc.

If the penetration didn't happen frequently enough people would likely use something simpler and cheaper like rocks or metal balls. But I like the aesthetic of the javelin more for the setting.

I want it to be unit on unit, and military applications in general. Nations of mages vs nations of mages warfare where magic isn't overpowered and common.

*** [[https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/]], section "Armor and Weapons", and especially the linked posts [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/21/collections-punching-through-some-armor-myths/][/punching through some armor myths/]] and [[https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/][/archery, distance, and 'kiting'/]].

Generally a fantastic blog for pre-modern military history, often illustrated with detailed walkthroughs of fiction. I'm particularly fond of the Tolkien series where he compares book, film, and real-world history.
