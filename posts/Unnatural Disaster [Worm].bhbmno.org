** Is there any chance you could explain why you put this link here? A link by itself is sort of a recommendation, but I'd usually want a little more before I dive into a random fanfic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bh32vm/dc_corrupted_data_files_star_trek_si/elplipu/][A short comment like this]] would help me decide whether the linked story is relevant to my interests.

*** Taylor gains a power to change stuff in a wide area and goes to town taking down baddies. A little like Labyrinth but selective, partially sentient, incredibly fine, and with no manton limitations.

It seems that it suffers from the same problem that crazy overpowered heroes have, namely that the power seemswoefully underutilized at least as far as I have read but maybe it'll change. Writing quality is fairly good and there are real consequences which I find appealing. Tentatively giving it a 7/10 for recommendation.

**** Ugh. I wish that the power were used in actually clever ways. Go out and copy a bunch rodents and experiment on biological tinkering, make a big ball of flying metal, and playing with people's oxygen levels to make them pass out.

***** It's a more slow-building story. That kind of thing happens to a much greater extent later on, to the point where Taylor is able to make the Simurgh back off.

****** Good to know. Would you mind spoiler that last part, that is rather major spoiler.

** Warning: While this fic was a fun read it seems to last have updated in 2016 and is not finished.
