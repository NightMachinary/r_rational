Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I watched Good Omens the six-part TV series that came out Friday. TL;DR review: Read the book if you haven't, miniseries is decent but not amazing.

The novel Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett was one of my favourites of all time, and I've read and reread it kind of a lot. Strongly recommend the novel - it is excellent, and if not exactly 'rational' it has a strongly humanist message that is certainly rational-adjacent in theme. About the end of the world as foretold in Christian eschatology, it's a witty and humorous book that ultimately has a great fast-moving plot and basically no problems or defects of any sort.

Overall, it felt like the TV series stuck to the novel very hard - possibly to the detriment of the series as a whole. They were dedicated to using most every joke and plot point from the novel, even when it didn't make sense necessarily with the medium or the updated setting. The miniseries was definitely set in the present day, i.e. ~2019ish, but the novel was grounded in the time and place of it's publication date, 1990, - so certain plot points like Crowley's tape ansaphone feel wildly out of setting / out of character for a 2019 Crowley archetypal character. I'd have prefered it if they either made it a period piece set in the early 90s, or updated the entire plot. The decision to make Anathema a well-off American heiress rather than the novel's coding of her as poor to middle class UK native was weird, and introduced a bunch of plot and character inconsistency for no perceptible gain. The narration of the story got quite heavy-handed at times, explaining things that were obvious to those paying attention, and basically ruining what could have been a couple of decent jokes by overexplaining and slowing them down too much - it was overused.

A huge amount of Good Omens novel fanfic is/was dedicated to the Crowley/Aziraphale ship, which the TV series did not make explicit but definitely hinted more heavily than the novel did, and the series focused more on them as characters than anyone else. This is probably for the best because Tenant's Crowley and Sheen's Aziraphale are the best characters and actors in the whole thing, and focusing on their relationship was definitely fun. There's a lot of stuff with Adam that got cut and it hurt the plot a bit IMO but on the other hand the children actors gave reasonably good performances for child actors, and thus were mediocre at best by the more stringent standards we'd apply to adults, so it's probably overall for the best.

There's also some weird editing. A couple of jokes still show up in the miniseries without the same setup/payoff that they had in the novel, so it feels weird and out of place to have them in there - for example, the Des Moines Elvis thing had no payoff but Elvis was still in the Des Moines scene.

I liked a lot of it, but overall the book still remains a must-read while the miniseries is more of a 'if you're bored' recommendation.

Did it? I can't think of anything right now, while on the other hand, considering Agnes Nutter's willingness to pass on excruciatingly precise prophecies for the benefit of her descendants, it'd have been weird if she didn't give them something to become filthy rich off.

I felt that happened especially in episode 5. The direction was all over the place. Still, I enjoyed it as a whole, and as you said, Tennant and Sheen as Crowley and Aziraphale are a joy to watch. Really fun.

On a related note, I guess this is as good a time as any to mention to anyone who's reading this that if they lived under a rock until now, like Pratchett-esque British humour and unusual takes on Biblical canon, well, then they really really really ought to check Scott Alexander's /Unsong/.

** Does anyone have recommendations on how to find good content? Currently my methods are this thread, asking in subreddits like [[/r/books]] or [[/r/anime]] if I have something somewhat specific I'm looking for, and just browsing the front pages of YouTube and Netflix. I feel like I could be doing much better, there're enormous amounts of content in the world to read and watch, yet I somehow have difficulty identifying content I'd like to read and watch.

*** Sorting by popular on novelupdates, royalroad, and the various writing forums (sufficient velocity, space battles, etc.).

Sort by number of reviews on fanfiction.net / fictionpress. If you have authors you like on those sites, I've found some good stuff by going to their personal Favorites page. (This works well on Literotica if you read smut, too).

Look at recommendation threads in [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] if you're into those fandoms at all.

Examples on TV Tropes' pages.

Find a work you like on Amazon and browse through the "other people bought" suggestions.

For Netflix/Amazon, there's apps like Flickmetrix.

It's been a while since I sought out anime, but I used to use Anirec.com which looks like it's now anime-planet and still has a recommendation system. People write out what they think is similar about the recommended series so you have an idea if it's what you're looking for.

Like anime, I don't read much manga anymore but I've always found the ratings on Baka-Updates to be pretty good ([[https://www.mangaupdates.com/stats.html?period=month12][stats page]]). Lotta light novel crossovers get rated highly, though.

People make some good lists on Goodreads, including top picks for genres you're fond of. The sidebar giving recommended "if you liked..." on that site has never been very good for me, though.

Can be fun to browse [[/r/booksuggestions][r/booksuggestions]].

*** I've recommended the [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30344847][Masters and Mages]] series a few times here already, but that's because it really is good. The first part of the first book especially was a breath of fresh air for me, just a young guy with the world at his feet thinking about his situation and his prospects, working out his problems in his head. And it was interesting!

I wouldn't say it's rational(the magic system is a bit fuzzy, especially in the second book), but the author is a history buff--medieval scholar and HEMA practitioner-- and actually put some thought into the history of the world, into why politics are the way they are and how the conflicts that the story revolves around actually came about. Like I said, it's the first fantasy book in a while that felt like it broke the mold.

Another story in the vein of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]] is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44327636-the-first-step][The First Step]], this time a competently written xianxia(what a rarity!). Another story of the guy with the world at his feet, on a journey of discovery. Pretty good, and unlike in Cradle, the setting feels very chinese.

- You might like The Engineer by Darren M. Handshaw. It's a kind of post apocalypse, but not the awful depressing kind. The main character also does realistic engineering (mostly stuff you could realistically achieve with medieval tech). I didn't finish it but I don't really remember why.
- I quite liked pretty much all of Drew Hayes' novels, they're generally enjoyable and not about depressed or depressing people.
- I also really liked Edward W. Robinson's Cycle of Arawn series - it's got a main character who grows powerful over time thanks to intelligently exploring and using his powers, and is generally an enjoyable swords and sorcery adventure.
- Similarly, Mark Lawrence's Prince of Thorns series is also quite good - bad things happen to the main character, but he doesn't let that get him down. He turns in to the bad thing that happens to other people. The whole series is very Dying Earth, too, which is fun.

That's not what he's saying. AI-Equivalent humans wouldn't be humans that have gone FOOM, because AI has not gone FOOM. Human-Equivalent AI would be an extraordinary claim; AI-Equivalent Humans are just humans that generate slightly different versions of the same repetitive content over and over again, like modern AIs do.

Haven't thought about this one in years but it is lots of fun. It is a good adventure novel that has challenges but doesn't needlessly make the characters miserable.

I definitely wouldn't say it matches the best of QQ in intelligence, since any story that reaches that level of meta-awareness probably eats itself or blackmails its own author into locking themself in a room to write infinite sequels shortly after being completed.

The characters value brains over brawn and make an effort to be clever to the point that they immediately declare war on mythology and start turning it upside down in entertaining ways, but it is a light adventure novel that doesn't get too complicated about breaking the system. More along the lines of basic bluffing and trickery, exploiting the modern tech that was brought along with them, and gathering useful allies.

It has two sequels based on Egyptian and Norse mythology.

Summary:

An alien pyramid has appeared on Earth, squatting in the middle of Chicago. It is growing, destroying the city as it does and nothing seems able to stop it, not even the might of the US military. Somehow, the alien device is snatching people and for unknown reasons transporting them into worlds of mythology. Dr Lukacs is one of the victims. Granted, he's an expert on mythology. But myths are not something he'd thought to encounter personally. Or wanted to! Sure, he has a couple of tough paratroopers along with him, as well as a blonde Amazon biologist and a very capable maintenance mechanic. Unfortunately, modern weapons don't work, and the Greek gods are out to kill the heroes.

Well, yes, they've got Medea and Arachne and the Sphinx on their side (both Sphinxes, actually the Greek version as well as the Egyptian). And at least some of the Egyptian gods seem friendly.

The Dungeon novels I've read do seem unusually trope-y. Which is a shame, since I genuinely like the concept of a sentient dungeon as a protagonist. Bunker Core was probably the best of them, but I'm not sure if the author is continuing the series.

(If you count Dungeon Lord that's far and away the best; but the protagonist isn't a dungeon, but a human with Sauron type powers in an RPG mechanics world)

Already read or reading Mother of Learning, Time Braid, All you need is kill/Edge of tomorrow. I'm not sure about VR based stories since all of the players would have the same ability. Alternatively, if there is a reincarnation story where they end up in the past with future knowledge and skills which is good, I could try that as well. That's kind of similar because they at least learned from one death.

*** The anime Re:Zero has the protagonist return to certain “checkpoints” after dying, and the problem solving involves using multiple loops to get to a good resolution. On a more limited scope, in Mo Dao Zu Shi the protagonist is a master cultivator who was killed and then ends up possssing a new body, making a new start, but maintaining his knowledge of cultivation techniques and such. I have not finished it yet, but so far it is good, and I have gotten many recommendations for it from other people.

***** No personal experience with the Re:Zero web novel, but I'm also loooking forward to S2. To be honest, the reliving aspect in Mo Dao Zu Shi is pretty minor, but I am greatly enjoying it as my first real experience with the xianxia (cultivation) genre. Also, I recalled the short story The Keeper, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/creatorcorvin/comments/8f7if1/the_keeper_part_1/]] which has return by death as its central premise.

Edit: also the anime Youjo Senki has a mature person reincarnated as a child in a magical world, making use of their intelligence to become a prodigy. Secondly, and a bit more loosely fitting, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has time loops with learning from mistakes to try to find a “good route”. More details are spoilery, but it is probably my favorite anime overall, so I would definitely recommend it.

** In my search for a work that has the same appeal as Worth the Candle, I came across [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]], a complete webnovel with 61 chapters. The premise is that the MC finds himself in a game; the twist is that the game is both grimdark and full of glitches which made it popular in the speedrunning community, of which the MC is a member.

I enjoyed the MC's efforts to apply his speedrunning knowledge to his predicament, testing out which exploits still work and taking advantage of memorised secrets like it's a time loop story. The setting is fairly original and evocative, and I liked the discussion of the video game and anime, in particular their NGE-like production history. There seems to be an intentional contrast between the bleak backstory and the goofy attempts to use glitches, and between the grim amorality of everyone native to the world and the upbeat MC. This dissonance probably won't appeal to everyone, but I found it funny.

However, it could use some editing, and the climax and revelations at the end fell flat. Partially that's due to the speedrunning conceit: it's hard to maintain tension when glitches and foreknowledge are the MC's main tools. I also found the character development to be weak; unlike WtC the effects of the MC on the other characters and vice-versa weren't explored very well.

TL;DR: If you liked the first dozen chapters of Worth the Candle, you might have fun with the first dozen chapters of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]]. Beyond that, it probably depends on your tolerance for the writing and whether you enjoy the asides and dissonance.

I've actually put it on hold since then so I can binge it, so the details are a little fuzzy.

But she is transported to this other world, where she uses her knowledge and tech to make things easier, with the overall goal of getting back home. she can learn (and does learn) how to use the magic that is available in this world. Plot progresses like an isekai-adventurer story mixed with a D&D campaign. Author does a great job in making the MC powerful enough that it's fun but not so powerful she doesn't face setbacks.

In the background is the story of the angels who act as reapers or Death (the soul ferrying kind). Shennanains and power plays are what we get, here, where angels oversee individual worlds/dimensions and there's the usual Heavenly Host heirarchy type of deal.

Hope that helps. Not 100% rational but a fun story.

She's in an odd situation and does a pretty good job of reacting to it, though she isn't rationalist or min maxy. MC has indicators of being very special and potential to be very powerful, but it still feels pretty grounded and she clearly has major threats. It hits the emotional notes decently with her connection to the other characters being interesting and developing naturally. Action is clear and interesting, though not that tense. The power interactions are worked out well, and I haven't detected any idiot balls. Solid though not super unique world building. There's an implied 'big mystery' which I felt was pretty obvious, but that's okay since it means the set up was actually done well (and it hasn't really reached that part yet so who knows how it will be handled).

But, man, I'm about 70% of the way through the story and I have to drop it. The MC is just too fragrantly annoying. I think his stream-of-conscioisness one-liners are supposed to be coming from a place of nervousness but after the first 10-15 chapters there's no accompanying sense of danger or feeling of exploration to really justify them.

Primer (movie): my favorite movie, some engineers develop boxes that can bring them back in time, but only as far back as the box was turned on. Gambit pileup ensues.

Looper (movie): have not watched yet, but have heard it's good.

Re:Zero (anime): isekai guy returns to “checkpoints” of a sort whenever he dies, uses this power to try and achieve a good route through life.

All You Need is Kill (light novel): soldier, basically same power, returning by death, fighting alien invasion. They also made a nice live action movie adaptation.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (web novel): time turners get used, much more than in the Rowling novels.

**** I've got to ask why I keep seeing this recommended. I remember a few months back giving it a shot and it seemed almost anti-rational and mostly just a super angsty slice of life fic where everyone panders to the MC because she's cute and talented. I think I stopped reading because, aside from the above, she kept using her lethal poisons that kill in minutes instead of her non-lethal poisons that can incapacitate someone almost instantaneously, and the result was her nearly dying on multiple occasions.

** I wondered why many ratfic protagonist motivation is about the greater good. Like minimizing suffering, eliminating work (pfft), societal revolution, or even put an end to death. I just read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] [8/10 match to my taste if I don't have personal dislike toward fanfic, I read it because I don't have original fic on reading backlog], a fantastic good vs evil series that's not fun to read toward the end.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][Bluer Shade of White]] [9/10, same], a thought provoking gentle God concept that reeks of AI hard-on, and

- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] [7/10] A kingdom building with awful choice for POV characters.

I'm seeking a fiction where the protagonist has more basic motive. Something like greed, lust, or revenge. Survival also works, but I'd rather not read it if character's adversary is artificially created (like dungeon where stronger and stronger adventurer keep coming). But definitely not the greater good motive (ew). Same criteria as [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bqwp8b/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eobhusd/][the last time I post a request]]. But this time, I'd like it if it's freely available. Thank you.

*** Most ratfic inherently hews to the Effective Altruist party line of "a rational and moral agent should try to maximize their positive impact on the world," so it's no surprise this sub is full of such things.

That said, the 3 protags of Pokemon: Origin of Species all have deeply personally-motivated goals, and while 2/3 have some sort of "greater good" in mind (ending death/general futurism and ending pokemon and human suffering respectively), they're not nearly as in-your-face about it as HJPEV. The third protag just wants to be a really good pokemon trainer.

It's also extremely well-written and very fun.

****** I suppose MCU Thanos must be written that way so that it appeals to general movie-goer. I heard, though, that Thanos actually do what he did because he's enamoured by an incarnation of Death, the sexy one. I admit I do not look deep into the lore, but whatever altruistic reason he get along the way, his root cause is courting that Death.

But my point is we're not general public. We seek a rational protagonist who achieve his goal without abandoning his mindful rationality. Despite adversary that's more, or at least equally, competent. Despite the world that's already so established the free lunch is no longer exist. And I personally wish for a protagonist who's utterly selfish. I think, it's easier to understand that kind of character.

Oh and I thought of another one which was pretty recent. I'll spoiler it because that part isn't at all clear initially. The Favourite.

Honestly though, one could say that almost every historical movie that depicts the people in power as main characters (as opposed to the oppressed rebels fighting for freedom) has a touch of this. As do many black comedies in general.

Edit: Two more for the list with a different feel from the previous ones.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Company][Black Company]] follows a band of ruthless mercenaries, but the book is written as the annals of the band, so a lot of their really vile shit is glossed over because the writer is a softie. I don't actually /like/ any of the characters, but they're still fun to read about for the most part.

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] tells the story of a young child who is a state-sponsored terrorist in a Biopunk style world. It is his coming-of-age story, and you could argue that he's fighting /even worse/ monsters, but the truth of the matter is that he only really cares for his group of friends, and perhaps children in the abstract. Nonetheless he's a lot of fun to read.

Of the 4 you mention, I've only read Lolita... And I'll give you that I enjoyed the book and the character was not doing things for "good" and was not sympathetic (but I will say I enjoyed the book for it's prose and thought-provokingness and not because the character was entertaining. More like a non-fiction work.)

The other person replying to me said they wanted to read books that contained protagonists who do bad things for no morally good reason, so I was also accepting that I'm wrong on that front.

I think, for me, part of it must be that if I don't identify with a character I've probably put the work into the box of "character study" or the like. For me, if I don't identify with the character at all they themselves are definitely not /entertaining/.

******** Because it's boring. In many works of fiction, everybody has their definition of good and they want to do good according to their own definition. The story usually is about conflicting definition of good, either between the protagonist and the antagonist, or between his conscience and the culture (s)he live in.

I want protagonist who seeks revenge, who's willing to sabotage to hurt their enemy the most. I want protagonist who heed their lust, who breaks family because the dude/dudette (s)he fancy is already taken. That kind of basic motive is more real. Doing good is vague. Besides, moving against widely acceptable value is a great challenge on itself. Are you not interested reading about a home wrecker so skilled the ex did not hold grudge?
