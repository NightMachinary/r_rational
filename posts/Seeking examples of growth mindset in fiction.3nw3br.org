As people who care about rationality and winning, it's pretty important to care about training. Repeated practice is how humans acquire skills, and skills are what we use for winning.

Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to get System 1 fully on board with the fact that repeated, difficult, sometimes tedious practice is how we become awesome. I find fiction to be one of the most useful ways of communicating things like this to my S1. It would be great to have a repository of fiction that shows characters practicing skills, mastering them, and becoming awesome, to help this really sink in.

However, in fiction the following tropes are a lot more common:

- Hero is born to greatness and only needs to discover that greatness to win - I don't think I actually need to give examples of this?]

- Like (1), only the author talks about the skill development or the work in passing... but in a way that leaves the reader's attention and system 1 reinforcement on the "already be awesome" part, rather that the "practice to become awesome" part. Examples of this are HPMOR, and the Dresden Files, where most of the implied practice takes place between books.

- A training montage, where again the reader's attention isn't on the training long enough to reinforce the "practice to become awesome" part, but skips to the "wouldn't it be great to already be awesome" part; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage][TVtropes]] has many examples of this.

- The hero starts out ineffectual and becomes great over the course of the book, but this comes from personal revelations and insights, rather than sitting down and practicing. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20426102-nice-dragons-finish-last][Nice Dragons Finish Last]] is an example of this.

/Examples of exactly the wrong thing/:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games][The Hunger Games]] - Katniss is explicitly up against the Pledges who have trained their whole lives for this one thing, but she has ... something special that causes her to win. Also archery is her greatest skill, and she's already awesome at it from the beginning of the story and never spends time practicing.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]]: Ender manages to beat a more experienced player 2 out of 3 without ever touching the game controls prior to the contest. Later on, he trains his troops, but he is already magically there himself.

/Examples that approach the right thing/:

- [[http://www.rakuten.com/prod/the-pillars-of-the-earth/204583267.html?listingid=-1&ranMID=36342&ranEAID=je6NUbpObpQ&ranSiteID=je6NUbpObpQ-ZyCNGK4.s2vUzJ2bdIwDOA&scid=af_linkshare&adid=18094&siteID=je6NUbpObpQ-ZyCNGK4.s2vUzJ2bdIwDOA][The Pillars of the Earth]] - Jack pretty explicitly has to travel around Europe to acquire the skills he needs to become great. Much of the practice is off-screen, but it's at least a pretty significant part of the journey.

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_Harrington][Honor Harrington]] series: the books depict Honor, as well as the people around her, rising through the ranks of the military and gradually levelling up, with emphasis on dedication to training, and that training is often depicted onscreen -- but the skills she's training in herself and her subordinates aren't nearly as relevant as the "tactical genius" that she seems to have been born with.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film][Groundhog Day]]) and similar types of stories. Shows pure growing mindset and determination, no extra talent.

The Tamora Pierce series Protector of the Small does it, though my memory of them is about a decade old. The fanfic crossover with HP called Ambiguous Artifice seems to combine born to greatness and a lot of hard work if that appeals.

*** Protector of the Small is a great example. Tamora Pierce's other works fail on this front: Daine is born with a unique system of magic. Alanna is better, as she trains a lot, but she's also chosen by the Goddess and was born with a magical Gift and a talent for healing.

Protector of the Small has Kel doing good old fashion work to improve, and highlights the skills she starts the book with as a result of the same sort of training throughout her life.

**** Welllll because it is, really. I mean, just because anime tropes allow for a higher level of baseline weirdness, doesn't mean /most/ anime aren't just repeats of the same crappy tropes over and over again.

I mean, consider how many anime deal with cute girls doing cute things in high school, /and don't even have airsoft battles or zombies/. Or harem romantic comedies with soulless, no-personality male protagonists obviously meant to let the otaku audience fantasize about being surrounded by adoring beautiful women without having to relate to others.

With anime, the import process pre-filters things, so you see a selection of higher-quality material without having to browse through all the crap. There's actually quite a lot of good Western media when you exercise an equally strong filter.

The argument is not that the filter functions perfectly to only grab the cream of the crop. It's that the filter greatly increases average quality. For the stuff that gets imported, someone had to sit there and think, "Yes, this is good enough that it's worth the cost of importing", then they had to spend thousands of dollars on doing that. Unless that filter is no better than random chance, the stuff that gets imported is going to be of a higher average quality.

The exact same argument applies to work the fans do. The only works that get fansubs are the ones where some fan sat there and thought, "Yes, this is worth the hundreds of hours it's going to take to translate this". Because fans have limited time, they're going to be selective in what they translate. So they're applying their own filter, except the filter has somewhat different criteria.

That is the same argument that says the best shows are the ones that sell the most.

******** No, it's not the same argument. The argument is similar to one that says "books which get published tend to be better than books which don't get published". But that's not at all the same thing as saying "the best books are the ones that sell the most".

Business decisions /are/ different from fan decisions, but business decisions are predicated on people either sticking around so that they can be fed advertising, buying the product, or buying the merchandising for the product. Those are all things that fans do.

A businessman /purely seeking to maximize profit/ is going to put his money towards the things that he thinks will make him money ... but the way to make money is to have people actually willing to buy the product. So if a businessman is looking to put dubbing on an anime in order to release it to Western markets, he's not going to pick something that absolutely bombed and which no one liked, he's going to pick something that has shown some measure of success. We can be pretty sure that he's not going to be picking from the bottom 10%.

And yes, /some of it/ is going to be shit. Sometimes our businessman is going to get a license on the cheap, sometimes his predictive power is going to be terrible (or simply fail him), sometimes he's going to select things which are generally palatable instead of those which are daring and bold ... but he's /still/ applying a filter and that filter is /still/ going to raise the average quality.

It's possible that we could even empirically test this if we had a big database of anime, whether or not they were imported to the west, and ratings, assuming that we could get past selection biases. Assuming such a database existed somewhere, my prediction is that the average rating for the set of all anime would be lower than the average rating for the set of all anime that got imported to the west.

(My views are somewhat colored by having briefly worked at a publishing company where I sifted through manuscripts to see which ones might be suitable for profit-motivated publication. The idea that this profit-motivated process doesn't incidentally filter based on quality is just ... well, I don't think I could disagree with it more.)

***** Cute girls doing cute things barely exists in western media though. It's either gone through massive sexualisation so it's hot girls doing hot things or uh I can't even think of anything else. Western media has a serious lack of female centric shows. I guess some kids shows ala power puff girls would come under it so the or would be it's demographically targeted at toddlers.

The harem thing is more common, but you can hardly use things that never or hardly happen to show that anime is similar to Western shows.

******* I suppose I could for the discussion accept that definition as cute, but I'd say that that's a cute girl doing cute things which isn't the same as cute girls doing cute things.

There's a very different use of characters there, one is cute as an additive or reward or even contrast for the main character and the second is cuteness for its own sake which as I said seems restricted almost entirely to very young children demographically.

Flicking through that trope page some of the examples, like Her, under films really don't seem to fit the concept brainz was referring too that is very common in anime.

**** A fair part is inherent to the medium. A large assembly of people in a musty church is about as expensive to draw and render as a large assembly in space. Hell, if you go detailed enough the church might actually be more expensive in some cases, so why not do it space? While live action can send actors to a church for cheap, rendering a spacescape is horrendously expensive in CGI. This means that smaller companies can pump out crazy shit at a lower cost, allowing them to take greater risks.

I mean, imagine trying to shoot Attack on Titan or Gundam in live action. Sure, you could technically do it but the price would be astronomical (no pun intended). It gives them much greater freedom to be off the wall.

Think back to western attempts on the same medium and you'll find they can be pretty damn creative as well. Consider Courage the Cowardly Dog or Wren and Stimpy or even South Park. The differences between that and live action are many and obvious, because they do just have more freedom.

Say you're a creative young writer in the US and you want to do a zombie scene. Just a throwaway zombie scene for a gag on a low budget live action show. It's a huge hassle and like as not just not going to happen. In an anime you can totally do it pretty easily.
