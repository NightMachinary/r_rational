  “Here's how it's going to go, Wes,” said Clive. “Can I call you Wes? Do you prefer Nell? Or Lady Ebbridge.”
#+end_quote

Dammit Nell, why didn't you answer this question?

#+begin_quote
  “Here's how it's going to go.” She leaned forward. “I'm going to tell you who I am. And when I'm done, you're not just going to spare me. You're going to join me.”
#+end_quote

Yes please! I've been waiting far too long for the protagonists to join forces with Maxine Clive.

#+begin_quote
  “Wish we could go with you,” breathed another girl.

  “Sure,” he said. “Give me your business cards, and I'll have you both sent to the front lines in no time.”

  The girl blinked. “Oh. Um, no thanks.”
#+end_quote

I still hate you Lorne, even though this part was fantastic.

#+begin_quote
  And as Lorne transferred and bled out, he looked at me. And he /grinned/, his eyes wild.

  “Not bad, Ebbridge.” He spat out a globule of blood. “Not bad.”
#+end_quote

I still hate you Lorne, even though this part was badass.

  “Hey!”  I called out to him as he left.  “Did you do this for Kaplen, too?  This advice.”

  He paused for a moment.  “Yes.”  His voice was soft, hard to hear across the cocktail party.  “Not everyone's built for hell.”
#+end_quote

This passage surprised me a little. Not the part where Lorne mentioned that he gave advice to Kaplan; he strikes me as a person who genuinely wants others to be "strong." But he seems to show a little more sympathy for Kaplen than I expected. Lorne is still a elitist and racist asshole, but this passage and other moments (especially in this chapter) give some depth to his character.

  I placed some of the bills against Clive's exposed neck, ready to slice. She didn't react, continuing to eat her bacon bits.
#+end_quote

I just noticed this. She's still eating bacon. That's wholesome.

#+begin_quote
  “Here's how it's going to go.” She leaned forward. “I'm going to tell you who I am. And when I'm done, you're not just going to spare me. You're going to join me.”
#+end_quote

The "I already know you're going to work for me" pitch works a lot better when you do it on someone convinced that Paragon is evil, though.

#+begin_quote
  “And,” said Clive. “Your mother Ousted you. Kicked you out of her family and replaced you.”

  “I wasn't worthy, then,” I said. I was a drunk, duplicitous wretch with no empathy. “I am now.”
#+end_quote

Do you not remember the part where she told you and Ana you'd have to fight for a single pardon after you both helped save the government? (and technically not a pardon, more like an identity change)

Ugh. I hope Nell gets out of her "Paragon did nothing wrong" phase quickly. She's seen /a lot/ of evidence by now.

#+begin_quote
  My breath caught in my throat. “No!” I said, half a shout. “No. She has lines she won't cross. She can be an ass, but she's not a monster. Not like that.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “The Shenti have cut off contact,” said Clive. “And I thought I was funded by a warlord,” said Clive. “If I'd known the Black Tortoise was involved, I never would have worked with them.” [...] “He's a monster,” said Clive. “If I was born in Shenten, I'd be fighting him right now, not Paragon.”
#+end_quote

Would you really?

That parable you gave about a devil making you do horrible thing for you people works equally well if you're working for the Black Tortoise.

#+begin_quote
  Clive bowed her head. “If you change your mind,” she said. “Go to a store like this, wherever you are. Give the clerk exactly four ten-pound bills when you buy something. And then we'll get in touch, even if you're in Shenten.”
#+end_quote

Wait, how does that work? Does Commonplace control /every/ shop of the brand, even abroad?

#+begin_quote
  Lorne looked at me with a new light in his eyes. “Alright,” he said. “I accept. But we'll use Paragon's training gear. No fancy family armor -- you won't have that in the field.”
#+end_quote

Holy crap, that worked?

#+begin_quote
  And then, one of the metal beams curved midair, and slammed me in the chest from above. Heat washed over my body again, and I dropped out of the sky. I projected into my armor, pushing myself to the side and upwards, slowing my fall.
#+end_quote

Here we see Lorne /demolishing/ Nell. It's not even a contest. I kind of like that; even though Nell and Ana can hold their weight in a scrap and they're creative and underhanded, Lorne just consistently beats them at every metric. Heroism doesn't make you stronger than the guy who trained his entire life for war.

#+begin_quote
  Leizu clenched her fists. “You know why assholes cheat and maim people? Because it's easy.”
#+end_quote

In keeping with previous chapters, Leizu is the only one really calling Nell out on her stupid stunts.

Like, yeah, Lorne and Rowyna congratulated her for it, but it's because they're both sadistic social darwinists.

In a real combat situation, you don't get to plant bombs in your opponent's armor ahead of time.

#+begin_quote
  She nodded. “I wanted to see how you'd act when backed into a corner.” She nodded. “And Lord Daventry was right. You carried yourself well in the battle. Better than you did the entire last year. You're capable of creativity. Focus. Raw aggression. Though you'll need to learn an Autonomous Bullet Defense.”

  Leizu sighed next to me. I stepped forward, a thrill running through my body. “And?”

  “Pack your gear,” my mother said. “You're going to Shenten.”
#+end_quote

/Nell:/ Yay! I get to go die with my friends!

/Leizu:/ :|
