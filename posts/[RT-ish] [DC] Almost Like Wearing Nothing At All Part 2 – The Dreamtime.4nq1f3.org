** i predict that the monks are actually good guys, that the basilisk is not evil either. Maybe the king sent the protagonist to them to become a martyr. If they kill her, the king can be all like "look at those savages who kill poor, defenseless women! This is war!" never mind that it's done in defense of their home and way of life.

** So she's facing a horribly dangerous monster she knows almost nothing about. And she was just going in with no plan, betting her life on a blindfold* and on her blind combat skills. This is suicidal stupidity.

(* which /we/ know is sufficient protection from basilisk petrification, but /she doesn't/. For all she knows, the monks may also have to bathe in unicorn blood under the full moon.)

*** Yep, reckless as hell. A terrible idea brought on by exhaustion, lack of proper nutrition, exposure to the elements, etc.

One thing that has often bugged me with regards to rational fiction is that in real life when things overwhelm us we typically abandon rationality and act in what can only be described as stupid ways. Tanya is not immune to this, only to genre conventions.

**** Ah, fair enough. When it's not explicitly stated out, it can be hard to distinguish between Hollywood Zombie-ness and understandable exhaustion. My apologies for not giving you the benefit of the doubt.

***** I'm actually working on showing not telling right now. Trying to let the readers interpret things, and of course I'm not perfect. I do try, but sometimes I write stupid things too. Just happens that this time I didn't ;-)

We don't know for sure. For all we know, the "basilisk" in that world is actually grey goo that was programmed to make statues out of whatever wanders close enough and the natives know not to do that. The blindfolds are decorative or actually transparent or one of many other possibilities.
