Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}

*** Literally use a random word generator and put "-punk" after it, and you'll have one.

Doing this now using 5 from [[https://randomwordgenerator.com/]] , I got:

- Acceptablepunk: A very gray generic suburbian experience of eternal failed potential, a feeling of being left behind and stagnation.

- Partypunk: Like cyberpunk, but going REALLY heavy on the drugs and neon, as well as taking the decadence flaws that normally are only applied to the rich in cyberpunk instead applied to the whole population via post scarcity automation. Also explores toxic positivity.

- Hikepunk: A nomadic and outdoorsy but non the less technologically advanced civilization, extrapolating MallNinjaShit and prepper bunker to an entire society. Highly focused on survival and post apocalyptic; in fact, just take any generic post apocalyptic setting and give everyone the high tech new and clean gear via some macguffin fabricator technology and you're close.

- Debtpunk: This is just normal cyberpunk isn't it? maybe a bit less neon and a bit more grey, with a prison aesthetic?

- Thronepunk: The 40k imperium, but with more complex interplay betwen multiple royalties, and heavy prince-ness-proliferation like in saudi arabia

**** Debtpunk brings to mind a grimdark version of the late 17th-early 18th century England. The social conditions of the post-South Sea Bubble, except much more severe and permanent.

For the random word generator, I got:

- Moodpunk: Aesthetic and technology of the 1970s, a society focused on a hegemonic neo-religious cult whose followers are distinguished by wearing mood rings and having an emphasis on regulating their emotions, not becoming agitated.

- Depthpunk: A variation on atompunk, instead of the Cold War spurring the Space Race, it triggers the Depth Race. Technological milestones, militarization, and colonization of the underwater. Advances in submarines, underwater cities, etc.

- Churchpunk: A hyper-denominational society based on the early 19th century USA's Second Great Awakening. Various restorationist and revivalist movements compete for domination of society, each often only having enough followers to fill a single church.

*** Hopepunk (often also called solarpunk for some reason): a derivative that explores what happens when the punks of cyberpunk finally win, defeat the System (or at least, escape it), and build a positive, free, techno-anarchist society.

Examples would be the end of the Daemon/Freedom series by Suarez, and most of Cory Doctorow's works.

*** Hmm, given cyberpunk is basically gritty techno dystopia, it'd be interesting to write a world where long-distance communication and transit was significantly harder, so even if things went down the path of dystopic societies across the globe (something something humans suck? Or maybe just turn the 'common and accessible fuel source causes irreparable negative externalities that aren't addressed' up to 11), the individual dystopias are all significantly culturally distinct between places. So you'd have your cyberpunk hellscape as its own country-thing, a steampunk one, a biopunk one, etc.

*** Leaving aside practicalities:

#+begin_quote
  Hydrothermal vents are recognized as rich sources of thermal energy. The hot water flowing from some vents contains thermal power of up to 60 MW. The thermal energy contained in hydrothermal vents make them potential sources for the generation of electric energy. [[[https://www.creare.com/power-system-hydrothermal-vents/#:%7E:text=Hydrothermal%20vents%20are%20recognized%20as,the%20generation%20of%20electric%20energy.][x]]]

  Some of them have a thermal power of up to 60 MWt. [...] With conservative calculation, it can give result of 15 MWe by exploiting a middle range diameter of hydrothermal vent in deep of 2000 meters below sea level.  [[[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/42/1/012019][x]]]
#+end_quote

So assume perhaps 15-60 MW energy input to the system per vent.

How much energy is needed per person? [[https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/22012/power-to-grow-food-per-person][This StackExchange question]] has answers producing varying estimates in the kilowatt range:

#+begin_quote
  The 3kw/person figure in the [NASA] report may just be for general life support - it's caveated as "in the habitat" and the report goes on to explicitly say that the manufacturing unit will have extra power. The farm is shown as a third module. [...] This means you need enough energy input for about four and a bit pounds of growth per person per day, or 450 kwh. Assuming 24-hour farming, you're then looking at ~20kw

  Perhaps a worst-case could be calculated based on an optimistic .25 hectares of land to support 1 person and approx. 1 kW/sq m solar flux for about 2500kW per person. Factor in daylight hours, solar incidence angle in most farming regions and it maybe drops to 500kW or so. 

  The result is cE/d∼100cE/d∼100 kW of electrical power to support one human being with indoor farming. Given all the very rough order-of-magnitude assumptions involved, this seems to be roughly in line with Anthony X's estimate in a comment of 500 kW. No matter what, this is a fantastic amount of energy, dwarfing the approximately 2 kW per person used at Antarctic bases, which ship in their food.
#+end_quote

This would imply a single vent can support somewhere between 30 and 3,000 people.

*** For a complete layman, I always found the basic sanitation advise (and the reasons behind it) to be the most realistic.

If you are an expert in any field however, I think that can be quite useful: an engineer would have basic knowlage on mathematics, alloys, construction methods and materials like concrete and design principals and most important of all: electricity. All these by themselves won't be super useful unless you remember exact formulas, but can be very valuable to a local expect in the field.

The easiest to introduce of the above is electricity IMO. If you have wires and a magnet you can generate it, and once you can show a spark you can get research to continue on other things like light bulbs etc, which as long as you know its a vacuum inside you can think up solutions for how to make them. Lights is the easiest low-hanging fruit of electricity but motors and early phones are not too complex either.

I think the most difficult part would be not getting lynched as a heretic (simply because you start challenging the local churches power).

Edit: Don't forget the steam engine! (but that would be after some infrastructure in smelting already)

** So, last November, I wrote a thing for NaNo. It's 53kish words, and it's maybe 2/3 of the way to a first-draft-done state (entire plot-loadbearing scenes are just "TODO, this thing happens".)

Finishing it would be a big investment of time. So I'm looking for alpha readers to let me know if there's enough /there/ there to be worth finishing. Ideally what I'd like is people who love the idea and maybe also the voice (which owes some fealty to Graydon Saunders, I hate to admit) but are critical about the execution (especially on a big-picture/structural level).

Elevator pitch: it's an urban fantasy novel set in November of 2020, but what it's about is what it means to have power and not be allowed to use it, what it's like to relearn how much there is to learn in the world, and how awesome people can be to get to know and learn to love, in all the ways people love each other.

The MC is a married dude in his thirties. He, his wife, and their 1-year-old daughter are moving to San Francisco because they've had enough of Washington DC, and wind up staying in a group house with a bunch of wizards, a couple paladins, and a young woman who's actually an eldritch abomination.

*** Question, why haven't any of the magical folks pointed out raising a 1yr old in that environment is asking for trouble? Or the protag+partner themselves once thye find our? Like protag actually having relevant family relationships is a severely under-represented aspect in writing, but it kinda clashes with the general rule of "keep toddlers away from balls of fire"

**** Ordinary in-house uses of magic (like the climate control orbs that do temperature control and air quality) aren't any more dangerous to a toddler than a mundane house's power cords and electrical outlets. The deadly kinds of balls of fire have no business being anywhere near the nice furniture or the people playing board games in the living room.

(That's not to say that the house isn't dangerous to a baby. All houses are dangerous to a baby. Babies can practically light themselves on fire through their righteous indignation that you didn't pick them up immediately, while you were on the toilet.)
