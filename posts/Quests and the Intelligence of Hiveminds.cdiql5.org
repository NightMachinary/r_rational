In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/quest-mechanics-introduction-discussion.642898/][quests]], players often vote on the next course of action, and this shapes a story's outcome according to the desires of its active readerbase. Before I got into quests proper, I expected that the quest hive mind would be substantially more competent than the average member, and perhaps more competent than its most capable members. After all, each player brings a different perspective to the table, different skill sets, broader knowledge base, more computing power, and if appropriate delegation is done, improves the knowledge acquisition capacity of the collective. However, after reading some quests (specifically quests whose mechanics tried to incentivise competence in the hive mind) I no longer hold this belief.

​

The choice of action at each point is usually decided by [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting][plurality vote]]. This has the advantage of making the decision process more fair and more democratic (which I think is something that is unduly privileged in Western culture and may be a bit of an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLbkrPu5STNCBLRjr/applause-lights][applause light]], but that's neither here nor there).

A major weakness of this is a phenomenon called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect][bandwagoning]], when a proposed course of action gains momentum, pulling ahead and due to inertia (and perhaps other social effects) it creates a positive feedback loop which eventually cements the position of that plan as the frontrunner. Furthermore, people aren't that likely to change their vote (for various reasons, after voting others may not return to the thread before voting ends, making an explicit decision makes the decision more salient and raises the bar of evidence required to change it, etc). Once a bandwagon starts it's often irreversible without QM intervention (which may invoke perceptions of bias, partiality, etc) and due to the nature of the quest, bandwagons are very easy to start (often they're one of the first few plans). Due to bandwagoning, the earlier a plan is posted, then ceteris paribus the more likely it is to be adopted.

That said, I'm not sure bandwagons are an inherent weakness of hive minds. It seems to me that the phenomenon could be mechanically alleviated. In [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond.45951/][one of the quests I read]] by veteran questmaster [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/rihaku.5176/][Rihaku]], there was a one hour moratorium on voting (I really think it should be substantially longer) after each update to allow players to discuss amongst themselves. This meant that once the moratorium was lifted and plans were posted, those first few plans were likely to have substantial thought behind them, as it was usually those who participated in the pre voting discussion that suggested plans (sometimes the course of action was decided before voting began). This meant that when the bandwagon effect did happen, it was on substantially better plans.

​

However, even in the aforementioned quests, there were some vulnerabilities that I perceived that seem substantially harder to overcome. In short, the hive mind seems to be strategically hindered and weaker at committing to long term plans. I am reminded of how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasparov_versus_the_World][Garry Kasparov beat the rest of the world at chess]] (my original beliefs about hive minds would have predicted them crushing Kasparov), and I wonder if the above vulnerability didn't have a part to play. Progress in quests is sequential, and the players must make decisions at each step along the way. There is often a goal the players are striving towards. In that sense, quests can be viewed as sequential decision problems. There are often many plausible strategies, and the players may favour different strategies. An explicit strategy is often not feasible as important information is often revealed at each update, so players often don't have enough to go off on, that said, people may have ideas for broad paths they intend to pursue. However, only one decision can be made, and once that decision has been made, certain paths are permanently closed off, but there's no mechanism for the players to commit to a given path. Players make atomic decisions when they should be deciding upon paths, usually operating at the tactical level instead of the strategic level.

It seems to me that a hive mind made of competent individuals (hive minds largely populated by less competent individuals would have many other problems to deal with, but they're not as interesting as the problems that persist even in the best case scenario) may be profitably approximated by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm][greedy algorithm]]. At each point the hive mind makes the best choice of action available to them at said point. The hive mind may be substantially more tactically competent than its average member (assuming the decision process is robust to phenomena like bandwagoning and encourages serious discussion of plans) but it's not necessarily strategically more competent. Unlike individual agents, the hive mind lacks the means to commit to a given plan of action (perhaps not inherently, one could conceive of systems designed to let players commit their votes to given plans, but regardless of any such systems to enable commitment, the hive mind would still have more difficulty in commitment than the median member). In this critical capacity (the ability to commit to long term plans of action), it seems that /hive minds are/ /inherently less competent than their median members./ The ability to commit to long term plans is an important facet of strategic competence and enables such basic maneuvers as sacrificing short term benefit to reap long term rewards.

As a result of the aforementioned weakness, I suspect that hive minds are usually less strategically competent than their most competent member(s) (assuming competence is normally distributed). I can't really make a call on whether they would be more competent than the median member. I suspect that would be very dependent on the nature of the task and the competence/skill distribution of individual members (if there's sufficiently non overlapping skill sets/knowledge/competence amongst the members of the hive mind, then I expect the aggregation of their individual abilities the hive mind enables would exceed its median member).

​

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cdiql5/quests_and_the_intelligence_of_hiveminds/etug545/][Another weakness of hive minds]] was pointed out to me by [[/u/nohat][u/nohat]]; the hive mind cannot trust itself to reliably follow any given long term plan. As the individual members of the hive would be aware of this vulnerability, it would set up incentives that biases them away from long term strategic plays (because they wouldn't expect the hive mind to be able to follow through on them). The hive mind being unable to commit to long term strategy thus becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and may reinforce the perceptions of the hive mind being unable to commit to long term strategy in a vicious cycle. When players are individually biased against long term strategy it would manifest as a collective bias, and this may explain the greedy algorithm approach of hive minds as pursuing the apparent best choice of action in the given scenario is easier to persuade the hive mind to adopt. This may manifest as hive minds with suitable communication mechanisms (I suspect this is a big ask, in particular it would require that the best ideas gain currency) being more tactically competent than the best members.

I wonder if a reputation mechanism would improve coordination of the hive mind. [[/u/ArgentStoneCutter][u/ArgentStoneCutter]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cdiql5/quests_and_the_intelligence_of_hiveminds/etu6nzc/][suggested something similar]]. The mechanism doesn't even need to be explicitly used in decision making. Ideally, by providing members with convenient access to the histories of their votes, the players who were right more often may gain increased social cred and thus louder voices.

​

The main objection to the above theory I have is the aforementioned match in which Kasparov faced off against the rest of the world. While Kasparov did win, he admitted that the hive mind gave him his toughest match yet. Perhaps that result was in part a feature of chess (apart from the idiosyncrasies of the game, there was a clear competence hierarchy and folks may have deferred to the judgement of those more competent than them), but I don't know enough to make a call on this?

Edit: The world team had access to computer assistance. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasparov_versus_the_World][From Wikipedia]]:

#+begin_quote
  The World Team also benefited from an organization known as "The Computer Chess Team" founded and captained by Gordon Swobe. This team used distributed computing to analyze each possible line and make recommendations to the world.
#+end_quote

​

I feel like I should withdraw my previous reservations in light of the above, but I would appreciate commentary from those more knowledgeable on chess (and those aware of what that level of computing assistance would have meant in 1999).

- What measures do you think could be taken to raise the strategic competence of hiveminds in quests?

​

My tentative plans for improving strategic competence in quests is to adopt a three part voting system.

- A discussion period in which no votes are cast nor plans proposed that lasts several hours.
- A plan proposal period in which plans are proposed but not voted on (plans can also be discussed and refined further) that also lasts several hours. No plans can be voted on during this period.
- A voting period in which players [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting][rank the plans]]. Only voting takes place in this period (one could raise the threshold of investment by requiring players to rank all plans, but if a sufficiently large number of plans are proposed this would become cumbersome).


** There's a YouTube video out there about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw]["why corporations aren't AIs"]] that's relevant to the topic, but I can't find it right now.

The basic thesis is that a committee is sort of like an intellectual harness. If you have a bunch of people pulling on a cart, the cart can never go faster than the fastest person. Similarly, a committee can never be smarter than the smartest person in it.

And that's completely ignoring the fact that there's an efficiency loss in having to coordinate all those people.

I think the biggest advantage of group decision making is that the ability of the group to spot potential blunders or optimizations is additive and far better than any individual, assuming all the individuals (or most of them) in the group are willing to listen to productive suggestions of that nature and alter course accordingly. That is a very big presumption, but if it's not the case then you do not have a good selection of people for making group decisions.

It's almost the 50th anniversary of the Apollo moon landings. The decision making and engineering thought behind those massive machines was done by a large group of people in under a decade. There were smart people, sure, but not one of them could have even come close to the cumulative centuries of thought, testing, and analysis that were performed by the thousands of people involved in the project. A solitary individual couldn't even get past the "gather background information" stage. They'd be hard-pressed to read just the executive summaries of the reams of reports that were produced, much less make good decisions on them.

** I've definitely noticed the 'Greedy Algorithm' tendency, particularly in acquisition of power. It does make sense to grab short term benefit, especially when you can't rely upon your future decisions to follow through on long term plans. It's a downside of democracy that's been apparent in real life. One administration can start a long term project, but quite often it gets cancelled by the next administration before it is finished.

I've also noticed it in a game I played a long time ago called CyberNations. The democratic alliances were considered unreliable by other alliances because the people in charge would change regularly. Of course that also helped sometimes -- the new leaders could easily brush off past animosities or conflicts with a "that was the old administration." Nearly all the rest were run by relatively few high effort members who also tended to bring a lot of history with each other (good and bad) to the table.

I'm not really sure how to counter it. Possibly some sort of a trust vote (ie I temporarily imbue X with my vote). Possibly a pre-planning exercise where people vote on long term plans to pursue.

I can imagine each update of a quest having a short period where people simply vote on which longer term goals and strategies are more important to them, after which there is a short moratorium on voting to come up with a plan with the goals in mind, and then a vote on which plan to follow.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure bandwagons are an inherent weakness of hiveminds.
#+end_quote

Agreed. In fact,

#+begin_quote
  The choice of action at each point is decided by plurality vote.
#+end_quote

is only sometimes true. Various other voting systems are used. You can't completely get around [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem][Arrow's impossibility theorem]], but you can still do a much better job than plurality vote.

E.g. [[/r/rational]] darling /The Erogamer/ uses a combination of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting][ranked voting]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting][approval voting]] - and sometimes combines multiple high-ranked options. Strategic voting is far less rewarded (and, at any rate, requires too much calculation for readers to bother with).

 

It's worth noting that in many quests, long-term strategising doesn't bring much benefit /to the readers/.

Sure, the character has a strong preference for a certain long-term goal (say, taking over the world). But a /reader/ might only have very mild long-term preferences, with much stronger preferences for some kinds of scenes (say, banter) over others.

Why pick the smart long-term world-conquering option when you could have a banter scene right now? The "I have successfully taken over the world" scene would be sweet, but not so sweet as to be worth the sacrifice. Plus the questmaster is clearly aiming for that scene, so it'll probably happen eventually anyway.

And since opportunities to banter come pretty much at random, there's no point in doing long-term planning to maximise /that/ either. You just vote "banter" whenever the option shows up.

(I once again present /The Erogamer/ as an example.)

 

Sorry for only addressing the specific case of quests rather than your higher-level question. Well, this /is/ [[/r/rational]].

It may be cheeky to file away a player base whose incentives aren't perfectly aligned with the goals of the quest as less than competent, but after covering bandwagoning, I realised that there were other problems with quests as practiced that didn't seem to be inherent problems and thus I didn't find them as interesting as the kind of problems that persisted when we had an ideal player base.

​

That said I would look at other forms of voting. I was wondering that stuff like ranked choice would make the voting process more complex (especially if write in plans are accepted, it may become cumbersome), but perhaps the higher threshold for voting would incentivise more intelligent behaviour. I'm now thinking of a three part voting period.

- A plan proposal period in which plans are proposed but not voted on (plans can also be discussed and refined further) that also lasts several hours. No plans can be voted on during this period.

** I don't really even understand how this is applicable to quests.

Hive mind video games yes.

But the vast majority of quests don't have failure states. The authors are having fun and so are the audience. There are rarely "best" choices. Whatever choice you choose something will occur and when does that something mean game over no more content ever?

The long term is vastly discounted because the voters don't even know if they'll bother reading future updates. Even if there was only a single individual voting almost everything you say would still apply.

I can't trust that my future self is going to want to keep reading, I can't trust that the author will keep producing content, etc.

Why not look into the video game community? Which can and do commit to longterm plans, especially with small numbers of people. As the game progresses interest dies down and similarly minded people continue the process.

Look into twitch plays pokemon and all the thousands of clones of that.

** The Forge of Destiny / Threads of Destiny quests have a Math Cabal that meets on Discord, and a lot of times they have determined the best choice ahead of time, and usually their choice wins the vote.

That quest also has an automatic 2 hour wait before anyone can vote, which also helps foster discussion.

** It amuses/frustrates me that you think Quests would be "better" if the posters always made the absolute bestest, most smartest, most well-informed decisions. I completely disagree.

Stories are built on characters being idiots. On making mistakes. On failing to think ahead. On being flawed, and limited, and buffeted by desires they may only be dimly aware of. Frankly, I find characters' weaknesses vastly more interesting than their strengths, because that's where drama lies.

You are not treating Quests like an exercise in collaborative storytelling. You are treating them like an engineering problem. You are trying to optimise away the drama. As far as I'm concerned, having a Quest protagonist make stupid decisions, despite having the intelligence of a whole crowd of spectators driving them, is the system working as intended.

Because stories where the protagonist always makes the right choices, and comes out of every conflict on top, /are fucking boring./

This rings true. In fairness, that's due to the nature of certain quests I've read.

** It can help to create a mandatory discussion period before voting begins. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction.

** Iterative Score Voting would fix most all issues and is fairly streamlined (certainly more so than any ranked system).

1) Each person proposes a plan (no discussion needed)\\
2) Show of fingers to score each plan 0-10\\
3) Each person proposes amended version of the highest scored plan\\
4) Show of fingers to score each plan plus the highest scored plan\\
5) Repeat 3)/4) until highest scored plan outscores all amended ones

No discussion needed so it harder for bandwagons to occur.

I believe the iterative nature helps with long-term planning, the voting process itself is longer-term, and iteration helps amend any strategic flaws and short-termism in the plan.

The only amendment to the procedure I might make is to try the procedure out a few times, then propose multiple amendments to the procedure and run them through the iterated score voting procedure until the iterated score voting procedure produces the optimal version of the iterated score voting procedure.

Hopefully, this doesn't result in a recursive self-improvement process that leads iterated score voting procedure to acquire runaway super-intelligence, but if one does emerge I think it's best it be made of people.

--------------

Iterative Score Voting also opens an avenue for something better than reputational weighting. Forecasting skill weighting!

Each plan's total score is an independent event, so forecasting each plan's total score is a prediction that can be made and immediately checked for accuracy.

Forecasting a plan's total score and forecasting a plan's value should correlate highly relative to anything else you could test.

If you then bias the vote toward good total-score-forecasters you should get higher forecasted-value plans winning.

Its also possible a training effect will occur. Getting rapid feedback on your forecasting skill should allow you to improve it, and thus improve your skill at forecasting other things like how valuable each plan would prove to be.

It's similar to how accurately assessing your confidence in your answer is closely tied to your ability to predict what percentage other answerers would give the same answer.

**** Every person still experiences every idea, because they have to assess each presented idea to vote on them.

And the fact that the next step is amending the previous winner, rather than starting from scratch ensures there is cross-pollination.
