  ‚ÄúThat's exactly what my near-death-experience brain hallucination would tell me, though.‚Äù

  The woman rubbed her temples and sighed. ‚ÄúEpistemologically speaking, anything that ever happens could be your near-death-experience brain hallucination and you would never know for sure. If you want to play it that way.‚Äù

Wait a minute. That's exactly what my dying brain would show me if it were trying to distract me from the experience of death by drawing me into a well-crafted fiction... ü§î

**** Well... as long as it's well-crafted. I'd probably mind a lot less, even if theoretically I should be panicking about my imminent demise. There's a lot to be said for the distractability of good writing, though.

** Interesting so far, although I agree that there's not enough to make any firm judgements yet.

Starting a story /in media res/ is... I'm not going to say it's a /bad/ choice, but it's writing a check that you'd better be confident in your ability to pay off.

There's some blatant narrative contrivance here, but I don't have any problem whatsoever with that when setting up the premise of a story. Just as long as it isn't indicative of a habit (which, again, way too early to tell).

I'm a little confused by the story having the framing device (narration from the POV of the character as she's being tortured) at the beginning of the first two chapters, but not including it for the third.

I like the tone, I like the snark (first person smartass is the best story perspective), I like that I can see mysteries already starting to get set up in anticipation for future chapters; hopefully, those are paid off well.

Thanks for sharing it!

** :( only a couplr of chapters yet...

Looks promising. But did not give enough to say yet. I need to know how the systemless guy is not gonna be powerless, or if he just is and has to win by doing politics or assassination or something instead of facetanking armies.

Why did she say two thousand years ago for aphoridtie, surely at least 3000 is more appropriate

However she saw lots of people prior to this, some dead admittedly, and there's no acknowledgement that she's talking about this world anyway, for all we know she's saying average height for her home country
