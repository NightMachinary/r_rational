It doesn't have to be rational or even rationalist. I currently read and caught up with all the fiction that get posted here. Is there any other hidden gems out there?


** Here's a few I follow:

- [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][OOTS]] has already been mentioned. In essence, it's the story of a party of adventurers trying to stop a powerful lich from obtaining world-threatening macguffins in a setting loosely based on D&D mechanics, but that barely scratches the surface. It starts out as a gag-a-day strip but quickly develops an engrossing plot and a richly characterized ensemble. It has a lot of well-executed "wham moments" and brilliantly handled character development throughout. You don't need to be familiar with D&D or tabletop games to follow the plot, although it helps with getting some of the jokes.

- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][Unsounded]] is possibly the overall highest-quality webcomic I've ever read and also deals with some themes relevant to this sub. The complexity of the worldbuilding is extremely impressive (especially if you follow the creators' Tumblr, where she answers questions about background details that don't make it onto the page), and there's a really cool, consistent, fleshed-out magic system that functions similarly to computer programming. The premise is hard to summarize, but basically it's about a dead-ish man whose soul is trapped in his decaying body for reasons he doesn't understand, tasked with escorting the young daughter of a crime boss to a distant city, and...it kind of seems like the story will ultimately be about uncovering and comprehending the very underpinnings of reality? Time will tell. (Also, highly reliable 3-updates-per-week schedule.)

- [[http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1][Stand Still Stay Silent]] is a postapocalyptic story inspired by Finnish and Scandinavian folklore. It follows a band of misfits on an underfunded expedition to retrieve old-world books from the deadly Silent World, a region abandoned by humans after a global plague. It is not remotely rationalist, but has beautiful (or sometimes grotesque) art and rich characters. One of the main ensemble is autistic-coded, for those looking for representation (though the author has said he won't be officially diagnosed with anything in the comic). One "book" of this comic has been completed and the second one is in progress (4 updates a week). See also the creator's "practice comic," [[http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page01.php][A Redtail's Dream,]] which is fantastic in its own right.

- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=1][Lackadaisy]] is a Prohibition-era story of similar quality to Unsounded, but with a tragically much slower update schedule. It's about a speakeasy struggling to stay afloat admidst the dangerous schemes and shenanigans of the criminal underworld. Meticulously researched for historical accuracy, gorgeous sepia-toned art. Also the characters are all drawn like cats but I don't think they're actually canonically cats? You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.

- A lesser-known one is [[http://www.doomsdaymydear.com/comics/1735998/title/][Doomsday My Dear]], which is about an an alt-universe UK where a mysterious plague paves the way for the rise of a totalitarian state. Kinda slow to update, but I love the art style and the characters feel very human.

- [[http://gobolatula.com/ithurts/][IT HURTS!!]] is crude, bizarre, silly, sometimes offensive, and overall about as far as it gets from being rationalist. It's also one of the most sincere and relatable takes on depression and anxiety I've ever read, and did things to my emotions that I would never have anticipated, and it's somehow also consistently hilarious and the plot goes to some really fucking cool places. Give it a shot! (The characters use slurs in the beginning because they're shitty middle schoolers--if it bothers you a lot, start 60ish strips in, they decide to stop using them around that point. Also don't read the comments if you don't want spoilers.) This comic is complete, although there's a sequel comic which absolutely should not be read or even read /about/ before reading IT HURTS!! in its entirety.

- [[http://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1][Paranatural]], currently on hiatus but returning Jan 1, is about a boy who moves to a new town and discovers that he can see spirits--and that his new school has a club for kids like him. The art and writing are really goddamn funny, and the character dynamics and conflicts are very well done and have caused me /a lot of feelings./

- [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]], currently on hiatus, is pretty close to rational compared to most of the others on this list. It's set in a world where a generation of kids developed superpowers a few years ago, and it follows a young Superman expy as she tries to, A., figure out how to do good effectively on a global scale when all she really excels at is punching things, and B., figure out what "good" actually /is/. Lots of lengthy ethical debates, occasional creative superpower use, exploration of the social-justice implications of superpowers.

- [[https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/][Kill Six Billion Demons]] is about an ordinary woman from Earth who is transported to a strange, alien place with a mysterious artifact embedded in her forehead. Before long she's making friends with angels and picking fights with some of the most powerful entities around. Cool art, very cool worldbuilding, lots of action. Sometimes the authors' notes contain excerpts from in-universe texts concerning history, folklore, religion, etc.

- In the world of comics that actually cost money, I've been following [[https://www.comixology.com/The-Unbeatable-Squirrel-Girl-2015/comics-series/33143][The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl,]] which is written by Ryan North of Dinosaur Comics. It's lighthearted and very funny, with a focus on finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts that satisfy everyone (and failing that, creative out-of-the-box solutions that use available resources in unexpected ways). Also lots of of philosophy and computer science jokes, and there's a graphic novel that's a fun take on the "utilitarian character tries to take over the world to impose a benevolent dictatorship" trope I see occasionally in rationalist fic.

********** Yeah, I think you're right--most of what happened really wasn't fair. But I guess we have to take [[https://imgur.com/a2juCK4][God's word]] on that subject.

The part that really kills me is knowing that since Pasqualo never double-died, Ally spent who knows how long in Hell not knowing where he was or what had happened to him, and probably eventually got incinerated by hellfire still not knowing. That and when I realized on rereading the comic that Aurora knew Pasq was going to sacrifice himself for her in the rebooted universe, and explicitly, desperately did not want him to do that, and died knowing she was helpless to prevent it.

On a more positive note, check out [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlBppRLXgAAT4iq.jpg][the sketch I got in my copy of Book 6]]. Canon ending IMO. Freeze frame, roll credits.

** [[https://wanderinginn.com][The Wandering Inn.]]

It has some rational parts but for the most part is very irrational. The basic premise is a country performs a ritual to summon [Heroes]. A side effect of that ritual is that various humans arrive all over a world where people have classes and skills but no stats. The main character Erin is one such human who stumbles upon an abandonded inn and becones it's innkeeper. Adeventures ensues as she's forced to deal with adventurers, guards, friendly monsters and hordes of monsters. It's a stereotypical world where Humans, Drakes, Gnolls and the hive minded Antium are the principle races. There are also various mini stories that focus on other people dropped in to the world who generally have unique or rare classes like [Doctor], [Clown] or [Emperor].

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound][The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound]].

A regular LitRPG where Earth is hit by the System which destroys civilisation and forced everybody to start over. Randidly becomes a reluctant hero when he is given the advantage of immediately being dumped in a high level time dilated dungeon when the System hits.

****** Lol. And yet for some reason I felt jerked around less by Worm. I think it's a question of expectations. Of course your favorite characters will die in Endbringer attacks, but why should experienced adventurers forget the possibility of traps when they've already fallen into one, not aim for the weak spot, not succeed in hitting the enemy with a door or capitalize on its weakness, and after all that, still fail at keeping it from destroying everything that you've spent five or six chapters ramping up to?

I seriously felt cheated.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound][The legend of Randidly Ghosthound]] is a series I follow rather religiously, I'm a $10 patron on the authors patreon mostly because his patreon reward is like 60+ chapters more reading, and discussion in his Discord. It's a very fun series that is a great example of the Litrpg Genre, with a very interesting take on the 'system' that is present in such series, mostly as it's system is both working towards its own goals and actively Malicious. The MC is rather fun, as he is the opposite of what most Litrpg MCs are, he is awkward, impatient, antisocial and just generally a loner, and stays that way, improving without changing these core aspects. It's a fun series, if you like it's genre.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles][Metaworld Chronicles]] another series that is just plain fun. It's a bit of a self insert fiction in which the Main character, previously a successful business woman in Sydney 2017, is drawn into the body of an alternate universe version of herself that exists in 2001, a the world has magic and monsters, ruled of by the mages that are the only hope of fighting back the existential threats to mankind. I like this series partial for its endearing character, it's initial Australian setting (an uncommon setting, and welcome for an Aussie), it's unquiet and entertaining implementation of D&D magic as its magic system, with great restrictions and interesting variations, and a rather well thought out and explained alternate history.

I wouldn't consider either of these to be rational /or/ rationalist at all, but I very much enjoy them, and they are the main series I wait for each week.

It has racked up several Hugo nominations, and is also notable for never once having missed its daily update in its 18 years of publishing, not even when [[https://tech.slashdot.org/story/08/06/01/1715247/explosion-at-theplanet-datacenter-drops-9000-servers][the datacenter hosting it exploded]], caught fire and was subsequently flooded.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] One of my favorite webnovels, be warned however that it is /extremely/ NSFW.

Best to read it without spoilers, just try and make it through the first chapter and you should pretty much immediately be hooked. But here's a more detailed description, for you to read after finishing chapter one.

It's about a mimic who, mostly through sheer luck, becomes sentient. It is, however, still fundamentally a monster- as such it lives only to fulfill it's utility goals of "Acquire Shiny Things" and "Eat Tasty Things". Get's more interesting the longer you read it, though I can't really say how without spoiling it. Let's just say that he won't be satisfied staying in the starting dungeon forever...

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]]

The best quest-type story I've ever read, not counting Homestuck. This actually is brought up on this subreddit sometimes, but not often. A lot of readers are scared off by needing an account to access the site. Anyway, it's about a girl on the verge of suicide, who one day gains typical "The Gamer" style abilities, but the twist is that it's locked into the genre of "Erogame", meaning that everything sort of revolves around sex.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/217108/not-the-hero][Not The Hero]]

Man, I don't even like MLP. But with that said, this is still one of my favorite stories. It's basically a "Human in Equestria" story, but the human in actually a villain, and the longer they spend in this world, the more it resembles their shitty fannon. Discord, spirit of disharmony and chaos, decides he has to do something about it. The story itself is basically his journal, chronicling his attempts to fight this living Mary Sue.

[[https://mspfa.com/?s=14113&p=1][COOL AND NEW WEB COMIC]]

The best Homestuck fan comic in existence. I know it seems kinda boring at first, and that it seems like you get the joke, but I /BEG/ you to at least read up to Rose's introduction before judging it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re:Trailer Trash]]

A story about a girl sent back in time, who resolves to live a better life than the one she had originally. MC is ridiculously competent, but in a good way, rather than a Mary Sue sort of way. Kind of inspired me to try and exercise more, actually...

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21368/the-dungeon-traveler][The Dungeon Traveler]]

Generic, but fun. It's your run of the mill "MC is a living dungeon" type of story. The gimmick is that the dungeon teleports to new locations all the time. Kinda underselling it here, but I can't think of anything else to say about it...

EDIT: AAAAAAH! I forgot!

**** Had to look that word up on urban dictionary. For anyone wondering: vore => voraphilia => people-eating (fetish)

The way I look at it, the "monster vs enlightened" terminal value gap is something that the [[/r/rational]] community should be able to appreciate. I like how the author never lets you forget that even though these things may have reached human level of intelligence and some are even able to adopt human appearances and act like humans flawlessly, they are absolutely NOT human in the only way that rationalists really care about: their mind and their values. I don't think it's really played for fetishistic delight, but that's just my opinion.

The only /repetitive/ vore is him summoning and eating his succubus familiar as a snack, but since her body is that of a demon, it's kinda like eating a ghost or a body made of ectoplasm rather than flesh. Sure, there's people-eating going on here and there, most of them innocent bystanders, but the /depictions/ of it aren't usually that gratuitously disgusting. It's always framed in such a way as to be normal (since in the monsters' value system, it /is/ normal). If you were to replace the words "human" or "elf" with "beef" or "cow", the descriptions would be totally PG outside of certain more exceptional cases.

That said, if it triggers you, it triggers you. But I'm not exactly a huge fan of splatter in general, yet I don't have a problem with ELLC, so I just wanted to post this as a counter-opinion for anyone considering whether to try it out or not.

[[http://www.paultwister.com/]]

​

the xy adventures comics i check everyday uhh warning kinda extremely homoerotic and fanservice-y which if not to your taste should be avoided, but is a very slice of life cutsie kind of thing [[https://blackadventurescomic.com/]]

​

Life ore death a mistborn/young justice crossover that has a feruchemistw/atium misting spike that I just love for the way that the Main character is very orange/blue with the more traditionally morals-ed cast. Also mistborn crossover so like given the constraints and the /rules/ of a Brandon Sanderson work which I love. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/reader]]

also that's on spacebattles too but the reader mode for sufficient velocity has more entries per page so that's why i linked it from there.

​

Olivine Romance on Ao3 uhhh this one is a little more explicit in the sexual sense so uhh heads up if that's not your cup of tea. but it's a pokemon fanfic based on Jasmine the steel gym leader from johto it rather recently started into it's second book so minus it being a huge mass of writing now is a great time to start reading it lol. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1609088/chapters/3425729]]

​

soo uh none of that is particularly what i would consider rational fic but i do check them religiously.

*** is the digimon story as lighthearted as the life ore death story? I started reading that one and was enjoying it a bunch but gave up on it when it became apparent how obsessed the entire YoungJustice seemed to be with never taking life of people trying to kill you and dropped it shortly after the mind control arc; it seemed absurd to me the way they reacted to the MC killing soliders who were shooting at them and would of killed them if she hadnt saved them; similar to why I dropped dungeon keeper ami after the whole fairy arc

**** uhh on the whole while there are parts that are jovial and light i'd say it has a much darker tone on the whole like as in treating it as the deathworld that is kind of implied at various times. so no i would say that life ore death has a much lighter tone than digimon world infamy.

** Currently, the manga subreddit is going crazy over Solo Leveling. Nothing innovative, but the execution of the story and art is pretty good.

Outside of web stuff, I continue to religiously wait for the Cradle series by Will Wight. 5 books (out of potentially 12+) are out and the author has been releasing them about every 6 months.

** I'm reading [[https://www.lezhin.com/en/comic/appetite][Appetite]], because I am complete garbage for weird romances and Appetite is a slow-burn love story between a cannibal monster and a suicidal teen who has agreed to be eaten once he's a little older and will be a more magically potent meal, so that his death will mean something. As somebody who once agreed to give bone marrow 90% because it was the right thing to do and 10% out of the faint hope that something might go wrong and I'd die in a way that seemed less wasteful than outright suicide, it's really easy to identify with the latter character's headspace.

It...kind of changes tracks later on and isn't entirely what I was hoping it would be, but it doesn't take much of a time investment from me so I'm willing to keep reading in order to see how it all ends.

If you have access to normal comics, either at a local shop or online or through a scan site, then you may also like *Dwarves*. Each issue is 60-70 pages long and follows the life (or part of the life) of, uh, a dwarf. The issues stand on their own feet but where the series /really/ shines is in the way that it becomes a multigenerational epic. Several protagonists have been the children of protagonists from previous issues, and other protagonists have reappeared in supporting roles. There are two other series in the same setting, /Orcs & Goblins/ and /Elves/, but I found the writing and stories to be far worse and no longer follow them.

You may also enjoy *Uber* and *Uber: Invasion*, a WWII/superpowers comic. In the early months of WWII, it turns out that Germany was working on a way to give people (very specific) superpowers. This is sufficient to turn the tide of the war /temporarily/, but they had a mole who was able to get some of the relevant information out to the Allies, who begin producing their own supersoldiers, and the fact remains that Germany is still on its last economic leg, which is posing its own problems. The comic makes no effort to shy away from the more gruesome aspects of war (as the writer, Kieron Gillen, mentions in one of his afterwords, war is a horror story and war /with superpowers/ would be even more so). Murphy's Law is in full effect and plans go right just about as often as you'd expect them to. Finally, the narration appears to be sourced from a history book (or several) from some time after the war, though we aren't given the title (or titles).

My last recommendation is *The Black Monday Murders*, a noir/horror series by Jonathan Hickman. In the Mormon temple ceremony, Satan is explicitly linked to capitalism, and money is the means by which Satan "rules with blood and horror." Jonathan Hickman is not a Mormon and Mammon is more an ancient god than a Christian demon, but the underlying theme remains: black magic requires human sacrifice, and capitalism with all its excesses is the means by which this is carried out in the modern day, with the occasional detour into sacrifices of the more conventional kind (early in the first issue, we find out that the bankers and brokers who supposedly committed jumped out of windows during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 did not commit suicide, but were thrown out to keep the magical consequences of the crash from hitting the people at the very top).

It is the only time that you will see someone pay a dreadful price to ask questions of a god, and ask something as banal as "What causes a market crash?"

** I am reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/][Now You Feel Like Number None]] and I love it.

It's a very well-written, story-driven Bleach quest about an arrancar in Aizen's army. Updates tend to be long and frequent.

(Bleach's worldbuilding for those unfamiliar: The standard-destination afterlife is a dimension called "soul society". It is a conservative feudal-japan oligarchy with vast slums. The ruling class is sequestered into a walled district with its own army of ghost samurai wizards - "shinigamis". Individual shinigami vary vastly in strength. The strongest few are granted the title of "captain" and their individual physical power actually constitutes the real power of all of soul society. Three of these captains have defected with plans to supplant the withdrawn "soul king", who is isolated in another inaccessible dimension.

To achieve this, they have subjugated a third dimension, "Hueco Mundo", populated by strange, twisted ghosts - "hollows". Hollows are driven by a constant hunger to consume other souls. The invading captains have removed this hunger from the hollows they conquered by spiritual surgery and turned them into something more human and more usable as soldiers in the process - "arrancars". The quest follows one such arrancar as she tries to get by in a society created for the sole purpose of fighting a single war.)

**** From the [[http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/after_the_hero/prelude/about][about page]] of the entire series:

#+begin_quote
  Here told is the tale of the night the Hero fell, the night that Galavar and his Guard set in motion the fate of the world: the Prelude to After The Hero.

  After The Hero itself tells the tale of Galavar, the ambitious stranger from the desert, who sets out to fulfill his life's dream of ruling the world of Relance---not to plunder it, or set his people above the rest, but to lift up civilization into something finer. Can such a thing be done? Can such a dream be made real without becoming a nightmare?
#+end_quote

The prelude, which is a complete ~280 story, starts with a setback. Galavar - ruling in a desert town where he and his followers are hiding away, building up resources for their ambitions - is attacked by a large army lead by a Hero from a neighbouring country. They survive; but damage is great, and their plans must compromise. This strains the relationships within Galavar's closest following - the Guards, and between them and the deity (Sourros, God of Logic and Wisdom) whose patronage they've been leveraging.

The Great Galavar, which is the incomplete serial story currently at ~40 episodes, is about Galavar's backstory. It starts at something like a college in the country of Ieik, where Galavar is educated and trained. During a local feast, it is said the patron god of Ieik - Sourros again - occasionally speaks to his people, but that has not happened in years.

During casual conversation with a friend, they discuss why that is; Galavar cheekily suggests that they ask the god directly.

The god answers.
