For those who don't know what xianxia is, it's a genre of novels that takes the themes and ideas present in wuxia - that is, exaggerated martial arts, honour, and various other things; basically Chinese martial arts fantasy - and brings them to a world in which it's possible for people to train to a ridiculous point, often through comprehension of the world surrounding them - comprehending the Dao. If wuxia is analogous to fantasy as a genre, then xianxia is high-fantasy. It's often the case in these novels that someone can train to the point where they never age, can fly through the sky, and in some cases affect the laws of the world itself. Combine that with a huge world, often with a deep history and many secrets to it, and you've got my new favourite genre. And, since I've been requested to do something like this for the sub, here's a few recommendations.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon, by I Eat Tomatoes]] - One of the more famous examples of xianxia, and a good starting point if not my favourite example. The translation is complete, at all 21 books (800+ chapters) being translated, and at a consistently high quality.

Official Description:

#+begin_quote
  Empires rise and fall on the Yulan Continent. Saints, immortal beings of unimaginable power, battle using spells and swords, leaving swathes of destruction in their wake. Magical beasts rule the mountains, where the brave -- or the foolish -- go to test their strength. Even the mighty can fall, feasted on by those stronger. The strong live like royalty; the weak strive to survive another day.

  This is the world which Linley is born into. Raised in the small town of Wushan, Linley is a scion of the Baruch clan, the clan of the once-legendary Dragonblood Warriors. Their fame once shook the world, but the clan is now so decrepit that even the heirlooms of the clan have been sold off. Tasked with reclaiming the lost glory of his clan, Linley will go through countless trials and tribulations, making powerful friends but also deadly enemies.

  Come witness a new legend in the making. The legend of Linley Baruch.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/][I Shall Seal The Heavens, by Er Gen]] - My current favourite xianxia. Both the original Chinese and the translation are the best of the best. The main character in this novel is Meng Hao, a failed scholar who's abducted into the Reliance Sect - a sect of immortal cultivators. In this world, strength rules above all. Cultivators take in the energy of heaven and earth to build their strength, going through various stages on their paths to immortality.

Official Descritpion:

#+begin_quote
  If I want something, the Heavens better have it. If I don't want something, the Heavens better not have it! This is a story which originates between the eighth and ninth mountains, a world in which “My fate is to seal the Heavens like a demon!” “I Shall Seal the Heavens” is a new novel from Qidian's Er Gen. It tells the story of a scholar named Meng Hao, who enters the world of cultivation and slowly undergoes great change of character, eventually becoming an old eccentric. Overall, the story is not depressing like “Beseech the Devil (Qiu Mo 求魔),” but Meng Hao does have some of Wang Lin's rebelliousness and Su Ming's stubbornness. If I want something, the Heavens better have it. If I don't want something, the Heavens better not have it!
#+end_quote

Improved Description by Deathblade, the translator:

#+begin_quote
  I Shall Seal the Heavens is currently one of the most popular xianxia stories in China. It is about a failed young scholar named Meng Hao who gets forcibly recruited into a Sect of Immortal Cultivators. In the Cultivation world, the strong prey on the weak, and the law of the jungle prevails. Meng Hao must adapt to survive. And yet, he never forgets the Confucian and Daoist ideals that he grew up studying. This, coupled with his stubborn nature, set him on the path of a true hero. What does it mean to “Seal the Heavens?” This is a secret that you will have to uncover along with Meng Hao!
#+end_quote

I Shall Seal The Heavens is not currently finished, but it has more than 500 chapters currently translated, and Deathblade hasn't missed a day without a chapter for as long as I've been following the novel. If you're going to read only one of my recommendations, read this one. Seriously, it's great.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/][Against The Gods, by Mars Gravity]] - The One Punch Man of xianxia. It takes the common tropes, turns them up to eleven and just has fun with it. Yun Che is the main character, a boy hunted by all the great sects on his home continent, the Azure Cloud continent, for want of a great treasure that found itself in his hands. Not willing to let the sects gain the treasure, Yun Che instead decides to take the treasure with him to his grave. But, after dying on the Azure Cloud continent, he awakes on the Profound Sky continent, with the memories and body of a 16 year old cripple who shared the same name.

Official Description:

#+begin_quote
  Wielding the sky poison pearl, receiving the blood of an evil god, cultivating the strength to oppose heaven, a lord overlooking the world!
#+end_quote

My second favourite xianxia currently, mostly because of the great character interactions. Yun Che is a womaniser who gets into large amounts of trouble due to his stubborn nature and unforgiving attitude. But, be warned, he's in no way a good person. Don't read it if you like your main characters to follow your morals. It currently has 400 chapters translated at a quality somewhere in between CD and ISSTH.

So, there's a few of my recommendations for those interested in trying out the genre of xianxia. If you enjoy these, feel free to ask me for more recommendations and join us over at [[/r/noveltranslations]].


** So, the thing about the xianxia genre is that it's extremely homogenized. Xianxia as a genre has basically gone through the Moloch grinder and traded off a WHOLE lot of values to pursue a weird, ruthless quality of storytelling that I don't see anywhere else. For this (and other reasons), I find the Xianxia genre really interesting, both on its own merits and partially as a case study.

Basically, in Xianxia settings, magic is scarce. To get better at magic you need to consume large amounts of magical materials and use them to upgrade your physical form, and competition over nonrenewable magic materials leads to every practitioner being incredibly, incredibly ruthless. In Xianxia, the BASELINE for survival is to either be Mad-Eye or Quirrellmort; Harrys and Hermiones can't survive in that competitive world. A common trope is 'if you want to live happy, stay mortal. If you want to LIVE FREE no matter what, pursue magic.'

In that sense, it's not that Xianxia isn't rational. The problem with Xianxia in the context of [[/r/Rational][r/Rational]] is that it doesn't work like most stories. In most stories, because the author has prematurely closed off logical routes of story development due to various reasons, applying logic to those stories EXPANDS the field of development and enables more diverse stories. In Xianxia, it's the opposite; cruel logic has been applied to the extreme to create settings bereft of the human element, and making those stories more 'rational' is just a change in quantity, not quality. In other words, adding Rational elements to Xianxia doesn't diversify the scope of possible stories- it narrows it even further.

What Xianxia as a genre needs is more personal development and diverse motivations and actual characters that are not Literally Voldemort. Seriously. Holy fuck I am so sick of reading about Xianxia 'protagonists' who in a different story would literally be the BBEG. More ruthlessness and cunning is NOT what Xianxia needs, it has WAY TOO MUCH OF THAT ALREADY.

Edit: AND ENDINGS! Xianxia stories need to FUCKING HAVE AN ENDING! There are way too many long runners which don't have endings and just pile on dimension-rending existential enemy after dimension-rending existential enemy! "It's basically anti-spirals all the way down" is one description I've used before.

You may enjoy the first story arc of [[https://scryatranslations.wordpress.com/my-disciple-died-yet-again/][My Discipline Died Yet Again]]. The main character is a female computer programmer from our world, and the typical xianxia MC is a different character whose OPness is a product of a bug in the system that the programmer needs to fix.

It's actually pretty good.

********* It sounds similar to the Japanese series Hero Union BBS (Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban) WN/LN/[[http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/hero-union-bbs-r12956][Manga]]

I have read some of the translations of My Disciple Died Yet Again, and will probably catch back up one of these days. The MCish character reminds me a lot of Yun Che because of his ever-expanding harem and the YY protags in general because he never seems to find fault in his own actions.

Thankfully the actual MC girl of the series is immune to his charm and has her own romantic interest.

*** What's strange to me that the current crop Xianxia seems to be so much less sophisticated story-wise than even the Wuxia stories of decades ago. Jin Yong's novels have them all beat in terms in prose, diversity of characters, and development arcs that are emotionally moving. The only thing Xianxia has going for it is turning the power level up to eleven, even if that utterly breaks worldbuilding.

**** My amateur armchair anthropologist wants to ascribe it to the relatively recently-formed divide between Wuxia and Xianxia. The 'respectable' bits of chinese fantasy stayed in Wuxia, and Xianxia instead split off, transformed from a legitimate literary genre into a societal stress-relief mechanism, and lost all literary merit in the process.

I've read Coiling Dragon (good uptil halfway, then fell off) and I Shall Seal the Heavens (pretty good so far), but neither can be considered rational. They're the literature equivalent of junk food.

OP, I think [[/r/fantasy]] may be a better place, and they already have a few recommendation threads along these lines.

*** Just chiming in to add that I don't find this genre remotely rational in the least at all. It can be entertaining to read one of these (I'd recommend ISSTH myself) but I quickly discovered that all of them are essentially identical.

Recently however I have discovered and have been reading My Disciple Died Yet Again which, as a parody of the Xianxia genre and starring a female protagonist, has been hugely amusing to me.

** They're not strictly rational, but ISSTH at least might appeal to a number of people here. The main character is moderately rational, and the world has a sort of alien logic to it that I've found interesting so far. I would note that it took me a few chapters to not dismiss it out of hand, but the writing isn't as weak as it initially appears. It also has a kind of unselfconscious bombast to it that I find entertaining.
