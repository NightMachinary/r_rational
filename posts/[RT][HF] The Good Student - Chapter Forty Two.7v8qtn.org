  “What kind of ending is that?” cried Fanny.

  “The kind of ending you get when you take three years finding a cure,” said Davo. “What do expect with terrible service like that? That's why we guarantee same-day delivery.”

Oh Davo, never change.

On a more serious note, I honestly cannot tell if Fanny is blindingly brilliant, or a complete idiot when it comes to common sense. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

** Weaponized protagonism. This story's demons are really something different.

  “Were you the princess?” asked Fanny. It was what Davo had been wondering, but he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer.

  “No. I told you, she was very ugly. Do you think I'm ugly?”

The Librarian is fascinating. I love how she drops hints about her otherworldly nature, nudges the conversation into such direct questions, then shoots them down with some prosaic counter-questions.

  “But you are fragile things. You wear down and wear out. It is both your strength and your weakness. You have so little time to achieve your ambitions, it makes you unstoppable. Yet, your desire to shed your skin makes it easy to tempt you into new clothes.”

I love this quote.

** Are the demons still invading through the school? I thought when Nic sucked the demon dry the door would not be able to open? Anyway, I'm not very convinced the Librarian's correct - this seems like the perfect time for Nic and Dizzy to work together and bicker about leadership later, after the whole demons invading their world threat is dealt with.

*** Through the school or through the other site as well. There's bound to be subversion of the Librarian/demon's plans at some point because things seem to be going way too well for them. Thematically the Librarian's expectation that they won't be able to work together almost feels like foreshadowing that it /will/, or at least is supposed to for plot reasons. Let alone with Davo charging in as a potential third "Hero"?

*** I think the requirements for the door were fulfilled, but the demon who was to influence nick into doing that was absorbed. So the door is open, but Nic has gained power. It will probably feature in whatever showdown he's supposed to engage in now.

**** Hmm, that makes sense. I wonder if the Librarian predicted Nic would absorb the demon's power or if he did something unexpected again. The conversation between Nic and the demon a couple chapter's back seemed to imply he managed to change its nature which is supposed to be impossible.

** Forty-two chapters in, and I'm /still/ not sure how the magic system of this story's supposed to work. The author's got the art of writing things that are infuriatingly vague down pat, I guess.
