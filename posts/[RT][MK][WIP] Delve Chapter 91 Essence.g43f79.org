** Huh, surprised Rain didn't immediately figure out that channel mastery is getting the xp for the mana that it reduces.

Velocity at 100% for a minute is 600 mana. At 90% its 540 mana, so 60 mana saved by channel = 60 xp. At 80% is 480 mana, so 120 mana saved is 120 xp.

*** That's true but you have to see it from his viewpoint. It's ridiculously counter-intuitive for him to gain /more/ exp when he spends /less/ mana on his skills. In a game that would be considered a glitch. But he isn't in a game but rather an alternate world.

He'll probably figure it out sooner or later, but for now his assumptions will get in the way.

** It's too bad Rain doesn't know calculus, he would've figured out that it's almost time to switch to training sync instead (assuming his initial training predictions were both off by the same amount).

- Effective Strength = (Base + Tolerance) * Sync

Writing that as symbols:

- E = TS

Taking the derivative with respect to time:

- dE/dt = T dS/dt + S dT/dt

He can only train one of them at a time, so the formula has two options:

- dE/dt = 47(0/day) + 0.24(5/day)
- dE/dt = 47(0.02/day) + 0.24(0/day)

Solving:

- dE/dt (Tolerance training) = 1.2/day
- dE/dt (Sync training) = 0.94/day

For reference, sync training before the tolerance training would have given a predicted 0.56 points per day. Assuming that he doesn't change his predicted relative rate of gains, he should switch over when (Base + Tolerance) = 60, so he's about halfway there now.

*** After he gets out of the hole, the optimization becomes more complicated since he will no longer be concentrating on strength alone. If he wants to use his ring to boost multiple attributes, he has to take into account that the ring has a total boost cap (287), so at some point that cap makes it more rewarding to increase sync than tolerance, because increasing sync does not require any additional boost points in order to increase the effective attribute, whereas improving the tolerance only increases the effective attribute if additional ring points are allocated to the attribute.

It may seem like 287 is a big number and that is not a concern for now, but if you consider that Rain already has 200 points of tolerance in Clarity and Focus alone, it could be a concern soon. Especially if he finds a use for very high effective focus or clarity, in which case he could probably quickly train the tolerance above 287 total between those attributes alone. Then if he wants to increase a non-mental effective attribute, his only choices would be to increase sync for that attribute or reduce ring points allocated to focus or clarity.

** Oh snap, did Rain just turn into a Wuxia Cultivator?

Essence is the power of the 'soul', and he can improve his soul through expending EXP. Rain is already stronger in his soul than other people of his level, as noted by the Watch's truthtelling ability.

Rain's most recent development arc is the difference between stats and potential, and how you can raise up potential, then later raise up stats. It sounds like he's going to (eventually) take it to the meta level and do that with his soul -eg level cap. That's completely setting breaking. I guess it explains how the Majistraal (and everyone else) used to be orders of magnitude more powerful in the past.

Still, it's amusing that he's (eventually) going to figure out how to raise his level cap... by sitting and meditating. Effectively a wuxia cultivator.

Also find it amusing that people on royal road hate this chapter so much and call it filler. Last week, I joked that the story was about Rain sitting down and doing math and that it was the best part of the story, but it really is. Crazy that they think it's filler, while I think this is potentially one of the most important chapters in the story.

Readers on RoyalRoad have... interesting tastes. A lot of the top stories on the site are just trash - as in clearly written with little to no forethought and sometimes very little writing skill. Basically: "your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer".

(And RoyalRoad is /also/ the home to some excellent amateur fiction that clearly has a lot of effort and thought put into it, just to be clear.)

Hah, just wait until next week, they might get even more pissed. All the buildup just turns into him getting a fucking pet. And for a moment you think the pet is somehow gonna be a secret to him leveling up somehow like maybe he can level up pets. Nope, just a fucking pet that Rain finds cute.. It almost made me cancel my Patreon subscription. I'm 8 chapters ahead and nothing OP has come out of this little session. I like the math and detail in delve, but much of it is starting to seem self-serving. Its math and numbers for the sake of numbers. But none of it is playing into the story heavily.

1. Rain seems to have gotten no advantage from his heavy use of math. Someone not knowing any math could copy his exact build specs. No one chooses to do so, because its mostly a horrible build for an adventurer.
2. Rain has not discovered anything new or interesting due to math or munchkinry. In fact, without his armor and gear, he'd be horribly underpowered for his level because he chose a highly specialized build path. Doing something like Amelia's build and diverse skill set probably would have been way more useful for him.

Not. He needed to get the language fast. He needed to get the XP fast. He would be horribly underleveled for the stuff he does right now with other builds.

He also gets a lot of friends because he can fill their mana.

This is literally the one build that let him, as a noob, rise to where he is right now. And because this is a story, it's the build that allows him to beat his future challenges, because he is unique and can do stuff that others can not. Instead of being "the chosen one" and having some OP power, he is working with the same system everyeone else is.

I think we know that now in hindsight. How the hell could he have known these things when he chose his build? That undermines a bit of the rationalist premise for the story. He stumbled onto a decent build for a transmigrator.

A dynamo focused on straight-up magic spells rather than auras might have also been a deadly combination. It's clear the dynamo aspect of his build is what allows him to get so many XP points so quickly.

He had no way of figuring out a good class anyway. Sometimes you just have to do decisions without full knowledge of stuff and of course that fits a rationalist story.

He needs to keep minmaxing his shit and learn more. It's not a prebuilt class and he could fuck it up too, as the resources (skillpoints) are limited.

And he would have needed to get something intelligence related obviously if the story was going to be about a smart dude.

I would feel like immolate and refrigerate would make the rock brittle and he could also try to purify rocks as well. He might also train at the same time as well and it might improve his soul strenght....

He's only got five days of food (less since I don't think he accounted for exercise), and with his new exp exploit (708k in day, which is ridiculously faster than previously), the story would simply fall apart if he could gain a dozen levels in a week.

Still, there's a lot of stuff it can be useful for until he figures it out. All the non-level fuzzy stuff seems to scale with it. But if he can start to break down some of the RPG-ness of the system, he can get all sorts of benefits without a strict level increase.

He should be able to easily get 20x that, if he figures it out. Refrigerate, Extend, Amplify = 450 mana/s. Channel 1% to bring it down to 4.5/s, and alternate 1:2 Refrigerate:Winter to keep his mana up. Instead of 8.2 XP/sec, he'd be averaging 150 XP/s (from one-third of 450/s from Refrigerate).

He could get ~650/s if he /really/ tried, though. Refrigerate, extend, amplify, focus = 1350 mana/s * 0.01 channel (reduces it to 9-10 DPS), with possible flipflopping with Immolate to deal with the mageburn. Alternate offensive aura use with Winter singularities ~1:1 for sustainability, and he's good.

Now I want Velika get him a Blue and tell him to only come back when he's capped again. Heck, he might even surpass Carten's bets if that happens.
