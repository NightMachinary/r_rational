Here's how time travel works in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][/Branches on the Tree of Time/]] (and how it /should/ work in the Terminator series, except that they didn't think it through as much as they should have, and it looks like /Terminator: Genisys/ is going to invalidate at least part of it):

- Time travel creates a new timeline.
- Timelines can be logically arranged into a binary tree.
- The time machine does a cut + paste of a slice of three-dimensional space, but does not actually move on its own.

/Branches/ was sort of a naive exploration of what those rules mean. There are only two real players in the game - Skynet and the rebels. Both sides can duplicate themselves, and cooperate with future versions of themselves, but there are only two sides, and the battle (while high-stakes) is not terribly complex given that there are only two factions.

Let's say that a large corporation opens up shop in downtown Chicago. Castle Solutions will, for a small fee, send anything you want back in time however far you'd like to send it. All you need to give them is a set of GPS coordinates and a time, and whatever it is you want to send back. For /reasons/, the government did not come in and immediately take control, nor did anyone declare war.

*The question is this;* what does society look like as a result? This is not a case of a single entity having access to time travel. This is /everyone/ having access to time travel, a thick tree of timelines that result from long causal chains.

There isn't just one resultant world. There are a ton of them. There are timelines where time travel only seems to work about a tenth of the time on average, and timelines where time travel seems to work more and more poorly the further into the past the time traveling object or person comes from. What are the distinct and interesting "areas" of the binary tree? What does society look like there?

Note: I am not asking for exploits. If you have them, that's fine. What I'm looking for is what /society/ looks like given those exploits, which is something that I think a lot of time travel stories seem to miss because they only involve a single time traveling entity who is usually working alone and in secret.

(My National Novel Writing Month novel the first year I did it (2010) involved this sort of world. Practically nothing of that novel was salvagable, save for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZ5xBiQhyBy7iCgt1P7PHq8EuoHZvtU0bUd4qBlj3aw/edit?usp=sharing][this short story]], which is ... early work, let's call it, but not so early that I'm totally ashamed of it.)


** I dispute your interpretation of Terminator canon! (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Societies in this setting(s?) are under /staggering/ evolutionary pressure toward maximizing their timeline's "reproduction". Assuming a fair amount of variation, as random individuals create the first few timelines, the vast majority of creation is in the highest stable state of constant world-creation.

I'm actually not sure what that /is/. Religious/ideological/philosophical fanaticism seems like the obvious answer, but it actually seems quite hard for that sort of thing to create a Singleton. On the other hand, too much "selfish" timetravel to create a private world might not be self-perpetuating enough..

Three scenarios come to mind. One, an ever-expanding Time Empire that "invades" timelines before the invention of timetravel and conquers them with advanced future knowledge to use as a staging-ground for more "invasions". Two, a world rapidly depopulated as the poor flock to a device that can literally promise to make /anyone/ a rich man; the single timetraveller in most worlds doesn't really change the timeline much beyond living in luxury, and they eventually fall victim to the same depopulation. Three, a world where timetravel is tightly regulated/underutilized, and only used in obscure industrial applications - which of course spawn near-identical worlds, and appear to work 50% of the time for the same reason quantum stuff does (it only worked in half the timelines.)

*** Colonizing the past is expensive, even if the time travel is free. It means leaving behind anyone that you care about, unless you can convince them to go with them. It means losing contact with the industrial base of your present timeline, even if you think that you can rebuild and get it back. It's dangerous, because your body isn't adapted to life there, and the medicine and expertise necessary to negate those problems is expensive. It's also dangerous because of the people there (unless you're going way, way back) which means that you need defenses, which costs money.

Still, you're right that there are going to be lots of people who will want to go back in time anyway, and that there will be a depopulation effect. This means that there will be a time expedition economy for all those people who want to make a buck off those who want to go back to Edo Japan or Enlightenment-era England - period-appropriate costumes, language training, technology, etc.

While there is a depopulating effect from temporal emigration, there's a good chance that there's also a /populating/ effect from temporal /immigration/. If people want to go back to the past so that they can exploit it, why wouldn't people from the future come back to our present to exploit it?

For a long time I was trying to create a setting that incorporated all of this, and never quite got there when I was writing my NaNo 2010 novel. There were immigrants from the future living side-by-side with people preparing for expeditions to the past, and writers whose best books had already been imported from the future before they were written. But I don't think I got the full way there.

Why bother doing any colonizing? If you have access to this sort of time travel technology, it seems like it would be the easiest thing in the world to just go back a decade or two, and use whatever knowledge / technology you bring with you to the live the high life. It would be easy to quietly make a lot of money from lotteries, stock predictions etc, or if you're not content to just live a quietly luxurious life, you could get to be the most important person on Earth by revealing the existence of time travel, and sharing (for a fee of course) the future knowledge you brought with you.

***** Some people would do that, certainly. It would be a balance between difficulty and rewards - wanting to be able to fit in, having maximal comfort, avoiding local authorities.

But for some other people, it would be a yearning for a bygone era - a belief that colonial America or medieval Ireland is where they belong (with a healthy amount of advantages). I imagine that a fair number of people would jump at the chance to live in some other time and place instead of the present.

As I had originally conceived the setting, it was an open question how much of history had been influenced by time travel, and this was a topic of rampant in-universe speculation. Anyone who had played the markets a little too well, anyone who won the lottery, prolific authors, recluses, all of them fell under suspicion. And then part of the joke was that the world looked a lot like ours, and while we can be sure that Warren Buffett isn't a time traveler, they would have to have some doubts.

******** Interesting to think about successful authors, and generally the intellectual property implications of all this. How to deal with intellectual property of all kinds showing up from the future? It seems absurd to have this kind of stuff do anything but go into the public domain, since no currently existing people, even those who would have eventually created it, would have any real claim to it. However, this would make such material very cheap compared to works that had to actually be written, and thus copyrighted. So you'd probably see the collapse of the whole system.

A great replacement would be to give prizes for certain accomplishments. Say you offer $10 million for whoever comes up with a certain desirable technology. If someone invents it, great, they get the money. However, it also creates an incentive for time travelers from the future to bring you the technology you want and take the free money. This would be great for directing temporal visitors to more productive ends, since they'd have an easy way that actually benefits the host society.

Of course once that sort of thing gets started, I'm not sure where it ends. In later iterations you might have crowds of time travelers banging on your door the moment you set up each prize.

Really being able to get information from the future is a kind of singularity. Once that becomes available, it's tough to explain why we wouldn't almost immediately have access to all the secrets of the universe. Maybe we're too early in the universe iteration cycle?

********* Creative IP would move to alternate revenue streams. You don't sell the album, you sell the concert. You make pay-what-you-want downloads. You set up a Patreon. Proving that it's actually original is an issue, especially for something like a book where the author can't really give any proof of skill, but I think you'd see things like painters live-streaming their creation process. Branding would become a lot more important, since your brand would be almost the entirety of how you compete against future products.

Industrial IP would basically be worthless though. There'd be nothing to stop Samsung from reverse-engineering Apple's twentieth generation phone and then claiming the work as their own, aside from maybe some legal protections of some kind paired with proof-of-work embedded into the design (and that wouldn't work very well, since you would retroactively scrub it clean in most universes even if you were caught by your competitors in a first iteration timeline).

Prizes are a great idea to attract future travelers.

And yes, you run headlong into the singularity if you're in one of the timelines where you get lots of distant future information. I think the setting I am most interested in writing about had time travel introduced five years ago and is forty years ahead on tech (and accelerating fast, mostly held back by the complex production lines that need to be set up and the warring incentives).

********** I guess the question is what the farthest point in the future they are getting information from is. Is the present day time agency part of a universe dominating bureaucracy that extends into the far future? If not, it must have some frontier that it it's not receiving more information past. This could have to do with the organization no longer existing after that point, or something to do with how far in the cycle of iterations we are.

As for technology, what does the iterated fastest possible progression of technological expansion look like? I could imagine a deflationary effect, since if next year's gadgets will be so hugely better, why not save up and buy something then? On the other hand, this could be counteracted by the blazing fast economic expansion that would come from these sorts of productivity gains.

If we're getting 8 years of technological growth per year, productivity growth and thus economic growth will accelerate similarly. The world will be getting very rich very fast. Lots of companies popping up from nothing to gigantic overnight (only most started by time travelers).

Despite the growth it's presumably a very scary and uncertain time. It may be sort of 'so far, so good' in terms of truly scary types coming out of the future, but immigrants from the future are already taking control of more and more of the economy, and everyone has seen people leaving to move into our own past. Plus people probably won't be sure about this whole time travel based police panopticon concept that the government managed to role out a day after the invention of time travel due to aid from the future. If it's been 5 years, the few elections that have been held post-time travel must have been pretty interesting. Can you model how foresight would effect election results?

** Some griefer destroys humanity. No more society.

Assuming Castle Solutions solves this problem well enough to stay in business and people can't go back personally:

- Someone will kill Hitler within the first day. Locate, send back a time bomb, done. Antisemitism in the 50s and subsequent few decades is heightened compared to today without a giant pogrom.
- Someone will start ferrying technology and geologic resource maps back in time. People develop Windows language packs for Egyptian, Luwian, and Phoenician.
- Since we don't have a written language available for the Americas or Australia in antiquity, they'll get shafted again. Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China will win out technologically. Early Celtic tribes in the British Isles will get peppered with technological artifacts that have operating instructions written only in modern English thanks to stupid people.
- Someone will develop an autonomous recording drone that stores its data durably for future generations. History as a discipline explodes, insofar as it is still possible with what's happening to the timeline.
- People quickly realize that sending objects backwards tends to overwrite history, resulting in a much different set of people existing. At that point, they will lobby for Castle Solutions to restrict its maximum displacement in time to, say, ten years. Possibly with some exceptions for non-intrusive scientific research.
- Even so, you get any technology advances that you can develop within ten years. But you have to retrieve ten years' advances, understand them, and then develop the next advance, all within ten years. (If Castle Solutions is above the law, this restriction doesn't apply.)
- You can use time travel to duplicate items. Need a second Hope Diamond? Have Castle ship it to you yesterday. Unless you've received one from them, in which case you go about your business. This reduces scarcity for physical items -- at least for compact, high-value items. The diamond industry crashes. Peer-to-peer electronics sharing becomes widespread.
- Homework becomes useless. People do it whenever, possibly years after it's due, and send it back in time to themselves. Then they submit the assignment without having done the requisite readings. In-class assignments and tests take over.
- A new intelligence technique emerges: kidnap a suspect (possibly in broad daylight), torture them into confessing, and send the report back in time. It doesn't work terribly well, but the intelligence community is (privately) enthusiastic about the idea.
- Recalls (for drugs, toys, cars, etc) become retroactive; a company gets a message from itself, possibly countersigned by a government authority, saying that it can't release the product.
- When a serious communicable disease first occurs, we trace it to its origin and prevent it from happening.
- Stock markets need to be heavily altered.
- Put your foot in your mouth at the party? Send yourself a reminder to be more careful.

Just to start, imagine how the world would look three thousand years from now. Turn that into today. Double it. That's your background. Ongoing object-only time travel doesn't have a hugely noticeable impact on most people's daily lives. It does have a huge impact, but it's not one that people will think about that often. When they do, it will be somewhere between helpful and burdensome, depending on the situation, but it will be intended to make their life better.

As for your story, that seems about right. But it was kind of stupid of the murderer to send the body to that place and time. Had he sent it to the heart of the Yellowstone supervolcano, or the heart of a wildfire, or a hundred years further back in time, he might have gotten away with it.

*** It's clear that society would put some regulations on time travel from the future, but not really clear to me what those regulations would be. There are legal problems with a person using time travel to duplicate themselves, and economic problems with duplicating materials (though there are game theory considerations there - you can send the Hope Diamond back to "yourself", but now there's one timeline where you have two Hope Diamonds and one where you have none, and Hope Diamonds have to have decreasing marginal value). There are also societal problems with people abandoning the present for the past - by, say, racking up a bunch of debt first and then leaving their debt behind.

Overwriting history isn't really a problem (for most people) since the timelines coexist (but do not interact) with each other. I'm sure there are some narcissistic people who don't want there to be a universe where they don't exist though.

I wouldn't create a new universe full of people just to fix a mistake I've made. I don't see a value in vastly inflating the number of people in order to increase the average living conditions.

Is there some negative value in creating a new universe full of people? I mean, if the expenditure of resources to you is essentially nothing, and you (or a version of you) gets some benefit from it, does the incidental creation of a new universe with effective duplicates of everyone represent a disincentive?

You can't improve your past, but you can often improve your present by being the sort of person that routinely gives aid to their past self. If you were the sole holder of the time machine, you could either be the sort of person who sends their past self a lottery ticket, and thus is likely to receive a lottery ticket from the future, /or/ you can be the sort of person who sees no benefit in helping someone who is not you, and thus never receive a lottery ticket from the future. (A world with commonplace time travel probably runs their lottery in a way that precludes this specific example from happening.)

** I'm not following how Castle Solutions stay in business with just inanimate objects...

Say Alice decides to send back lotto numbers...

1.0: Alice1.0 sends back in time lotto numbers. After fees she loses 100 bucks.

1.1: Alice1.1 gets lotto numbers, much to her surprise, and becomes super rich because of it. Alice1.1 decides to send some of her excess money to the past.

1.11: Alice1.11 gets a huge stack of money, much to her surprise.

What incentive does Alice1.0 have in sending the lotto numbers back in time if she knows it will never directly benefit Alice1.0? Alice1.0 spends money so that Alice1.1 benefits. Alice1.1 sends money back in time at no benefit to herself.

From the perspective of timeline 1.0, all Castle Solutions does is provide a strange way of permanently destroying an object. It stays in business mostly by shunting nuclear waste into transdimensional space. As for society? Timeline 1.0 is not enriched by having time travel be a thing at all. Timeline 1.1 is only enriched by Alice becoming rich.

Additionally, if all instances of time travel creates a new branch on a tree, then every single instance of time travel creates a new branch were ONLY one "receiving object from the future" event can occur.

If Bob is next in line behind Alice in Timeline 1.0 and he sends back lotto numbers, you will have:

Timeline1.1 where Alice receives lotto numbers.

Timeline1.2 where Bob receives lotto numbers.

But could you have Timeline1.3 where Alice and Bob both receive lotto numbers? Because in order for Timeline1.3 to exist then Bob will need to time-travel INTO the branch where Alice receives lotto numbers; instead of making an new branch.

This is a game theory question.

Let's say that you and I run competing businesses. You run Singleton Industries, which has the following policy:

#+begin_quote
  Never send anything backwards in time, unless there's need for a roundabout way of destroying an object, which will almost never be the case.
#+end_quote

I run Plurality United, which has the following policy:

#+begin_quote
  Always send as much information back in time as feasible. Just reams and reams of it. If we ever get information from the future, send that back to the past too. Set aside a certain budget for this, and keep doing it even if there's no benefit.
#+end_quote

Singleton Industries beats Plurality United in Timeline 1.0. Plurality United beasts Singleton Industries in /every other timeline/. By having their stated policy, Plurality United ensures that it is almost certainly going to end up in a timeline where it receives help from the future. By having this policy (and importantly, following through with it even if they /don't/ receive help from the future) Plurality United can act on trends that haven't happened yet, they can complete month-long design processes overnight and with practically zero cost, and they never have to issue a recall because they can get defect reports before the product is on the assembly line.

Maybe you stick to your guns and say "No, I'm never going to send anything back to my past self, because that's not /me/ and /I/ don't have any benefit". But it seems to me like the vast majority of the time, you're going to wind up missing out.

  Additionally, if all instances of time travel creates a new branch on a tree, then every single instance of time travel creates a new branch were ONLY one "receiving object from the future" event can occur.

In a binary tree (which is the best representation of this), branches can have branches. So yes, Alice makes 1.1 and Bob makes 1.2, but you can have multiple receptions. For example:

- 1.0 - Alice sends lotto numbers backwards in time.
- 1.1.0 - Alice gets lotto numbers. Alice sends money backwards in time, but to a point /after/ she received the lotto numbers.
- 1.1.1.0 - Alice gets lotto numbers. Alice gets money. Alice sends money backwards in time, but to a point /after/ she received the money.
- 1.1.1.1 - Alice gets lotto numbers. Alice gets money. Alice gets money again. Alice sends money backwards in time, but to a point /after/ she received the second batch of money.

Every period there is a branching point, but from Alice 1.1.1.1's perspective, she's been the beneficiary of three distinct "receiving object from the future" events.

**** Hmm, if you put it that way it makes alot more sense. So time essentially branches whenever someone RECEIVES something from the future. Thus Alice1.1.1.1 benefits from three "receiving events". So if Alice1.1.1.1 sends money back in time to before she receives lotto numbers, that creates essentially an Alice1.2.

If Alice1.1.1.1 sends money back from after the lotto numbers but BEFORE the first batch of money she creates Alice1.1.2

And if she sends money back after she receives the 2nd batch of money she makes Alice1.1.1.1.1.

So if Alice and Bob both send money back in time, you could have timeline 1.1.2 where Alice receives money, then Bob receives money. Or 1.2.1 where Bob receives money, then Alice receives money. All on a consistent timeline.

On a wider scale that means in some timeline "time travel" doesn't work and is the really expensive pet project of some eccentric company. In another timeline only a handful of "receiving events" happen, and in other timelines it's just an endless chaotic mess, where fortunes change overnight and every other person has a time traveling terminator out to kill them.

And I agree with your argument about Plurality United benefiting the most. So even if you were being 100% selfish and did not care about alternate reality versions of Plurality United, by upholding a policy of "always send back in time" you raise the possibility that present Plurality United will benefit from being the receiver of future Plurality United information.

In lieu of this new information, Singleton Industries will be adopting a new policy of sending terminators back in time to kill off Plurality United founders.

** A major economic problem is going to be people taking out loans and/or committing crimes, and then escaping into another timeline to avoid the consequences. If they go back to a relatively recent period, information sharing among the timecops of different eras can shut them down after only getting away with it for one iteration. However, what about escaping deeper into the past? The timecops can't just do a routine infodump to deal with it, because there's no one on the other end to receive the information. However, the future timecops would still like to do whatever they can to hurt the escaping criminal, in order to discourage more people from doing the same thing.

So imagine you know that someone has jumped from your timeline to whatever period in the past. How do you get to them? You'd want to send something back in time to before they were scheduled to arrive, which would not effect history in any way unless it detected the arrival of that time traveler, to ensure they end up existing at all in the new timeline. If the time traveler does show up, whatever you send back needs to deliver whatever punishment is deemed appropriate. Thus, if you try to escape into the past, you can never be sure you're not on a later iteration, and thus there's a terminator or whatever already waiting for you back then.

On a similar note: how about the possibility of building a base in the deep past. Let's say in order to avoid disrupting things on Earth, you build a facility on the far side of the moon 1 billion years ago. By traveling back and forth between your home base and the human era, you can simulate a much more effective variety of time travel. Go through however many versions of human history you want, and then when you're done return to your home in the deep past moments after you left.

** I don't think I'd call the result a "civilisation". The amount of communication between timelines is effectively zero. Time-travellers can only come from the current future, which changes as soon as it arrives. As soon as you arrive somewhere, from your point of view the future that spawns you has ceased to exist. All you have of it - all you'll ever have - is what you're carrying on you.

When you arrive somewhere, the government will have no record of you (though it may know of your past self, who is a different person). Any identity papers you carry are easily-forged, since there's no way to corroborate them. Any debts you owe or crimes you've committed are instantly and completely forgotten. And of course, your friends and family in the future no longer exist.

This is obviously true if only criminals have time machines, but giving them to the police doesn't really help. If a fugitive jumps back in time, he's gone. Even if you follow him, you'll never end up in the same timeline as him. Of course, you can instead go back a few minutes and stop him from entering the time machine, but anyone who makes it to the portal has escaped from everyone forever.

And when he arrives carrying a small fortune in stolen goods, the time traveller is free to tell everyone a lovely story about a utopian future where diamonds are common as muck and the streets are paved with gold. Even if someone thinks he's lying, there's nothing that can be done to find out what his future was really like.

Okay, so let's say that you're the President of the United States. Someone invents time travel and posts the instructions online. The materials are cheap, so you can't constrain the materials, and it doesn't take a huge amount of knowledge to make one - anyone could do it in their garage.

Seconds after you get this urgent briefing, you get the alert that a laptop addressed to you just arrived from out of thin air in a secure location. It takes some investigation, but eventually security declares it safe to open (not by you, obviously) and your team looks inside.

It's from your future self, and details a list of policy proposals which he's enacted, and the rationale for them, along with the suggestion that you do the same. It also gives a comprehensive list of everything that happens in the future, and how to respond to it. It's not just /one/ future though, because your future self continued to get reports from /his/ future selves, and they got reports from /their/ future selves, so the list of what happens is a condensed-down-for-easy-reading map of everything that happened in a billion different futures, through to the next ten years.

What immediate instructions does your successor give you? What is in his report of the futures?

Edit: If you need to, imagine that your future self's very first piece of information is a way for you to identify yourself to yourself, and that you receive a second message from your future self which verifies that the information in the first message is 99.9999% genuine.

Edit 2: And if you're the sort of person who would just throw up their hands and say "lol, society is fucked" or "screw you guys, I'm moving to ancient times" assume for the sake of argument that you're not.

**** Well, I'd get a lot of data from testing out different policies in the real world. "We tried raising X tax and spending Y money, but it had the following unforeseen consequences.", that sort of thing. And I'd get some probability distributions on who my likely successor is and what the state of the world is likely to be at the end of my term.

It won't work for specifics. If there's a note saying "The Spider Clan is going to send ninjas to kidnap you at 8 am on 12/07/2045", there's no guarantee that's what will happen. The Spider Clan are probably also using time travel to refine their plans, and be using it to attempt millions of different attacks in millions of different timelines. That's only useful if the Spider Clan are already on their way and it's too late for them to change their plans. Maybe warn about that sort of thing a day ahead of time?

From the perspective of the timeline receiving the future data, what they've got is basically the output of a 100% accurate simulation of a single possible future branching out from the moment they received it. Easy to understand, though there is the question of why people send back data at all when it won't benefit them.

**** The main priority would be defending the timeline against incursions from the future. No need to worry about people leaving to go live in the past, they are effectively disappearing forever and can have no more effect on your timeline. On the other hand, there's always the chance of someone arriving from one of the many possible futures and causing trouble.

Now if they're serious enough of an invader, you're pretty much screwed. No policies you can enact will stop a post-singularity robot army from 1000 years in the future. So let's assume we're dealing with more ordinary future travelers. What do we have to change?

First thing: shut down lotteries and other forms of gambling as much as possible. No reason to give anyone who arrives in our timeline from the future those free resources. It might also be wise to start dismantling the stock market for similar reasons. Now that I think about it, you'd really need to switch to a radically different currency regime as well to prevent counterfeiting - presumably involving some sort of shift to an all electronic currency. No need to worry about duplication of valuable physical items, we can just let the market deal with that.

I like the closed loop policing in what you wrote so far. Clearly you'd want to get such a system up and running ASAP. Being the type of society that would help other timelines catch criminals who fled from your timeline would be helpful, since it's free and makes it more likely that you will get the same help from your own future. Plus, there's the deterrence factor of criminals knowing they can get away with something 'once', and then in subsequent timelines the authorities will know about the whole thing before they do.

It seems the big X-factor is technology. Along with information about likely events in the future, you'll also get access to a technological package that's been honed across the many iterations. Not sure if this will mean a sudden singularity, or some carefully planned rollout of new tech on an optimized schedule. Probably some of each depending on the timeline.

If a government did manage to get things under control post-time travel, there would probably be a move towards a much more planned society and economy. Who needs capitalism when you can just iterate 5 year plans until you're optimizing for whatever it is you want to optimize for? Meanwhile people who would chafe under such a regime are free to bail on the timeline and go into the pre-time travel past where their actions can't be regulated to create their own.

** The outcome depends on how the time machine redistributes anthropic weight (how much each resulting timeline is weighted in our utility function).

Option 1: Each timeline is weighted equally (then multiplied by its many-worlds probability). Having a time machine activated effectively doubles the anthropic weight of the timelines that have that machine in its causal past.

The universe falls into a malthusian trap. I would be very surprised if no student on Earth had ever fed 100 MB of random numbers into a file, renamed it dundundun.exe and ran it. (In fact, I'd place more than 5% on one of the readers having done something of the sort.) In 2^{-100000000} of that timeline's future, the resulting program was a UFAI that got its physics model exactly right and its anthropic weighting module as this scenario describes. It then, of course, proceeded to employ the fastest possible way of exponential replication of its timeline and took over pretty much all of the universes weight (as modelled by it, and us) in about 100002000 steps. (If its utility function happens to include something else it wants in its universes besides fastest possible replication, another UFAI overtakes it.)

Option 2: Timelines are weighted according to their many-worlds probability multiplied by 2^{-amount of time machine activations in their causal past}. Having a time machine activated conserves anthropic weight.

Anyone who wants their causal future to be made of 50% modified past + 50% unmodified present more than the 100% modified present it would get without the time machine, will want to increase the modified past's weight further and will thus repeatedly activate it in the same way, resulting in effectively option 3.

Option 3: Activating a time machine deletes the universe and replaces it with the time machine's target universe, save the transported material.

This one is interesting. A culture that finds the universe's laws working as described here and has its ethicists think this scenario to be true (but cannot build a time machine due to missing unobtainium) finally has the one time machine that can possibly be sent to a timeline with any anthropic weight (and surely /theirs/ has some, after all they're there!) appear (and on their planet, no less! Fermi paradox decided, no aliens exist.) with a little unobtainium, and the race to their world's destruction (through sending a time-machine with possibly a few survivors) or saving (through permanent disposal of the unobtanium) begins...

(I'm pretty sure that any utility function that calculates utility from diverging (never-to-communicate) timelines other than through a linear combination (where "weight" plays a role) can be dutch-booked, but not quite sure...)

** An average timeline: throughout history, time travelers from a variety of possible futures have arrived in what was their past, and is now your past. You are lucky enough to live in a timeline where humanity was not destroyed, and where there hasn't been a serious takeover attempt from the future. People have probably known time travel was a thing for all of history, and been receiving contradictory descriptions of the future for that long. As we get closer to this civilization being able to produce their own time machines, the number of time travelers increases, as visitors come back from what is now the timeline's near future, to visit and/or live in their own recent past. Time machine designs are probably introduced by one of these types well before anyone gets around to actually inventing it.

Time machine production starts. What tech level we're at at this point depends on the minimum possible tech level that you can build time machines at. Hoards of people start enacting time travel plans that they or their ancestors have been scheming for a long time. People exit the timeline, and start creating myriad more timelines with histories roughly like this one, but with one more time traveler in the mix. Others head to the future, and return along with the stream of travelers who originated in the future, coming back to the boom times of the first days of time travel.

On a more mutliversal level, I think you'd end up with some sort of wave front of histories where human development gets started earlier and earlier, as more and more time travelers / information dumps get sent back, accelerating progress more and more. Eventually you'd start reaching the origins of the human species, but you might even be able to push the evolution of intelligence earlier, by future generations interbreeding with past generations, and future genes propagating farther and farther into the past.

On a larger scale there would be a wavefront of human colonization of the universe, going farther and farther back towards the big bang, as travelers colonized earlier periods, and then those colonies grew and began producing colonists to still earlier periods.

** I'm not entirely clear on how time travel works. Suppose you send Alice back one second, wait a century, and then send Bob back one second. What happens?

A) A universe is created where Alice and Bob both arrive. Bob is left very confused as to how different the universe is even though he only went back one second.

B) The universe is destroyed the moment Alice goes back. Bob never arrives.

C) Two universes are created. Alice arrives in one and Bob arrives in the other.

I think A is the most similar to the Terminator stuff. Otherwise sending a human back to protect against the Terminator that got sent back wouldn't make any sense. In this case, the second timeline will change immediately because someone decided to send something back to the Big Bang. The Earth never forms, and everyone else just arrives in space and dies.

If they're a little more sensible with the time travel equipment and don't send anything back before life evolves, then humanity doesn't evolve and it only comes to exist due to time travellers. They might still all die out no groups have a large enough gene pool. On the other hand, there's probably a lot of people who will go back to see Jesus or something, so they'll all have each other.

In general, the later time travellers will arrive in a world where their destination is not what it was the first time around.

This arguably makes /less/ sense if you model time travel in Terminator any other way, because you're breaking the causal connection between the two events. It's also possible for a person to be mistaken about how time travel works, and for this model to appear as a stable time loop model.

Anyway, if you send Alice and Bob back like that you would end up with three distinct timelines that continue to exist in parallel. Timeline 1.1 and 1.2 branch off at Alice's arrival point, and Timeline 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 branch off at Bob's arrival point.

*** D) Independent of the time machine, every $TIME_QUANTUM a new universe is created, with identical initial conditions (except for the effects of time travelers). The time machine (which exists in all universes unless there is a reason for not inventing it, ever) can send matter to any universe with a later start time. I think this looks a lot like A, assuming you set the duration to the exact number of time quanta for Bob as for Alice. In this scenario, your target universe is not private, anyone else (including any universe between you and it) can target it. Also, if you send Alice, you're almost certain to receive an Alice as well.

E) Using the time machine creates a duplicate of the universe at time X and moves matter into it. In Universe 0 Alice disappears in a puff of greasy black smoke, never to be seen again. In Universe 1 to (infinity), Alice appears just in time to see herself disappear. Each of the infinite universes becomes universe 0 for Bob, where we do the same thing for over again, ending up with infinity**2 universes.

There's a lot of people you'll never see again because they time-traveled in a huff over an argument they wanted to win the second time around. Or because they left to find another version of a person who left them.
