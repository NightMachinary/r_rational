** Discovered Royal Road and am having my heart repeatedly broken by starting great stories and then finding they aren't finished yet. The ones I read that are actually good are /The Salamanders/ (not rational fic but great characterization and magic system) /Mother of Learning/, and /Eight/. (The last isn't rationalist but has an unusually practical protagonist). Started an awful lot of drivel before I found those gems.

Really looking for more protagonists that are pragmatic. Too many portal fantasy feature characters that are sucked into another world and instantly shout "Wee!" and dive into a deadly Dungeon full of Monsters. Or decide to Conquer the World or Become the Strongest in the World. Cultivation novels and urban fantasy seem to make a point of having the hero mouth off to stupidly powerful people or monsters. I know I'm supposed to be impressed with how they stick to their guns but I just think "You're an idiot".

What books are out there where the protagonist is..pragmatic? Picks attainable goals, doesn't behave recklessly, sucks up to the powerful when necessary?Now, "pragmatic" doesn't necessarily mean evil...I've asked this question elsewhere and got a plethora of villain protagonist suggestions. This is related to but not identical to "rationalist" as this community seems to define it. Some rationalist fiction features heroes that introduce rationalist scientific ideas to fantasy worlds, but some of those feature megalomaniacal and reckless characters who preach the idea of rationality.

Oh...English language fiction. I've learned I have to specify that now...I find most Japanese translations I find online unreadable.

You know, I was just thinking the other day that it could be interesting to see a Cultivation novel that really addresses this. It almost feels like by following their daos relentlessly and allowing no doubt, they're trading physical and spiritual strength for mental weakness. For any such setting to make sense, it has to be a genuine advantage - people who don't recklessly act like idiots genuinely can't progress.

So, what if you had a protagonist who tried to deal with this? Rather than having a secret bloodline or a ghost mentor hidden in a ring, they could have some spell or ability to temporarily make themselves just as foolhardy and reckless as everyone else, that's generally unknown because everyone with "authority" in the setting who comes across it sees it as a crutch that could only hold the user back - improbable in the real world, but less so in a setting that actively rewards pigheadedness.

You'd have a character who'd act rationally and try to put themselves in the best possible position, like any smart person... who then has to flip a switch to cultivate and fight, and pray they don't do anything too stupid before they turn it off.

As for your actual request... I've found Super Minion to be pretty great, along with RE: Trailer Trash. The former's set in a world opf superpowers, and is pretty great - the latter is more of a real-life Peggy Sue.

It's all the horrible trappings that come with it that I'm less a fan of - some make sense as being derived from a society where "Might makes Right" is more or less a physical law, but some's just pretty gnarly. As you say, IRL such attitudes are pretty damn fascist.

The protagonist just sat in a room meditating and reached various stages of cultivation or whatever, and the story let us know that this was supposed to be impressive, but just... ugh. I had absolutely /no/ emotional connection to this style of progression.

Anyway, your comment made me realize another problem I had with it: it was just /so/ every-person-for-themself, which just made me hate all the characters. If it's just going to be a power fantasy it should at least have wish fulfillment, right? But I got no enjoyment imagining myself in this place with those people.

That's unusual. Usually there is lots of kung fu fighting, martial arts tournaments, vendettas with spoiled nobles. The "Every Man For Himself" part is typical.

Generally I just don't care. A magic system where the only "magic" is improved karate chops and the prize at the end is to be the the baddest dog in the junkyard (and even that prize is a perpetually receding mirage).

I'm totally into books where the character improves himself...but just improving his physical strength isn't a kind of improvement I can get excited about.

I haven't been able to get into cultivation novels except by proxy (/Cradle/), so I am curious: do they emphasize the importance of the state the way fascists did? To [[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm][quote Mussolini]]:

No. Quite the opposite. That's not one of the fascist tendencies they have.

They come out as vaguely fascist to me because people influenced by fascism and lots of tin-pot dictators often talk a lot about "strength" as the be-all end all. If anything cultivation novels seem more like Hitler's brand of fascism with it's obsession with strong Aryan supermen, but I'm hesitant to make that comparison because the whole racism and genocide thing tends to overshadow everything else about Hitler.

It might be more precise to say it is vaguely Nietzschesque in it's obsession with individual strength and ruthlessness, and I tend to associate people getting over-emotional about over-simplified versions of Nietzsche's philosophies with crypto fascists.

If so, then the fascist ideology had some similarities -- "quality rather than quantity" and "the mightiest because the most ethical, the most coherent, the truest", to quote the same article -- but the context was different. Fascism valued "quality" and "mightiest" individuals because they were supposed to form the elite of the state and of the nation, which were seen as the pinnacle of human existence. In that they were similar to other "vanguard" movements of the 20th century, which valued individual strength only in the service of a "vanguard party", which, in turn, served a higher goal, be it race, nation or class. They had no use for a purely individualistic philosophy.

**** Devourer of Destiny was the pinnacle of cultivation novels, but it author took it down because they were getting too much shit for â€˜only' releasing once a day. Too much as in having dozens of people ordering them to write more, despite it being free. The main character was the old guy in the ring, using the people he taught to rise in power. Very much evil protagonist, but damn if it wasn't a good character. The PDF still exists somewhere, but the story is dead.

Journey of an Old Dreamer is a cultivation novel where the protagonist is actually moral. As in modern day morals, and not stupid as a brick. I lost interest in it, but I think it's still being written.

Cultivating Civilization was about a military guy who got sent to a cultivation world. No talent, no resources, no special powers. Builds his own army, and tries to strip the mysticism from cultivation. Was really great, but the author stopped writing. I think it was because of their reader's disappointment when the main character didn't suddenly become a god.

I Think cultivation novels are always going to be trash, not because they can't be done well, but because their community is going to ruin it.

That said the way the first was handled could be better. The where the MC accuses the system of trying to force him to the dark side then does it anyway.

I started /The Silver Mana/ - it's okay, but the idea that the MC is just so stubborn he manages to break some god-like security system by smashing it because he was told he couldn't get silver and gold mana rubbed me the wrong way. The dialog feels a bit stilted too, in part because the author doesn't use conjunctions, but also because they talk way too formally when they should basically be panicking.

I actually dropped /The Daily Grind/, which is a shame because I started out really liking it, because the MC seems to refuse to take the danger seriously and treats the whole thing like a game. He has a near death experience and goes "wow, that almost took my head off. I need to prepare better and take this seriously" and then next week we're back to him joking about some new creature's name and the sweet loot they're going to get while treating the office-maze like a game.

For example, after he did a few dungeon runs and started to get better gear, including body armor, I kept waiting for him to get some proper head protection, especially for his eye. Seriously, he has the cash, get some ski goggles or safety glasses or something. If you get a stapler in your hand of even face, you can walk that off. Get one in your eye and you're screwed. He never did, and would't you know it someone shoot pencil shavings or something in his face, blinding him. he manages to survive, and still doesn't get eye protection when he goes back!

I don't know, maybe I'll give it another shot later, but for now it's low on my list of things to read.

Anyways, for mass isekai, do you mean a party transported to another world with one main character, or several main characters transported to another world?

There's /Epilogue/ which is like a reverse-isekai - a bunch of teenagers were transported to another wold, fought evil, then came back after a few decades. Though they came back at the point they left, so they're physically teenager despite all the years that passed.

Maybe /Legend of Randidly Ghosthound/ (yes, the name is weird, but you get used to it after a hundred chapters or so), which is more of a "system transforms earth" story but given that earth's not really earth anymore but a mashed up planet connected to a multiverse it might as well be a new dimension. It's a LitRPG but pretty well written, though it leans heavily on the "MC getting a lucky break early on that makes him stronger and edgier than everyone else" trope.

There's /Displaced/ which has several characters transported to another world and getting superpowers. It's pretty good, though the author made the mistake of having the first dozen of so chapters be only about one guy, so it skewed the series to seem like he was the only MC until we got some new POV characters. The characters are eccentric (and that's a nice way of putting it), but not in the "that's hard to believe, people don't act like that" sense, more like "well he/she became a fascist/mass murderer pretty quick."

It's well-written, grammatically and in terms of character development, plot and worldbuilding. The story is updated regularly - though the author is on break at the moment it started in 2017, so there's almost three years of chapters to go through - and is on its sixth book.

I agree with you on the Japanese (and Korean, and Chinese) stories largely being lacking when it comes to translating, but it's amazing how many English series I've found that would benefit from a brief spellcheck. There are so many syntax and grammar problems in what would otherwise be an enjoyable series that it really becomes a headache to continue.

Anyways, I think you might like /Eight/, which is about a guy who is transported/reincarnates into another world. He tries to make it to a city, but the guards think he's a monster and drive him off, so he ends up living in the wilderness and has to start from scratch, making flint tools, figuring out how to start a fire and hunt. He also lives with a magic otter that's pretty cool.

/RE: Trailer Trash/ is also worth a read. It's about an old woman who gets transported back to her past teenage self. She doesn't have any magic powers or anything. Her main goal is to improve her life, given that she currently lives in a trailer park. It's harder than you'd think as the only real asset she has is future knowledge but no spare cash, rich friends, hidden treasures, just herself and what she can push herself to do.

I'm reading /Eight/ and love it. I like that the hero has some sense of the risks and is trying to minimize them. I also like he retains his memories of his old life and they are plot relevant. A lot of authors on Royal Road have the protagonist lose his memories of our world...which defeats the whole point of having him come from our world, and often makes them rather flat. It's a bonus that he's not another sad sack loner gamer. And I think the author gets the degree of starting advantage to give the hero just right.

It's still one the better isekais from the royalroad/light novel bin because the guy's earnest in reliving his life and everyone likes a redemption story. Its flaws aside, the protagonist and his reactions to his new life are more true to his self than most self inserts where you can feel there's some sort of mask or filter. Just like the protagonist, the story's average at everything [except plot twists] but the whole is more than the sum of its parts. warning: it's still a translation but readable

*** Ordered by my enjoyment

1) Displaced has hands down the best world building I've seen in any online story, the characters are amazing, but there are a lot of them. The POV changes to completely different story threads, and there isn't a main character. That's not a bad thing, but it can be off putting, especially the first time.

2) Delve is what would happen if a munchkin went to a fantasy world. The characters are alright but not really THE focus. A lot of numbers, and a book smart protagonist.

3) Worth the Candle is on royal road, I'm not sure if you've read it on Ao3. Probably the closest to what you've described. Great character growth, incredibly well written, amazing world building. It does go on some pretty long tangents, and can be a tad political. Overall very much worth reading.

4) He Who Fights Monsters is very enjoyable, with a smart protagonist, fits very well with your listed character traits. I would highly recommend it, but it doesn't have much to do with science or technology.

5) Super Minion has a Android for a protagonist. More of a comedy than anything serious. Decidedly not finished, and very slow updates, but I would still recommend it.

You should also read RE: Trailer Trash. It's not the genres you asked for, but it's fucking amazing.

I wouldn't call Rain a munchkin. His build is the most straight forward build of all: Just auras and metamagic feats that work on Auras. Rain's just obsessed with calculating every detail of the system.

I would call it a rational build though. Rain doesn't have system knowledge or the time/money to get some. So he picks a straight forward build.

He desperately needs help in this new world, so he picks a support build.

Features a protagonist who could definitely be described as "pragmatic", but may not necessarily tick the other boxes (it's the secondary protagonists more so that fit into that mold). Might be worth a try anyway. It's also fully complete, so there's that.

My normal review of it: It's slightly inconsistent in what exactly it's trying to /be/, and as a result comes off to me as being slightly generic. On one hand it's a story about people using magic (a "weak" magic system) to solve problems. Set in the present, it mentions the problem of magic being superstitious and mostly hidden from laypeople, but doesn't really explore it. Similarly, it touches on social acceptance, using demons as an analogue for minorities in a sense, but doesn't explore this theme in a nuanced way. That said the overarching thread is morality, and how that develops in different characters with different motivations (and how different personal systems of morality conflict with each other). It's competently written and moves at a reasonable pace, and is also complete, so you won't have to wait on any cliffhangers.

**** Honestly its not that complicated at all, the site has a list of rules which are fairly simple in practice. A few tips for the road from someone who's won 2/3 games he's played:

1) Try to get a tech trading agreement for every technology (aside from the one you are researching). This assures you will never fall behind in any technology, and be ahead of most people.

2) Try to talk to any be friends with everyone even if you are planning on murdering them next. It minimizes the chance of you being attacked and maximizes the chances of your attack succeeding due to them being unprepared.

3) Expand. If you sit there doing nothing you will 100% lose to the person that does expand faster then you. Thus you pretty much always want to be either expanding or planning an expansion (eg. moving your ships into position just outside their radar range, waiting for them to be attacked be someone else so you can move in and kill them).

4) Don't hesitate to backstab people if needed. There can only be one winner, and if you don't exploit all the chances open to you it probably won't be you.

5) Keep your economy strong and don't put all your money into ships/research, otherwise you will fall behind over time due to being poor. I don't remember the exact ratio since its been ages, but you probably want it equal or even better to your ships.

6) Most importantly, check the game as much as possible. All else being equal if you check it every hour you will slaughter someone that checks it every 8 and it is often the difference between defending from an attack perfectly and getting slaughtered.

tl;dr: Tech trade up the wazoo, be friends with everyone, expand, ruthlessly murder your friends, invest in economy, check the game as much as possible.

You are shown so many different paths and fight strategies, and so many odd characters. Along with the personalities associated with the vague powersets and tropes you saw when Suriel showed Lindon the Monarchs(those insanely powerful people she said could save the valley). Also while the individual characters are good but not great, the dynamics between them are fantastic. Also, the character motivations make genuine sense, based on their pasts, and the antagonists are very rarely portrayed as genuinely evil, and the grief of those around them is shown if they die.

The way that guy described power progression as Underlords being 'fodder', was really badly put.

The depth of the characters is dependent on pacing, the faster the pacing the less character development you can get.

It is ultimately very similar to Litrpgs in general, if you like that it's pretty much the same thing with an asian twist. Train, get stronger, fight baddies, get loot and power ups..

But instead of 100 levels there are less than 10 and the power differences between each level are greater.

I think the mass market litRPG formula caters to a junk food mentality but litRPG itself has more potential than that. For a start, I'd prefer stories prioritizing the /RP/ part of RPG: better dialogue, better plot hooks (than the usual revenge or sob story), more immersion into the game world and what makes it real. But there's also many angles to play and worldbuilding questions to answer when you dump a human being into a game (simulation?). Why does the game exist? If the gamer lives in the real world but spends all their time in the VR, how is society built around this (assuming the game has made it big)? What's the end-game and is it meaningful?

Yeah I did take it as aggressive; thanks for clarifying and rewording. I was actually intentionally generic, because I don't want to push what I think are worthy character goals onto writers. Also there's so much, from the very meaningful large-scale humanitarian goals you mention to the smaller and personal goals. I unfairly lumped the common revenge and sob stories above as negative, but not because they're inherently bad - more that litRPGs usually deal with them in a superficial way where it's ignored until it's convenient for the plot.

For specific examples: Worth the Candle is my favorite litRPG that deals with thought-provoking themes; The Wandering Inn is my favorite litRPG that has what I think of as /human flavor/ (no cannibal jokes), i.e. character interactions; and A daring synthesis (Worm FF) has the best character growth arcs.

**** Oh god don't get me started. I've read the first 2 and a half books, and am kinda let down. Absolutely everyone is already some amazing legend, and it's largely just set up. It's not a bad series, but it's most certainly not progression fantasy

***** Haha fair enough, I'm almost exactly where you are/were, and everything prior feels like set-up for the main conflict lol. I guess I interpreted it as progression because quite a few of the main characters definitely get involved in a great game with some true heavy weights.

Arguably the central character (Ganoes) starts off as a kid and is definitely being hinted at being a central mover and shaker in this conflict that probably will span entire pantheons!

****** That's fair, and the scale is amazing, but the style frustrates me. Whenever I get invested in a character, we don't see more of them, and most of the book is spent telling us how powerful and cool people are, rather than them actually doing anything to achieve that. I will admit that Ganoes has some progression, along with both of his sisters, and the younger sister's arc was one of my favorite things, besides the trail of dogs or whatever it was called.

***** Often things like this are better on a rewatch. As an example, I really enjoyed the recent Star Wars film with the much-maligned plot point of using the rebel ship as a missile. I thought the person who did that was a true hero, and the people who came up with that plan, willing to think outside the box. In a lot of cases, perhaps unlike many on [[/r/rational]], I don't really care about internal consistency if there is a good emotional arc, and I think they nailed it with that movie.

Edit: at the time I recommended TGWDLM, I was thinking about how much optimization power it would actually take to turn the world into a musical.

As a starting point, one could consider the song Bohemian Rhapsody; and DJing.

I honestly think an ordinary human could do it, given sufficient motive.

I especially like this line from Chapter 22 - "/I am an amoral sociopath who cares about nothing but his own enjoyment. Neither crippling sentiment nor uncontrolled sadism shall impede my ambition. Cold hard practicality is the only thing that controls my decisions./"
