(Spoilers for all chapters up to 221)

I think it's likely that Arthur's older brother is the DM running Aerb. There are only a few pieces of evidence but these first two are fairly strong:

- In [[https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-144/][Chapter 144]], Reimer's notes describing the game system that runs Aerb (and which Aerb!Juniper supposedly created) say:

#+begin_quote
  Should probably mention that a lot of this system wasn't unique, it was descended from a game called Fullplate that focused more on wargaming instead of adventures/theater. Your innovation was hacking on a whole bunch of garbage and including some talky bits, though at least some of the work was done by Arthur's brother, not sure how much.
#+end_quote

That is, Arthur's brother did some unknown amount of work in building the rules of the game that runs Aerb.

- The DM of Aerb indicated to Juniper that they're kindred spirits in their talk in [[https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-79/][Chapter 79]]:

#+begin_quote
  “Do I know you?” I asked.

  “We're kindred spirits, you and I,” he replied.
#+end_quote

This is an evasive answer, which to me suggests the answer is not exactly "no" (and we wouldn't expect, narratively, for the DM to be some completely new character).

Taking this answer on its face, the main defining feature of Juniper is his worldbuilding and acting as a DM. And Arthur's brother is the only other (likely) DM mentioned in the story; as mentioned early on in [[http://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-4/][Chapter 4]]:

#+begin_quote
  The Collection actually predated the group; when Arthur's brother had gone off to college, he'd left Arthur with two dozen source books for various tabletop RPG systems, though about half of them were for D&D.
#+end_quote

- Arthur's brother would care, at least a little, about Arthur. At least, we don't think he actively hates Arthur, from [[https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-96/][Chapter 96]]:

#+begin_quote
  Arthur's brother was nine years older than him, and I was never quite sure which of them was the mistake, if either was. It seemed like a long gap between children, enough that in a lot of ways, Arthur was effectively an only child. Arthur's father was an engineer, and his mother worked part-time at a store that sold wool, which she did mostly to fill her days, since it wasn't like they needed the money. He didn't talk about his family that much, except to say that his brother was fairly distant and his mother was on medication for depression and anxiety. Arthur's father was an old-school geek, with a small library of fantasy and science fiction, but most of it was ancient and yellowed --- and, honestly, kind of trash, the pulpy kind of stuff that had mostly gone out of fashion.
#+end_quote

Perhaps (wildly speculating) Aerb was created for Arthur by his brother, with the idea of actually including Juniper only coming later.

--------------

These were all the mentions of Arthur's brother that I could find, maybe there's more.

Given these, I think Arthur's brother is the best candidate for the identity of the DM, possibly tied with "The DM is someone completely new and unknown" and "The DM is Juniper himself, somehow"


** What would be the point of this reveal? Why would it matter? It's a character we know nothing about, and don't care about. It explains nothing about the nature of the game or reality, it doesn't answer "why" any of this. A reveal like that would be total anticlimax with no narrative purpose.

** Two more weak points in favor of this theory:

- Arthur's brother has been mentioned less than we'd expect for someone interested in/involved in/knowledgeable about RPGs. Sure, Arthur doesn't talk about his family, and sure, Arthur's brother is away at college, but Arthur's brother must have been very engaged with RPGs to have this large collection of source books. Surely Arthur would talk to his brother about RPGs at some point - it's apparently a strong shared interest. Heck, Arthur's brother might even visit home at some point - participating in a session would be plausible. Aerb!Juniper apparently even collaborated to some extent (perhaps without actual interaction) with Arthur's brother on the ruleset of the game running Aerb, and Aerb!Juniper's life is supposed to be pretty close to Earth!Juniper's. Yet we have had very little mention of Arthur's brother, none of these light, simple interactions that one might expect with the minor character who started Juniper and all his Earth friends on the path of RPGs.

- This would be an unexpected resolution of the "Who created/runs Aerb?" question. "It's just Juniper from the future" is the obvious resolution, and frankly, a pretty boring answer in itself, both of which are points against it. Arthur's brother would be a more interesting subversion. (Of course, the obvious answer is also sometimes just the answer...)

** I'm a fan of the theory that the DM is Joon, but not the same as the character in the story.

The idea being that the the DM is the real Joon, older irl, and that he had created this simulation. He initially put Arthur in due to never getting over his death. Putting Joon MK2 in is another attempt to deal with something he never got over. His teenage trauma and attempted suicide. Joon in the story is his attempt at creating an alternative past for himself, including changes to the character itself, to be more the person he wished he had been.

***** So that gives him an upper bound of 50 years to work on developing simulations, but that puts him in the 2060's. There's no way sims of that complexity are possible in the next 4 decades. Though I suppose you can always hand wave this away by saying their technology advanced faster, or June went into cryostasis and came out when tech was better, but that just feels contrived.

But more important than all that is; does this feel like a good explanation? Is it satisfying to say this really was all just a elaborate fantasy fulfillment on the part of an old man?

I wouldn't be so sure about that. Think about processing power 40-50 years ago.

And its possible future medical advances will give him at least a few more decades. Assuming future Joon came into big money to make this simulation, we can expect him to access top medical stuff.

I guess I have to sit down and explain the futurist concept of longevity escape velocity to ya. (Transhumanism is a theme of the story, and not dying is kind of the whole point of religious things like the technological singularity.)

Simply put, "curing" aging outright and immediately isn't necessarily necessary to avoid dying to it. Maybe the first treatments only get you +30 years. But that's 30 more years for new breakthroughs to develop to increase the average lifespan, and so on, until aging isn't a cause of death.

Whether that works out in real life or we end up poking each other with sticks when civilization collapses in 30ish years, well, doesn't matter. This is a story. About a simulated virtual world with at least one human-level agent; curing aging is way less amazing than that.

(As an aside following this kind of stuff is kind of depressing some days. One of the current hot topics is ISRIB, a *miracle brain rejuvenation drug*... for mice. Not you or me.)

** I'm confused why "the DM is the author" isn't on your list. It works even better with the "kindred spirits" line, explains why he has the power that he has and fits the metafictional nature of the story. Ever since Juniper started speculating about how he might be emulated in precisely the same way that the people of Aerb could be emulated (and he's right of course, they're all characters in the same story), that was my best guess.

Alexander Wales has the ability to be the DM and might easily have the inclination, though. For it to be Joon, Arthur's brother, or some as yet unknown character leaves us with the question of how and why they'd choose to be the DM, and it's hard to imagine a satisfying answer.

Especially aspects like Fel Seed that weren't cribbed from another pre-existing campaign.

On the other hand, Joon thinks the DM isn't Joon, and you'd think he'd be the expert.

Back on the first hand, Joon would know how to fool Joon into thinking he's not Joon...

And so on.

It all depends on how many layers you think AW is playing on. Going strictly by the text above, it's not Joon. One layer down, you'll notice that the DM doesn't outright /deny/ being Joon. A layer below that, and you'll notice that Joon, an experienced DM, doesn't notice this and call it out as an obvious attempt to misdirect without lying. But then we know that the DM can snap his fingers and reset the conversation to an earlier point until it goes the way he likes, and we have no assurances that we're seeing the first iteration of the conversation...

You could go around and around in circles forever arguing whether that chapter implies that Joon is the DM, or implies that he isn't.

My own opinion is that it's being left deliberately ambiguous, so I'm open to the idea of the DM being other characters than Joon. But then, I believed that the identity of the antagonist in HPMOR was being left deliberately ambiguous, and the author has said that wasn't the case, so take that for what it's worth.

Shit went wrong, something like Arthur being fundamentally unhealthy or giving him what he is supposed to want keeps making him miserable. So Aerb turned into the grimdark version it is now.

Joon goes in to fix it and the AI has now combined his deep-seated self-hatred with Arthur's arrogance, helplessness, and misogyny to create the mess that is current Aerb. The game was originally set up for Arthur 2.0, but starts adapting when Joon lets the first version of Amaryllis die.
