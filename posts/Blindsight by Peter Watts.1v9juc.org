** I also loved this book. There's just so many interesting /things/ on every freaking /page/. But more than sheer idea-richness, this book has believable characters, although it isn't bent on presenting the whole story as a puzzle that can be solved. It's dark hard sci fi done very well.

** I love this book, but not in a rationalist fiction way. However, this is a very good Sci-Fi and my favorite existential horror to date.

Also, --- I suspect many of us will find this amusing --- this book is an apt example of a story which could not be reduced to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/oq/savanna_poets/][savanna poetry]] without it losing all of it's impact.

** Loved the ideas, wasn't thrilled by the main character.
