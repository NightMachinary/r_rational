** I /loved/ the quick description of the necromancer war. Noble families who realized they would never inherit the title? Brilliant. It really built the world and made magic much more of a thing that's always existed, especially since there was just so much history summarized in those few paragraphs

** If Zach's initial movements repeat over loops, it would strongly suggest that Zach himself is carrying memory packets for Red Robe, and this is what he's doing at the start of every loop. Probably some sort of compulsion spell.

The Bakora gates are a nice touch. A unique deconstruction of the "ancient artefact" trope so common in fantasy/sci-fi.

This was my proposal in the last thread, and there's a nice bit of evidence for it here :) Even better: once Zorian can break Zach free, Red Robe won't be a problem!

*** Yeah, I was waiting for the headslap moment, but it's almost like Zorian doesn't want to think about the undercity at all right now. Like, weirdly so.

Mental issues with PTSD and [[#s][old spoilers stuff]] or magic mental compulsion that survives loops?

***** There is the classic "high fantasy" problem in stories like this.

You, the reader, only get pointed at the really interesting magic stuff, not the magical stoves in every home and such. So someone growing up with that in the story sees something old and not as good, it sorta kinda makes sense that they don't go "AH HA! The next MacGuffin is that ancient magical artifact! That one, right THERE!" Even if that ultimately isn't true, because it likely /is/ simply a MacGuffin and not the actual ultimate goal, it makes sense that they should see it like we do: lit in a giant neon glow.

But the characters must see stuff like that all the time. Older magical stoves that just weren't as good, simply littering junk shops or museums.

But still. In context, literally /ancient magical stoves/ discarded in piles under the city should be* the sort of thing twigging him that something weird is going on with them. That's how even real life works. I'm calling either authorial blindness or looming plot. Or a character flaw I missed.

****** I don't know, I think what you're saying explains Zorian's relative lack of interest sufficiently. He /did/ follow up on it enough to research more when he has the opportunity.

To be perfectly honest, personally I didn't mark the teleport gates as ridiculously important except in the same way as the sad cat sitting around on the bridge when Zorian didn't fish out the bicycle in early chapters - it will certainly be important later, and it merits research, but that's mostly meta-knowledge.

Zorian's in the middle of something, and I don't expect him to drop everything to chase a small clue. Hell - his combat training will directly contribute to being able to visit the gate under Cyoria.

Although personally my attention was more on the Sovereign gate and how it sounds /precisely/ how the time-loop situation could be described to other people (as opposed to loopers).

******* Yeah. Zorian is rightfully very cautious. Makes a lot of sense for him to focus on becoming good at combat rather than trying to solve the big mysteries and find the source of an invading army. I mean, he could try the good old scry and die techniques, he might succeed, but it'd be very risky.

Plus, psychologically, it's all very scary for him. Red Robes could murder him and his family at any time if he found him. It's a lot of mental effort to go confront all of that, especially when he rationally knows it could be a very bad idea.

******** Here's the author's take from a PM on fictionpress (quoted with permission):

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, from Zorian's perspective the gates are a neat little mystery that he has no reason focus on at the moment. They're far from the only mystery scattered through the world, and he is still heavily under impression of the evens of 'Soulkill' and focused on making sure it can never happen again. The gates do not help with that, they have no obvious link to the time loop, and they appear to be objects that have stumped more capable mages for centuries so what the hell could /he/ do about it?
#+end_quote

He's also leery of engaging in debates as an author, which seems very reasonable to me.

********* Thanks for that, and thanks to [[/u/nobody103]] for being awesome.

That is something I hadn't really considered- he is just one wizard. The Sovereign Gates and the other ones are centuries old, all the obvious low hanging fruit of how to activate them or find them has likely been tried, he had no reason to believe he would perform better than hundreds of other mages.

It's the sort of rationality that Eliezer mentioned- if your main is doing something else no one else has done they better have a damn good reason for no one else trying it. And I guess he knows lots of others have tried to do stuff with the gates.

While I understand his leeriness of engaging in debates, I do appreciate when he talks to us. Engagement and learning more about the story is very fun.

** Finally got around to reading this story, so I can post in updates! \o/!

Does anyone else find it suspicious that the person Zorian happened to get asked to steal "trade secrets" from is likely heavily involved in the invasion? If Gurey doesn't end up being some undercover intelligence agent or something, I'm going to cry shenanigans unless there's a merchant in practically every town and city that's connected to the secret plot.

Also, this was probably mentioned in earlier posts, but if we're getting pseudo-confirmation that souls can't be killed, then that confirms my hypothesis that what happened to the spiders is probably what happened to Zach, and they'll all come back in one of the restarts, feeling disoriented and sick at first.

*** What exactly is your theory- that the spiders were the victims of soul merge spells like Zach was (where the damage was foreign bits of soul)? I ask because I'm not sure what you're referring to.

My own personal theories are that the only things that would render non-time travelers essentially mindless at the beginning of each restart are: (1) some mechanism that ejects their souls from the time loop, (2) the purple spell actually attaches a marker to their souls like Zorian's, but also damages them (any other form of soul damage wouldn't be moved back in time, according to my model of the time loop).

**** Not exactly soul merge spells, but we don't actually know what soul alteration magic was used on Zach and Zorian: maybe the lich intended to damage their souls together out of efficiency, but the time loop spell made it go awry by cancelling it early due to Zach's death and causing the soul melding to occur.

Since people aren't dropping dead all over the place in each successive restart (Red Robe should be permanently killing off everyone of any importance in each invasion to make it a cakewalk when the time loop ends), I think RR is lying about it killing them permanently: he probably knows it's a temporary thing, and did it to disable them for the next restart so he could confront the third time traveler (Zorian), knowing he would go to the spiders to warn them in the new iteration.

***** I've been assuming that Red Robe knows more about the time loop (whether they're an original time looper or stole that knowledge from Zach), which would make it more likely that as a necromancer they would be able to use it for something sophisticated. But I'll admit that since we've seen temporary soul damage before, so that's another possibility.

Edit: I guess that I'm just more taken with the other theories because I like how strong it makes Zorian's adversary... for plot reasons I think it makes a better story compared to essentially losing your allies for a few turns instead of having permanent consequences while simultaneously revealing how powerful the opposition is. Maybe not the most objective logic.

****** Don't get me wrong, it absolutely makes the stakes shoot straight up: it was an emotional hammerblow to have all the spiders get killed off for good. There just seems to be weak evidence now for RR having lied or been wrong, and the part of me that wants the spiders to not be dead is happy to acknowledge that evidence, even if it's not for objectively valid reasons either :)

** I did love the history lesson. Beautifully written, amusing, made the world much more real.

The priest's no selling of his teleport wards also amused me much.

It also explains even further the earlier Zoltan vampire/ Quatach Ichl debate where the vampire was a prominent member of society. Many houses converted their leadership to undead for immortality and as such those houses have likely continued to claim to be the true houes in Ulquaan Ibasa.
