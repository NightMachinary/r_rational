** Is this porn? Because it feels like porn.

*** The short answer is no it is not porn. The longer answer is it is an attempt to deconstruct something that is pretty heavily sexualized.

Not sure how well it's succeeding though because there are a few reasons it could feel like porn, some of those would be 'okay good working as intended' but a bunch of them would be 'no that is wrong I need to fix something' So if you can expand on what gives you the feeling I'd appreciate that.
