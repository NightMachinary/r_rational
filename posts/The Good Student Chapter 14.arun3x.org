** “I think you've got it all wrong,” said Nic.

“Do you?” said Simole. “Or is that just what you want me to think?”

I think that little exchange encapsulates this series quite well.

  The men around Minister Carmine, large brutish soldiers of the Ministry for Instruction, intimate with countless forms of torture, looked uncomfortable and like they wished someone would sound the retreat.

** Nic and Dizzy ganging up on the new character makes me feel really sorry for him. Nobody deserved to be hit simultaneously by Dizzy's cold-hearted emotional abuse and Nic's cold-blooded dissection of everything the Minister was doing wrong like that.

Simole didn't even have to lift a finger.

*** Sure Dizzy gave him a hard time, but he is quite the creep so he probably /did/ deserve that (unlike most of Dizzy's victims).

Nic actually helped him to do his job better. Unless Nic was wrong, but I do not think he was.

True. I meant that in a joking way, since Nic wasn't even intending on being particularly malicious. Dizzy was particularly caustic in a way towards the Minister that she wasn't towards Nic.

  “Now's your chance to win her heart,” whispered Simole. “Challenge him to a duel.”

  Minister Carmine looked to be in excellent shape. A military man, Nic guessed. He was tall, his hair was pulled back from an aristocratic face, and his shoulders were broad. He had a sword at his side that didn't look like it was there for show. The scabbard was plenty scratched and scuffed, but it still looked well cared for --- glossy and polished.

  "Those books you read about romance and heroes and forbidden love,” Nic whispered back at Simole through the side of his mouth, “they aren't historically accurate.”

  “Men didn't use to duel over the love of a woman?” said Simole, sounding disappointed.

  "No, they did. I mean the part where the weaker man finds a way to win because his love is true. That part never happened. The smaller, weaker, more in love man always died.”

Good stuff.

** So I made it through more than half of volume 1 and just am not enjoying the story/writing at all. Does it seriously get better?
