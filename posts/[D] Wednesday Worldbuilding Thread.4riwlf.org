Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** The superhero genre is about as irrational as they come. The nearly universal premise is a person discovers they have abilities beyond what a normal person does, so they put on a mask to fight crime and help people as they choose while still living a normal life. In reality, this is not an efficient use of their abilities, nor is it particularly effective at fulfilling their goals on a macro scale.

However, one thing rational fiction authors need to understand about these genre conventions before they play with them is why they exist. When people see someone notice injustice and use the power they have to fight it, it inspires the audience to do the same. Superheroes are fundamentally just good samaritans, and therein lies the basic reason people get emotionally invested in superhero stories.

Seemingly a good way to compromise would be for the hero's job to to be helping others, such as a police officer, firefighter, or paramedic. However, this risks denying the central conceit of a heroic protagonist: autonomy. People recognize heroism when the protagonist chooses to help when they don't have to. When you institutionalize heroism, it risks taking the inspiration away.

I'm not critiquing any story or setting in particular, The Metropolitan Man was most certainly not a superhero story and I thought Worm actually stuck too closely to superhero conventions given the setting. I just think it's important to understand why people like irrational stories before you write rational fiction.

Note: I have not yet read Strong Female Protagonist.

*** There are different ways to write rational fiction.

You can take a reconstructionist approach, where you see this trope (or genre) that people like and try to have it make sense somehow -- that's completely valid. But you can also take the deconstructionist approach and tear down a trope (or genre) to expose its weak points.

I think superheroes-fighting-petty-crime is generally a bad trope. It gives people warm fuzzies, sure, and /maybe/ inspires them toward being good (more likely, it short-circuits the altruistic reward pathways in the brain), but it's ultimately a model of charity that exaggerates all of the worst aspects of charity-as-warm-fuzzies or charity-as-signaling. It's ineffective altruism. One of the things that people like about rational fiction is that it's willing to examine things like that. There's a connection between Superman pulling a kitten down from a tree and slacktivist culture that you don't often see pointed out; to my mind that's one of the reasons that rational fiction exists. (And yes, you still need to make a satisfying story, but you can do that without doing a reconstruction.)

**** My personal experience with slacktivism is that while it isn't very effective, it's the best I can do. I don't have the money, energy, or ability to change things so I throw what little weight I can behind causes I want to see succeed. I admit I'm lazy, but even if I wasn't I wouldn't have any opportunities to help that I couldn't capitalize on that I don't already.

The problem with an individual trying to change the world is that, as far as I know, they can't. The world changes as people do and no one can force that change. We do what we believe is right when we can bring ourselves to do it and hope what we did helped. I don't know if there's another way to live and stories of heroism remind us to keep fighting.

***** Arguably, the effective altruism movement is a response to that. Nobody's asking you to personally save the world; giving money is more than enough, if you give it to a charity that's efficient and doing something that will help.

Which brings us back to superheroes. Superheroes always have to personally save the world. Which make sense when they're the only person remotely qualified to do so, but in most superhero shared-universes that's not the case. Batman could enlist Superman's help in fighting the Joker (most of the time). Even when there's organisations of established for the specific purpose of handling supervillain threats, calling them in is a rare dramatic twist to heighten tension rather than the superheroic equivalent of calling 911. "Superhero teams" have more in common with D&D adventuring parties than any peacekeeping group. And all this has good narrative reasons behind it, but it's not how actual people work.

I don't care what your powers are, if a spandex-clad minotaur is robbing a bank you don't handle him yourself. You call the police, and /then/ if they need your help you can offer it. You don't have to solve all the world's problems by yourself; there's almost always someone else working on that problem who could use your help.

****** The fact that heroes aren't well organized brings me back to the idea of institutionalizing heroism. Most superheroes don't make a career out of saving people because they just help in their spare time, which authors put in to make their situation more relatable to our own. Don't get me wrong, there have been plenty of times where it's stupid and should be done better, but that's why it persists.

When you read a story about people doing their job, even if it's about helping others, then you don't see them as good samaritans. I love the show Sirens, those people are fantastic paramedics, but they don't inspire me to help people in my life because their situation is not applicable to mine. It's their job, and it is a very good job I will always thank them for doing, but it's not my job and never will be.

The lesson every superhero teaches people is to do what's right when you can. We don't love them just because they give us ideals to aspire too, but because we see ourselves in them. Police come fight crime for us, but superheroes are us. They aren't out there helping people all the time, but neither are we for the same reasons they are, and that makes it all the more important that we help when we can.

I never have those as a goal of writing fanfic or stories, unless I am trying to stay faithful to the story details by trying to justify some tropes.

Otherwise, with original fic, I try to write a story about what would actually happen as a result of X, usually by what I think would happen.

I totally ignore any tropes at that point. Trope that arises will be a total accidental concern. I think it causes story to go in entirely different directions, which is rather novel.

*** An interesting proposal I've heard for the strange behavior of super-heroes is that it is driven by a system similar to Mantling from TES, or Archetypes from Unknown Armies. Essentially, there are timeless prototypes that exist in the universe, which allow for an actor with the right qualities, following the right script, to do things that are otherwise impossible (with escalating levels of impossibility for a more complete replication of the prototype).

#+begin_quote
  The superhero genre is about as irrational as they come.
#+end_quote

I would disagree with this, at least in part. Marvel / DC superhero stories are irrational, yes, but I think it's perfectly possible to do a rational superhero story. I worked pretty hard to come up with one when I was writing The Change Storms series, and I think I succeeded. ([[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][Free download]] of The Change Storms: Induction if you want to check my work.) The elements of superhero storms that I had to work around, and the solutions I found, included:

- Where do superpowers come from?\\

Most comic book universes have a giant buffet of how to get powers -- mutant genes, alien birth, lightning, chemicals, radiation, etc. 'Alien birth' is dodgy at best and none of these others work at all -- in reality, if you get hit by lightning you just die, you don't suddenly have the ability to run at the speed of light.

There's two solutions that I see: don't explain it at all, or come up with a paranormal answer and just implicitly admit that it's a story premise and therefore not necessarily realistic.

My answer was "probability storms" -- in their area of effect they render nigh-impossible things (e.g. photons condensing out of the quantum foam in a collimated beam) certain. If you're caught in a storm a piece of it can get stuck inside you, which is what gives you your superpowers. There's a lot of handwavium here, and a lot of the powers don't hold up under an "could this happen under real physics given infinite luck?" exam. I'm fine with that. Any story should be allowed its premise, as long as it remains consistent and rational within that.

- Why do superheroes and -villains wear spandex?

Marvel and DC said "because it makes drawing the human body easier."

Strong Female Protagonist said "at first they did this because it was a cached thought about how superpowered people behave, but now they're moving away from it."

I said "they don't wear spandex."

- Why do superheroes and -villains fight / commit crime?

Supervillains committing crime is easy -- they have power and they are inclined to be criminals. Motivations are as easy to find as a police blotter.

Superheros fighting crime is harder. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_superhero][real-life superheroes]], so clearly it's a thing that some people are motivated to do. The vast majority would more likely go into law-enforcement, fire/rescue, the military, or some other community-service-oriented career.

Then there's the question of regulation. Marvel and DC have done a lot with this. The basic superhero concept is of a vigilante, someone who is breaking the law in order to preserve it. People might look aside as long as the hero is doing no harm, but eventually there's going to be calls for registration, and those calls are eventually going to be backed up with force of arms.

Because of my initial premise (p-storms change you, you get powers when a storm fragment gets caught inside you), I had to acknowledge that being around an empowered individual would eventually cause other people to get superpowers. I wanted powers to be rare, so I decided that p-storms are most likely to just kill you but, if they don't, they will probably change you into a bodyhorror form at the same time as they give you powers. Anyone with superpowers (bodyhorrored or not) is a walking p-storm, so being near them is going to Change you as well. Given this, there was zero chance that powers wouldn't be regulated. Therefore, all powered individuals in the Change Storms universe are either criminals, in an internment camp, or in a government paramilitary group intended to deal with natural disasters, supervillains, etc.

- What is the motivation of the (presumably superpowered) antagonist? Why aren't they using their powers to make a fortune in industry instead of robbing banks?

My villains weren't bank robbers, they were (depending on who's telling it) terrorists or freedom fighters. They had broken out of the "Relocation Facilities" (aka internment camps) where Changed people had been put to keep them away from normals and were now trying to bring about a societal shift so that the Changed could have a better life.

Again, you can [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][read the book]] to see if I succeeded, but I would contend that it's very possible to write a rational superhero story.

** So something I've been thinking about recently is how you could plausibly keep something like the Harry Potter verse hidden. I don't think the Obliviators portrayed in the books be nearly enough. That kind of localized mind magic would always have problems with missed people convincing a large number of others.

On the other hand, this is clearly a universe with anti-memes in the style of SCP (forgive me I forget exactly what they called those things). Many charms work on this principle most notably the Fidelius Charm ignoring for the moment that it isn't used nearly as often as it ought to be given it's properties.

There's also the other side of things which is the massive lack of culture flow form the muggle world to wizards. Yea I get that they're separated but there ought to be more flow. Somebody who's studying them should have a basic understanding at least. The only way you end up with something like we see in the books is with spell work. Something's prevent the worlds mixing. If I were to guess something related to the Fidelius Charm preventing muggles from learning of the existence of wizards and preventing wizards learning much about muggles and also possibly giving them a level of protection. The amount of crime aimed at muggles given wizards can wipe memories again seems unreasonably low.

*** A Masquerade is comparatively natural when the magic world is physically separate from the real one. Perhaps like a parallel universe. And magic people don't commonly come and go between worlds, so their presence is fairly easy to hide, particularly if they need some sort of travel visa so the magic government knows what they need to cover up.

I thought Harry Potter was going in this direction at first, with places like Platform 9 3/4 and Diagon Alley and Hogwarts being completely inaccessible to Muggles, but it eventually gave up on that.

*** Agreed, the setting doesn't make much sense when you look at it too hard. The only justification I can come up with is that the whole series is told from Harry's perspective, and he isn't exactly the brightest kid. We're just hearing what he's learned from personal experience since he never bothered to study the wizarding world.

The Masquerade is such a common trope, however, that I'd love to find a way of having it make sense. How can you possibly keep an entire world a secret right under the public's nose, let alone keep it up forever? The SCP Foundation uses the trope as Fridge Horror when we discover reality is a lie created by , but that isn't applicable to every story.

The only solution I have for when you don't want to fall back on conspiracy, is to throw out the idea of objective reality in your setting. Make the supernatural real, but impossible to objectively prove. Mental effects are the easiest to do with this, but Genius: The Transgression does a remarkable job of making the unscientific true.

If you really throw out objective reality, then it could be that there isn't a single unified true state of the world, and there isn't a single true history and there isn't anything making one future more probable than another in an objective sense, and there definitely isn't a single unified model that can explain reality at all phenomenological levels. Everyone's subjective probabilities are different. The mundane reality is an island of stability, or rather meta-stability, it asserts itself because [insert whatever general metaphysical rule comes close to being true in the setting: mundane reality is mathematically simpler, mundane reality is commonly agreed upon, mundane reality is enforced by powerful supernatural entities, etc.]. For the average person, any evidence of the supernatural they could try to find will have more parsimonious mundane explanations because the very metaphysics of reality is enforcing such an apparent explanation. Mages/wizard/witches/mad scientists are the few humans able to overcome this mechanic [depending on the setting by force of belief/will, contact with a higher power, ability to outsmart reality itself, etc.]

In Genius the reason mad science can't be proven is because the effects can't be replicated, showing them off to people turns them in to mad scientists or Igor-like creatures, and when the gadgets are examined they tend to explode.

*** You don't have to worry about missing people you should have mindwiped so long as no one will believe them. There are people who say they've seen ghosts or angels, and I dismiss them pretty much on reflex.

Edit: I've actually got a story I'm (idly) working on where this is the case:

#+begin_quote
  On the whole, the masquerade was surprisingly easy to maintain. The mind was a wonderful, complex thing, and one of the things that it was very good at was matching patterns. If something deviated from the pattern, the mind simply glossed over it. A gleaming sword became an aluminum bat. A unicorn became a horse. People would dismiss what they saw as a hallucination, a trick of the light, or a practical joke. Even if they had some hidden suspicions of the truth, and never fully fell for the pattern matches the brain offered up, the average brain was also very good at conformity. You didn't mention the man with the wand, because you didn't want the social stigma that came with that. There was nothing magical about any of this; that was simply how people were.

  Sometimes, in exceptional cases, the twin friends of pattern matching and conformity simply weren't up to the job. And that was where the Department of Memory Management and Modification came in.

***** There really isn't one. People, technologies and institutions are getting better at collecting and analyzing data year after year, and people are getting increasingly connected.

It mostly depends on the magic system and the masquerade scale (hiding a town of faeries basically just requires hypnotizing all outsiders into ignoring everything, controlling communications with the exterior, and a lot of accounting), and the effects of the masquerade. If it's "some people are somewhat stronger, faster and more attractive than average because they descend from Apollo", it's easy to hide because the most visible effects will be something like most Olympic medalists having Greek lineage. If the masquerade is about vampires going around killing people, keeping it secret is a lot harder because the existence of a cast of superhuman killers will leave traces, patterns in the murders, physical evidence, recordings, etc.

It might be possible to hide it for some time, especially with mind control, memory altering and financial or administrative power. But there's not system that will give high odds of keeping the masquerade secret in a modern world for more than a few years.

****** My basic contention is that it requires large scale mind control. You can't get by on a case by case basis, you need something that completely eliminates certain knowledge. You want a situation where certain thoughts can't be had or at a minimum certain things can't be remembered.

Alternatively you can get by with a god like entity working on a case by case basis.

Keep in mind the goal isn't to prevent all knowledge of something, just prevent the knowledge from becoming commonly known.

******* Sure. Personally, I've never liked masquerades, because they're always more of a writer's trick to say "Look, this takes place in reality, except you never realized it because it was kept secret!", than actually thought-out worldbuilding.

Like, there's nothing unrealistic about keeping a secret. It happens all the time. But keeping a secret shared by thousands/millions of people, who might live among those they're supposed to hide from, for hundreds/thousands of years? It's hard, it's expensive, it's probably not going to work, and it'll create loads of problems when the bubble inevitably pops. It's almost never worth the handwavy benefits it's stated to have. And the way the masquerade forms is never clearly explained, and usually boils down to "And then people stopped believing in fairies even though the number of fairies remained exactly constant." A reductionist approach to "what would we do if we were people with these magical powers" gives something very different from "let's spend the next centuries in hiding!"

******** Of course, the really /brutal/ way to enforce a Masquerade is to have a setting wherein, if the Masquerade gets broken, then /bad stuff happens/.

One such setting is El Goonish Shive, where there exists a masquerade to hide the existence of magic - and, more importantly, to hide /how incredibly EASY it is to get magic/ once you know it exists.

And the reason for the Masquerade is that people who get magic wind up with spells that fit their personality. As one character puts it; who do you think will end up getting the /really/ violent and destructive spells?

--------------

When the people maintaining the Masquerade can point at Pompeii and say "That's what happened the last time the mask slipped", then almost everyone has /really/ good reason to work hard at keeping the secret.

For instance, you could easily argue that a masquerade make people with magic powers more dangerous and harmful, since it's harder to make organized institutions to track the renegades and fix their damage, and they have an easier time hiding.

Well, the brutal way would be something like a Somebody Else's Problem field accompanying any supernatural effect: Any use or appearance of something magical would inspire /extreme disinterest/ in any muggle onlooker.

**** I feel like "I must have seen something else" or "nobody will believe me" would be pretty ineffective at maintaining a masquerade. For one, as xkcd pointed out, almost everyone is carrying a camera everywhere at all times now, so material (fakeable, but attention-worthy) proof is becoming easy to produce on demand.

But most importantly, the reason people are quick to dismiss crazy alien sightings and other extraordinary things they/other people saw as not being surnatural is that the things in question /are actually obviously not surnatural/. Like, if you have a farmer who says he saw a dark shape going from tree to tree at night, while he was drunk, shot it and heard a metal sound, and says he's seen an alien robot... then your first reaction is to think "No, this doesn't sound anything like an alien encounter and a lot like you shooting at an owl, missing, and hitting a bucket instead". You can confirm it by looking for bullet holes in metal things near the alleged sighting.

On the other hand, if someone says he's seen a knight on a unicorn cut someone in two with a sword in broad daylight... well, it's really hard to mistake a guy on a horse with a baseball bat for a knight with a sword, especially once you've seen it go through someone. Sure, the guy could be intoxicated or lying for attention, and in some cases /will/ shut up by fear of social stigma. But if they're socially comfortable, or don't care about the backslash, or have a reputation for honesty and sobriety, or other material proof to back it up (like the person they've seen killed is reported missing, or portal-shaped scorch marks around the portal the knight disappeared in), they will talk, because seeing a knight with a sword on a unicorn is /not/ something you just forget overnight.

** So, I am thinking about trans-dimensional travel mechanics. Specifically, I am looking for general inexploitability.

It has to be something that is: difficult to build; not so easy that eventually a car factory can't simply build and mass produce, yet built by shipyards. It also should not be easy to mount an invasion or use it as a poor's man teleporter, and so on.

One thing I did think of is to have the trans-dimensional machine's navigational capability tied to the main protagonist as a unique ability. Only individuals like him can travel to anywhere in the multiverse at any distance in any dimension or use it as a poor's man teleporter.

To some extent, he could show others how to travel the multiverse, even building technological devices to allow navigation, but it's either impossible or required a really long time to unlock all of his secrets as a person with trans-dimensional travel.

The other approach I have is that the TD drive only cross the dimension next to it. If it open a gate on Earth to another universe like our, it's going to open up where Earth would be. Though I supposed you could open up to a universe where there is no Earth. I wonder what effects it would be? I suspect it will be exploited for all its worth.

Then there's the 'cost' of building a TDM. I don't want it to be too casual to the point that people can just buy a car off a parking lot and use it to travel to other realities like nobody's business. It should cost about ten million dollars, the price of a container ship or is at least as expensive as an Abram tank(4.3 million dollars per unit). There may be other methods of trans-dimensional travel that isn't so expensive, but at no point that people should be able to casually explore new universes. This also make it easy for me to write stories since I don't have to worry about contacting new civilization all the time.

Limitations is also a good way to add complexity and plot tension. Maybe there should be chokepoints that allow easy point of entrance for trans-dimensional travelers, but it's otherwise difficult to travel there otherwise?

*** I'll point you to the Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Steven Baxter, and the Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross.

In Long Earth, the dimensional travel device is cheap and commonplace. The worlds it can access are arranged in a line, and you can make one "step" East or West every 15 minutes or so (it causes nausea). You don't move through space - all the parallel worlds are Earth, with the same geography. It's a plot point that a few universes don't have Earths - those effectively prevent unprotected people from travelling past that point. Eventually, the Gaps are used for cheap space travel, and they incidentally violate conservation of energy.

In Merchant Princes, there's only a handful of worlds that are accessible (two or three so far, but I've only read the first couple of books). Only the protagonist's extended family can world-walk, but their carrying capacity is enough to bring one other person along. Again, all the worlds are geographically Earth and you don't move through space, and there's a cooldown between successive travels. There's the interesting idea of "doppelgängering" a space - securing an area against transdimensional invaders by buying the corresponding space in adjacent universes and securing that. Or just by keeping your secure things on the second floor, when the corresponding space has nothing built on it. It's generally a very deconstructionist take on the whole idea, and I recommend it to people who like the sound of a rational protagonist discovering she's the lost princess of a magical kingdom.

While interesting, it's not something I will use in my story, since I intended for trans-dimensional travel to be hard, and will be exploring only a few worlds for the sake of managing complexity.

Good call :)

Who's your protagonist? If travel between worlds isn't for everyone, he or she will need to be someone involved in it at the start of the story.

Is "trans-dimensional travel" a misleading name? A dimension isn't a universe, it's an axis along which universes are measured. You're not travelling across dimensions. And coming up with your own name for the process is an opportunity to do some worldbuilding.

There are a few ways to go about this.

- location restriction (leaving from) -- you can only leave from a specific (inconvenient) place(s)
- location restriction (going to) -- you can only go to a specific (inconvenient) place(s)
- personal restriction (user) -- only certain people can cross dimensions
- personal restriction (sender) -- only certain people can sent people across
- equipment necessity -- (self explanatory)
- energy necessity -- (self explanatory)
- cooperation (inter-world) necessity -- requiring people on both sides to initiate travel

Of those, the most interesting (in my opinion) are location restrictions and cooperation necessity.

With location restrictions, control of specific areas matters, leading to conflict (and the possibility of restricting effective transport.) For a portal fantasy, these are useful because they can explain why more people haven't discovered the trans-dimensional travel (it's in a hard to reach place) or provide conflict for the hero (the places you get transported into are completely distinct from the places you can get transported out of.)

Cooperation necessity can be used in a variety of different ways. Perhaps a ritual has to be performed at the same place on both worlds, so while cults might try to do it on either world every few years, decades, or centuries, it's very rare that both sides do so at the same time. From a plot conflict standpoint, then, all that needs to happen is one side being prevented from completing the ritual. Or alternatively, if it's something that's only discovered recently, perhaps it requires advanced technology on one or both sides of the portal. (for example, particle colliders count as artificial signals for interdimensional travel spells.)

I'm pretty biased towards portal fantasies here, but that's because I spent a lot of time thinking of how best to make one when I still cared about the mlp fandom.

*** The price and size points are easy - this is a fictional machine, you are free to say "It takes a machine this big to open a wormhole and we haven't figured out how to miniaturize it," or "A dimensional drive is powered by pure Unobtanium and it costs a million dollars to get enough for each."

If the story is long enough that someone /will/ figure out how to miniaturize it, you can make it impossible by fiat: "Whatchamacallit's Constant says that you need a wormhole generator at least 100 times as big as the wormhole you want to open," or similar.

The easiest way to prevent the "poor man's teleporter" is to require that you arrive in the other dimension at the same place you left - if you teleport from New York, you always wind up in Alternate New York and not Alternate San Francisco, so the trip doesn't get any shorter.

This can limit your story somewhat, if you want to be able to leave Earth and end up on another planet, so another option is to limit the places you can teleport from. Perhaps you can only jump through "jump nodes" that always lead to a fixed destination. Or perhaps the wormhole generators only go one way and don't come with you, so if you want to create a teleporter shortcut you'd have to move an entire ship-sized machine over to the other dimension to make the return trip, for a single destination.

To prevent trans-dimensional invasions, you have a couple of options. You could do what Schlock Mercenary does and make machines that block teleportation around them. Call them "dimensional shields" or something. You could do what Mass Effect does and make it so that the more mass you jump, the more inaccurate your jump becomes, which limits how much an invasion can send at once. You could make the wormhole take a long time to open (possibly scaling with mass), so that the defenders have plenty of time to set up an ambush if you try to teleport on top of them.
