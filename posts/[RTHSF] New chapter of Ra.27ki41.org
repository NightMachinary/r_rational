** The main sub for Ra is, of course, [[/r/qntm]], as listed in the sidebar. And yet, new chapters are never posted here, for some reason! I decided I'd take the initiative and post it myself.

(Same thing with [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com][Pact]], on that note. Hmm.)

*** Thanks for this! I doubt I'd have noticed that there was a new chapter until July.

Edit: actually, I /had/ missed two chapters. I guess it's updated a little quicker than I thought.
