** Hmm. Seems like it has potential. Apparently not HPMoR-canon-compliant?

*** Grownups always forget.

I'd imagine this version of Harry, for /reasons/, would begin to think of his time with Mary Poppins as a series of half-forgotten dreams within 12 hours of her departure. I scoured the text of HPMOR, and as long as Harry either doesn't remember it or only has fuzzy memories that he never thinks about (because why would you go around thinking about a weird dream you had one time four years ago?) then there's nothing about it which precludes compatibility with HPMOR canon.

** u/Kuratius:
#+begin_quote
  "Come along now, spit spot."
#+end_quote

Apparently the term is used by MP very often, but it really reminds me of Sith spit.

*** It's onomatopoeia, basically meaningless noise that means "hurry up" or "be quick about what you're doing", but with a connotation of "do what you're told to do, please."

** UPDATE:

Title has changed to "Mary Poppins Enkindles Oblivion." More accurately represents the meaning I'm trying to convey. Can't edit it on this reddit post.

** HJPEV's parents are upper middle class. They would not be living in a dingy little house. They need lots of space for all their books. Just wanted to point that out.

*** u/ElizabethRobinThales:
#+begin_quote
  The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the time they negotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town that was Oxford, and parked in the driveway of the *small, dingy-looking* old house that their family used to keep the rain off their books.

*** Also, Oxford's average house prices are 11 times higher than the salaries of the people who work in the city. The location(s) I modeled "Number 11" off of were 2 bedroom homes of probably less than a thousand sq feet and they were like Â£350,000. It had to be done that way because EY modeled the Verres house as a detached house and most housing in Oxford is flats and, like, houses that are connected to each other like a townhome but not, idk what they're called. There aren't a lot of /house/ houses available, and the ones that aren't big and fancy are all in the poorer areas of the city. He said they live in a small house, and the small houses are where the small houses are, so I put them in Cowley.
