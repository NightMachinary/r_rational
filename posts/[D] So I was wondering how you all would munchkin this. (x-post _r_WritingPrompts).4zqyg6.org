** Just wish for the coins to always come up heads in the future. If it comes down tails, well it'll always come down tails in the future. If that's the case just wish for the opposite of what you want, hell if you're really lazy just preface all wishes with "I wish for the opposite of x".\\
Anyone who's not a complete idiot should realize that the coin has absolutely no drawbacks if you know which side is going to come up beforehand regardless of which it is.

If you can't manipulate the coin like that then just formulate more complex wishes such that they do the same thing regardless of which side comes up. For instance "I wish for a billion dollars, unless tails came up in which case I wish to be a billion dollars in debt."

***** The most likely option is for that coin to land on heads, because the person using it can train themselves in such a way as to flip to one side consistently (And also because wikipedia says the chance of a coin landing on the same side it starts is .51). So the opposite, the least likely option happens-- sides.

To be fair, I don't know how the coin would determine "opposites," but there probably isn't a silver bullet for such a coin, or someone would have already munchkined themselves into godhood.

** The big problem with this comes from the definition of "opposite".

If it uses stricly logical definition, meaning that the opposite of your wish would be [not][your wish], then you have nothing to worry about. After all, the opposite of a wish "please make it so [a glass of water appears before me]" would be "[a glass of water does not appear before me]"... which is simply [nothing happens]. Nobody said that the coin is creative in it's way of not granting your wishes.

If it uses more language based system, than it totally depends on how the wishes are compiled. RTFM first, munchkin later.

*** I would hope the coin is smart enough to know what you want to achieve, and create the opposite effect on tails.

For example, it could boil the wish "Move Steve 100 kilometers further away from the earth's center than he currently is" down to "Kill Steve", and on tails it would do something positive for Steve instead. Maybe extend his life by however many years you would have cut it short?

How it calculates these value estimates, though, would be another question. The least exploitable version, I think, would be for it to have some sort of utility function that roughly matches that of the average human, and takes your goals into account when fulfilling the wishes. That way the results are comprehensible and predictable, but harder to game.

Obviously that's dangerous to wish for directly, so you wish for a Fountain of Cleverness. The coin comes up tails. Supposing I'm the genie of the coin, there are a few different opposites I can use here.

1: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone drinking from the fountain becomes a complete moron.

2: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone who doesn't drink from the fountain is imbued with cleverness.

3: A reverse-fountain is created in the desired location. Everywhere except the inside of the fountain is flooded with the Elixir of Cleverness, and everybody drowns.

4: A fountain is created on Pluto. Anyone who drinks from the fountain becomes a superintelligent paperclip maximizer and destroys the universe.

**** That's not the opposite! "A not-researcher not-at not-Harvard not-finds the not-cure for not-cancer" - that's a sextuple negative!

It's like saying the opposite of gaining six dollars is losing $6 of debt.

*** I think a more consistent opposite (how is yale the /opposite/ of harvard?) would be to have someone at harvard develop a disease the gives everyone cancer.\\
Or maybe it somehow sabotages any potential for there to be a cure for cancer in the future.

** "I wish the coin would come up heads next time"

If heads, make wish on next flip.

If tails, make the opposite of your wish on next flip.

Repeat.

Of course you'd want to test this on minor wishes a few times to make sure it will work.

** This is a perfect oracle for answering binary questions. Let's say you want to find out if X is true. Then you wish for X to be true, toss the coin and find out if it's true (if the coin came up head) or false (if the coin came up tails).
