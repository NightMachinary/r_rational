I've got the very, very basic starting ideas for a story. The ideas interest me (as they should), but I'm looking for some feedback on what about these ideas interests /you/, and what directions you'd be interesting in seeing the story explore.

So I have four main points - plot and worldbuilding to come (my image of this is that the rules of the world /are/ consistent, but possibly not known - even to me at this point):

Avery, the male protagonist, is a wanderer. He has some power, but tends not to use it until there's a big ‘flash-bang' moment - overwhelming force and dealing with the problem quickly. He gathers power and artifacts, just in case he ever needs. He's cautious, and grinds more than he thinks will be necessary before entering a new area.

Raeni, the female protagonist, is a social manipulator. She's ambitious, and surrounds herself with friends - useful ‘friends'. She has little to no true physical power of her own; that's why she avoids situations that would make that be a disadvantage. She plays her true cards close to the chest, and switches out faces depending on who she's interacting with.

Looming over the world is a dark mountain. Weird things happen around it, forces swirl and strange, unpredictable phenomena appear. There's been no shortage of adventurers trying to approach it over the years, but the expeditions become rarer and rarer the longer it sits there, still and silent - only the bravest and most foolhardy venture there.

There is also an epically powerful homunculus who makes their home in some hidden location. They have been around for long enough that legends have grown about them; how they are knowledgeable of many of the world's mysteries. They are also a common target for adventurers to track down - and those who claim to have met the homunculus bear wonderful gifts and strange wisdom.

So yeah: what interests you about these ideas? What would you like to see in a story such as this?


** Heroes are generally defined by their flaws, and character growth is generally about overcoming those flaws.

If I had to take a stab at it based on those initial sketches, Avery's flaw is that he's overcautious, and he would complete his arc of character growth by doing something reckless in service of a thing that he loves (whether that's a person or an idea). Raeni's flaw is that she's ambitious, or possibly that she lacks empathy, and she would complete her arc of character growth by throwing away a position of power in service of a thing that she loves (whether that's a person or an idea).

If I were sketching out a completely standard story, they would meet each other, find an attraction in things that they shouldn't be attracted to, and eventually have a falling out before coming back together at the completion of their character arcs. The homunculus are a narrative stop on the story path which leads up and into the mountain, and they're the place where the characters increase in power, and where Chekov's gun is handed to them. (Standard isn't derogatory - it's the standard because it works.)

If I were sketching out a less standard story, only one character would complete their character arc in full - the other would complete their arc by succumbing to their flaw, making one half of the story a tragedy and turning a one-time protagonist into an antagonist. I might also swap the genders (which would make the characters more atypical), remove any hint of romance, etc. I don't actually know if you intend a pairing here, but standard storytelling for two protagonists suggests it.

Okay, so things that interest me:

- What's at the heart of the dark mountain?
- What are the characters' internal conflicts? What's the source of their flaws? (Avery's brother died while they were out in the woods, which is a part of why he treads so lightly. Raeni was betrayed by an early lover, which is a part of why she keeps up her false faces.)
- How does magic actually work? You talk about it in terms of simple power, but what are we talking about here? Do the characters control swarms of small pearlescent creatures which are visible only with their third eye open? Do they bond to a material to give them power over it? Do they scream "Fireball!" at the top of their lungs while depleting their mana pool? (Magic is a really easy thing to get wrong, especially if you're figuring out what it can do on the fly. I strongly suggest mapping it out before writing too much.)
- What motivates the homunculi to give out their gifts and wisdom? What's their connection with the mountain, if any?

** First, this sounds too much like a videogame or paper-thin action movie trope pile. Terminology from videogames also seeps in, and that isn't a good thing unless played relentlessly and with great skill. There is very little in this list of ideas that hasn't been done before precisely as presented. Putting the elements together isn't enough to make it interesting to me, or I feel most experienced readers, and certainly isn't enough to make it rational fiction. I think a lot of what is actually interesting to you about these elements maybe isn't being communicated.

Or you are simply a boring person.

I'll assume there are things missing from this presentation, as well as conceptual gaps related to storytelling and rational fiction in general, and so I'll attempt to ferret out those elements through careful questioning -- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yjc41/metabst_ideas_are_cheap_writing_is_hard_can_we/][as was discussed in the original thread on this topic]].

Before that, this is where I'm coming from in my evaluation and questioning of these ideas.

--------------

Rational fiction characters need to be driven by real human goals (assuming characters are human). What they do in the story is possibly all we see, but it needs to come from somewhere strongly grounded in human motivations and goals. Real people don't simply go around "adventuring" and fighting dangerous beasts just to get better at it.

Those who do similar things in real life have complicated reasons, usually don't have to do it to make a living, and are even able to be in that situation because they have absurd technological advantages that make it less of a fair fight and more of a slaughter. They don't get more arbitrarily powerful from doing so, other than sometimes monetarily. They are usually working outside the law and would arrested for poaching or worse if found out.

A world where people /do/ get more powerful from "adventuring", finding lost treasures, and killing dangerous "monsters" (or where such even existed) wouldn't look like a feudal fantasy world.

Rational worlds need realistic reactions from people and societies to in-world things. People won't act like historically and sociologically sound medieval peasants, or RenFaire villagers, if there /actually is/ a fire-breathing dragon, a horde of angry orcs, or an evil necromancer living nearby. Having big, scary threats doesn't work like in videogames. People would just avoid that shit and move away from the war zone, or the zone of strange things that kill their sons, or whatever.

Lots of questions need to be answered to make this into a world where things happen because of root causes instead of tropes. The characters seem to be driving much of the budding plot, so they need to be filled out as well. Some questions really need to be answered in the first chapter, or even the dust jacket blurb.

Questions time.

--------------

First, Avery:

- Why is what Avery does supposed to be interesting to the reader?
- What do wandering people like Avery actually /do/?
- What differentiates Avery from a murderous, kleptomaniacal hobo?
- Is this a one-orc-per-square-mile world that Avery is working in? If so, /how/?
- What are "artifacts"?
- What is "power"?
- Why "artifacts" and "power"? What are they needed for in his life?
- Why is being cautious important? Is it a positive trait in this world? Why?
- Can anyone use artifacts to gain power? If you kill Avery, can you take his? If so, why hasn't this happened already?
- How much tougher than a non-wandering, non-artifact boosted person is Avery?
- How /specifically/ does that affect the way the world works? It certainly won't somehow look like historical societies from medieval Europe or East Asia, or the modern world, just /plus magic/.
- What is an "area"? Sounds like some videogame logic seeping in.

--------------

Next, Raeni:

- Why is Raeni an interesting character? What about her situation is supposed to be interesting?
- What does she do? That's even vaguer right now than with Avery. What is interesting /specifically/ about her life?
- Why is this focused character attribute of using her friends important?
- Why is Raeni acting in this way interesting?
- What power does she have that people accept this behavior from her? This isn't high school. Everyone over 13 has seen this trait list in books and movies before, or experienced it directly. People compare notes, especially in smaller, feudal style living conditions or tight-knit modern interest groups. Non-Protagonist Characters aren't allowed to simply carry the idiot ball, after all.
- What is the difference in "physical power" between people with and without "artifacts" and what I assume is magic?
- Do artifacts exist that make you more "physically powerful", and if so why does this character attribute matter to a powerful and connected individual?
- Why is "physical power" important in anything but a crapsack, Mad Max world where you have to murder someone for breakfast with your bare (or depending on mutation levels, "bear") hands every day?
- Is this a crapsack, Mad Max world where you have to murder someone for breakfast with your bare hands every day?
- Why should anyone care about her "cards" (i.e. goals) and why do they matter to the plot?

--------------

Now, the mountain:

- /Looming over the world is a dark mountain-/ Nope. Just no. There needs to be a hell of a turn on this idea for it to be acceptable. The entire story needs to be about why this is an awesome idea to make it even slightly interesting. Maybe played absolutely /to the hilt/ this would pass muster. Not otherwise.
- Okay, fine. How long has this...mountain been happening? When did it start being strange?
- What does it mean for it to "loom over the world"? A planet the size of the Earth is literally wholly aware of a single normal sized mountain? Or just a single pseudo-feudal kingdom with 1400s technology?
- What are "adventurers" and why do they adventure around this mountain instead of being traveling merchants moving trade goods around (for example) anywhere else in the world?
- Why the hell would anyone go near a mountain full of apparently human-calibrated affective warning signs? Why don't people just leave the mountain alone?
- What reward would possibly be worth the risks?
- Why hasn't an army or wizard's guild or /something/ organized either quarantined or neutralized it by now?
- Do those things (armies, groups of powerful wizards, etc.) not exist? Why?

--------------

The obvious MacGuffin:

- Why is this character interesting to the reader?
- Why a "homunculus"?
- What do /they/ want?
- Why would they seek out a hidden location, and why would they reward people who have tracked them down after doing that?
- What do the protagonists want from interacting with a world with this character in it? How does the MacGuffin realistically intersect with the lives of the protagonists?
- Why hasn't an organized group formed to track down an individual who apparently only gives people good things? At least, those who report back...
- How do legends grow around about someone without localizing them better? Why isn't that area then swarming with people looking for them?
- How does this world have mysteries interesting enough to note in this highly suggestive way, exactly?
- Why would seeking out a legendarily hard to find person on the off chance they'll tell you some of them be better in any way than just going out to discover those mysteries yourse-...oh, is /that/ what adventurers are doing?!

--------------

That there is the sort of thing I do when working on a story. It's a lot of critical stuff and it might look negative overall, but that's because there's so much left unexplained -- things don't logically follow from what you wrote, other than in cliched, uninteresting ways.

After all this, I still think you've got something worth working on. Just...make it more /obviously/ interesting to other people. Highlight the awesome. Answer mine and similar questions about the world and character motivations and you've just about got a plot just from the logical intersections so formed.

My one very strong suggestion is, flip genders on Avery and Raeni but /keep the names the same./ They are not strongly gendered names, after all. As for the why, having a powergaming loner Indiana Jones character be a woman, and making the weak (?!) Diplomancer taking advantage of "friends" be a man shakes things up and makes the characters much more interesting. It defies expectations from the very start. The other way around, and without further rationalization and justification, is really cliched and borderline sexist with the attributes and emphasis given.

** The nature of masks.

You say Raeni switches out faces depending on who she's with. What I'm wondering is, how much of any given face is real, and how much of it is a fabrication? People take on different behavioral patterns around different people after all, but can any of them truly be considered false?

What about her feelings towards her friends? How much does she think she values them, and how much does she think she's using them? Does she care for any of them more than she thinks she does, or does she thinks she cares for them more than she actually does? Does she ever show acts of genuine affection? Is it possible to show genuine affection when you know that you're at least partly doing it for your own gain?

As she deceives more and more, as she becomes more accustomed to those patterns of behavior, does she become comfortable with that behavior? Does it feel more natural to her than if she were to act how she used to act? Where does the act end and the "real" person begin?

** Sounds like the hook for a D&D campaign. I would play.

The characters seem a bit generic. I would like to see the genders reversed, making the female lead a wanderer cautious wanderer with a power fix, while the male lead relies on manipulation and favors over physical might.
