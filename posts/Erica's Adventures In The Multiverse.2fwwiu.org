** Thank you very much for posting this! I am the author. After reading Harry Potter and parts of HPMOR to my young daughter, I had a wish for more YA science fiction with female protagonists. Fortunately, I had already concocted the beginnings of a plot, as part of a "fulfillment game" I had constructed to help Heather learn the Methods of Rationality. EAITM is that game translated into novel form. The most consistent piece of feedback I've received so far is, "I'm hooked and I desperately want to know what happens next!" I hope you enjoy it.

Every day since Erica Anders Singleton moved with her family from Manhattan to Quibbletown, New Jersey, has been wrong. In her earlier life she was a gifted student in a school for gifted students; now she's a weirdo in a school full of "normal" kids, where the worst thing you can be is Different. To make things worse, Erica has a secret: the power to see into the multiverse and change the future. And now that the school has been taken over by the strange, dead-eyed teacher, Mr. White, she just may need to break the world, in order to save it...

*** I read it, but to be honest I did a lot of skimming in the early pages, I feel like you need more dialogue, something actually happening, closer to the beginning. Once the side-seeing started to get explained I was interested. Then at that point I felt there could have been a little bit /more/ explanation of why she has this power she has never used, not even once. To make it a little more believable she'd never experiment, to make it more believable why this time she would.

But I did get interested, I'd have kept reading but I caught up to the in progress part!

** I liked a lot of the story so far. My tentative assumption is that the story is actually about a simulated reality (hence, antibodies->maintainer of simulation, vs. presumably viruses).

I feel like Erica's characterization is inconsistent - it feels like sometimes she's a reasonably intelligent 18-to-22 year old with a series of really odd interests, and other times she's a fairly standard 9-year-old.

The simulation hypothesis suggests a logical explanation of the various place names and reasons for the more fantastical setting elements (e.g. this is a simulation of what a AI takeoff could look like, set up because of quibblers, hence Quibbletown etc. Honestly, if that is what you're going for, a bit more subtlety might be called for - unless it's a red herring and the truth /really is/ 'aliens' or similar, I see no reason for a simulationist to present labels like that internal to the simulation seemingly simply to point out that is in fact a simulation. Also, the idea that White has less AI to him and his existence outside school than a 2014 Sim or Skyrim NPC seems slightly silly all things considered.

The guess about the simulation is sort of preventing a lot of criticism of the setting and realism of certain characters' actions etc. I can't really say "this portrayal is obviously silly/unrealistic/etc" when the setting is supposed to be unreal in very obvious ways.

To other readers: Turning off javascript for the page while reading turns off all the "suggestions for editing stuff" along the side of the page, improving page performance and removing distractions, so I recommend doing that while reading esp. if you have e.g. noscript installed. Click on the "single page" text at the bottom of the first chapter to get the whole thing in one page instead of broken up into many small pages for no reason (first chapter only - later chapters are presented whole by default)

*** Thank you! I'm very interested in your comment: "The guess about the simulation is sort of preventing a lot of criticism of the setting and realism of certain characters' actions etc. I can't really say "this portrayal is obviously silly/unrealistic/etc" when the setting is supposed to be unreal in very obvious ways."

Not spoiling whether anything's a simulation or not: If it seems "obvious it's a simulation" because certain settings or actions seem silly, that's probably a writing fail!!

If you feel like giving me more detailed criticism of places where the setting and action strikes you as unrealistic (aside from the name "Quibbletown", which is more or less a [[http://www.njplaygrounds.com/6842/quibbletown-park-piscataway/][real place]]), I would welcome it!

** It feels very creepy to read about actual people in a fiction story. Don't like.
