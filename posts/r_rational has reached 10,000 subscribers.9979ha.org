*** I wonder what some of those spikes re from. The one in September seems especially odd to me.

I /don't/ wonder about a few of those spikes. I don't think it's much of a coincidence that this sub gets a lot more views when MoL updates.

**** I still find it depressing how hardly anyone else reads rational fiction. Are there any other fiction genres that are this obscure? You'd think someone would have popularized the genre by now by publishing a good non-fanfic work offline. There are a lot of genuinely intelligent people out there who would undoubtedly enjoy reading stories with genuine portrayals of intelligence. It's one of my biggest passions and I can't talk about it with ANYONE out in the real world.

***** It might not be called rational fiction, but any work with good enough worldbuilding is 3/4 of the way there. I would argue that the most popular rational story is The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. Otherwise, we have many stories that try to be intelligent, some of which succeed, some of which don't. They're not generally found in the fantasy genre though.

******* How so? I feel they are very rational. With good worldbuilding and holding to logic above plot. Plenty of intelligent characters and systems. They're not /rationalistisc/ fiction, true. But that has much stricter requirements.

**** I think I can mention my experience, since I joined around September:

I found Mother of Learning trough a friend recommending it to me last year. After reading the whole thing, I went to tv troupes to see if I could find a few new troupes to search other works from. That in turn netted me the "RationalFic" troupe that mention one other fic (HPMOR) that I've read before and has this sub linked on the description. One glance at the sub wiki recommended list was more than enough to convince me that this was what I was looking for.

** Sadly I don't think the number of active subscribers is increasing. This is just a way of eyeballing if active subscribers is increasing, but the most recent top-all-time posts on this sub are all at least two months old until you go a fair way down. And the only two things that are highly upvoted lately are Worth the Candle updates and Mother of Learning updates.

**** If the sub is growing, then recent posts will get more upvotes easier. The quality of a post at sub num 8000 could be the same as a post at sub num 10000, but sub num 10000 should get a whole 25% more votes, a pretty dramatic difference. A really amazing post from 2 years ago could stay up longer, but if it's just stuff like chapter updates, if the sub's growing more recent chapter updates should almost always have more upvotes.

Although I've been going into some other subreddits to try to gather proof, and the results are not matching my expectations, so it seems like something's wrong with my hypothesis, or Reddit's changed some algorithm around or something.

***** As someone who has been posting most of MoL chapters here for the past year I can say that the number of upvotes is slowly rising. A year ago a good MoL chapter ended up with ~150 karma, today we hover at 200, and even broke 300 mark a couple months ago. However reddit sorts the posts is of little relevance, I think.
