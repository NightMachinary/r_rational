*** Note the wording:

#+begin_quote
  They were the First Prince's primary opposition within Procer, though, so I suspected she would not be shy about spending their lives to damage my position.
#+end_quote

This implies that whatever their negotiations were about, the concentration of the rival princes in the host isn't a part of any kind of deal.

By the way, seeing as she isn't using the Observatory for the negotiations, and Thief was needed to deliver the means of communication rather than the message itself, I have an out-there guess. What if the glamoured body double Cat was talking about with Vivienne isn't for her, but for Catherine herself, to negotiate with Cordelia "in person", like the Empress did in Liesse?

**** oh, now I get why the Paladin claimed glamour on cat, but if that was just a body double and was still able to overpower 3 heroes (with help) and zombify at least one, cat is indeed a terrifying force.

***** No, no, you got it backwards: I meant that Thief caried in her satchel a glamour-created copy of Catherine, who can now, similarly to Malicia in Swan Song, talk to Cordelia once a month (for now I'm assuming that's because, like with portal opening, there are arcane reset points for that power, only instead of sunrise it's a coming of a moonless night).

Paladin bullshitted his way through the glamour because otherwise he'd lose. Maybe Cat set it up that way, so her new undead puppet wouldn't be just a straight up bruiser.

A body double, winch I bet is made of ice, that cat can use as his own.

*** From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Tapirs have brachyodont, or low-crowned teeth, that lack cementum. Their incisors are chisel-shaped, with the third large, conical upper incisor separated by a short gap from the considerably smaller canine. A much longer gap is found between the canines and premolars, the first of which may be absent.

  If there was one thing to love about Masego, it was that he could easily be side tracked by technicalities. I was getting fairly good at that, these days.
#+end_quote

Please tell me that's not just an offhand remark and Catherine is actively learning how to get around the letter of the promises that bind her, and not just me expecting a "deal with a fairy" story even in a chapter where it doesn't really belong.

** It seems likely Cat will have to fight the demon. It's built in as a red herring but it very neatly fits into her story - she's already fought other demons that were comparatively easier to deal with. This could be a final boss type of demon.

*** Alternatively, if heroes fight it and and one of them gets an Aspect out of that fight, it may well be a silver bullet against Cat. The demon is: 1) an otherworldly entity with a gaggle of other otherworldly entities (bonus points if heroes banish them by abusing their bindings, since magical binding Aspect is one of the means of control over fairies Catherine inherited from Akua); 2) a being of Absense, which is similar to the idea Winter is built around; 3) a demon with a mental background effect on Creation, overcoming which may allow the heroes to also work around the glamour (Catherine's latest and most versatile tool).

Elaborating on the last poiint: the lands of Yan Tei were said to have disappeared from the histories for two centuries because of a demon of Absense, and apparently returned relatively whole and well. That points to it having effects that affect the living more than the Creation itself (like Madness or Apathy), and not just some irreversible effects on the world (like Time and Order). While it probably has the latter too, the former is a good setup for an emergence of an Aspect like Discern.

**** or if the theory that cat can use Akua's ability thanks to have her bidden to her will (and coat/necklace), could mean she now gets to use demons against her enemies, that would be a line that so far, cat has avoided.

** It is intensely weird that the Proceran army has a batallion of heroes...but none of them are in command OR good enough at magic to help with the ritual. Maybe commander abilities are generally associated with the Gods Below, while Heroes tend to be individual fighters What do these folks do?

*** That's because the army with the unruly princes was kept separate from the top secret magical superweapon years in the making. They only marched to the pass when Papenheim gave the command to start digging.

And yeah, unless it's a strategist kind of Name, heroes are more likely to fight in the front ranks and inspire the soldiers with their example. The Aspects of heroes are more likely to affect themselves or be some kind of personal direct tool, while the Aspects of villainsare more often about affecting other people.
