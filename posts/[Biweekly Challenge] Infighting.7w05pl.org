[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7sqylx/biweekly_challenge_pioneer/][Last time]], the prompt was "Pioneer". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7sqylx/biweekly_challenge_pioneer/dt7m9jx/]["108 Terabytes Per Second"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]] for their seventh win!

This time, the challenge will be *Infighting*. Write a story about two (or more) people (or groups) who are theoretically on the same side having some sort of conflict with each other. This conflict doesn't /necessarily/ have to be to the detriment of their mutual goals/values, but that's what I personally would do with it. Note that two agents with conflicting goals/values in conflict to the detriment of the goals/values they claim to be (or are paid to be) working for is another tack you might take. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, February 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

Next time, the challenge will be *The Mentor*. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype][The mentor archtype]] is one of the oldest tropes in fiction, for some pretty obvious reasons (while we all love autodidacts, they don't tend to be great at providing exposition within a story). I think there's a good opportunity to use mentors as an exploration of how we learn, and from whom. "Mentor" here can be abstract, and need not refer to a master/apprentice relationships; you can choose to focus on a luminary, if you'd like. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 2/21*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7w27vk/challenge_companion_infighting/][is available here.]]
