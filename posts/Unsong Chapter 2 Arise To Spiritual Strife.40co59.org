I am head-over-heels in love with using these randomly generated mixtures of programming and King James as chapter openers. It seems to sell everything about the story in fantastically tiny bits.

** Oh well. Some more world building, no plot progression. Had to happen at some point :P Looking forward to discussion with Ana (or alternatively the congregation getting swatted)

*** It is literally the second chapter... I think the progression is just fine, especially once the story is finished and someone reads it as a whole, it just feels slow because it is a weekly serial.

**** Yeah, I wrote this with the same pacing as other novels I like, and I didn't realize it would seem slow as a serial. This was a mistake and I'll know for next time. Honestly it's not going to speed up much for a few weeks, but after that you guys should be a /little/ happier.

***** (Go go gadget unsolicited advice!)

Serial fiction has more in common with television than it does with novels. Readers tend to like (and expect) little self-contained stories that push along the bigger plot or are all contained by themselves. So I thought this was a good chapter, but it's a good novel chapter; from the episodic perspective, not that much actually happened. We had worldbuilding, background, and a Chekov's Gun (possibly a few), but our over-arching plot didn't advance and we didn't have a mini-plot either.

Assuming that next two chapters occur during the same UU meeting, I think it's probable that if the text of all three had been released at once no one would say that it's slow, even though it's the same amount of plot over the same amount of text. This is probably the case even if it had just been one chapter released at a three-week interval.

(I assume there's something going on in the brain that causes us to process into episode-sized chunks without much regard for how much actual text there was.)

I enjoyed this chapter a lot. It didn't have any problems with pacing and the exposition was exciting, not boring. The only problem for me is that it cuts off right where my brain thinks that there's another two-thirds of an episode left.

****** Thanks.

For complicated reasons I can't change course now, but I'll remember this for future serial works.

(and don't worry, the UU meeting is over)

******* I don't necessarily recommend changing course based on reader feedback; you can get yourself into some awkward positions. This was the number one thing that went wrong with nostalgebraist's /The Northern Caves/ and I think it would have been better off if he'd just bitten the bullet and ignored his audience in order to tell his intended story. (I've personally wavered because of audience feedback, but it's hard to evaluate the results from the inside.)

*** We are the unfortunate few unsatisfied with tidbits released weekly. I'm having similar feelings of "DAMMIT, UPDATE FASTER, THESE ARE MERE MORSELS" with Casey Muratori's ongoing blog series at Molly Rocket regarding truly interactive fiction.

It's like heroin, except we can't have the next hit until next week! That's 1.65 microHertz!

I trust that some discussion with Ana will take place shortly before they inevitably get UNSONGed. This is the same day that he was rebuked for using an Awakening Name, you think they're not onto him?
