** While the story is awesome, what do you guys think about Hitler's death causing the non existence of computers and electronics?

Wouldn't we have discovered those things anyway?

*** We definitely would have those things - it's just a question of how delayed the technologies would be without the concerted war effort pulling people from various specialties in and giving them a lot of funding. In a parallel timeline without WWII (and it's a big leap to go from "no Hitler" to "no WWII") you would probably have the funding done by private companies, educational institutions, or a government that didn't really care that a war wasn't on and just wanted to spend some money.

The first conception of the electrical digital computer predates WWII by two years, for what it's worth.

*** regardless of the validity of that conjecture, shouldn't it be possible just to bring some data about computer back, or even found a company dedicated to developing them early? The message board obviously exists outside the timestream (somehow) so information, at the very least, can still be preserved
