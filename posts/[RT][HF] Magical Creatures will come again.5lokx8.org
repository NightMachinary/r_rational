I've reposted the [[https://sadehall.tumblr.com/index.html][text]] thus far (oh so very NSFW in there).

To make a long boring story short, I've been thinking as I post that some revisions are in order, been in the process of making them, and been distracted by family drama in the way one often is over holidays. I took the story down on (terrible) advice to take it offline while I was revising, something I now thoroughly regret, especially since I haven't till now had opportunity to make a post about what's been happening.

There will be a new post Very Soon and hopefully On Schedule with the next chapter, and a discussion maybe of certain revisions I'm considering implementing. For now the text is there for your /ahem/ reading pleasure, but shouldn't be considered any kind of definitive or canonical version until I've at least done my revisions.


** I haven't noticed any plot - relevant issues so far, assuming that there wasn't something you messed up related to worldbuilding that I don't know about.

And I do honestly read this story because I'm interested in what the characters will do and the worldbuilfing. Seriously.

** Oh sweet Sade why don't you have have a Patreon or something? I'd be happy to pay $5 / chapter, or $10 for chapters like Wham Line. This is just basically something that mashes my "happy" button at maximum force.
