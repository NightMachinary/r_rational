Until it started having irrecoverable graphics issues, I was playing /MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries/ and enjoying it a lot, with the primordial stages of a tale of a mecha pilot in a horrendous situation.

If people want to talk about it I'll make a follow-up BST post with some of the rough ideas and go from there.

So, [[/r/rational]], what do you want in a mecha story?

** I'd love to see it, because mecha are pretty much the trope codifier for Rule of Cool.

That said, you're going to have a really tough time of it. There are pretty much no conditions under which upright human tanks are the optimal combat design. Here are some of the problems you'll need to find answers to:

- Mecha are basically a giant pile of shot traps strapped together.\\
- Tanks are relatively low-lying and can hide behind terrain features pretty well. Mecha can't, unless they lie down, at which point they are just inefficiently designed tanks.
- Realistic mecha will be slow moving and their weight will put incredible strain on their joints. Fast-moving agile mecha are science fantasy.
- One of the benefits of mecha that often gets quoted is hands, but the only advantage hands have is that they allow holding / manipulating a variety of tools. A fighting machine doesn't really need a variety of tools: it needs "blow thing up" and "blow thing up more".\\
- Tanks can center-axis mount their weapons in order to absorb recoil, mecha can't unless you put it in the chest, in which case you've given up the advantage of hands. Even then, you're an unstable two-legged upright pole instead of a low-lying box with long fat treads.
- A gun built into the arm is just a tank barrel. A hand-carried gun will by necessity have a smaller ammo capacity than what a tank with equivalent technology could mount. It probably also can't hit as hard, due to needing to be more miniaturized.

Here are a couple of ideas for how you could justify having them:

- If mecha combat is a sporting event -- basically mecha gladiators for the entertainment of the masses.
- If they are built as highly mobile rough-country artillery platforms instead of as close-quarters fighters.
- If the mecha are old gladiator rigs left over from a more civilized era and now being repurposed as weapons of war because they hit hard even though they are impractical. Bonus points if they're being used by the ragtag misfit rebels against the vastly more powerful imperial troops of DarkEvil McBadGuy.
- If the mecha are actually captured exoskeletons of a much larger race, being appropriated by humans because they are the only things that hit hard enough to penetrate the other race's armor. (You then need to deal with square-cube law issues as you explain your larger aliens, and why aliens and humans are fighting in a universe that makes interstellar contact, let alone combat, extremely nonsensical.)

As far as mechs go, I can see them possibly being effective on the field, just not the most sensible investment given the costs involved with making and/or maintaining them /unless/ there's some kind of secondary motivation like propaganda, entertainment, or an idiot ruler that wants something that looks cool.

TVTropes has this to say about why Gundam managed to make mecha a sensible combat choice:

#+begin_quote
  Yoshiyuki Tomino wanted to write a Real Robot anime. However, anyone remotely familiar with either engineering or military tactics will tell you that such devices are almost impossible to effectively use; a bipedal platform is needlessly complicated, hard to properly armor, and the easiest thing to shoot at in a battlefield. Enter the Minovsky Particle: an EMP-like, sensor-jamming, delicate-electronics wrecking Plot Device that not only renders all ranged targeting and guided missiles useless, but requires Helium-3 to produce. Consequently, humans had to go to space to get Helium-3, fight old-school close combat battles using systems capable of tricky microgravity maneuvering, and eventually expand on the technology to make maintenance easier.

  Unlike previous series in the Gundam franchise which are set in the "Universal Century" timeline, Mobile Fighter G Gundam takes place in an alternate "Future Century" universe.[1][2] Within this timeline, much of mankind has abandoned a ruined Earth to live in space colonies. The countries on Earth have corresponding colonies just outside the planet's atmosphere. Rather than fight wars for political and social dominance, the colonies agree to hold a "Gundam Fight" tournament every four years. Each country sends to Earth a representative piloting a highly-advanced, humanoid mobile fighter called a Gundam. The Gundams compete with one another in one-on-one battles, under a strict set of rules, until only one fighter remains; the nation represented by the winner earns the right to rule all of space for that period.[2] Each Gundam is controlled directly by the user within the cockpit using the "Mobile Trace System", a gesture recognition and feedback mechanism whereby the Gundam mimics the pilot's own body motion, combat skills, and weapon-wielding capabilities.[1] G Gundam opens at the start of the 13th Gundam Fight in Future Century year 60 and follows Neo Japan's Domon Kasshu, fighter of his nation's Shining Gundam and bearer of the coveted "King of Hearts" martial arts crest.[1] Aside from winning the tournament, Domon's mission is to track down his fugitive, older brother Kyoji, who allegedly stole the experimental Dark Gundam from Neo Japan's government, leaving their mother dead and their father (Dr. Raizo Kasshu) to be arrested and placed in a cryogenic state.[3]

A note: "blow things up" and "blow things up /at different ranges/, /with different effects/ is more than enough to require weapon-swapping. For example, if most of the people you're fighting are RPG-toting infantry, a pack of artillery rockets is going to be next to useless compared to a bunch of machine guns, and if the main opposition is main battle tanks you want a big gun firing high-velocity long-rod penetrators. The ability to put down your giant cannon and pick up a couple rocket tubes or machine guns makes your platform significantly more flexible and effective.

A better solution is to either make sure you know what mission you're going on and use an appropriate loadout or, more likely, use a combined-arms strategy where each member of a mech lance carries a different set of weaponry for covering different situations. You can also have some general purpose weapons, like missiles. They're overkill for taking out a squad of soldiers, but they'll get the job done.

***** Yes. However, if you don't have hands or a similarly modular design, it becomes much more difficult to do that swapping even during downtime. Main battle tanks tend to have their one gun and that's it; changing it out would require disassembling the entire tank and rebuilding it. That's the situation you want to avoid. Hands aren't /necessary/ for that, but they do make it somewhat easier, particularly if you've designed them so the mecha itself can do the heavy lifting during outfitting. If you can get it to the point where the mecha alone can do the work, you now have the ability to do something like send all your guns in on trucks behind your front line so that if your mecha needs to rearm it can run back a kilometer, pick up a new gun, and run back to the fight.

As far as I can tell, the more expensive a platform is the more likely it'll be modular. A six-million-dollar tank has minimal flexibility, a twenty-million-dollar attack helicopter has a fixed gun and can mount a couple different rockets or missiles, and a thirty-million-dollar multirole fighter mounts just about everything. Basically, the more expensive something is, the less you want to have to rebuild it if you /do/ have to do something different, and the cheaper something is the easier it is to branch out by just building a bunch of different variations.

Also, modularity is more valuable the more flexible a platform has to be. The only things a tank is really designed or expected to deal with are personnel and other tanks, so they have machine guns and an anti-armor gun and that's it. A jet fighter has to do all of ELINT, air superiority, ground attack, bombing, and missile defense, so it's hugely modular. Mecha are going to be a little bit combined-arms, but they'll still be replacing a large variety of dedicated infantry support and artillery vehicles.

Agreed; humanoid is bad. Two legs are insufficiently redundant and the materials science isn't there. Hands are mostly so you can service your gun without a maintenance bay or ground crew. I'm thinking something much more like a spider tank, with a very flat body and six or eight legs around the periphery. Weapons would be mounted to a big modular turret on top of the body. The two frontmost legs would be special, with extra flexibility and manipulators so you can use them for lifting turret assemblies into place. Extra legs are there for stability (both while moving and standing still), redundancy (so you can lose a couple legs without suffering a mobility kill), maneuverability (inverted pendulum dynamics are useful, but sometimes you just want to go /that way/), and height (you want to be able to scuttle around while hull-down, and being designed to crab-walk is better than crawling).

I think there's a question of causality here. Is it more modular because it's more expensive, or it is more expensive because it's more modular? My vote goes for "more expensive because more modular".

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_United_States_military_aircraft][Wikipedia suggests]] that most aircraft are designed for a single purpose, although there are a few [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirole_combat_aircraft][multirole aircraft]].

Although, yes, fighters can typically swap out what kind of missiles their hardpoints are carrying. I'm not sure if a given hardpoint can be either a missile or a bomb, but maybe. So, yes, there's some flexibility there. Still, that's a long way from "I'm going to swap out my long range missile pack for another rack of medium lasers".

Regardless, handheld weapons are never going to be as effective for a mech as builtins. They will have a much smaller ammo capacity, and won't hit as hard due to being smaller--both because if you focus on pure power you don't focus on making the weapon small enough to be hand-held, and because the gun has less mass and a weaker mounting (hand/wrist instead of whole body) to absorb recoil.

Sure, but then you have mecha that are dependent on wheeled logistics to be able to fight. At this point you've lost much of the benefit of the mech's go-anywhere legged design, and you have a critical point of vulnerability in your weapons platform. The enemy can now soft-kill the mech, just by finding and destroying its logistics train. Which means you now need to send forces to protect the logistics train, which jacks up the effective cost of the mech in terms of both money and materiel, and reduces the tactical flexibility you gain from it, since it ties up other forces.

But, sure, maybe handheld weapons are totally the way to go because mecha need huge flexibility. I doubt it though; for the money you would spend having highly flexible hand-carried weapon mecha, you could buy a bunch more simpler mecha of various specialized kinds...or just a whole lot of tanks and planes.

** The biggest thing to take into account: realistic mecha aren't heavy armor. Instead, they're light, stealthy, mobile urban assault forces. Basically, think ground helicopter.

A mecha can't move as fast as a tank across flat ground, in the same way that a helicopter can't go in a straight line as fast as a fixed-wing aircraft. They can't carry as much payload, they are less efficient, and they aren't anywhere near as durable.

However, mecha are far more maneuverable, particularly in the ways that let you dodge behind buildings or pop up and down behind a small hill. A pile of rubble, like you'd get from a destroyed building, is an insurmountable obstacle to anything on wheels or tracks but a wide-open highway to a mecha. Balancing and crouching (shorter levers) means they can hugely vary their carrying capacity, which when combined with hands (built-in cargo cranes) lets them engage a wide variety of threats.

A typical engagement against a mecha will have it running down cross streets so that it can appear in random places to toss a single missile from its external rack and then disappear back into the mess to find another place to hit you. If anything big enough to whack it gets line of effect, it'll dodge down another street or into a building and run away. If you change what you're using to hunt it, it'll grab a weapons cache that it carried in before it engaged and come back with weapons that counter your hunters.

For a technical note, as you might already be aware the Iron Man model is implausible because it needs to violate conservation of momentum in order to not hurt the human wearing it. The smallest you can plausibly go is about twice the size of the reassembled armor Stane uses in the first movie. This can be overridden if you have it as a remote-piloted humanoid drone, which has its advantages especially in comparatively early stages of robot war adoption since you probably have a bunch of Special Forces around who can use their already-developed instincts to pilot them.

This also puts it at about twice the size of Lagann, I think. The pinballing effect it has would be a problem even if it was less cartoonishly exaggerated.

Isn't the Iron Man model plausible if you lower your expectations? I imagine armor that's just designed to keep up with the human inside it, not improving their speed at all, but doing all the carrying for them. They could be well-armored against regular bullets, and not bother trying to stop anti-tank stuff because conservation of momentum would kill the pilot anyway. Even if the end result is less powerful than a tank, you could fit more of them in a space than tanks, so the available concentration of firepower is higher. And they can go into buildings.

** My personal preference is towards super robots, so my opinion probably won't be too helpful here. For what it's worth, I don't really want to try to justify mechas at all; I'd probably try to sidestep the whole issue by setting the story in, say, a virtual-reality videogame simulation or something artificially constructed like that.

On the other hand, 'rational' doesn't always mean 'coheres to what we know about physics'- focusing on the problem-solving and analytical aspects could be just as interesting. For example, a story in which the mechas being piloted are actually stages of an alien organism's life-cycle might provide an interesting puzzle for our protagonists to slowly unravel. (This is actually an idea I've had for a long time, and I could go into more detail on this particular puzzle-setting idea if people want.)

Anyways: at the furthest end of realism is basically the story of a tank crew trying to survive in a battlefield. Choose how unrealistic you want to be by your own discretion, I suppose.
