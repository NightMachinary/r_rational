Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j1r84/d_friday_offtopic_thread/djaxnoc/][this]] question was asked, I've been thinking about furries. (weird, I know.) Currently, they still fall squarely into the "weird internet fetish" category that most people, despite their overt disgust, really don't care about one way or another.

But let's imagine a world 20 years in the future. Gene editing methods have gotten good enough that we can manipulate both DNA and gene expression to a fairly exact level. Plus, with massive advances to 3D printers, combined with the gradual fall in price of technology, it's relatively cheap to create the tools to create gene-editing retroviruses, and serums to modify and encourage gene expression. It's not easy, it's not fast, it's not legal (for private citizens), but it's cheap.

Now, the major bottleneck to recreational gene editing is the fact that retroviruses need to be personalized to individuals to have the intended effect, which in turn require the use of specialized (and very difficult to create) programs, which tend to be copyrighted by large pharmaceuticals. And with better technological methods to enforce copyright, this typically means that if you want to undergo any serious changes, you need to pony up the cash.

Still, many open-source programs exist, including, but not limited to, cure_nearsightedness.exe, glow_in_the_dark.exe, and who can forget the increase_penis_size.exe?

Most infamous among these, however, is probably furry.exe. Though it would be incorrect to say that furry.exe is "open source," per-se. Its license allows for free use. That same license, however, doesn't allow any edits to furry.exe... which in turn means that nobody has yet figured out how to undo its effects.

--------------

So to sum it up, imagine a world where people finally reach the transhumanist fantasy of relatively free control over what they look like, providing they have the cash. Most major changes are locked behind very high paywalls, although a few aren't.

What would the culture around genetic modification look like? What steps could such a society take to avoid x-risks from the easy genetic modification? With the knowledge that such a change would be permanent, how many people do you think would actually run furry.exe? What kind of subculture would the genetically modified furries adopt? For the people who had genetic modifications forced on them (for example, running furry.exe with someone else's genetic material, then administering the retrovirus to them without their consent), what would the societal reaction look like? Are there any other observations you'd make about such a society?

*** I'd think 90% of genetic modifications would be similar to plastic surgery; people would get it done, then mostly pretend that they had always been that way, and the polite thing to do would be to maintain that fiction. Hidden utility modifications probably fall in here as well, since they're not out in the open and you don't need to explain them to anyone. (/e.g. lipostat correction to kill hunger and let people slim down, modifications to give people clear skin, removal of unwanted hair, darkening or lightening skin color/)

Another 9% would be semi-transgressive but still within the norms of traditional beauty. I'm thinking things that today would be accomplished by rather expensive/uncomfortable/rare cosmetics. (/e.g. heterochromia, skin color modifications to make 'genetic tattoos', non-standard eye colors, non-standard hair color/)

And then that leaves 1% for flat-out social transgression. These would be the kind of thing you'd see on [[/r/genemodfails]], or posted to future-Buzzfeed's '10 Worst applications of genemodding'. Stuff where people would cluck their tongues and talk about how obviously that person doesn't ever want a job (though if the cost is high enough that might be a somewhat nonsensical criticism). These would be the equivalent of getting a full-face tattoo or an extreme body modification. (/e.g. furries, genemods that alter digestion to make someone a full carnivore or vegan, gills, green skin, etc./)

I don't anticipate a riot of transhuman variety, at least not until several generations have passed. Norms are pretty powerful things and hard to break, even if the technology exists to do so. Anyone thinking about getting a genemod would have to think about how their day to day life is affected, including going to the pharmacy, walking down the street, or standing in line at the DMV.

*** The novel [[https://smile.amazon.com/Kismet-Watts-Martin-ebook/dp/B01MY02OXB][Kismet]] is essentially that, though with people who have chosen to become hybrids living mostly in habitats on the frontier of the solar system to get away from a more prejudiced inner system.

The novel is interesting in that its take on transhumanism could almost be a metaphor for transgendered people- it mentions "species dysphoria", for example, and portrays "cisforms"- unmodified humans- as being torn between their discomfort with the hybrids and a desire to be accepting, with conservatives decrying the entire thing as evidence of the degeneration of society.

For a small-press book, it's also pretty well written.

*** I really love this idea. Like what if your father is super rich and buys a program which has the ability to customize genetics from a big corp, and you find it one day? Who's to say a custom-purchased program would have all those safeties so it only affects the one person it was installed on? What if a kid has enough similarity to your genes in the sections the virus checks safety for?

Bug-testing programs is hard enough. But bug-testing a retrovirus so it only targets one person? The first and second generations it's gonna be terrible with lots of ruined lives.

What if you as a male kid have a female twin, and your parents get you both little 'tune up' viruses and mix them up? This would make a good fic for exploring gender identity as well as sexuality on top of furry-ness.

*** That's kinda similar to how it works in my cyberpunk worldbuilding project, though less via genetics (which is relevant rather to Designer Babies and prenatal modifications) and more with advanced plastic surgery aided with biological and cybernetic implants. As for furries, their lifestyle and subculture, they are are similar to Real Life furry fandom though they don't need to create any fursonas or avatars anymore. Also they are kinda similar to LGBT community, as like the latter ones furries celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. Not really common, but also not the weirdest of transhuman subcultures.

Going back to your idea, how would introducing major genetic alterations in an adult human look like? Because retroviruses alone probably wouldn't be enough.

**** Several applications of retroviruses, I'd imagine. The first application modifies some cells to become stem cells, another application tells the stem cells to replicate across the body, another application modifies the stem cells into their intended type of target cell, another application modifies cells to release hormones to activate the stem cells, and a final application cleans up remaining hormone-producing and stem cells.

Of course, that would only be for a simple modification, like increasing the amount of hair producing cells on a balding man's scalp. A more complex modification (furry.exe for example) would have more steps, and steps that overlap each other to save time.

I think it should be possible to induce some pretty profound changes just with retroviruses, but as I said in the OP, it would take a long time.

Which means you've only got /one/ target output?

I don't imagine many people would use it, under that scenario. I think most people who would be interested in using such a thing would have their own, unique idea of the perfect "target form", so to speak.

The /original/ would probably be set to the target form of the original writer of the software (either that or the person who paid the original writer and thus got to dictate such things), so I imagine there would quite possibly be /one/ user.

Anyone else? They're not turning into their fantasy image. They're turning into someone else's.

--------------

At the same time, it's hard to imagine that there wouldn't be a widely customisable GPL'd open-source editor (which would probably get you many similar effects - but that license does allow edits by its very nature). There, I think you'd get a few people willing to try various exotic bodies - some on a temporary basis. (We're not talking a percent. Or even a tenth of a percent. I'm thinking a vanishingly small fraction of humanity - best measured in parts per million, perhaps). There might be enough for a /single/ community somewhere, I guess. (So we're not just talking subculture, we're talking subculture of displaced people).

Having irreversible modifications forced on you would probably qualify as assault. (I'm thinking jail terms, fines, therapy for the victim, possible ostracism of said victim by family and former friends...)

Not unless you pay a company do specifically develop a gene mod that changes an arbitrary person back into you (because simply copying your DNA won't result in the correct gene expression.)

Though you can do stuff like, for furry.exe specifically, "reduce_hair.exe" and "make_nose_smaller.exe or whatever. Still, you won't get a perfect reversion, and in all likelyhood I think having so many gene mods stacked on top of you could be pretty harmful in the long run.

I mean, even something as innocent as your example "increase_penis_size.exe" could also contain genes for murderous rage. These genes may be slow acting and so difficult to catch. And so one year after "increase_penis_size.exe" comes out, society has degenerated into a murder fest.

** So, the zombie thread made me think of how I had the concept that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/66ar64/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dghrqxr/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][my vampires could become zombies under the right conditions]] (the thread is very, very long but the first couple of posts will give you tons of background, and I'm going to tl;dr below).

TL;DR: My Vampires regenerate like starfish, and the regeneration is based in the heart (probably). So if you cut the heart into lots of pieces, you grow that many entire new bodies.

This includes a new brain. The pulp horror implication is that the brain is a "blank human brain" with vampire instincts, so it lacks higher executive function but wants to seek blood. Basically a pulp zombie! Awesome coincidence.

Then my partner pointed out that a "blank human brain" wouldn't be able to do things like walk since that requires growth (which vampires can only do consciously), so you end up with two choices:

1) Copy of time-of-turning brain or of time-of-heart-cutting-brain: the vampirification process backs up the brain state, which then grows back as it was when the vampire turned; or the vampire's brain is constantly backed up so it's a clone of the vampire when you did the heart thing

2) Worse-than-infant brain: maybe the zombie twitches a bit, but ultimately it's powerless, but perhaps useful as a body double

So, the thread I linked above discusses this and basically determines that #1 is too powerful since you can make a clone army.

Then I realised: My Vampires, when devoid of human blood, "lose their higher functions" and become automatons seeking out blood - i.e. zombie!!!! So, a "clone" wouldn't have any blood human in its system, so it would seem like a zombie. It wouldn't have higher functions.

I like this: it means that /you are creating a clone of yourself/, putting it through miserable /starvation/, and /not realising that it actually feels/. AND I get to have my zombies.

Plus, staking works, so vampires will stake their clones to "store them", and they'll end up kind of going insane anyway from a combination of hunger and not being able to move.

The problem: *is this too easy to figure out, and thus too powerful*?

Like, "cut out a piece of your heart and leave it somewhere dark for a month and then it grows into a clone" seems like it's not intuitive: but if you cut your arm off and it grows back, how long before you start trying to figure out what grows back under what conditions? (You can create other vampires "the old fashioned way", to experiment on). Would vampires figure out that feeding their clone makes them "normal" again? I mean, it only takes a vampire to leave its clone in a dungeon with say a human servant, the servant to get curious about the clone and unstake it, get bitten, and then the clone is /maybe/ cogent again (unless "it goes insane from not being able to move", which seems a bit of a cop-out, and even if it /did/ go insane from not being able to move for centuries, it would probably be saner than a blood-seeking automaton which might make its master ask questions)

I think, in the great tradition of its thread, writing this out has caused me to reflect enough that I need to stay with #2 (worse-than-infant brain), because #1 would probably have been exploited by now.

Anyway, if you have any thoughts, feel free.

This should reduce the number of people who are willing to mess with hearts for the heck of it, and also reduce the number who are able to.

EDIT: Alternately, it has been exploited before (how much have you already decided on, with regard to the big war that happened?) and the old vampires now intentionally circulate false information to dissuade the younger vampires and kill anyone who gets too nosy.

**** I've decided on almost nothing, war-wise, and it might be useful for the survivors to use vampire-doubling to increase the world vampire population, but if it gets widely used, that could be a problem; then again, a clone of The Main Vampire (William), being a reboot of a dark age general-king's brain in the 1600s, slowly becoming accustomed to modern life, is pretty neat. I'm not sure how they'd stop any impersonation from happening, though.

I'm also coming to terms with a "mass turning" and "vampire classrooms" in the early days. I never pictured William doing such a thing, but those were desperate times and it may have been a requirement.

It would result in young vampires having their patrons in their styles: "from the line of Guillaume" or similar. I'd like that: the Human Love Interest would just assume they were like surnames.... Yeah, I'm getting into this.

I figure vampires get benefit from having a sufficiently large population which is why they'd be motivated to expand it: being able to look out for each other, trade secrets against the other supernatural beasties, and and so on.

I never considered pain as being a useful limiter, but that has the potential to work out VERY nicely. Thank you.

***** Not just that. If the vampire has to be held down while someone else messes with his heart, there's the issue of /trust/. Precisely because his heart is so central, the person doing the messing about can stake him, then drag his frozen body onto the roof and wait for dawn.

In short, pain aside, in attempting to make a clone the vampire is deliberately making himself /vulnerable/. Most villains have trust issues - so that could also limit the use of clone armies quite significantly.

Incidentally, growing from 800 to 40k over 300 years at a constant growth rate requires about a 1.3125% average per-year growth; which means only (average-wise) around ten-and-a-half new vampires in the first year; and at the end of that period, around 525 new vampires per year.

This isn't especially important as I haven't committed to anything, to be honest, but either way, something resembling the above will make sense with a constant growth rate model and also with a culling model; additionally, younger vampires could be more likely to reproduce, etc.

Working with a constant steady growth rate between those points, you'd have 5656.854 vampires (working on averages) which would imply a maximum of 14.142% vampires older than 150 by 1900 (and that's assuming none of those vampires die and are replaced in the interim).

So, in short, your percentage of superold vampires likely needs to go down a bit, your percentage of medium-old vampires should probably be in the 10-15% range, and most will therefore be under 150.

Here's what I have on vampire demographics (written in a /Dune/-like appendix style, so it's in first person and in the present day):

#+begin_quote
  In Australia, as best as I have been able to determine, the ratio seems to be approximately 300,000 humans to 1 vampire, though this ratio is higher in cities (approximately 700,000:1) and lower in the country (100,000:1). It seems that vampires are willing to accept lower ratios of prey in exchange for a larger territory, though my research indicates this varies extensively based on the individual.

  A crude estimate based on the 300,000:1 ratio I've observed indicates a world vampire population of 23,000. However, if we take into account world urbanisation figures, the vampire population could be as high as 40,000 (5,000 urban / 35,000 rural). In Australia, the vampire population is likely to be about 100, total (20 urban / 80 rural).

  Vampire population is stratified. Only about 800 vampires (3%) were born before the year 1700. Young vampires are often killed by the elders for violating their inscrutable social rules, so the average age of everyone else is less than a hundred.

  The elders all seem to know one another and to be on reasonably friendly terms. From what I have been able to determine, the youngest of these would have been turned around the year 1500 or possibly even earlier. As the elders are not chatty, there has been little luck in finding out what happened. It's worthy to note that this is when vampire mythology as we know it took hold in Eastern Europe.

I'm not committed to any of this, and I'm not committed to a world vampire population: I worked out the density of vampires I would imagine in my home state, and extrapolated those densities to world figures, since that's what the author (Fiona, the ex-werewolf lawyer) would have done.

The rapid growth of vampires since 1500 would be enough to make the average vampire age less than 100 even without young vampire deaths...

Then it's entirely reasonable for her figures to be wrong, should it somehow become plot-critical.

****************** Okay, I [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ioo90KR3IeK2SWSGx0L1eak39gZ_r5CuxJtd4Vhm500/edit?usp=sharing][worked out how to make one myself]]!

It looks like if we assume that we start with 800 vampires in the year 1700, and end up with 20,000 vampires in 1900, reproducing exponentially and then reproducing linearly between 1900 and 2000 to get 40,000 vampires, we get a distribution that matches my thoughts pretty well:

World population: 45k

1900-2017: 25k (56%)

1800-1900: 16k (36%)

1700-1800: 3.2k (7%)

Pre-1700: 800 (2%)

Assuming exponential the whole way, we end up with 100k vampires in the year 2000 and 131k vampires in 2017: I think this is too many, but it's good to know that as a ceiling that we're still looking at something along the lines of "the vampire population has not had time to recover since 1700"

******************* The switch from exponential to linear is probably significant. Population growth is almost always exponential, and even a complete agreement by all vampires to tone the conversions down a lot would merely result in /slower/ exponential growth.

/Linear/ growth sounds rather like a senior vampire decided that enough was enough, laid down the law, and made it clear that there will be no more than X new vampires in any given year, on pain of rather severe pain.

******************** Yeah, I was trying to hammer it out with my husband last night (pillow talk with a mathematician and an engineer...) and he's got this differential equation with grass-rabbit-fox to model predator/prey/etc demographics. So he's going to work something out for me, I think. I figure as the vampires get more dense, they're going to get noticed more, killed by hunters more, etc. So it'll attenuate the growth somewhat.

Then again, a world population of 130,000 vampires (exponential growth assuming 800 vampires in 1700 and 20,000 in 1900) is perfectly serviceable. The demographics shake out differently:

World population: 130k

1900-2017: 110k (85%)

1800-1900: 16k (12%)

1700-1800: 3.2k (2.5%)

Pre-1700: 800 (0.5%)

Much like my ill-advised "uniform distribution of vampire ages who survived The Big Catastrophe of 1700" plan, I'm probably going to have to get more specific. I also did some demography with world population in 1700 to work out where the vampires would have been drawn from as a rough approximation.

(Fun fact: randomly generated an age and ethnicity for William's ex-girlfriend who'll appear in Volume 2 which I'm beginning to get an itch to start writing, and by virtue of the RNG she's the 20th oldest vampire in the world (!!!!!! Valuable ally ahoy!!!!!!!) and originally from Korea. Reading some Korean creation myths has given me some fun thoughts for her character, which is excellent: there was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungnyeo][a bear who became a woman]] after staying out of sunlight and eating a lot of garlic... very interesting parallel to vampirism).

That said: given that of the 800 Elders, my story is likely going to introduce <5, I don't really think the specific distribution matters all that much since you won't have enough characters to do meaningful statistics, but maybe it's a good idea to know the numbers?

  How long before you start trying to figure out what grows back.
#+end_quote

For me? An extremely long time.

I'd put an extraordinary effort into not having my arms cut off in the first place.

Any situation where I could get cut to bits is a situation where I could also get killed, so I want to avoid those entirely.

Missing an arm or leg would also interfere with my social disguises. It would make it hard to feed.

And, with the low vampire population you're describing, the arm regeneration thing might only be known as a creepy, vampire version of an urban legend.

The vampire who discovers this and decides to exploit it would amount to a terrifying prepper.

Starfish need food. And bodies require mass. So, this is a dude who's going "Interesting. When I soaked my severed hand in this barrel of human blood i had lying around, it scabbed up and started growing a protrusion like a stump. Let's see where this goes."

Then, terrifying vamp discovers that he can make continuously screaming clones of himself at the cost of mere barrels of blood. And he decided this is useful, just in case.

Your setup is great, and I don't think it's an excessive exploit.

Going into that dudes basement, where there are dry, hissing husks of himself would horrify vampire-me. It would be way worse for actual me.

**** If it helps any, the raw materials for regeneration come from the air, not from human blood; so it's not THAT resource intensive.

It only takes one out of THOUSANDS of vampires to want to work this out for it to be discovered and exploited; you don't even have to do it to yourself, you can turn a human into a vampire and do your experiments on them (you'll be more than strong enough to overpower a baby vampire).

The benefits? If the new brain has memories from when you were turned, why, you'll be able to get a clone army (admittedly, not with your current knowledge): or, with a suitably brainwashed mook, you can get a /better/ clone army than that, even. With exponential growth you can double your army at an astonishing rate. Yeah, they'll need humans, but at carrying capacity you can support a vampire for every 12 humans. I'm sure a feudal castle would give you plenty of chattel.

I do like the idea of vampires viewing being in the state of regrowth as unclean in some way: I never really thought about that, but it makes sense that it would have big social consequences. So you may not want to do experiments on yourself, lest people think you get in lots of fights, or something.
