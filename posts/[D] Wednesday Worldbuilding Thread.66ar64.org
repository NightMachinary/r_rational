Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So, I had this idea (actually I think it was [[/u/ccc_037]] who had it, so credit where credit's due...) that vampires can become zombies in the right conditions. But after finding out more about brains it's probably not possible. I wonder if it can be rescued?

My vampires are powered by the brain (mind) and heart (magic). They can regrow limbs and whatnot. All good. This is powered by the heart's magic.

Then we realised that there's no reason why a whole head can't grow back if the heart is damaged. So, immediate thought: it's a "blank" brain and it has only the basic vampire instincts (avoid light, seek blood). Basically, a fast zombie! Cool, huh?

Problem: Brains Don't Work That Way. The brain is made by having a lot of connections grow during infancy and then die until only "good" connections are left.

So you've got basically got two choices for the new brain:

1. Copy of the vampire's original brain (say at the time of turning), which would naturally include memories and personalities - bad because then you have young memories with old bodies, and old vampire bodies are very powerful. Bad because death is not necessarily permanent. Bad because where does the brain get "backed up"? Good because you can play with "what is the self" type things. Good because it's interesting and different to stuff I've seen before. Good because the new vampire is still dangerous. Good because the new vampire is probably scared and alone in this new world and might be easily manipulated, which can make for a good story. Good because you can see powerful vampires beheading their subordinates to "reboot" them if they know too much or get too plucky.

2. Infant brain, which cannot even control the muscles in the vampire's body. So you end up with a vampire who can't move, maybe some odd twitching, definitely can't talk. No threat to anyone. Brain can't grow as, while vampires can will their bodies to do things like heat up, grow hair, etc, if the brain doesn't work it can't will itself to grow. Good because it's kind of creepy and you can see a BBEG keeping a "zoo" of his enemies' infantile forms for intimidation (but BBEG can do the exact same thing by staking the vampires from #1). Bad because it's not dangerous at all. Good because the vampire personality is definitely dead.

I really wish there's a way I can make a zombie-like vampire work (just any sort of bloodthirsty monster really). Anyone have any ideas?

Originally I was leaning towards #2 but after writing out #1 it's probably a lot more interesting. I can also see a #1 who is staked for a few centuries slowly going insane from sensory deprivation and maybe acting like a zombie. At one point in the past, it was trendy for vampires to make "doubles" of themselves by cutting out pieces of their own hearts and letting them grow into full human size. So my main vampire has one of these things staked in a coffin in his giant storage room. But if they were #1 I think my main vampire would kill it upon realising it was him, but as he was before, because it would be horrifying to be faced by someone saying to you in the language you spoke as a child "did it work? Am I immortal?" and realising what you've done...

#+end_quote

Where does the structure and layout of cells in a dismembered arm get backed up?

Here's an idea for vampiric regeneration which should work for allowing zombies.

- The vampiric regeneration works at different speeds depending on how damaged the vampire is. The more damaged the vampire the faster it works.

- The vampiric regeneration only works on one part of the body at a time.

- The vampiric regeneration automatically prioritizes where to apply regen on the body based on the type,severity and area of the injury. Brain damage has extremely low priority.

The above means that you can easily have vampires with partially assembled brains walking around as zombies. They could heal eventually but it will take time, particularly if they keep getting minor injuries that stop their brain from healing.

I had that based on DNA. The question that naturally arises is that how does the heart know what DNA to use - after all, different cells in the body have different DNA, what if the heart's magic happens to lock onto a tumor cell, etc.

Way around that: turning someone into a vampire often fails, so the vampires who "rise" are the ones where the DNA "snapshot" was taken of a cell with appropriate DNA features.

Using DNA as the explanation for regeneration does mean that #1 is harder to justify as saving the memories would require a snapshot of the actual physical brain structure at time of death rather than just DNA.

Yet infant brains can and do show certain instinctive behaviours. Horses can stand up within an hour of birth, and gallop by the end of the first day. Human babies will [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmar_grasp_reflex][grab anything placed in their hand]] (and there are a number of other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_reflexes][primitive reflexes]], many of which will also affect a new-born human infant as well).

So, alright, #2 is never going to be able to make complicated plans, but I don't see why it can't display a few primitive instinctive behaviours. Not to the point of being able to sneak up on someone, perhaps, but certainly to the point of "if you put your arm in his hand he'll grab it and suck out the blood". (One of those could even be the instinctive reflex to will the brain to grow, I guess). Or do I just not know enough about how brains work? (That's quite possible, I'm not a biologist).

**** Yeah, but horses aren't humans. Horse brains are designed very carefully to allow them to gallop at hours old because otherwise they'd die. Human brains are designed to have protective parents.

Added to that, brain #2 is not really a proper infant brain, since I believe there are actual physical differences between adult and infant brains, and a vampire doesn't grow a baby arm when they regenerate their arms, so why would they grow a baby brain? So the brain itself wouldn't be an infant brain, it'd be an adult brain (i.e. pruned I guess?) but without having had careful connections made.

I think getting zombies to happen is going to take way too much handwaving. I think I'm beginning to make peace with #1, it's just as interesting but in a whole other way. But how the brain structure and thus memories are "snapshotted" is an issue, because DNA is easy for the vampire to have a record of, the brain structure not so much...

Neither are vampires. (Come to think of it, is there any reason - besides that the human vampires think it's squicky - why one can't have vampire horses?)

Here's another thought for the vampire brain structure (#3, perhaps) - it's the same for all vampires. If Tom the Vampire and James the Vampire both get their heads cut off, the regrown heads have different faces but share the exact same brain... which is already templated in the magic, and doesn't /need/ to be snapshotted.

If I cling to DNA, perhaps it's a DNA thing: you'd need a vampire with horse DNA to seed it. Vampire transmission is what the previously human digestive tract is co-opted for: to make a new vampire, you vomit up Special Vampire Goo^{TM} into the new vampire's heart. That goo somehow is the seed material to create the new vampire. So you could say that that goo is for humans only, and you'd need to start a line of horse vampires with the appropriate magic skills to have something that makes sense.

This was something else that came up - because vampires are 4D, perhaps the "vampire brain" is in the forth dimension and that has all the "RAWR KILL" stuff going on and ends up fully in control. The problem with THAT is that if you do that, it gets complicated because would cutting the human head off really work that way if they're 4D, you know? Like, 99.99% of the mass of that brain is in the 4th dimension, so losing the tiny slice on /this/ dimension should be meaningless.

Okay, so the victim needs to have what the spell classes as 'human DNA' to be turned into a vampire. This allows for some DNA strains to be completely immune, or to have other side-effects ('all descendants of that drooling idiot will be turned into especially stupid vampires!' kind of thing - petty familial grudges lost to the modern day).

Then there's the question of what exactly is classed as 'human DNA'. Would /homo erectus/ count, if you could find one? What about a chimpanzee? You could go with /modern/ humans only, but there has to come a point where humans, through natural genetic change, become different enough to usee different DNA - beyond what the original spellcaster thought of as 'human'. Now, this is an /extremely/ slow process... but it does become important.

Because one possible definition of 'human' is 'sufficiently close to my current host's DNA'. This avoids the problem of humans slowly departing a narrow definition of 'human' to become something new, by allowing vampires to /follow/ that evolutionary change.

And that, if true, would allow a sufficiently dedicated vampire with some genetic cloning equipment and no moral or ethical qualms to create a series of bodies, working from more humanlike to more equine, change the first one, use it to change the next, and so on, and he can change his beloved steed into a vampire as well (this might be done to prevent having to keep buying and training new horses every few decades or so).

Oooooh. It gets worse than that. Why would cutting through the vampire's neck remove his head in the first place? After all, 99% of the mass of the neck isn't reachable by your normal three-dimensional weapons. So if you, say, cut off a vampire's arm (or head) then, instead of falling to the ground, it should just stay there in mid-air and re-attach itself. (And then the vampire will be cross with you, not for cutting off his arm, but for ruining the sleeve of his exquisitely tailored suit).

Now, if you have a four-dimensional sword - call it a 'magic sword' if you like - then you can go around cutting off vampire's heads, much to their shock and surprise. Or maybe if you take advantage of their weaknesses, by, say, arranging to shine sunlight on their heads. Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).

******** DNA / vampire transmission would probably be in the "could I breed with this person" level of similarity required. So, ten million years from now a modern vampire probably couldn't turn the neo-humans into vampires, even if we assume they look pretty much the same.

Vampire horse: I'd imagine each intermediate form would require an advanced enough brain to will the "transformation goo" to be made. I had in my head that it takes a few dozen/hundred years for a vampire to have enough transformation goo in the tank, or that the goo increases in potency over time, etc. And then the goo has to be deliberately vomited up. So it would have to be able to will the goo-vomiting (gross).

I want making a new vampire to be an "expensive" process in that it can't be continuously done to raise an army, "difficult" so you can't have your childe create a childe who creates a childe and thus have an army like that, and "risky" so you are not guaranteed to be successful.

But yes, if a vampire was willing to genetically engineer intelligent human-horse hybrids and continuously have them make slightly more horsey vampires, waiting the requisite time/taking the requisite risks of failure to produce them, you probably could. And then you'd have to keep a stable of horses for your vampire horse to feed from.

Below is my earlier response to the same sort of question in this thread:

That said, given vampires, werewolves aren't born in 4D, it's pretty easy to conceive that they have a very odd shape. Perhaps a tiny "spur" from their heart from which a whole second body comes, so they would perhaps flicker a tiny bit as they left their first body and their second (identical) body appeared, and then got smaller and turned into a bat. Could mean earth!body is vulnerable to beheading.

Vampires can't control their transformation, just will it to start (since they're not 4D natives: werewolves don't even get to will it to start). So there's no chance of a vampire wearing "morph armour" by having their transformation stop at the full-size double body.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).
#+end_quote

Yeah I think I'm going to say there's a ~1 atom thick spur coming out of the heart, which perhaps directly joins to the bat form, with no intermediate shapes visible to onlookers during transformation (except for perhaps "disappearing" altogether). With vampires not having control over the transformation process it's easy to conceive of it as "/poof/ all of a sudden I'm a bat" and no need for more fine-grained control.

My gargoyle does have fine grained control of his transformations though! Made me realise he'd have an interesting way to carry out one of his orders:

#+begin_quote
  There was a knock at the door. Red grinned, placing the heavy book down to go answer it. William stood there, his clothing looking ever so slightly dishevelled; his shirt seemed to have hints of light grey powder on it, and his trousers were wrinkled. His tie was loose around his neck. A faint smell of smoke followed him inside. He did not smile; for the first time, Red thought he looked tired.

  “Come in, please. Are you okay?” Red asked, concerned. William entered and began stripping as soon as Red closed the door behind him.

  “I am fine.”

  “Do you have... a bag?” Red murmured, not quite sure what William - who was now naked as the day he was born - was playing at.

  “Why would I have a bag?” William asked, and then called out. “Julias!”

  “For the... thing you had to get for Elodia.”

  “Oh, that has already been delivered.” William said calmly. Julias appeared in the doorway, apparently unconcerned by his master's state of undress.

  “How may I be of assistance, your majesty?”

  “Take this clothing and destroy it.” He handed Julias his clothes, scrunched into a small bundle.

  “Of course, your majesty.” Julias replied, and his skin started rippling in that strange, hard to focus on way that it did whenever he transformed. The bundle of clothing disappeared instantly. Red squinted. He'd never seen Julias do that before. It seemed William hadn't, either. He raised his eyebrows and gave a small, impressed smile, the same way he had when Red had found everything on that shopping list of his all those months ago.

  “I take it that you have destroyed it as directed, rather than transporting it somewhere else?” William asked, apparently a bit uneasy.

  “In a manner of speaking, your majesty.” Julias shrugged. “My magic is complicated. Rest assured that no trace of it will be found, your majesty”

  “Very well. You are excused.”

That's reasonable. So, fair enough, a modern vampire couldn't turn neohumans, but his great-great-however-many-greats-grandchildren vampires will be neohumans and could thus turn neohumans.

Why can't the vampire cut his genetic chimera's stomach open and get at the goo that way? Sure, it'll take a while - especially if it's taking decades to get enough goo - so you'd have to have a pretty dedicated vampire to even try this...

This works out really well. And has consequences.

- The humanoid form of the vampire is vulnerable to beheading - but the chiroptean form is not. You can cut off the vampire's bat head and he'll be no more than annoyed until it regrows.

- Having said that, the bat-form may very well still be vulnerable to a stake through the heart - especially as the two forms are probably joined /at/ the heart.

- Whether in human or bat form, the human-form brain is doing the thinking.

- The thin link between the two halves is vulnerable - to a 4D native. Breaking it doesn't kill the vampire (but probably hurts). If the bat-heart counts as part of the vampire-heart, then this might be a relatively neat way to grow a clone of the vampire - let it grow from the severed bat.

- When the vampire turns into a bat, the bat always appears where the vampire's heart was (thus always in mid-air, hope you've got those wings out)

- When the vampire turns back into a human, the heart always appears where the bat was. Thus, the bat has to be in mid-air before transforming.

(Destruction of clothes)

Neat. Though, pedantically, another 4D native could still find traces of those clothes (unless perhaps Julius just shifted the clothes enough to toss them through the wall at the fireplace in the next room).

True. I guess Julias is not concerned about this, or more likely the 4D world is inhospitable enough to normal matter that simply being in it would destroy the clothing (I'm imagining a 1 atom thick sheet of metal would be destroyed in a slight breeze). Not that the 4D world /has/ a breeze...

Now i'm imagining the BBEG getting his own gargoyle detective on the case, and the gargoyle detective coming across the ruined remains of William's clothes. Then again - that'd make Julias not be very good at his job.

I think I'm going to settle on the 4D world being inhospitable to non-4D objects as the easiest way to have the cool little detail and also have Julias be doing the right thing.

Intriguingly, they'd be valuable - but quickly become /less/ valuable if ever gifted. See, once you have /one/ vampire horse, it's not hard to get twenty more - the difficulty lies in getting that one.

But oh, if you have the /only/ one, then it is /extremely/ valuable - because, short of getting one from you, anyone else can only have one with centuries of dedicated effort.

So it might be more valuable as something that he - casually - lets the other vampires know he /has/ without ever letting anyone else get hold of one.

The first trouble with this is that we've just established the vampires as being mostly 3D. There are a few other troubles as well - if Julius is wearing a 3D suit and is forced to change shape for a bit, his human form should still be wearing the suit on return; Julius can't store a few personal items just outside 3D space for security; but the idea that the vampire's human form starts degrading as soon as he is a bat is probably the biggest problem.

One could say that there are /specific/ locations in 4D space that are dangerous to 3D objects, but that just means that there are places where, if William walks past, his bat-body suddenly dies.

An alternative option is that Julius is still holding the clothes (e.g. in his tail) outside of 3D space, and is intending to quietly toss them in the next fire or furnace he finds. Or maybe he intends to make a fire, outside 3D space, burn them there, and scatter the ashes. Or he deliberately /threw/ the clothes down and 'out', such that they'll be pulled back by Earth's gravity but not otherwise interact with the 3D world until they're either deep in Earth's crust or possibly in the mantle (good luck finding it /there/).

That's something I don't want him doing, to be honest.

And if he's allowed to keep his clothes between transformations then he /has/ hammerspace whether we like it or not.

True. Julias definitely has a whole horrific "rest of the iceberg" type form underneath everything, since I've established that his humanoid form has blood but no bones, so the blood has to get made somewhere. He probably has a horrific flesh sac type thing further "above" his human form. And that could quite easily have all manner of limbs and organs that could be used to grab that bundle of clothes. Hell, maybe he'd /eat/ them to destroy them.

Also a very good idea, though I'm not sure if putting them perpendicular to the mantle probably isn't conducive to "destroying" them.

I think I like the idea of him grabbing them out of 3Dspace with his "tail", popping them into a 4D mouth of his, and then they're incorporated into his body.

Then again - canonically he can eat /rocks/, so why didn't he just eat the bundle of clothing? I suppose then he'd have to explain that he doesn't poop and William would not quite trust it, whereas if the bundle just seems to disappear it would make his master feel better about it whilst still being just as good.

Well, if we imagine him having at least one 4D arm that he can use to grab the clothing and eat it, he would be able to put all the items he wants to keep in hammerspace onto his 3D cross sections and so hold /quite a lot/ of stuff. I mean, he'd have to concentrate to keep his fists closed or something, but he could even tie them to his arms if we say that any movement one of his forms makes is repeated on all of them.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's where you're wrong! I can ask tons of embarrassing questions about gargoyle digestion. Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.

I mean, he's got a human-looking body, and all of his bodies can eat in that the mouth is attached to his 4D stomach. So he's got a functional mouth.

He has a son, so he can obviously make babies. So he's got some sort of penis in at least one of his forms (his son is with a siren, so, probably a human-compatible penis). He's canonically slept with men and women, so that's more evidence for a human compatible penis as well.

So he can need a penis, that's fine, since who doesn't want to reproduce, or at least, do the things that are conducive to it. (I know, I know, our ace friends don't)

But he doesn't need an anus. All his waste just gets put into his hammerspace. So, does he have one? It would make his human form more convincing if he needs it to be, so maybe his human form has one - because why have a human form if it can't pass a strip search? Actually, now I think about it, if he's a two inch thick layer of flesh over a stone core, he wouldn't pass a modern "is this prisoner smuggling drugs up his butt" type test. So he probably also has a fake colon for some appropriate length so he'd be able to pass those things??? Or perhaps he has a fleshy tube joining his mouth and anus to keep appearances of having an esophagus and colon, though he'd look very weird with an endoscopy or colonoscopy and presumably the type of epithelium would change halfway through? (Probably at the nexus where food is transferred out of his 3D form and into his 4D form)

But then, the fifteen foot tall stone gargoyle doesn't need to have an anus /at all/. So I suppose it doesn't? Or if we give him a tube, perhaps he does to maintain his topological shape? I'm going to need to ask my husband...

Anyway.... this is why we try to ignore the embarrassing mechanical questions about anatomy and digestion. There's a lot of evidence around the place but it's all rather more information than I'd really care to know. And yet you start wondering about these things and you can't stop.

  Well, if we imagine him having at least one 4D arm that he can use to grab the clothing and eat it
#+end_quote

I was thinking he would use his tail for that, being the limb that doesn't have an analogue in his 3D body.

#+begin_quote
  Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.
#+end_quote

Alright, there are three points to consider here.

First of all - his human form was clearly /deliberately/ made to /look/ human. Human shapes are complicated; but most of that complexity is in things like eyes, which need to be visible. Any craftsman capable of making a suitably accurate human eye isn't going to be tripped up over something as simple as a convincingly human rear end. So, on that basis alone, I'd say he has to be at least as human as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw][R. Daneel Olivaw]] - at a minimum, he has to be able to pass as a human when naked.

(But he might not be able to pass through a metal detector without setting it off, depending on exactly what sort of stone he's made of).

There's another question, though - where does what he eats go? Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy (in which case he might well need only a small snack every century)?

And, related to that, what does he breathe out? (Humans tend to stick carbon onto the oxygen before we breathe it out, and that carbon comes - eventually - from the food we eat).

Once these three questions are sorted out, the remaining messy little details are easily resolved.

Regardless, he can use whichever limb it is to "hang" things in other parts of his 4D shape, allowing him to use hammerspace... Which is not necessarily a problem. I might have to ask on the upcoming munchkinry thread "how would you abuse hammerspace?" to see what I'm not thinking of.

Sandstone, so he should be fine.

Have not read much with him (though I have read /mirror image/ a long time ago). I take it he'd have a realistic butt going on?

#+begin_quote
  where does what he eats go?
#+end_quote

Just into 4D space. Like I said, the calculations were done previously and they indicated that 0.01% of his total mass is in any one of his cross-sections (or that his whole 4D body weighs more than the Earth). Either way, anything he eats just gets glommed into his 4D body: probably digested in some ineffable way, used for any raw material he might need for regeneration, etc.

#+begin_quote
  And, related to that, what does he breathe out?
#+end_quote

If he chooses to breathe, he's probably just breathing out the same air he breathed in. So a scientist would be able to tell something was odd about him by measuring his breath.

#+begin_quote
  Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy
#+end_quote

Nah, sunlight. He spends the daytime in a fully stone form that does some sort of advanced photosynthesis. Because it has to feed a gigantic 4D body, it has to be /very/ advanced photosynthesis. He can forgo it for a few hours at a time, but only occasionally as he probably has very low power reserves. If he doesn't manage his energy very carefully he's probably going to die - like a hummingbird I suppose.

#+begin_quote
  in which case he might well need only a small snack every century
#+end_quote

He eats regularly, mostly for social reasons. His sense of taste is... different. (Aside: I'm actually doing an assignment on the determinants of food choice right now. Or rather, procrastinating.)

Hmmm. Here's a another thought - 4D backpack. Just holding things with his tail is going to get in the way when he needs to /use/ his tail - a backpack will have more space and be easier to carry. (And the 3D cross-section of the straps will probably just look like a pair of fabric loops around his shoulders - he might be able to get away with calling it a fashion statement).

Oh, yeah. Olivaw was designed in order to be able to walk amid humans, observing them and gathering sociological data, without anyone being able to (immediately) tell they have a robot amongst them. This includes the ability to look convincingly human in a public shower or nudist colony. (Mind you, he doesn't excrete through it - if he eats anything, it goes into a bag in his chest - chewed but undigested - and he has to open his chest to empty the bag later).

Unlike Julius, Olivaw can't actually have children.

This is probably true, and though I'd imagine given he lives a pretty safe life, over the centuries he's probably got such an unimaginable excess of matter that it would take one of those [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/]["if he was reduced to an atom in size once an hour for ten thousand years, he'd use 1% of his mass"]] type of koans.

Just going to do order of magnitude on the amount he eats: The average human eats ~1000kg per year. He's probably eating about 1% of that, or 100kg. His human form weighs something like 250kg, so he can regenerate that with 2.5 years of food. I think his gargoyle form weighs 2.5 tons so he'd need 25 years of food to regenerate the whole thing. He doesn't live nearly that dangerously I don't think. I mean, if he had a master who liked using him for target practise he probably wouild need to eat more.

I looked into what sort of elements are in food as opposed to sandstone and they were surprisingly similar. Aluminium and Silicon would be the main differences. There's lots of potassium, sodium and oxygen. He'd have a /ton/ of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen excess if he ate a lot of food as opposed to rocks, though. Heck, maybe he poops diamonds? (Nah, he'd store the carbon to regenerate the organic portions of his body).

Nah, I don't think I like that. Long ago I conceived of him having a "heart stone" that was a big red gem in the centre of his body, and if it's destroyed he dies. I assume it's some vital 4D organ that holds him together. But that's an awful lot similar to vampires. Then again, assuming supernatural creatures have some sort of common origin, it's probably actually pretty good that "destroying the heart" works on two different beings.

It is an interesting idea if we do allow him to survive being bisected. I'd probably rule that he'd end up like a starfish if we did allow that. So now he's pissed off and there's /two/ of him - though the far-from-the-gargoyle-side half is going to die of starvation /very/ quickly with no ability to photosynthesise (probably in a day or two). And all the flesh on the near-the-gargoyle-side is going to die and rot away with no new blood source. It would be pretty cool though.

Okay, this is reasonable. He must have some vulnerability. (If nothing else, if the bit he does his thinking with is destroyed, then he's not able to do anything even if his body pieces itself back together).

But this heart stone - it doesn't /have/ to be part of his 3D human body. (It might very well only be part of his 3D /gargoyle/ body, which means that a prospective assassin has to get him to go into full battle-mode - perhaps by destroying his human-shaped "disguise" body - and /then/ break through all his outer skin and armour and /then/ destroy this tough-as-nails Heartstone.

Oh yeah - I wonder what that is? I never really considered that. Maybe the heartstone /is/ the brain? And that's why it's present in all slices, so that they can all be controlled (okay, probably more like a spinal cord: a small heartstone spinal cord in most cross sections with a larger heart stone "brain" in the other, "more important" cross sections - where would they be?).

His body is shaped like this:

Stone --> Battle --> Human --> Iceberg of flesh

So it'd make most sense for his "brain" heartstone to be in his /stone form/, not his battle form. So you'd have to get him virtually starving so he'd be forced to be in his regenerative stone form, and then destroy all of /that/ - which is no doubt the most protected part of him.

But if you destroy any part of his spinal cord stone, he loses control of his body /below/ that. The iceberg of flesh still keeps it all alive unless you sever everything, but he's not going to be able to use it. Maybe the spinal cord stone will heal given time, though?

At which point he'd go into battle form and rip the net apart. You could definitely use that idea to do it, though, but he's got some pretty unique ways to deal with whatever situation he's in: lock him in a small room? He can go human, stick his butt against the door, transform into a gargoyle and then his tail is making a hole in the door which he can probably leverage to break through.

You'd be best off with some sort of gauntlet with his master at the other end, tire him out that way. Then again, he might reason that he's doomed either way and he's not going to be able to help any hypothetical future masters otherwise.

Again not sure if that would be possible - how much regeneration can he do? Can he regenerate all his fleshy organs with just the stone side (like a starfish), or does he need the organs that grow flesh in order to regenerate his flesh? Either way, he'd be eating his other half when appropriate.

Half gargoyle, half siren - genetically both and is able to breed with supernatural creatures and with humans. He's also intersex in some non-specified way so is able to both impregnate and be impregnated (though it hasn't exactly come up).

Here's a family picture I drew in 2005: [[http://i.imgur.com/W0jTe6E.png]] - needless to say the mythology has changed over the past 12 years, but the broad strokes are there...

The "father gargoyle" has been redesigned to be Julias who was originally a completely different character, and the son (Malik) has been slightly redesigned too. Malik looks mostly human, and indeed can pass for such with appropriate fashion choices.

His non human features include bat-like ears, wings with glossy brown feathers (not bat wings as in the picture), and he doesn't grow hair but down. The hair on his head are actually made of tiny long tendril-like feathers, similar to what emus have. The son eats garbage and meat (including human flesh that he buys from demon fast food restaurants regularly).

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Not sure if Julias would eat garbage in front of his masters though; he'd know from experience that many find it disturbing and would not want to weird them out, after all...
  #+end_quote

  Well, not /deliberately/. But it's the sort of thing that Red could stumble across while going downstairs unexpectedly for a midnight snack.

I think it'd be hard to sneak up on a gargoyle what with their x-ray vision and all, but I get your point.

#+end_quote

Supernatural beasties are basically all compatible with each other and with humans (many humans have very thin supernatural blood, which gives them powers like e.g. slightly improved sense of smell). But they have a very low probability of conception. Malik's parents didn't hire the services of a witch; he was conceived naturally. His parents were married for something like 300-400 years and he's their only child, so being different demon species is about as effective contraception as having a vasectomy is. He was an "accident", I suppose, but they weren't doing anything to prevent his conception and were no doubt overjoyed to have him.

/Completely random aside:/

Malik /does/ have a brother named Kamal who isn't canon yet (he wasn't even canon in 2005, so he may never be). Given the rarity of demon pregnancies I'm not sure how to deal with him. Originally he was conceived as a twin brother (which could probably still happen - I assume sirens can give birth to twins), but I've toyed with making him a half-human half-siren person (thus Malik's half brother). In this case, I conceive of supernaturals not considering extra-marital one night stands with humans a problem, or possibly that Kamal is from before the siren met Malik's father. (I conceive of an impure demon having a lifespan of ~1000 years and Kamal having a lifespan of ~300 years, so I am not sure if this would work well in the timeline if we assume demons are monogamous.)

I imagine the mother leaving Kamal with his father, and then Kamal is taken in by a local monastery and ends up being an immortal monk and the source of many pilgrimages. Keeping a strict vegetarian diet whilst constantly craving human flesh (not being half gargoyle he has no pica to contend with, so /yay/?). But no real idea how to incorporate him into the story. I imagined him as receiving periodic secret visits from his siren mother and somehow gaining access to his culture that way, and then when she is killed he eventually leaves the monastery and looks for her? (That said I'm considering not killing her off now as I hate putting characters in the fridge: perhaps a divorce and the siren raises Kamal more conventionally???)

Extremely remote lucky chance. Fair enough.

The idea that Julius', um, genetic matter includes the necessary data for building his stone half, and his 4D body structure, along with the idea that it's at all in any way compatible with the sirens, raises all /sorts/ of questions about what was considered a legal requirement for building a bodyguard or other servant-beastie in Atlantis.

Nothing in anything we write has a narrative purpose; it all just /is/, because we like it. Malik is /meant/ to have a brother, and that's purpose enough. Whether any of our limited time available for writing and plotting is devoted to that is another question: with no purpose it's not there. But just as Malik serves no purpose in the novella I recently "finished" (still needs editing), he is mentioned because he exists in the greater fabric of the world and not mentioning him would be an oversight (okay, and Red finding out that Julias has a son and thus seems to have "free will" rather than being a golem adds to his horror, I suppose: everything serves a purpose if you squint hard enough).

It's the literary equivalent of junk food for us. And hey, who doesn't love a packet of chips now and then?

This was the original canon though is not a necessity; the idea of Kamal being half-siren half-human as opposed to half-human half-gargoyle (edit: /half siren half gargoyle/, rather!) would be interesting development of Malik's -character, as Malik places a lot of self worth (or rather, lack of it) on the fact that he's not a full-blooded demon as he is treated badly in his society because of it. Kamal would make a good foil if he was even less full-blooded (i.e. basically a full human) and had made peace with it through fasting and prayer. (And Kamal prays to a god who he /has never seen/, much less made regular ritual offerings of cake to!)

#+begin_quote
  (okay, and Red finding out that Julias has a son and thus seems to have "free will" rather than being a golem adds to his horror, I suppose)
#+end_quote

This, right here, /is/ a narrative purpose. Malik existing as a character - and the sort of character that Malik is - says something about the character of Julius, and that something is more than sufficient narrative purpose for Malik's existence. I mean, it doesn't /have/ to be some super-deep meaning or anything.

So, saying "Kamal has no narrative purpose" would be equivalent to saying "Kamal never appears on-stage, and no-one ever has any particular reason to mention him or call attention to his existence while on-stage". And if that's true, then he shouldn't be mentioned - even if he exists in the world, he's not part of the story. On the other hand, if there ever /is/ a reason to call attention to his existence, then his story should be tailored to making that reason plausible and reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  the idea of Kamal being half-siren half-human as opposed to half-human half-gargoyle would be interesting development of Malik's character

#+begin_quote
  Kamal would make a good foil if he was even less full-blooded (i.e. basically a full human) and had made peace with it through fasting and prayer.

And this is how the narrative purpose defines what Kamal's backstory should be. As long as he's a foil to Malik, he should be a /good/ foil - whatever that entails.

  Malik doesn't have any 4D structure or transformation ability. Not sure if that's just a consequence of him being of impure blood or if it says something about the way reproduction works, though.
#+end_quote

I think that says a /lot/ about demon reproduction. It sounds like the DNA Julius passed on is a lot closer to human-normal than Julius himself is. It suggests that there's a spectrum of DNA human-ness that Julius can pass on - mating with another gargoyle, he can have fully 4D gargoyle children at any time, but mating with another demon species, nothing happens unless his DNA contribution is pretty much as close to base-human as it gets - so you end up with mixed-species children sharing some qualities with their parents, but being closer to their parents' human side (because they were both designed to work with pure-human DNA, not exactly with each other's DNA).

****************************** Thanks for the stuff about narrative purpose: very comforting to think it's not just "things happen because we want them to happen", since, you know, we want them to happen because they satisfy our values (even if our values are "cute people making out" - hey, we're... uh, we WERE teenage girls. Quite a long time ago. Let's not think on that...)

Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head - when demons mix, their offspring are basically "humans with a couple of odd features", probably due to, like you are saying, there being some sort of meta-DNA, or the DNA is self-limiting in what it gets (like - bear with me here - imagine if you had a pineapple and a human breed. And you do it by getting the most pineapple-like parts of the human DNA and doing meoisis with them and joining them to the most human-like parts of the pineapple DNA. Since humans share like 50% of their DNA with fruit, this is probably not as completely off the wall as it sounds, though the resulting offspring in this case would be entirely pineapple (probably? actually the pineapple probably has extra stuff, humans are not "pineapple genome plus all the stuff to give us thumbs", so... yeah. It would be weird).

I guess what I'm /trying to say/ is taking into account the completely bizarre supernatural genetics, the "human genome" is the intersection of all beast genomes, and any two beasts that breed will have a child that sports features consistent with the intersection of those two beasts, which would be mostly human.

So Malik being Gargoyle + Siren = wings and feathers (gargoyles don't have feathers but let's not think too hard about it: chickens have the DNA for teeth in their genome after all), but lacking the bird butt that sirens have and the transformation that gargoyles have (since gargoyles can't transform at all).

This is a very sensible rule for fictional breeding. The siren body, after all, knows how to build a child-with-wings body (and knows how to build wings-with-feathers, which for all I know might be entirely encoded from the female end - it might well be that a gargoyle mother and a siren father never produces feathers). And the gargoyle body knows how to send along "this-is-the-colour-of-the-wings" instructions. (It also keeps sending along instructions for the transformation part, which confuses the siren body no end, which is why breeding doesn't /usually/ work between the two biologies - but verrrry occasionally it turns up in a form where the siren body can just ignore that bit)

All /this/ requires is that the DNA for the different demon species speak some common, standardised language (but extend it in different ways), which seems more than plausible, especially if the bioengineers who originally created the demons all used the same basic tools to do so.

Or maybe a half-siren half-siren is Siren enough to get more Sireny progeny. Or maybe a half-Siren half-human (without gargoyle traits to get in the way) is the place to start...

Here's some interesting examples from nature, though it's more for "relationship styles" than sex/gender type things: [[http://humoncomics.com/archive/animal-lives]]

Considering that they're interfertile with humans, I think they pretty much have to code for it in the same way as humans do. Which - oh dear, I think this means the genetics lab would need to pretty much build a Siren Y-chromosome from scratch. I don't think our hypothetical vampire scientist is quite able to manage that just yet.

Even if we keep it /that/ restricted, humans have all sorts of weird stuff. There's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome][androgen insensitivity syndrome]] - perhaps sirens have a form of that? AIS essentially means that the body doesn't respond to testosterone, so people with Y chromosomes who have it develop in a typically XX way - and they often look /extremely/ feminine because they don't respond to testosterone. So if we assume X and Y sex chromosomes, an XY siren would develop with female hormones and is likely to even have a female gender identity. XY!Siren would not be able to carry children, but may be able to father children. It would actually... explain a lot about sirens, since they're meant to be supernaturally beautiful and all. (Then again: there are less dramatic examples of AIS where the person develops in a normal masculine way but just has a low sperm count or something).

Then /again/, a siren's bottom half is bird, so if we assume there's bird DNA in there they'd have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZW_sex-determination_system][ZW sex determinant system]] which is a whole different kettle of fish. In that case, males are homozygous (ZZ) and females are heterozygous (ZW). And the bird half would have the baby-making parts: but if we assume that beasts are just augmented humans, the feathers are probably purely cosmetic.

Oh, and monotremes have a 10 chromosome system just in case you wanted something even more complicated.

So, uh, this is all pretty far above my pay grade. But let me reiterate: weird.

Yeah, I think I'm going to have to buy the ebook and read the rest. I love those little cartoons and I pay about that much for hot chocolate sometimes.

I personally love the rock-paper-scissors lizards. (Try saying that real quick!). And the hyenas are wicked (I already knew about the hyenas and anglerfish, but I find weird animal reproduction interesting in general).

I might incorporate something from one of those into the reproductive strategy of one of our critters. Will need to discuss that with my coauthor and see what we come up with. Might be a good way to incorporate a new character / creature.

--------------

So, all this talk about supernatural creatures, beasts, critters: should there be a word for them? Angela calls them demons (trying out using the name Angela to refer to me and my coauthor in the third person: not sure how I like it), but that has a particular connotation of malevolence when most of them are neutral on the subject of humans.

Some alternatives, maybe:

- Demons
- Beasts
- Creatures
- Monsters
- Fiends
- Behemoths
- Shedim (hebrew for demons/spirits)
- Jinn (from islamic texts: just generally means spirit/demon rather than genies specifically)
- Asura (Hinduism?)
- Yokai (japanese) / Yoagui (chinese)

Other options suggested by thesaurus.com include things like imp, goblin, titan and the like but those are too "specific" rather than just calling to mind the general idea of beasts.

Fiends is probably the best, but I like Shedim - hebrew has a certain charm to use for such animals, after all...

Yeah, but then (a) they wouldn't be interfertile with humans, and (b) having the male being homozygous means that an all-female race is pretty near impossible (since he only needs half the chromosomes of the female).

Yes, there should be. And that word depends on your cultural background. So the Hebrew would probably call them Shedim, the Japanese call them Yokai, and so on and so forth.

An interesting question, then, is what they call themselves. And this goes to the question of how they view themselves. Most human tribes come up with a name that means (some variant on) 'The True Human Beings' - it would make sense for these critters to come up with some name for themselves that means 'The True People' in their own language. (The name might very well still /be/ Shedim, especially if they had a lot of contact with the Hebrew people way back in the past...)

  Hot chocolate is expensive where you're from.
#+end_quote

Sure is; we've got a high cost of living. A cheap hot chocolate is AU$4. I get almond milk which they charge an extra 50c for. So I've definitely paid $5.50 for a standard cafe hot chocolate, you know, the 450 ml / 16 oz sort of size ("large" here).

Minimum wage for an adult is ~$20 so we've probably got a better purchasing power than the USA. Not sure how it compares with South Africa though.

Just did a cost of living comparison and it looks like [[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Australia&country2=South+Africa&city1=Perth&city2=Johannesburg][we have everything more expensive]]. Lists the price of our coffee as $4.50 (45 R) and your coffee as $2.30 (23 R). So yeah, we do have expensive coffees over here! (Though our average net salary is double Johannesburg's, so go figure).

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  An interesting question, then, is what they call themselves.
#+end_quote

They have all their own languages, so probably some made-up word in their language. Plus, I think demons would not have a word for "non-human sentient beings". They'd have a word for "non-centaur sentient beings" in centaur language or whathaveyou. Probably. They all do live in an integrated society so maybe they'd be more inclusive of other species (or maybe not: perhaps the big demon city we see is a cosmopolitan city like New York, and most people live in more homogenous places). Probably that New York thing.

I'm wondering how and when the penny drops for Red that it's not just vampires and gargoyles but dozens and dozens of things besides. Probably almost immediately.

Then again, Vampires don't go to the Demon Metropolis. I think I'm settling on a reason for that: there's some sort of vampire god who is unimaginably older than all the others, and he lives in the metropolis, and if a vampire dares set foot there they're /dead/. Possibly the same vampire who was responsible for the population bottleneck that happened c. 1600 and reduced the vampires to a population of ~500-1000.

Aside: here's a flash I wrote about "a day in the life" of Fiona. Haven is her psychic secretary.

#+begin_quote
  The photos were incriminating to say the least. The man - in his 50s - was in a rather compromising position with a large she-wolf.

  “Like I was saying, we, uh, made a little home movie.” His face was bright red and dotted with beads of sweat.

  His lawyer nodded, carefully taking notes. Haven was not around to do so; he knew the client would have requested privacy anyway, so he had taken the morning off. Fiona was glad. Her secretary's headaches had been bad lately; he needed an excuse to sleep in.

  “Yeah, so, uh, after she found out that I slept with her sister...” He trailed off nervously.

  “Please continue, Mr Callahan. I am not here to judge.”

  “Yeah, so after she saw the texts, I got home and all my stuff was in a box. That's fine. I deserved that. So I went to my brother's place, slept on the couch, and the next week I got a letter with these print outs. So I gave her what she asked for, she wanted five hundred bucks.”

  “And when was this?” Fiona looked up from her notebook.

  “Oh, um, about three months ago. So yeah, she phoned me a couple of days ago and now she wants a thousand dollars. I'm not an idiot. I know how this ends up. Is there any way to... force her to destroy the footage? I mean, I don't think my ex-wife would ever let me see the kids again if this got out.”

  “Don't worry, Mr Callahan. We should be able to get this sorted out in mediation. These photos will never see the light of day.”

The reference to Haven being there at all was a nod to some short stuff my coauthor had written in our "drabble" document.

Some random facts about Fiona from the random facts document:

- She's the kind of hideously successful middle-aged unmarried woman that everyone assumes is either a lesbian or sleeping with a married footballer.

- She loves running, and does it almost every day. She likes doing marathons mostly because they are the most common distance event. She competes in every local marathon she can find and usually wins in her age group, and has qualified for and competed in New York, Fukuoka and London.

- Vampires tend to be the most common to seek her out internationally; probably because of how they are always communicating and have deep pockets.

- Ultimately, she never ends up paired off with anyone; her passion in life is her work and community service rather than romantic love. That said, when she is consulting in other countries, she has certain physical needs taken care of.

- One of her big areas of work is teaching local supernatural creatures how to appropriately interact with humans and pass themselves off as such.

Realised the passage was a bit misleading: she often gets first in her age group in the /local/ races (and she's in her mid 40s, so not necessarily the most competitive of the age groups), but when she goes to big events, she's just in the pack. (If you'll excuse the pun).

************************************************** Not being a marathoner myself, I'm not really au fait with all of that. If anyone can handle the cutthroat world of over 40 marathoning, Fiona sure can! I wasn't aware that people who do just "okay" in world-class marathons are tested. I didn't even think there was a prize or anything?

Here's some of Fiona and her robotic pupil, Rose. This is /even more rough/ than my rough drabble, so bear that in mind:

--------------

#+begin_quote
  “Thankyou, Rose.” Fiona smiles appreciatively and begins drinking the tea, as is their usual routine. “How have you been this week?”

  “Yes, it's been good, I think.” She pours herself tea, more out of a desire to appear normal than anything else.

  “Handling Mr Richmond's departure okay?” She asks.

  “It was fine. The police were very nice about it.” She offers the plate of scones to Fiona first, ever the polite host. “I said everything you told me to say, how you told me to say it. Your advice was very helpful.”

  She nibbles on a scone, appreciating the talent that this robot has at baking. She wouldn't admit it, but these little tea sessions were always her favourite part of the week. “It was my pleasure.” She pauses. “Did you make the changes in your house that I suggested?”

  She sips her tea. There was no milk in it - the milk tended to be hard on her incredibly limited digestive system. “I purchased toothpaste, a toothbrush, tampons, and skin cream.” She sips more tea, allowing for a polite gap in conversation. All part of her programming. The perfect old fashioned girl.
#+end_quote

--------------

(I hope you don't mind me pasting all these things in, they seem relevant and I thought you might be interested. Here's Jack, the quintessential vampire slayer - if a quintessential vampire slayer can be a polyamorous lesbian police officer - breaking into the robot's house. The robot has been given a bunch of gifts from William, which have been strewn around the house randomly, as well as is trying to look human)

--------------

#+begin_quote
  After a few moments, she realised that the door wasn't going to be answered. She took her lock pick out of her tool belt and with practised expertise unlocked the apartment. She looked around; it smelled like onion, garlic and tomatoes, but not in a ratio that reminded her of anything she'd ever eaten. There was a large, leopard-spotted cat that sat on one of the almost brand-new couches, looking at the Slayer with only mild interest.

  Jack searched the house, finding a bathroom that had a half-finished box of tampons on the little shelf that was covered with a fine layer of dust, and a surprisingly grungy bar of soap with strawberry blonde hairs caked into it was in the shower, though the shower itself was perfectly dry. It looked for all the world like a human lived there, but at the same time, it didn't. An aura of sterile cleanliness punctuated by odd, careless messes that might have been put there carefully, deliberately. A vampire that was trying to appear human to its visitors? Or was it a vampire who was so old that she was starting to become human, sweating, eating, maybe even menstruating?

  There was no sign of any blood in the house; no small animals that a vampire might feed on. The fridge was precisely stocked,neither overful nor empty, with fresh fruits and vegetables, butter and cheeses, a few fish fillets and chicken breasts. No read meat. Overcompensating?

  A half-finished pint of cookies and cream ice cream was in the freezer. Jack almost considered it.

  She walked into the bedroom, finding a bed that was perfectly made, covered in an expensive-looking silk sheet. It was bordered by a quaint little set of bedside tables with mismatched lamps that must have been purchased from an op shop. One of them had a well-thumbed copy of Wuthering Heights on it, the tasseled end of a bookmark poking out of it.

  At the foot of the bed was a large, dark brown chest that smelled a little bit like one of the essential oils that Gwyn would insist on rubbing into her chest when she got sick. She opened it, only to find it empty, except for an old birdcage.

  A necklace on the dressing table caught her eye; it shone a silver colour, and she wondered why a vampire would own such a thing. Could she be immune to silver, too? She picked it up and examined it. It was light and shiny and seemed very well made; it had what looked like rubies and emeralds studded into it. But it was so light it could not possibly be silver. Part of the facade?

  Still not quite sure what to make of all she had seen, she decided not to press her luck, and headed out.

  On the way out, a piece of flat stone poised on the mantelpiece caught her eye; it had some faint, black figures drawn on it. Beside the figures there was a handprint, a silhouette surrounded by a spray of paint that the artist had blown onto the stone, tens of thousands of years earlier. With a start, she realised that the handprint was about the same size as the vampire's.

  Exactly how old is this fucking thing?

Practising her social skills. That's a nice little scene.

I like the touch of the dry shower. But why is the robot filling her fridge with easily perishable foods? (What does she do with the food, anyway?) Less perishable foods can sit in the fridge longer, saving on restocking and disposal.

How does the Slayer know how old the handprint on the rock is? I mean, the age of the rock can be calculated by a geologist, but a hobbyist can recreate the ancient inks and do a small art project today that will take serious effort to date once the paint has finished drying.

Confirmation bias. The Slayer thinks the robot is an unimaginably old vampire, and everything she sees confirms that.

Also, growing up in Australia you see lots of pictures of Aboriginal art, so no doubt she goes "that's aboriginal art" rather than "that's a painting done in the style of aboriginal art".

For the record, it was a legitimate artwork that William felt was an appropriate welcoming gift.

My boyfriend plays and he's going through some shit at the moment because of some drama. It's... interesting. Usually everyone's good though and there's a good-natured sort of camaraderie.

That's not going to make her look like a real human if a social worker comes by. Then again, neither is having a bunch of apparently good food in her garbage.

Knowing her, what she probably actually does is cooks big meals periodically and then gives them to homeless people or neighbours (probably in disguise so nobody catches on). She would do things like e.g. cooking a small amount of garlic or onion or something else stinky every couple of nights and then throwing it out, and maybe pouring milk down the sink to throw the cartons out so her garbage looks normal.

Hmmm, fair enough. Simple solution, then; buy around /ten times/ as much food as a human would normally eat, sourced from several different shops, and split the donations between three or four soup kitchens plus giving big meals to nearby homeless people, in wildly inconsistent ratios (so one week Soup Kitchen A gets three times as much as Soup Kitchen B, while the next week B gets one-and-a-half times as much as A, and so on). Anyone trying to investigate food going in minus food going out is going to either miss something or /assume/ that they must have missed something (after all, she appears healthy, so one has to assume she /is/ eating).

And then you don't have good food going into the garbage.

******************************************************** I like that: if she looks like a do-gooder, nobody is going to notice that she is giving away 70 days' worth of food instead of 63, because who looks at those things that closely anyway? All she really needs to do is start a little soup stand in the nearest place that homeless people congregate, she doesn't even need to bother with the business of donating.

After all, humans will think she's generous; vampires will think she's up to something, but not bother putting effort into figuring out exactly what; werewolves don't care about those sorts of things unless there's an immediate danger, and their pack is protected; and anyone else is rare enough that it might not matter.

Hmmm. Simple, straightforward solution - she never solved the problem of AI, she simply found a non-destructive means of brain uploading. Rose's 'brain' started out as a direct copy of the brain of the woman she's a copy of, taken at age 16 ("here, dear, wear this helmet for a minute, would you?") - perhaps not a perfect copy, but good enough to start out with the same memories and sense of identity.

He was inconsolable for days and jumpy AF. He wore full plate armour whenever he answered the door for a while, and then freaked out when Rose came in and didn't need an invitation (having a human thrall comes in handy for protecting you from other vampires).

(Aside: I always wondered why vampires don't wear better armour. If they're super strong, they should have no problem being able to wear full plate or riot gear/etc and still be agile. Great way to protect yourself from a staking from a human, if nothing else. Is there something I'm missing?)

Oh, of course. So Rose is essentially an uploaded version of Tara (her 16 year old "template") that has some nifty features that Tara doesn't (on-board memory, ability to read .txt documents, probably some things like an internet connection?)

I don't think Rose is particularly intelligent though. Perhaps she's got a pretty slow processor and it's hard to upgrade.

But Rose's boyfriend is a computer programmer, so I'm guessing he'd open her up and try and upgrade her (with her consent, naturally). That could be interesting. She'd perhaps start going on a takeoff trajectory and he'd have to pull the plug and be unable to. Eventually, being an uploaded human so having decently aligned values, she might... go for a life of aestheticism on a mountain somewhere? ¯\/(ツ)//¯

Rose has a robo-brother too, who was a less successful robot. I think he lacked real human empathy, though he sort of learns it. Maybe a more autism style inability to get any sort of subtexts.

#+end_quote

Yeah. I've made an unspecified vampire catastrophe canon which is why the vampire population is stratified (between waaaay older than 500 years and younger than 500 years). So I'd imagine the <1000 (maybe even <200) vampires who survived the Catastrophe would be well known to each other, if not people-who-were-allies-in-1600.

Then again, it's probably not /unheard of/ for an old vampire to pop back up after living underground (perhaps literally) since before the catastrophe, and it's even less unheard of for an old vampire to vanish for a few decades or centuries and then come back with a new hairstyle, so William could be assuming Rose is one of those.

Yep, that's pretty much what happened.

NINJA EDIT: No, wait. She played dead for a while, then (SPOILERS FOR VOLUME THREE OF MY BOOK???) William attacked her to save Red, he got overpowered, and then her torso got up and fought off the attacker who turned into a bat and ran away: everyone wins.

Oooooh, yeah. Here's another thought - for better conductivity, her wires are gold instead of copper. This comes into play when one of the two vampires touches her exposed wiring and it burns... so, when she gets up again, she fights off the attacker by stabbing him with her neck (and the exposed wires therein) - which means that yes, he could (say) rip off her arms, but that just gives her something more to attack him with.

She technically doesn't need access to the grandkids to take a brainscan. Just send a package containing a very large helmet as a gift for the grandkid (along with a cartoonishly large radio antenna and blinky LEDs on the front) and ask for a picture of the darling grandkid wearing the Super Brainscan Space Helmet that she made herself.

(Whether the parents will fall for that is another question entirely. But, hey, worth a try, right?)

That's so metal! I love it. I'm trying to work out how well-known the vampire weakness to gold is. Things are all happening out of order so when we do more prologue it will be fun to see how long the vampire hunters take to figure out that gold is a point of weakness.

That said, there's a scene in the novella where William gives Red a silver dagger, and tells him that it really hurts vampires, so the vampires are obviously perpetrating the silver myth come hell or high water.

Been trying to foreshadow the gold thing a bit: William receives something made of brass, and brass is said to symbolise "something that appears hurtful but is not"; William mentions the vampire superstition against touching money; and this little exchange really amused me:

Clearly, some vampires have read this list. And they quickly kill any Hunters that work it out, and burn down all their papers.

But Rose doesn't need to know about the gold weakness until one of the vampires literally steps in it (though the reader should know well before that).

Yeah. The vampires are glad they still have one thing. The vampire weakness to silver is a relatively new invention in folklore, so probably some people got wise to electrum and the vampires decided to name the Beast of Gevaudan as a vampire, since that's where the folklore for silver comes from. (The Beast of Gevaudan is certainly not a werewolf, so could well have been a vampire, and the silver bullet is just random folklore)

Lead to gold is such a cliche but a real concern for vampires... :D

Speaking of, the story is now basically as finished as it's going to be so I'm more than ready for readers if you were still wanting to be so kind. Otherwise once my coauthor finishes massaging it I'll put it on this subreddit one chapter at a time, but because of how well you have come to know the setting and how valuable your contributions are I'd very much appreciate your expert eye.

But, on the other hand, it's some 50,000 words long (TWO THIRDS THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST HARRY POTTER BOOK), so it's not exactly something you can knock out in half an hour. I appreciate that it's a lot to ask of someone, so you're more than welcome to decline.

I do want to thank you again for all your help and encouragement. If it weren't for that long conversation in that worldbuilding thread in like August, I wouldn't have written a 50,000 word novella this year, and this is something that me and my coauthor have /literally been talking about doing for 10+ years/. So it's an amazing personal achievement you started me on the journey towards. So thank you, again!

Anyway. Vampires. Yep! Let's go.

Hmmmm. But it is a wolf - or at least wolf/like/ - which should probably disqualify it from being a vampire, for the same reason as why it's a lot of work to get a vampire horse.

#+end_quote

A crossbow? Pretty much, yeah.

Vampire versus Hunter is going to come down to a matter of preparation and knowledge. A Hunter who really, /really/ knows what he's doing, and who has the right weapons, can probably take down a Vampire - but an important step in that process is that the Vampire must never know he's being targeted. (And a crossbow is /not/ the right weapon).

On the Hunter's side, the Vampire is going to have significant trouble entering a house uninvited (but this is hardly a problem, since he can just send in a jannissary with a gun instead). And if the Hunter is not inside a suitable dwelling, then the Vampire has every advantage.

Unless, and this is important, /unless/ the Hunter has taken the opportunity to pre-inject himself with a saline solution full of gold nanoparticles. /This/ Hunter will give the Vampire who bites him a mouthful of auric pain, which should paralyse the vampire long enough for the Hunter to provide a death blow (though it might be somewhat addictive to the Hunter).

Or a hunter could trick a vampire into catching something that [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/20040208][blows up, throwing gold powder in his face]].

So it is /possible/ for a properly prepared Hunter to win against an alert but ill-prepared Vampire. But it's very much not the way to bet - most actual vampire deaths would have involved staking the vampire in his sleep.

#+end_quote

Geez. That's... pretty metal. Problem with that is the feeding process is so pleasurable that the Hunter might have trouble pre-committing to killing the vampire. I mean, carnal events can make you go numb and your mind go all foggy: even if the vampire is in trouble from feeding from you, you've got to be able to make the killing blow in the no doubt short window of opportunity you have.

(Or maybe the window of opportunity is longer than you'd think: perhaps vampires are not only weak to gold, but their weakness to gold is far stronger than their weakness to silver is portrayed as in media? And eating from the gold-infused human would cause the vampire to be incapacitated for /hours/? Or in intense pain until he could find another human to feed from so he can excrete the gold out of his body? And basically he'd need a janissary or ghoul to come and help him out with that, since he might be in too much pain to do anything more than move?)

Now I'm wondering if such a technique is how Jack becomes a janissary in the first place. Originally she just gets grabbed by a Bad Guy and eaten from, and then is saved by her mage-ally Gwyn.

/I want to emigrate to equestria/

--------------

Here you go, another passage from another short thingy I wrote a while ago, where Jack is telling William that she's not going to be feeding him anymore. It features the crossbow /and/ a vampire wearing a chestplate. This is just after Red gets turned into a vampire and is /really, really impolite/ and it's giving William the shits.

It's me trying to work out how Jack and William would come to a truce. I was going to paste it in here, but it's actually 8,000 characters on its own, and Reddit's limit is 10,000, so it's too long. Ah well. I shouldn't put such long stuff in posts anyway. Here's a couple of tiny bits from it.

#+begin_quote
  William nodded. “You are aware, I take it, that you are threatening me in my lair, whilst I am in armour that would render your bow useless, gold or no?”

  “I've seen your kind get hit by gold. It ain't pretty.” She said, grabbing at the handle again. She felt she could see the vampire tense up minutely at this.

  “That may be so, but one bolt would do little to slow me, at least not until after I had dispatched you. You are, after all, aware that the human body is a fragile thing.”
#+end_quote

/[and skip to]/

#+begin_quote
  “I have subordinates in most towns, and I correspond with them regularly. It is my function to ensure there is a peace, that hunting grounds are appropriately distributed, that janissaries are not taken suspiciously and deaths are kept at sustainable levels.”

  “Whatever.” Jack said. “If we kill you, they'll just have to deal.”

  “That is precisely the problem. They are all rather young; the eldest, who makes her home in Darwin, is only two hundred years of age. There will be competition for my lands; in a few short years several upstarts may migrate here, all with voracious appetites. Whoever ends up as king after I am gone may well not be as willing to negotiate as I.”

  “Well, we'll kill him too!”

  “And the next one? And the next? Sooner or later, your luck will run out.”

  “They'll find someone else to do it. I'll find someone else. There's always more of us.”

  “So you will not consider an alternative to all this death and destruction?”

  “Like what?”

  “As you are well aware, despite my janissaries, I often find myself feeding on local stock. Several times a year I do not bother preserving their lives.”

  “Yeah, and that's why we have a problem.”

  “With that in mind, I am proposing an armistice of sorts.”

  “I'm listening.”

  “I will no longer allow humans to be killed during the feeding process. Where possible, I will use janissaries, but where that is not possible I will ensure I keep my consumption to within tolerable limits for the human.”

  “Just you?”

  “No. It will be myself as well as all of my subjects. However, the strength of my control wanes with distance. I suspect, for example, that the duchess of Darwin may move her lands into someone else's kingdom. She is fond of the hunt.”

  “So, yeah, how do you enforce that? If she can just piss off?”

  “She will not just piss off, as you put it. She will merely defect her lands to another kingdom. This is not uncommon at the edges of territory, and I suspect I may even gain some central territory as there are many in the desert who would prefer a more sustainable arrangement.”

  “So, your guys, how do you stop them from killing people?”

  “They are expected to do what I request of them, though there are of course never any guarantees. If they do not behave appropriately, I can banish them, taking their lands, or even destroy them directly.”

  “So, that all sounds... okay, I guess. What do you want in exchange?”

  “You and your associates will no longer attack me, my issue, or any other vampires in my kingdom.”

  “What if we catch ‘em killing people? Can we kill them then?”

  “No. Provide me with details and I shall take care of them.”

  Jack paused, considering this. “So, what do we do if you back out or the whole peace treaty isn't working?”

  “Well, considering your initial offer was for us to go back to trying to kill each other, I suspect that we would return to that status quo.”

  She nodded slowly. “Okay. We'll give it a try.”

Got to admit, I got the idea from [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/040312][someplace else]]. And yes, it has some severe practical downsides when being fed from feels /that/ good. It might work once - especially if the Hunter has practiced stabbing the vampire as soon as he's incapacitated long enough that he does so automatically without needing to actually decide - but by the time his third or fourth vampire arrives he may well be less interested in killing it and more interested in letting it feed off him.

Well, the thing is, because the gold is /inside/ the vampire, he can't just drop it and let go. And burning through the vampire does not actually consume the gold, so it's going to keep going as long as it's in there. Mind you, there are other ways for the vampire to get rid of the gold, depending on exactly where it goes - if it goes into his new-vampire-goo, then he can get rid of it by vomiting that up (though if he was planning on making a new vampire anytime soon, he can wave those plans goodbye). If it moves through his body, then he could (for example) wait until his right arm is in a lot of pain, then cut off the arm (and, by extension, the gold inside it). If it just eats right through him, he could lie on his stomach and wait for it to eat its way right /out/ of his body, though it will hurt a lot.

So, the vampire would no doubt /survive/ the gold nanoparticles. But it would leave him more than a little distracted, and extremely cautious about feeding from Hunters in the future. (While the Hunter is more than a little distracted by the feeding process. It probably comes down to a matter of just who is /more/ distracted at the time).

Possible, but doubtful - if Grandma's working off brain scans, then she hasn't really solved the problem of AI.

It'll take a few years for the company to get anything remotely workable from a mad scientist's notes, though.

  [golden blood] might work once - especially if the Hunter has practiced stabbing the vampire as soon as he's incapacitated long enough that he does so automatically without needing to actually decide
#+end_quote

Really you should inoculate a decoy person with golden blood (bonus points: kidnap a janissary, put them under, insert gold into their blood, then leave them in an alley somewhere). Watch them until they go to feed the vampire, when the vampire gets affected by the gold, come in from the shadows and cut his head off.

Extension: If you are a secret government organisation, inject gold into a portion of the population under the guise of a vaccine programme. Vampires are now unable to reliably choose targets.

Inspiration: This happened on Stargate atlantis (they have a sort of space vampire called the Wraith). The Wraith ended up just killing /everyone/ who was on planets that had tainted people on them because they were no longer useful as a food source so why keep them around (normally they'd kill a few dozen people every now and again, so this scorched earth really sucked).

QUESTION: are vampires harmed by gold compounds, or elemental gold only? You've probably heard of colloidal silver, which is an alt-medicine thing that probably cures cancer or something. It's just silver suspended in water.

Looks like [[https://www.purestcolloids.com/mesogold.php][colloidal gold]] exists as well and is sold with similarly dodgy health claims. So that would be a source for our intrepid vampire hunters. There's also ionic gold available (which the linked page decries as being inferior in whatever magical properties gold is meant to have), so depending on what about gold harms vampires, either one could work.

I assume colloidal gold is probably better to inject. I know a doctor, I wonder if he'd entertain my questions. Who knows. I've just IMed him and asked him. And while I've been finishing writing this he's giving me his thoughts.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, I was thinking through this. What does gold ACTUALLY do? Is it just painful? Or does it actually burn through them like acid would? I suppose it would actually burn through them.

On the subject of removing gold from the body:

- Their waste products are excreted into their janissaries when they feed, which is how I'd envision their bodies preferring to get rid of the gold - this is not very good for time-sensitive things, though.

- I don't think new-vampire-goo would be a good route for it. Not sure of a good way that that goo gets made, but I'm guessing the "making new soldiers" function of the body would not be able to take on "deadly poisons". That way if one of your vampire soldiers dies, you can cut his belly open and make a replacement.

- Cutting off body parts that are affected by gold: I'd imagine the gold would disperse pretty quickly throughout the entire body, so you're kind of stuffed. Then again, I also imagine that vampires are able to will their hair to grow, so why wouldn't they be able to will the blood they just drank to settle in, say, their left hand and then cut the left hand off. THEN AGAIN, blood would spread through arteries, which do not have valves, only veins do. So the blood would spread through the body pretty much straight away. (Then again: do vampires have a heartbeat? If not, their blood doesn't move. I guess they do have a heartbeat for that reason, also because Red would have noticed that someone he was snuggling for two weeks didn't have a heartbeat)

- Gold eating through you: this seems likely if we're going "gold bores through you like acid". Then again, these gold particles are nano-size. They might have a hard time boring through you from the inside out? (gonna ask doctor friend)

- Gold eating through you #2: Actually, if it did eat through you, it would be pretty slow, so the vampire might lie down for an hour or two and wait for the gold to come out of his body, then get his janissaries to do a very thorough job of sweeping the floor. This is probably a good way to do it.

#+begin_quote

Well, William's willingness to negotiate is borne out of two things:

1) They still have the masquerade going on, and Jack could threaten that

2) He actually has genuinely changed as a person in his attitude towards humans, and feels like negotiating with them is a good idea for the sake of future relations.

#+begin_quote
  1) When you drink too much colloidal silver, it makes your skin turn grey. When this happens does the silver get into your blood in any appreciable quantities or is it mostly in tissues?
#+end_quote

1) the silver would have to spend some time in your blood to get from your GI tract to the skin and other tissues. My understanding is that the staining is usually permanent, which suggests it doesn't re-enter the bloodstream after it's deposited. So I'd guess it would only be in the blood for a short time, at most a day, after drinking a dose, then it would just be in tissue

my conclusion: you cannot permenantly inoculate yourself by the looks of it.

#+begin_quote
  2) Colloidal gold is also a thing. It's gold nanoparticles in distilled water. If you put it in a syringe and injected it, would you have gold nanoparticles in your blood? How long for? Would the kidneys filter them or would they be in your blood forever? Would it be toxic?
#+end_quote

2) gold nano particles injected into the blood probably wouldn't be toxic, because they wouldn't react with anything. The only risk would be if they somehow aggregated together and blocked an artery, a gold embolus. I'm not sure how good the kidney would be at removing the particles, probably not very but they should pass through eventually. I doubt anyone knows this one, so you could spin it either way depending on plot requirements.

my conclusion: colloidal gold is a great idea!

#+begin_quote
  3) Same as above but instead of gold nanoparticles it's gold ions
#+end_quote

3) gold ions are toxic to the liver and kidneys

my conclusion: ionic gold is a Bad Idea

#+begin_quote
  colloidal gold is 40-400nm, is that too small for the blood vessels?
#+end_quote

A: Should be fine, lots of proteins and ions stay in the blood vessels after all. Stuff only really transfers into tissue in capillaries, and even then I doubt many gold particles would go through the membrane. If they did though, you've got the same problem as colloidal silver: once in the tissue, it probably wouldn't leave. People may change colour, and they'd need repeat dosing to stay vampire proof

my conclusion: The vaccine plan wouldn't work unless you want to prepare an entire city for e.g. a vampire convocation. Or you could perhaps routinely spike gold into all the e.g. insulin, testosterone, estrogen, heroin, depovera, etc, anything that anyone injects themselves with. Though you'd end up with people changing colour which would be hard to do in a stealthy manner.

--------------

EDIT: So, vampires might be able to use the smooth muscle in their arteries to direct blood:

MW: so if a vampire fed on someone golden, they could direct all that blood into say their left hand, and then cut their left hand off as a way to avoid t he damage? (their hands grow back)

Doctor Friend: I guess so? It would be a long way around though, if their vessels still rely on the heart for pressure to move things around. Anything consumed, assuming it gets absorbed in the guts like normal, would have to pass through the hepatic portal vein, the liver, the inferior vena cava, the right side of the heart, the lungs and the left side of the heart before entering the arterial circulation to be sent where they want

MW: I don't think it gets absorbed in the guts. That would be too far around: the guts are co-opted to make Magic Vampire Goo that makes the next generation of vampires. That said, it could perhaps go through the esophagus into the lungs? That would make a weird type of sense, wouldn't it? Actually the alveoli probably wouldn't be able to absorb blood because it's not air? like if you'd asked me 5 minutes ago I'd say it goes right into the jugular, but going via the lungs like oxygen does makes a weird type of sense, since vampires don't need to breathe, it would be something for the lungs to do

DF: There's no reason the process of becoming a vampire couldn't alter the membranes in the alveoli, giving them a new function

MW: true. So. that's badass. They drink blood and it goes down the oesophagus, BUT INTO THE LUNGS haha i am so excited. i love it when you think about things like this and then you have a really cool and bizarre thing seem logical

DF: Well, would be more direct if they technically breath blood into the trachea! Like drowning, but intentionally and with blood

So................ looks like my vampires absorb blood THROUGH THEIR LUNGS. I am so psyched abou tthis!!!

Hmmmm. Between wikipedia and the claims on the side of a box of plasters, it looks like silver nanoparticles actually do have genuine antibacterial properties - largely because they stick to bacteria and the bacterial cells can't handle them. I have no idea whether or not gold has similar effects (although they're in the same group on the periodic table, so it seems reasonably likely).

Incidentally, the wikipedia page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold][colloidal gold]] indicates that the nanoparticles /can/ be toxic if they're precisely the wrong size:

#+begin_quote
  ...size 1.4 nm were found to be toxic in human skin cancer cells...while 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 nm sized AuNSs were less toxic by a six-fold amount and 15 nm AuNSs were nontoxic.

Then /again/, vampires have conscious control over most involuntary body systems (so they can appear to breathe). So it would make sense that they can choose to excrete even with nothing to excrete into.

Then /again/, maybe they have conscious control over /human/ involuntary body systems, and the /vampire/ body systems are not so easily controlled?

#+begin_quote

This would work the best; I'd imagine that some gold could be excreted for the same duration that the vampire is able to drink blood out of his own arm.

Their reproductive systems are the obvious case because we don't want them to have babies because vampires getting pregnant is weird. That said, if I'm writing supernatural romance, we still want them to be fun to use. (I guess, /twilight-style/, we could say that females are infertile and males aren't, but I think vampires having children would separate them a lot from the "dead" category they're meant to be in).

Not sure what you can do with a reproductive system though, especially because the sexes differ in some obvious ways. I suppose you could say it's joined to the vampire-goo-factory in some way, and not really specify how. But the ovary/fallopian tube is a very different structure from the testes/epididymis, even if they are homologous, so there's probably important ways that male and female vampires differ because of this.

Talking of vampire internals, let's think about the bat-form for a minute.

Does the blood do some fancy four-dimensional looping to flow through both bodies in some way? If so, does this mean the bat-form can also drain blood?

  Hmmm... fair enough. But he's not trying to go after blood here, he's trying to expel waste; can he not do this by biting on a blanket and sucking, in an attempt to fool his body's automatic responses?
#+end_quote

Maybe, and it might even work to an extent. But biting into a clean, fresh human would be instant relief.

#+begin_quote
  Can humans (except the grandmother who made Rose) really make false skin good enough to fool a vampire at close range? And correctly predict where he intends to bite?
#+end_quote

I very much doubt it, it was more trying to figure out how you could get a maximum dose of gold into a vampire (probably better option: use a tranquiliser dart at range). I assume a co-operative janissary would tell you the vampire's preferred eating places though.

  #+begin_quote
    Good point. I suppose he doesn't think Jack is actually a threat to him, he knows she has power in the anti-vampire community (her best friend Gwyn is a mage, who is constantly developing her powers: she could be a threat, but she defers to Jack, who is harmless...), and William knows she's got subconscious sympathy to him what with having been a janissary.
  #+end_quote

  Ah... maybe he's not worried about Jack, but he /is/ worried about what Gwyn will do if Jack turns out dead? Especially since Gwyn is not currently right in front of him and thus easily and quickly killable?
#+end_quote

Yeah, and Gwyn lives in a house that not only is impassible without an invitation, but has lots of gnarly wards on it.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, he can start using Jack to provide Gwyn with a few interesting books and notes on types of magic that he wants Gwyn to be able to cast...
#+end_quote

True. He could provide spells that are useful against /other/ things that might bother them as well as spells that are useful /for/ him. I wonder what sorts?

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    It is /very hard/ to have the Bad Guy leave The Hero alive though.
  #+end_quote

  There are a few ways to do it; though most don't work for a Bad Guy who's already an unapologetic murderer.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but William is kind of self-hating about the whole thing: he believes by now that humans are sentient, but it's just /so convenient/ to kill them and has no consequences. Basically, the reason that most people today eat meat: they know on some level it'd be better if they didn't, but it's convenient and hedonic to do so, so they do.

#+begin_quote
  But "you're worth more to me alive than dead" is generally a good way, and a mage who is on William's side may just be enough of an asset to make it worth the risk. (Sure, their treaty doesn't put Gwyn on William's side just /yet/, but it gives him a chance to get close enough to do the necessary Diplomacy rolls...)
#+end_quote

And Gwyn really trusts Jack, so it'll be pretty easy to get her, even if Jack is no longer janissary-level charmed...

#+begin_quote
  Talking of vampire internals, let's think about the bat-form for a minute. Blood pumps around a human body in a fairly complicated way,
#+end_quote

It's not really that complicated; heart provides pressure, and it goes through various arteries until it reaches capillaries where it's disseminated into tissues, and then back into veins and into the heart again. It's just a closed loop. I mean, it's neat, and evolution is amazing to come up with it, but it's not what I'd call "complicated"

#+begin_quote
  but the vampire body is further complicated by having a bat-body joined at the heart. Does the blood do some fancy four-dimensional looping to flow through both bodies in some way?
#+end_quote

I'd assume not, in a vampire: if there's a one atom spur, blood can't go through that. Each would have its own blood supply, though no idea how the bat is able to be able to fly without eating. So, it probably makes sense for the blood to do some 4D looping.

#+begin_quote
  If so, does this mean the bat-form can also drain blood?
#+end_quote

It would do. It could likely bleed more than its weight in blood, ironically enough.

Well, yeah, but there's a kind of a double-loop through the heart - it goes into one side, gets pumped through the lungs, then into the other side, then gets pumped to pretty much everywhere else, then back to the heart.

I'm thinking maybe expand that 4D spur to, say, about the diameter of a finger or so. Just enough space for some blood to pump through. (And then the vampire's blood path will be a three- or four-leaf clover instead of a figure-eight)

Good question. He probably doesn't want for much, to be honest: he wants to be highly respected in society, but he doesn't want to be at the precipice - too much work and stress and risk. He'd perhaps want to extend his territory: if he could have a comparably sized swath of land in Europe then that would be very appealing to him. That's going to be tricky as [[https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-02/enhanced/webdr04/20/22/enhanced-buzz-11530-1392955176-4.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto][his current territory is bigger than France, Spain and Germany put together]].

Depends what "it would be better" means, I guess.

Basically, if you accept the following three tenets, it follows that it's better not to eat meat (whether you do or not is another question; cognitive dissonance is real)

1. Animals are harmed in order to produce meat

2. Eating meat is avoidable

3. If it can be avoided, it is better not to harm animals

Plenty of people will argue against any one of those three, but plenty of people will also accept 1, 2, and 3 and decide they'd rather eat meat anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, if you accept the following three tenets, it follows that it's better not to eat meat (whether you do or not is another question; cognitive dissonance is real)
#+end_quote

Hmmmm.

As to Tenet 1, I do believe that meat can be produced without causing undue harm to animals. (Yes, the animal needs to die; however, this does not need to be painful, and the animal does not need to be aware of this; so pain need not be caused. Indeed, I do believe that it is to the benefit of all - especially abbattoirs - if the animals are not afraid or fighting and damaging things in their last minutes, so it seems reasonable to assume that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that they remain calm). (I also understand that there is some progress towards lab-grown meat, but that's new enough that it hardly applies).

As to Tenet 2, I will agree that it is avoidable, but I understand that one has to be very careful of one's diet or certain proteins are particularly difficult to obtain. So, number 2 I accept.

As to number three; I accept that all else being equal, it is better to choose a course of action that does less harm over one that does more harm (including harm to animals). However, if for some reason I ever have to face such a choice, I would save one human's life even if it means the death of a hundred baby bunnies.

[[/fsangry][]] [[/sp][]]

So, I guess that, in essence, it boils down to that I feel the harm to the animals is slight enough as to not be worth the effort of attempting to figure out the complete intricacies of a meat-free diet. So... I guess I'm mainly objecting to (1).

#+end_quote

Yeah, but Tenet 1 doesn't mean "producing meat necessarily harms animals", it's closer to "the way meat is produced today harms animals". Animals live a fraction of their potential lifespan, the harm done to dairy cattle when their calves get taken away is real, one-day-old male chicks get put into giant grinders when they're fully conscious because they won't lay eggs.

The hypothetical idyllic world where eating meat doesn't harm animals isn't the world we live in. So the hypothetical existence of such a world doesn't mean that eating a chicken burger is exactly as harmful as eating a veggie burger.

#+begin_quote
  (I also understand that there is some progress towards lab-grown meat, but that's new enough that it hardly applies).
#+end_quote

Progress is going pretty well, actually. I think a lab grown burger is now only a few thousand dollars instead of a few /hundred thousand/. The [[http://www.gfi.org/][good food institute]] is a charity that is doing work in getting this to become viable, since it will be better for animals, peoples' health, and the environment.

#+begin_quote
  As to Tenet 2, I will agree that it is avoidable, but I understand that one has to be very careful of one's diet or certain proteins are particularly difficult to obtain.
#+end_quote

The protein thing is a complete and utter myth, garbage, honestly. I can go into detail if you like (I'm a nutrition student). The only issue with a completely plant-based diet is B12, which is available as a cheap supplement and is added to practically everything as a fortification. (Also, much like iron in menstruating women, B12 deficiencies are common in the general population regardless of diet)

To wit, if you are eating enough calories, you are eating enough protein. Complete proteins are virtually meaningless. As long as you are not literally eating only one food, you're fine.

In terms of certain proteins: if you are eating a low calorie diet, then you need to ensure you include rich sources of lysine in your diet. Which is basically /every single legume/.

#+begin_quote
  I would save one human's life even if it means the death of a hundred baby bunnies.
#+end_quote

I don't know if there are many humans who would disagree with that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Effectively no effort is required: if one eats a completely plant based diet, one only needs to ensure they're getting a B12 supplement. If they have a low calorie diet, it is important to incorporate legumes.

* Excerpt from JaNoWriMo Novel:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: excerpt-from-janowrimo-novel
  :END:

--------------

It was February. Prey was becoming more plentiful as the weather improved. A package arrived, forwarded to Bremen by way of an ally of William's in Rome. There was no mistaking it: it lacked the meticulous construction of a vampire, the packaging and the handwriting both produced by careful but irredeemably human hands. William could not believe the excitement he felt when Duke Alfons' thrall had delivered it to him. He thanked the human - another one of the strange habits he picked up from his time with Red - and closed the door. He could not help but wonder how Red had felt it appropriate to respond to his gift. He had such an astonishing instinct for these things. William could not help but think that the young man would make a fine vampire someday. He frowned and shook his head as he walked to his dark, wooden table. It was a silly notion.

He placed the box on the table, and ripped the wooden top off of it. The movement stirred up the air inside, and the hints of Red's smell that emerged from the box awakened a feeling in the back of his mind. He felt the desire to cry, but chose not to act on it.

Nestled amongst pages of crumpled newspaper were three pieces of a kerosene lamp: a round glass shade patterned with dogwood flowers, trimmed in pale pink; a round lamp base with the same dogwood pattern, with a brass font for the wick on top; and a simple glass tube that functioned as the lamp's chimney. It was at least sixty years old, and in fine condition.

William ran his fingers along the dogwood flowers; it couldn't be, could it? Dogwood meant regret for a decision made in haste. A kerosene lamp with a wick: travel, long journeys over the sea; the shade of pale pink: courtesy and respect; and brass: something that appeared hurtful but was not.

If Red had been a vampire, William would have thought the message from this gift was obvious: he regretted his decision to leave, that Red still loved him, but would accept if he was not loved back any more. The fact it was a lamp, symbolising a journey, and that it was sent to William, would suggest that Red wanted William to travel to Columbus to see him.

William put the lamp down and ran his fingers through his curly blonde hair: his mind, usually distributed on many lines of thought, was stuck on this, speeding along the same path with the force of a locomotive, the substrate of his psyche worn away under the strength of it: the thought that Red still loved him, that Red wanted him back was intoxicating as it broke its way through the machinery of his mind.

He willed it to stop. This was not what Red meant. Even a young vampire, inexperienced in the language of gifts, even they would not know enough to be able to send something such as this. And yet... Red had a talent. Did he know what he was doing when he sent the lamp? Did Red know what it would mean to any vampire old enough to appreciate it? He couldn't have. And yet... he had sent it.

William shook his head, placing the components of the lamp together to stare at it.

The accompanying letter did not indicate any desire to reunite; it just spoke of his family and sent Chestnut and Julias his regards. The gift's meaning had certainly not been intended. But the locomotive's well-worn path in his brain made William's desire to visit loom large in his mind. Red wouldn't need to know; William could have letters sent via his proxy in Europe - such favours came cheap. The thought of seeing Red again, with his own eyes, of getting an opportunity to witness the happiness reported in his letters... William could not resist the allure. He had never seen the New World, either. A former lover of his was now the Queen of Atlanta; she would no doubt accept an official visit from him, and that would improve his reputation. Moreover, it would be nice to speak with an equal after all the time he had been spending grovelling before dukes. He decided to send Duke Erlis a letter and announce his intention to visit.

--------------

Also, a little excerpt from a conversation earlier in the story, where a fellow thrall is warning Red of what he's getting into:

--------------

“... They aren't normal. And I don't think you understand exactly what that means.”

“I know about the... you know.” He put one hand up to his mouth, doing a small V gesture evocative of having fangs; he got the feeling that this strange, new version of Lucia would flinch if he said the ‘v' word.

“Do you really? I bet you don't know the half of it.”

“I don't doubt that.” Red agreed. “Did something happen? You seem... different.”

“They hear everything we say, even if they are talking in another room. Did you know that?”

“Wait, what? I knew the hearing was good, but I didn't...”

“They pay attention to it, too. I once saw Elodia follow three separate conversations.”

“That's... unsettling.” He studied her for a moment. “Were you worried about being heard yesterday? Is that why you're talking about this now?”

“Yes. I don't know what William is like,” She said, again not using his title. “But I've seen a lot of young people like you... that don't understand what they're dealing with.”

“What do you mean?”

Lucia frowned. “They think they are going on some grand adventure, trying a wonderful drug, perhaps escaping a terrible family. But... I have seen many get killed.”

“I thought that might be the case.” He admitted.

“So I try to make sure that people like you... know. That they can always, always hear you. That they can give you commands that you are powerless to resist, just by making eye contact. And that once you outlive your usefulness, they will kill you and not think twice about it.”

#+end_quote

I think it's on a case-by-case basis, and I'd imagine it's not so much done by exchange as "I want to be the King of Paris. Do you have a problem with that?" - only much like modern marriage proposals, you only ask the question if you already know the answer - so over the past few years, you've been communicating with the Queen of Paris and making it clear that she'd better have an exit strategy because you're going to be the King of Paris before too long, so she ultimately expects you to take it (and, if she has a problem with it, she'll reply back with biting commentary of her own, references to some Big Deal Guy owing her a favour, to the number of Dukes she has, etc).

So, basically, William was born in Tournai, Belgium: let's say he decides he wants to pack up and move there for a few centuries, in a fit of nostalgia. He'd communicate with the current King of the wider area that Tournai is in (let's say the King of Belgium for clarity's sake) - maybe that King is more powerful than him, so his negotiations develop and he is ultimately happy to be the Duke of Tournai: or, perhaps the title is important to him (it surely is), so the King of Belgium allows William to take control of the /Kingdom of Tournai/, which is entirely within the borders of the Kingdom of Belgium. In exchange, the King of Belgium can use the territory of New Holland (William's home) to give to an ally of /his/, perhaps someone else who likes large acerages, and perhaps resolve a centuries-old dispute.

  But the best way to reform /actual/ meat production is not to refrain from eating meat; one better way would be to get into meat production yourself, do it ethically, and /advertise/ the fact. Push the advertising to the point of getting a 'who-can-be-most-ethical' arms race going in the meat industry.
#+end_quote

Someone's trying to do that in England with milk; the problem is, it's extremely expensive so as not to be commercially viable. Like, milk is ten times the cost. Almond, soy, rice, hemp, etc milk are all about twice the price of cow's milk, so it seems like a complete waste to buy cow's milk in that case. (If one prefers the taste, surely one doesn't prefer the taste /that much/?)

Regardless, if it follows that you therefore accept 1, 2, 3, then "it is better" not to eat meat. If you want to start an ethical meat company (which I'm not convinced will be economically viable due to the space required), then "it is better" not to eat meat until the first ethically-raised animal reaches a decent chunk of its natural life span and ethically slaughtered. And once that's all set up, "it is better" to forego meat from all other sources until you are convinced there's a quality assurance process that meets ethical standards.

In my experience most people accept tenets 1, 2 and 3 and choose to eat meat anyway and this is relatively uncontroversial; it's why I was using it as an example for vampires feeding on humans. People will then try and justify meat consumption for a host of other reasons, but I think this is mostly cognitive dissonance: you just have to accept the dissonance. We all do all manner of completely selfish things in our lives the second we spend money on anything other than the basic necessities of life.

So yeah, vampires no doubt accept that killing humans in the eating process is not necessary and is bad, but it's more convenient (they can eat more rarely, no need to worry about the masquerade failing, the process of stopping one's feed is traumatic - I'll chuck William remembering his first meal at the bottom of this one for an idea)

    The protein thing is a complete and utter myth, garbage, honestly.
  #+end_quote

  Huh. Here I thought you'd have to include some percentage of some kind of soybeans.
#+end_quote

Soybeans are a "complete protein" (which is again, a myth: actually every food has complete proteins in it, just some are in far tinier quantities), and they're an excellent source of lysine. So they are really good /if you have a low calorie plant-based diet/.

#+begin_quote
  I think if you're a science lab you can order them. (Googling suggests they go for around a hundred dollars each, so I assume that means there's a fair demand). And they're pretty much ordinary mice until they get injured. But I think they can regenerate about the same speed as your vampires...

I have my old rat cage somewhere. Can I be a science lab???? Hmmm.

Now I want to go through to do my phD so I can order some science mice... When I was entertaining the thought of doing postgraduate studies in nutrition I was idly imagining doing studies on how the BMR changes during HRT for gender dysphoria (since females and males have different BMRs, I'd be interested in how much effect the hormonal stuff has on it: I'd assume most of it since I think it's due to body fat percentage?). Then again I never ever bothered googling to see if it had been studied.

#+end_quote

Yeah. I'm not sure how I want to go with that. I mean, better to keep him more human so I can actually write from his point of view, right? And there's no real purpose to making him more intelligent than I show there, it only paints me in a corner.

#+begin_quote

*William feeding for the first time*

He woke up, unable to move; his arms pinned to his sides, his legs pinned together by off-white linen. He could not breathe, but realised that that did not bother him.

But the hunger, oh, the hunger. As a man he felt hunger in his stomach, or sometimes in his throat; but even on the road, when they had not found game for a week, he did not feel hunger like this. This hunger was in the centre of his chest, in his heart, and it burned, it bled into every part of him.

He struggled against the linen, wanting to be free, to find something to eat. He heard, dimly, the voices of the mourners around him, praying for his soul.

He wondered if that soul was in paradise now.

He heard some murmuring; people saw his movement, as he promised them they would.

Footsteps, and he felt a hand begin to unwrap his bandages.

Clothar, one of his trusted generals, pulled back the last layer of linen and his face filled Clovis' field of vision.

For a moment, the men smiled at each other; a soft, friendly smile that they often shared during quiet moments when they were alone. A smile that in another time and another place might have meant more than the loyalty of a general to his king.

Clovis smelled Clothar's blood; his arms were free, his fangs extended.

He leapt, with agility he did not know he had, and dug the teeth roughly into Clothar's shoulder; the smell of the blood filled him with joy. As he imbibed the liquid that flowed slowly through the shoulder as his teeth slashed on bone, he felt Clothar's spirit, his soul, his loyalty and his love for his commander all at once.

It was the most amazing thing he had ever tasted. He drank Clothar in greedily, as Clothar cried out, first in surprise but then in pleasure. Clovis grew more excited; it was a beautiful moment, and they were sharing it together, better than the victory at the Battle of Soissons where they had drunk a little too much mead and ended up sharing a horse for many miles. This was beyond that; spiritually, he felt them joining.

Then he felt the body, limp in his hands; the connection severed as the blood ran out.

Panicked, he started lapping up the blood that was spilled; the blood that pooled on Clothar's shoulder, the blood that was soaked into his tunic.

Then, he heard the screaming that filled the church....

--------------

Aside: Originally I conceived of William having been Clovis I, king of the Franks. I'm wondering if that's too wanky, even though he's a relatively obscure historical figure. So I'm contemplating just having him be a guy from that same time and place who was not the king of France. Also, standard disclaimer about it being old: I don't think vampire fangs extend during feeding anymore for example. Doesn't really make sense? Or maybe it does?

--------------

Random other aside: I was thinking about vampires eating through their lungs, and I was going, "wouldn't it make more sesne for them to eat through their stomach and vampire goo through their lungs?", but then I realised the lungs go directly to the heart and the stomach goes to the heart via the liver, so the lungs actually are the most direct route from the mouth to the heart.

Yeah, but you still need some rough measure of comparative worth, so that the more powerful vampire can lord his strength over the less powerful one by forcing him into a poor exchange. (In your example, one could tell whether the King of Belgium or William was more powerful by looking at how valuable Tournai is in comparison to New Holland, for example).

And then, if we work in terms of population, one can also get to the concept of a vampire landscape improver, who takes over a large, mostly empty area of land, spends a century or two persuading more people to move in, and then trades up to a larger, emptier piece of land and so on.

That's reasonable. Incidentally, I've now gone and looked up South African food safety laws; it turns out that any meat offered for sale must come from a licensed abattoir, which requires a whole list of rules (mostly around ensuring that the meat is safe for human consumption) including that it must be "handled humanely" in accordance with the Animals Protection Act, 1962; and /that/ in turn includes (amongst other rules) a catch-all rule against causing or omitting any act that results in "any unnecessary suffering" on the part of the animal.

I guess one could raise a quibble over what counts as /necessary/ suffering, but I think that legal framework handles the most egregious problems at least.

(There's another route one can try - pestering the local politician to pass laws legislating against the worst abuses).

Also, having tasted soy milk, I'll admit that I'd rather go without milk than taste it again. (Dunno about the others).

Exactly; and they might be able to infer that William is powerful because he was able to demand a kingdom be made for him, and/or that Tournai is important to him.

I assume secession is rare, though it must happen. William took New Holland when europeans were living there only a few decades: I imagine he got permission from whoever was in charge of the east at the time, though.

#+end_quote

That's pretty neat: I wonder what William was doing before he came to Australia? I had him in Ireland, but I think he moved there to be with someone in particular rather than for political reasons. Perhaps that's why he went to Australia: he was like "I'm going to do something for ME. And I want a huge tract of land that /isn't/ in Russia."

Hmmm, I wonder if a vampire deigns to own Antarctica? Basically the entire crew of the research station would have to be in on it...

#+end_quote

In short, such laws are hard to enforce - undercover footage of slaughterhouses shows all sorts of horrible things - people kicking animals, not properly stunning them, etc. Being a slaughterhouse worker is a terrible job that is generally done by very vulnerable people (there's lots of evidence that it has a horrific psychological effect). I mean, I'm an engineer and I know there are plenty of people who don't do things strictly by the book around here, and there are /huge consequences/ to that in terms of it affecting thousands of people. Whereas if you kill chickens for a living and you're having a hard day and you kick one, nobody gives a shit.

But if we set /all that/ aside, and pretend that slaughterhouses have animals given a humane lethal injection while soft music is playing (the injection would make their meat inedible, btw), the bigger issue is the actual farming practises - the animal's in the slaughterhouse for, say, a week at most whereas the farm is where they spend most of their lives. They're not pretty.

And "slaughterhouses /aren't that bad/, here's a law from the 1960s" is not really much of a defense of point 1 ;)

#+begin_quote
  I guess one could raise a quibble over what counts as /necessary/ suffering, but I think that legal framework handles the most egregious problems at least.
#+end_quote

That's true; better to forgo animal products altogether and let the legal system focus on what's important. Consumer changes to plant-based foods have had a huge effect on big meat and dairy companies: they're diversifying into plant-based alternatives. Change is happening, albeit slowly.

#+begin_quote
  Also, having tasted soy milk, I'll admit that I'd rather go without milk than taste it again. (Dunno about the others).
#+end_quote

Soy milk in particular has a taste that varies wildly based on brands. There are some brands I can't stomach.

I started drinking unsweetened almond milk over cow's milk because it had 1/3 the calories and one's always looking for easy ways to reduce one's caloric intake. I kept with it because it tastes /so much better/. I've occasionally had hot chocolates and stuff with cow's milk and cow's milk has a weird, musty, tangy taste that just doesn't sit right with me anymore.

I think complete proteins were all the rage in the 1970s or something, when it was believed that you had to eat all the proteins in one meal or you'd wither to a husk and die. Even then, a legume and a grain makes a complete protein, so it's easy.

Yeah. We can work with this.

I also had a headcanon (can you HAVE a headcanon for your own universe?) that vampires could be much, much more effective but they spend so much of their mental real estate on status (their dunbar's number is through the roof!) and remembering all the social rules that they don't have room to do much thinking. I believe it's been theorised that primates have big brains to keep track of all their social interactions, and that's what human intelligence scaffolded onto. So it makes an odd sort of sesne.

Yeah, let's not go with that. Maybe they're more like vampire bats. (After googling an image: vampire bat bites look like mini hollywood vampire bites. Ugh.). I mean, vampires could rip the flesh open, but even if we assume that there's a healing factor in there, ripping a big bite out of one's flesh is going to not really work.

Looking at snake fangs, that's not a good way to model it. It seems like big muscles won't be needed but they'll be really obvious on examination.

Perhaps vampire incisors are just especially pointy, like a little knife? But it would mean that if you were to bite someone in a non-feeding way (/wink wink/), you'd probably draw blood.

Maybe have them just be ever so slightly longer than human canines, and very much sharper.

Another option: some snakes have fangs in the back of their mouth. Perhaps vampires have secret fangs there. But I'm not sure you'd be able to bite someone in the neck with those....

In Australia they do something called "captive bolt stunning" where there's a machine that hits the animal in the side of its head to stun it, and then the throat is cut and blood drains (halal slaughter is even worse as the animal can't be stunned IIRC).

*scene that touches on vampire status ?*

The ritual had been strange, as well; Erlis had not chosen one that required the serving of blood, even though that was the most appropriate both for the time of year and for subtly demonstrating superiority by showing that his attendants were superior to Red. And Erlis, of all people, must have known that William had a special attachment to Red what with his frequent requests for updates and the fact he had chosen to visit at all. Another vampire might think William was on his way to Atlanta, or going on a progress of sorts to repair his reputation, but Erlis must have known his true motivation.

And yet Erlis did not attempt to press his advantage. He had chosen for them to do the Dance of Dabbalemi. It was a complex ritual, but one William had been performing since before Erlis had been born. Erlis had clearly been taught well; his motions were fluid and pure and his steps were timed perfectly. In one of his apparently regular breaks from tradition, the music was performed in a modern style by a modern band of musicians. Although liberties were often taken with the arrangement of the traditional music for Dance of Dabbalemi, there was no doubt that the songs they performed the ritual movements to were modern inventions, especially given the inclusion of a saxophone in the band.

When the dance concluded, William sat down in the provided chair as tradition commanded, waiting for the customary goblets of water. Erlis approached the band and thanked them for their performance as he smiled and shook their hands. He handed them a white envelope from his inside jacket pocket, gave a small bow, and moved into his kitchen. The band began packing up, talking amongst themselves. William tried not to let that bother him.

Moments later, Erlis emerged from his kitchen, holding intricately carved conical horn goblets full of water that was at the appropriate temperature. William smiled: although they had not been brought by any sort of valet, the goblets were appropriately curved and the plants and animals that adorned it indicated an appropriate amount of respect. He was comforted that Erlis was able to pay attention to detail when it suited him.

William stuck his third finger into the goblet before placing it on each of his teeth in turn. Erlis also performed the ritual cleaning of each of his teeth, the order that each did so expressing subtle signals of gratitude and of friendship. William was glad to finally feel respected again; Erlis's minute gestures signalled that he thought of them as kindred spirits.

After precisely placing the goblets on the table and standing, they performed the carefully choreographed series of bows that concluded the ritual.

“Thank you.” William said, making a smile.

“I'm glad you liked it.” Erlis grinned. “I've got something for you. I wanted to give it to you during the ritual, but I realised you might not have anything with you to give in exchange.”

“Although one does not usually give and receive gifts during the Dance of Dabbalemi, I am sure I could manage it.” William said proudly.

Erlis laughed. “All the same, I didn't want to put you out. This is more of a personal gift, so I don't want anything in return. It doesn't really mean anything.” He stood up, and picked a small, modern notebook out of one of the bookcases. He handed it to William.

“Thank you.” William wasn't sure what to make of it; the light blue cover indicated sorrow over an upcoming funeral. He doubted Erlis meant it as a threat, so he had no idea what to make of it.

“I've been living here for just over a hundred years.” He explained. “I've always liked writing, so I kept a diary. I thought you might be interested to learn about the family of that Redmond gentleman you seem to have such a liking for.”

William allowed his eyes to narrow, trying to indicate his displeasure at having his weakness probed in this way.

Erlis laughed again; he seemed comfortable. “I've heard a lot about you. You know people are talking, surely. But not everyone is like Elodia. Some of us think it's a good thing.”

“Excuse me?”

“Some of us think they deserve our respect. The humans. They may not be our equals, but they deserve better.”

William frowned; this was the sort of naive attitude that came from a young vampire who still had a foot in his mother's womb.

“And, of course, they get smarter all the time. You heard about that bomb. The flying machines must astound you. You were born when ships were new, right?”

“Ships have been around for ten thousand years. None of us are that old.”

Erlis chuckled nervously. “Sorry, sorry. I didn't think - but still, it's amazing, isn't it? Can you imagine what they'll be doing in a hundred years?”

“The past few hundred have had some rather interesting progressions.” He admitted.

“And when they have bombs that make sunlight? When they can make gold from lead? Do you want to be on their bad side when that happens?”

******** It's how transformation works; lets you change in mass quite easily.

So vampires are essentially a "cone" that has a vampire on one end, and a bat on the other.

Unfortunately, my husband (who is a mathematician with a special interest in higher dimensional shapes) did the maths and even if the 4th dimension is only 1mm thick, their total form weighs as much as the earth or something.

That said, given vampires, werewolves aren't born in 4D, it's pretty easy to conceive that they have a very odd shape. Perhaps a tiny "spur" from their heart from which a whole second body comes, so they would perhaps flicker a tiny bit as they left their first body and their second (identical) body appeared, and then got smaller and turned into a bat. Could mean earth!body is vulnerable to beheading.

Vampires can't control their transformation, just will it to start (since they're not 4D natives: werewolves don't even get to will it to start). So there's no chance of a vampire wearing "morph armour" by having their transformation stop at the full-size double body.

** I'm sort of tinkering with an urban fantasy story along the much loved trope of monster hunters and an atypical (and rational) vampire. My worldbuilding issue right now is the monster hunter organization.

In today's world of CCTVs, mobile phones, NSA surveilance and the internet, maintaining secret headquarters for monster hunting seems difficult if not impossible. Even more so when the monsters may have additional resources.

How would you maintain a secret organization of monster hunters in a world much like today, where monsters such as vampires and demons exist, hidden from most. And how would you do to have the solution maintain an air of ancient heritage from a branch of the original Knights Templar or similar?

Next question is, how does the /monsters/ remain hidden? If the world, or even just a nation state goes to war against a small number of monsters, there can only be one result (why else would the monsters hide instead of rule?). And with the above mentioned information tools, especially the ever present cell phone vidoe cameras, how could they stay hidden?

My current line of thought is World of Darkness inspired, in that vampires have infiltrated or influences key positions in leadership and media (including YouTube) to keep the lid on, and most monster factions actively self-police to stay hidden. Does that sound feasible?

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Hunters need to be secret because monster are.

Also, having large numbers of weapons (modern and medieval, apologies if I made it seem like they were restricted to ancient stuff) and walking around with it raises all kinds of flags, especially in today's age of shootings and terror attacks.

I want the kind of secret war often portrayed in urban fantasy novels, but with a bit more plausibility. I keep thinking, "the acronym agencies would be /all over/ that".

If they can ferret out terrorist cells, how does a group of people that are heavily armed in their day to day work stay secret?

#+end_quote

This is a horrible in-story reason.

If having the monsters revealed to the world will result in them being hunted down and killed, then the Hunters should be deliberately /trying/ to reveal the monsters to the world; because successfully revealing the monsters to the world means that they win.

Plus, then the monster hunters can walk around with weaponry without too much trouble from the acronym agencies (in fact, said acronym agencies would be helping them to find and track monsters).

--------------

Alright, so here's a few options to consider that look more sensible to me:

Option 1: Revealing the existence of monsters won't result in the monsters being wiped out. In fact, no-one's even sure whether or not it will result in the monsters losing the resulting war. What is known is that the resulting war will most likely lead to the deaths of a substantial (80%+) portion of humanity (so the Hunters don't want to trigger it) and /might/ lead to the Monsters being wiped out but will certainly lead to them being put to significant trouble (so the Monsters have reason to remain hidden).

Option 2: The Monsters have already won. They control, directly or indirectly (vampires can hypnotise, right?) every major state and government body. This includes /all/ the Acronym Agencies. The only reason humanity is still around is because we're useful to them - the vampires, for example, prefer the taste of human blood. The werewolves might prefer to be able to hunt prey that is intelligent enough to make the hunt /interesting/. (In fact, some werewolves might even deliberately set out to /start/ monster-hunting agencies and hire and even arm humans, just so they have reasonably challenging prey).

Another thought which can combine with either of the above: A lot of monsters are only harmed by special weapons or materials, most of which do not look like weapons (e.g. silver for werewolves - throw a handful of silver coins at a werewolf and you'll do more damage than a hundred iron swords). Since the anti-monster weapons are not the sort of weapons that the anti-terrorism agencies are looking for, they tend not to bother... too much.

Huh. Well don't I feel stupid now? Thanks :)

What if hunters are /also/ supernatural (in some yet to be determined way), and will be dragged away to secret blacksite labs just as quickly as the monsters? Would that put hunters and monsters on some kind of equal "lets keep this quiet" footing?

Or maybe the Hunters /have/ been trying for a long time to convince authorities, but are seen as crackpots and conspiracy theorists (but why? a few samples to some labs around the world should be enough...).

Re: Option 1: plausible but would have to be framed right to convince the reader. The cost of losing a potential future confrontation when the monsters are ready for it would have to be mild enough to not be worth eliminating the threat once and for all, at all costs, as soon as possible. I would prefer a less challenging (to me) solution.

Re: Option 2: this is in line with the direction I was leaning towards, except I was thinking complete victory is not possible, and vampires have settled for a puppet master type of control to hide their existence. Vampires are so few in number that if the general public were aware of them and took action then the vampires would lose; numbers, need for blood, operate in daylight and all that.

This is tricky stuff, thanks a lot for helping out!

I was more thinking if the hunters reveal themselves, its not just the end of that singular hunter, but it becomes Humans vs Hunters as governments scramble to "eliminate the supernatural threat to national security" (and possibly start the supernatural cold war arms race).

I think of complete victory as open, brazen rule by monsters with a subjugated humanity reduced to slaves, pets, entertainment and food.

I still need/want them to wish to maintain secrecy. I do not aim for a "everyone knows magic is real" type of urban fantasy, more the World of Darkness/Constantine/Supernatural type where there is a secret war going on that most people don't know about or notice most of the time.

So I need all parties to sort of want to keep the general public out of the loop, either by controlling/squashing information through control of government and media, by making it look like mundane events/deaths or by simply not making any big waves (or a combination).

A bonus of having factions policing their own is that I can include (for example) vampiric tribunals and other political shenanigans.

The trick is to make it plausible.

Okay, yeah, open, brazen rule won't work.

But it doesn't need to be brazen. Maybe the monsters, having control of everything, just leave their human puppets to take care of the paperwork.

Or maybe there's one kind of monster that feeds on emotions, and can't survive on existential despair... so the other monsters leave humanity in a state where this kind can feed.

Or maybe there's a third faction - a faction with the ability to see the future, and they've foreseen that either side being revealed to the world leads to Bad Stuff that Destroys Everything (or at least destroys something important to them). They're mostly neutral, but they can see in advance what action or actions will reveal monsters to the world - and will step in at the perfect moment to prevent the reveal with minimal effort. Sometimes - even often - this will involve setting up what looks like a coincidence (e.g. placing a heavy book where it will later fall off and crush the evidence), which means that for most of the story, their presence is unknown to either Monster or Hunter. And even when discovered, all they do that's remotely useful for either side is make cryptic 'prophecies' that just guide everyone into acting the way this third side wants them to act...

They might even have "troll squads" that output a lot of conspiracies, photshops, etc just to cement the idea of supernatural = tinfoil loonies.

I like the idea, but in the kind of story I'm thinking of it would make it too common if all mental illnesses were demonic in nature. I prefer it to be fewer but more intense happenings (like full blown possessions). Also, the best lies have a grain of truth in them. Hmm...

Definitely can see things like paranoia, hearing voices, etc falling into this category. But how to explain eating disorders, self-harm, narcissism, etc?

Maybe there could be a singular werewolf as a unique character that for some reason has chosen to live in the city (perhaps guiding new werewolves out of the city, or some personal ageda).

Yeah, I was unclear. The story is going to be very city focused as it is now. So werewolves are more out of scope than non-existing.

Knee-jerk reaction is too much comic relief. Character themes/feels are more of the "agent/private eye/serial killer/assassin/crime syndicate" flavor.

Which brings me back to the original question: how does vampire/demon/misc-hunters organize and operate safely with the authorities being in the pocket of the bad guys and with all the technology and surveillance of today? Especially if they want to maintain some form of permanent headquarters? Perhaps temporary safe houses and op centers are more realistic?

I would really like to have the trope-ish "library of ancient books" and "strange artifacts in glass boxes" because I love that stuff. But if it isn't plausible then it has to go.

There's one more question that needs to be answered first. What's their motivation for monster-hunting?

Are they in this to:

- Protect innocents?
- Eliminate monsters?
- Prove the superiority of the human genome?
- They're psychopathic murderers and want to go after things that don't leave unsightly corpses?
- Xenophobia?
- Someone's offering a bounty per Monster killed?

This is certainly going to make a difference to what they do and how they operate.

Easiest way to do /this/ is to have one guy who's rich. Really rich. Bruce Wayne I-have-a-private-mansion rich. And he keeps both the library and the strange artifacts in his private mansion. (But be careful - "strange artifacts" is very close to "proof-positive paranormal")

Another option is to have the ancient books and strange artifacts be in a hidden room - say, the basement of the local museum - which technically anyone can go to, except the janitor (who's one of the monster hunters) is the only one with the key and he usually locks the door.

A mix of the points you bring up. The main organization of the story are in it to protect innocents by eliminating monsters. It is quite xenophobic in that (being of religious origin) all monsters are bad, period.

Individuals in the organization have their own personal level of xenophobia, and differ in which means justify the ends. One part of the story will be how it and its members react to a non-typical vampire.

There are other monster hunters, and monster hunter groups, that for some reason or other does not fit in with the organization.

My problem with this and similar fixed locations is that it seems so very likely that the hunters movements are tracked to this location at some point (cell phones, sattellite imagery, camera drones, manual surveillance, "enhanced" interrogation, etc) and then the collection of knowledge and resources is just a SWAT team away from being lost.

I would love to have an old building with a secret basement, like the museum you suggest or any old stone building really. I just can't get past the flaws. If I put myself in the mind of the bad guys there are too many ways to find and destroy it.

I need something that is safe against a rational and intelligent opponent with plenty of resources.

I keep coming up with boring solutions like decentralized and compartmentalized monster hunting cells using dark-net chat rooms and monster-hunting wikis. I want a little more focus on "fantasy" in urban fantasy, but it has to be plausible.

#+end_quote

Hmmmm.

As far as protecting innocents goes, let's say John Smith is a vampire. The Monster Hunter's cover story (so far as surveillance organisations are concerned) might be that John Smith is a serial killer, and /these/ disappeared people are among his victims, and no, Officer, I don't know why their bodies turned up without so much as a drop of blood, and yes, maybe I /should/ have gone to the police but he'd kidnapped me and - well, I guess I got lucky... no, I /don't/ know where he vanished to...

But it's not just the cover story after the fact that's important. It's also all about what happens /before/ the fact - how they track down and attack Monsters without attracting attention. And the thing is... decentralised hunting cells with dark-net chat rooms are a good idea for that. Because they /work/. The library of ancient tomes, the room of curious devices... those are impressive. They look good. But they have flaws - like existing in a single location - that an intelligent opponent can use, as you point out.

But they /are/ impressive. So how about this idea - most of the actual monster hunting is done electronically (specialised cellphone app using PGP-encrypted data for communication?) But one of the guys in the local group has the ancient tomes, he has the curiosities in plexiglass cases, and (very importantly) everything he has is /mobile/. So, when there's a newbie that he wants to impress, he puts it all in his van, drives to a handy building with a basement, bring the newbie in to look around, then packs it up afterwards and leaves - by the time the SWAT team arrives, there's just an empty basement and no proof of anything (same thing if the protagonist tries to sneak into the library on his own)

--------------

Alternatively, the monster-hunters have a /little/ bit of magic of their own. Not much, just a bit of space-twisting that allows two rooms to occupy the same physical space - turn the doorknob to the /right/, you have the boring, mundane room, but if you turn the knob to the /left/, you have the Ancient Library. So, anyone who visits without knowing the secret never finds anything incriminating (though, if Tom the Hunter is in the library and foolishly carrying his cell phone, they might have a bit of fun trying to track its signal and never, ever quite finding the thing even when their equipment says the signal's coming from /right in front of you/).

******************** The mobile library is a nice idea, a bit like the trailer The Accountant uses. Or maybe a standard-sized shipping container that fits on a truck.

Still, to access it there needs to be contact between a potentially compromised (under surveillance) hunter and the library. And then the adversary can follow the vehicle or at least flag the make and model as one to look for.

The self disguising room is not really a solution, if enough hunters go in and out of a building, I'd bomb it or at least pump it full with knockout gas and tear it down brick by brick.

Hmmm.... maybe the supernatural is the answer, like you suggest.

Some kind of "the coast is clear" magic would be enough. Or a magic that hides them, but that would be too easy if they could be invisible from monsters. So maybe they can't hide from monsters, only humans and technology. But they can also /detect/ monsters, so if a monster decides to do the surveillance themselves, it will announce their presence to the hunters... but that sort of makes any ambush by monsters impossible, which is also kind of bad for the story...

Yeah, and that is a problem. But... as soon as it drives off, the potentially compromised Hunter is no longer arranged. They just have to lose any followers, either change the plates or move the Container onto a new truck...

It's a fair bit of work, but it's not /impossible/ to hide, at least temporarily. And, sure, every now and then a vampire will be able to track down the truck. In which case, well, did you know what a mist of vaporised garlic does to a vampire? (Neither do I.) And if even /that/ fails to work...

I think the best option here is magic that hides a (carefully prepared) /room/. Any Monsters in the room can see any Hunters in the room just fine - the trick is that they can't see the room if they don't know the secret. And the secret is something trivial - like lighting a specific candle before entering the room, or pushing on a certain brick, or just turning the doorknob the wrong way - that can be easily replicated if a Hunter is silly enough to let himself be observed opening the door (so the Monsters can still pull off their ambush if they put in the prep work).

The neighbours will be told to "stay inside and away from windows citizen, police are conducting an anti-terrorism raid" or some other excuse the government can use to do whatever they want with a building.

The hidden room has a similar problem. If an FBI agent, gps tracker, mobile phone tracker or surveillance camera tracks multiple suspected hunters visiting the building repeatedly, the government can lock it down in all manner of ways. Even if they don't get into the room they can deny it to hunters by cordoning off the building or rigging it with hidden cameras and explosives for the next time the hunters visit.

I would also like to (but may have to abandon) books that are special (think of the Necronomicon, it's just not the same to have a digital copy). Same with ancient daggers and such that have attributes that can not be duplicated in a modern steel K-Bar. Again, I may have to abandon such items because it's just too impractical.

*********************** Take [[/u/CCC_037][u/CCC_037]]'s idea a step further, and make the entrance abstract. The library could be accessed from any place, if you have a suitable door and know /how/ to open it (with such-and-such speed, uttering a certain phrase, using the right key), with the caveat that you would be able to leave it only through the door you entered through. (You can enter through the door from your bedroom, but you will leave only /into/ your bedroom.) If the door you used is destroyed, you're trapped there forever.

The library itself is located in a bunker far beneath the Earth, or in a pocket dimension.

Hmmm... to counter this, what if there were /multiple/ hidden rooms, and more could be constructed (at an extremely large cost in both time and materials, basically needing to be built into the house at the time of construction) at any point. And each hidden room contains a means of magical teleportation, which can /only/ work between hidden rooms; so, if building A is cordoned off, the Hunters can go to the hidden room in building B, and then from there teleport to the Building A room. (And, if they really want, they can then step out of that room and stroll around in Building A inside the cordon, though for obvious reasons this is probably a very bad idea).

If this were to exist, then junior or possibly-compromised Hunters wouldn't get close to it. Only senior Hunters would know of it, and of those, only two or three at a time would know the location of any particular volume - and they certainly wouldn't be kept in the same place as each other (it's a lot easier to hide one book than to hide a library). Ancient daggers would probably each be carried on the person of a senior Hunter, who would thus avoid metal detectors if he could ("but officer, it's just a letter opener!") This would imply that magic-weapon-carrying Hunters wouldn't use commercial aeroplanes (though some might have small private planes and their own licenses)

*** Here is an idea

- Earth is a very minor unimportant place in the grand scheme of things and like a primitive hunter-gatherer tribe are ignorant of the much larger polities and civilizations around them.

- A strong relatively nearby major power or coalition has a prime directive of sorts. (This could be for ethical, religious or pragmatic reasons, though it might be better off to leave them relatively unknown.) that gets them to counter and punish obvious attempts at reveals.

- The nearby major power serves as the patron as the monster hunter organization and supplies the magic or technology needed to equip them, manipulate governments and keep things hidden.

There are various ideas you could have for the prime directive. It could be philosophical, religious or pragmatic. For WoD I would expect something like

- Every species develops it's own unique magic system if they are allowed to develop it naturally

- If a species achieves widespread exposure to another species magic system then they adopt it and lose their ability to develop one naturally.

- Local major power became a major power because their magic system enables them to steal magic from other places and they are just waiting for Earth to develop magic before one comes to consume us all.

As to why the local major power contracts out to humans instead of using normal humans.

- It could because their citizens can't navigate an earth-like environment (e.g size of small city, used to different magical field, or are used to strange geometries)

- Individuals are all powerful and high quality but they only have a small population and Earth is not worth having a dedicated individual managing it.

- They have passive magical effects which would effect our environment

- Earth is one of many backwood planets and they are too busy using resources for their own entertainment or a major war to commit more than a token amount of resources.

Humans and others without a magical system have raw chaotic magical fields that are constantly interfering with each other as well as any other magic in the area. Systematic magic is magic that has found a stable self-reinforcing configuration. It passively shapes other magic to be more like itself. This doesn't really work on already stable magic. It does work on raw magic but only if there is a lot of exposure (As in the magic was actively used on them or they are surrounded by people with the same system) or if the magic system is particularly suited to the species to question. (In which case the magic system spreads extremely rapidly from passive interactions betweeen magic fields and works much better for that species than others)

I would say the vampire aliens have a magic system that allows them to control the people they bite and draw power from their vampiric descendants. They go to a backwater world, bite someone, force their magical system on them and then get them to keep biting others.
