** Sorry about that, folks, apparently when it posts on mobile it says "there's an error when posting, try again later" even if it does actually post each time.

** For a moment, I thought there was suddenly a bunch of updates for the story. Then I saw they all had the same chapter number.

I'm disappointed now.

** What does a conclusion to these kinds of stories look like? It is always interesting in the beginning but when ever I have seen these stories get to the building-guns part I loose most of my interest. I do not know if it is the almost-modern weaponry or the inevitable modern warfare that I care less about, but either way most of these stories I loved in the beginning and then I felt as if the author no longer knows where to take the story.

*** Have faith, I have an overall story direction planned.

We're actually about 3-4 arcs from the end of the story.
