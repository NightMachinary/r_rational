I've always liked the way that the world of SG1 operates. They put a lot of thought into providing reasonable explanations for the advanced tech they come across, and the world evolved and adapted to new information as the show progressed. Here's a few examples of interesting story elements that I remember:

- *Tech level advances as new discoveries are made.* The humans learned from the tech that they encountered out in the galaxy, then used their own ingenuity to build on that tech in new and interesting ways.
- *A common biology.* Humanoid aliens are /actually human/. The show explains that ancient humans were shuttled off to various planets around the galaxy to serve as slaves. Some of those communities became free and developed their own societies.
- *Caution and SOPs are commonplace.* Being an air force operation, the Stargate program was handled with a great deal of caution and foresight. A MALP is always sent ahead of any personnel to assess a planet's atmosphere and hostility, and the teams often default to following orders.
- *Enemies react to the protagonists.* The various enemies that SG1 encounters repeatedly seem to learn from their mistakes. The replicators are a great example of this, becoming steadily more difficult to destroy as time went on.

Now, this is not to say that the show doesn't have big problems. It never gives a good explanation as to how everyone in the galaxy speaks English. It also takes liberties when talking about how wormholes function, and the Stargate addressing system is quite terrible (although this one could be explained as the creators trying to be way too clever when they designed it).

Are there any other fans of the show here? What would you change about the show to make it better? Do you agree with this assessment?


** I love Stargate! It does make a lot more sense than pretty much any other popular sci-fi franchise of the last few decades. One of the things it did a lot was to dissect and subvert the tendency towards "Awesome but Impractical" tech that very advanced species seem to have in fiction. The MP5 is definitively superior to most other handheld weaponry they encounter, even though most species dismiss it as a "primitive rock-thrower".

*** Oh yeah, totally. Like when it was explained that Goauld weapons were more for show than actually being effective, since they were terror weapons. When you look at Goauld tech from that standpoint, it totally makes sense why they designed things that way, and why the humans choose to adapt it rather than just copy it.

It also gave a convenient justification for the bad guys quickly upping in threat level. Anubis packed in a rapid fire staff weapon and healing device into his Kull Warriors, the replicators overclocked Goauld hyperdrives, Baal cloned himself and later exploited the solar flare time travel glitch in a clever way.

Another thing I liked about it was the tendency to reuse technobabble solutions to problems of the week in a consistent and logical manner. Power surge makes gate jump addresses? Try using that effect next time when you need to break a gate connection because of the blackhole.

It's that sometimes they needed Daniel anyway, and there didn't seem to be any pattern to it.

Also, you have to explain why, in the film, they needed Daniel to translate on Abydos but, in the series, they didn't need Daniel to translate on Abydos.

I assumed Daniel taught them English during his time living there. And any Goauld could have learned English by briefly taking an English-speaking host. The real question is why the Jaffa (like Tealc) or the other human populations could speak English before they could have learned it.

Telepathic function of the gates? If it provided enough to understand the basic language, but no idioms, it would explain why they still needed Daniel Jackson for communication sometimes but not normally. It would also mean that they need to have other communication plans when they are away from the gate.

Other stuff to reconstruct...

Whenever a tech doesn't show up again, mention problems with adapting or reverse engineering it.

Explain more about the Goauld Politics and Politics with the Asgard and Earth to justify why they don't repeat the blackhole dialed stargate into sun trick more often (and other OP tricks or uses of tech like that).

Have them speculate on limitations or dangers of timetravel and develop a policy about it to explain why the don't ever risk abusing it more. (But are willing to risk it other times)

The whole convergent evolution into a biologically compatible form with the ancients... my head-canon is that human life actually originated on earth and the ancients descended from time-traveling humans (who went back in time). The only thing that could be construed as evidence for this is the ancient's taboo against time travel, the fact that the ancients have a civilization so old they can't remember their own origins, and the fact that the convergent evolution explanation is completely implausible without introducing other factors... (As another alternative... perhaps the ascended realm is actively manipulating the physical universe to create humanoid beings that can eventually ascend?)

Because if they used it once, the Goauld have no idea what was done or how they did it. If they use it more times, maybe the Goauld figure out how it works and just wipe earth off the planet. Plus, earth was never in as dire a situation again after that point. So it could have always been a "last minute backup plan".

I totally agree. They seem to operate somewhat independently, but also with a kind of feudal system. Some of the Tok'ra episodes started to explain their politics and tendencies, but it still divided the species along strict lines of 'good' and 'evil', with no real in-between.

Yeah, it doesn't quite work with the show as it is. However, ff you were doing a rationalist take on it, you could use this idea to keep events fairly consistent with the show. You would need to remember that they need translator technology when on ships or otherwise away from the gate.

Canonically, Both.

Humans were engineered by Ancients, or at least their predecessors were, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Then, in about 8000 BC, the refugees from Atlantis returned to Earth after the loss of the war with the Wraith. Some of them ascended, others crossbred with the new existing humans.

This is the origin of the ATA gene in the modern human population, and it is why it is only in Tau'ri or Pegasus natives.

They left around the same time the rest of the ancients in the Milky Way were dying from the ancient plague.

They then went to Pegasus, where they explicitly did create Human life.

While it is never directly said that they in whole or in part modified the development of Earth, they were the first evolution of the human form, and had proven to be able to create more humans when needed, and they were on Earth and in the Milky Way for 40 million years.

The movie made a nod in that direction by having everyone speak a language close to Egyptian. And this makes sense if the Goa'uld ruled that region during that timeperiod, though we'd then expect Egyptian to be a linguistic isolate. The Goa'uld would keep a static language of administration; the Jaffa would all speak it; there should be a decent supply of human slaves that speak it. Furthermore, since the Goa'uld territories are widespread and many of the other races are fighting against them, there should be people who speak this language in pretty much every race.

However, being a lingua franca or the language of administration isn't the same as having most everyone speak it. The Hittite Empire had a Hittite language, but I believe Hattic was the language of administration, and most of the people typically spoke Luwian. We can imagine, though, that the Goa'uld, insisting on being able to interrogate even the lowest slave, would insist that everyone speak Egyptian on pain of pain.

Furthermore, you can pretend that the entire Stargate base operates in Egyptian and English interchangeably.

Independent planets would still pose a significant communications problem.

If you design a system of transport that can transport beings from solar system to solar system, and make the technology durable enough to last millennia, then it would seem to me to be foolish to /not/ include some sort of translation package to keep vastly diverged languages from becoming an impediment to peaceful interactions between representatives of the different solar systems.

I think that the chances of human populations separated from one another for many, many generations being able to speak to one another with little difficulty is far less possible than the idea of a technology we do not understand making communications possible.
