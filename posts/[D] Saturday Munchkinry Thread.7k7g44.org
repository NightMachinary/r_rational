Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** The God of Legalism created a ritual that lets people swear magical oaths.

Standard form is something like, "If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty]."

The ritual allows people to agree on wording in advance. Multiple people can make simultaneous promises, so you can deals like: "as long as you're loyal to me, I'll be loyal to you"

Once the ritual is done, people feel a strong mental pressure to perform their part of an agreement, up to the point where they invoke the penalty clause.

How would you exploit a world with magical contracts? What precautions would you take before swearing one?

--------------

Going a level meta, you're the God of Legalism.

Applying mental pressure costs you power. You get power when people perform the contract ritual. And you get [some of?] the power sacrificed in penalties.

How do you tweak the contract system so that it's used and you get as much power as possible?

**** That's a good point.

Let's start by saying that the God of Legalism likes descriptive linguistics. Your pile of metal objects counts as a "heap of coins" when ~90% of native speakers would agree that the pile is a heap, and that the objects are coins.

Magic is backed by a 'platonic realm' where everyone's expectations of 'coins' shapes a platonic form of 'coinness'. Every contract has to be in a language that's reasonably popular. And everyone involved needs to be speaking the same language.

So, "remain loyal" will only prohibit stuff that basically everyone in our culture would agree is solidly disloyal.

Concepts that are too vague or complex to have a well-understood meaning will cause the spell to fail. The common work-around for subjectivity is to explicitly name a standard. "I'll remain loyal unless the tribe chief banishes you."

*** Ok so if you can inflict arbitrary penalty clauses then you can easily leverage this to godlike power. Thus I'll just assume that the penalty is something to do with mind control just like the "mental pressure". Of course depending on the strength of the contracts compulsion it may well be totally superfluous to even include a penalty clause.

Now if the compulsion that's part of the normal contract isn't good enough you can always set people up so they're guaranteed to fail their contract, and then have the penalty invoke whatever mind control you want here.

Anyway if this works like I think it does then the first competent person to get access to this will coerce some people into agreeing to a contract that makes them unquestionably loyal to him. Then all of those people go on to threaten /more/ people who are assimilated into the contract army.\\
Point is this inevitably ends either one person having absolute control over humanity, or several such empires in constant conflict.

Honestly given there's no limitation on coercing people into contracts it seems inevitable that this leads to political power becoming totally centralized, and thus allowing those in power to act with utter impunity since their citizens are literally incapable of opposing them in any way.

Get all the uninfected to make an impossible oath to the God of Legalism with the penalty that they can no longer make oaths to the God of Legalism. Now even if they are captured by the infected, they can't make any oaths, so they can't be infected.

***** People taking oaths to vaccinate themselves would require that people be aware of how things worked, which they probably wouldn't given how early on I predict people would try doing this sort of thing. It's entirely possible that the very first person to find out about contracts starts using a plan like this and you can be quite sure that people would not know what's going on. After all how are they supposed to find out since the people in contracts will never reveal that information?

Also importantly you are likely to not notice this sort of thing spreading because you would want the controlled to act exactly the same except the part where they sometimes try to get people alone so they can force them into a contract.

Of course if somehow the information on contracts /did/ spread before anyone can implement this sort of plan then everybody would probably immunize themselves. The result of which would be that the existence of contracts doesn't matter that much short term.

Long term however even if people are immunized initially the next generation isn't. So you're likely going to get all kind of tyrannical results with governments indoctrinating children into total loyalty as soon as they get old enough to make contracts. Plus since countries that did so would have such a massive advantage there would be perverse incentives for every government to do so (either that or they get overtaken by countries that do).

**** I think this is solved by the proper precommitment oaths. If everyone simply swears, as soon as they're developmentally competent, "I shall not swear any oath that compels slavery nor loyalty, nor shall I swear an oath under the threat of force," the worst of these scenarios are prevented.

Of course, one might want to fine-tune that. The threat of jail time, technically a threat of force, shouldn't prevent you from professing your innocence under a truth oath in court. Life-long debt may not technically be slavery. I'm sure lawyers would whip up something appropriate in no time if it actually became relevant.

I think you're forgetting that in the scenario where governments use oaths to enslave the next generation they will likely make them swear oaths /as soon as they're capable of doing so/. Plus governments with a fair degree of nationalism may well have a pretty big portion of the populace on board with swearing oaths to the government. Particularly since the oaths seem to have tangible benefits (people under oath are going to be putting in 100% effort into whatever task the government desires of them).

As for fine tuning oaths that don't just totally disallow any further oaths, I think you're overestimating how well thought out most such "vaccination" oaths are likely to be. After all there will be mass hysteria over the potential of mind control, so I don't think most people are going to end up using the most well crafted oaths in their scramble to immunize themselves (particularly since such things are probably beyond the cognitive capacity of most people to come up with).

**** From what I read, I interpreted it as an entirely psychological phenomenon. The power can't omnipotently activate by reading reality, it depends entirely on your knowledge of whether or not the conditions have been met. Further, the power cannot control reality to punish you, but punishments have to be something you can inflict on yourself. That is, if you know (or believe) a condition has been activated then you will be pressured to punish yourself, if you don't believe this then you will not be pressured. It's effectively a form of pre-commitment, and could theoretically exist in real life with no supernatural phenomenon if a species had evolved an incredibly strong psychological aversion to lying or breaking promises.

would the Library disappear for ten thousand years? Or would the God of Legalism first recognize the ownership laws of the U.S., before its own contracts could take place? In which case, if the laws of man take precedent, I'd imagine there are some crazy exploits that could be achieved by passing very specifically worded laws.

*** The motivation for this is that I've been reading a Kim Harrison book. The story uses the 'demons with detailed magic contracts' tropes.

There are parts of the trope I like. It creates room for cleverness, and gives the characters clear stakes. But, when I see the trope in stories, the contracts seem so exploitable that no magic society could really use them.

I'm trying to see if there's a way that they could work in genre fiction without being story-breakingly powerful, or so dangerous that no one would ever consider making them.

Yea. I think language in general is so fluid and subjective that, while it's fun to watch a protagonist trick their way through a situation using contracts, it's not particularly "realistic" or believable. The types of contracts in these stories leave lots of wiggle room, and I think intelligent characters (whether protagonist or antagonist) would never knowingly sign such agreements.

One different interpretation of the contract trope that I particularly enjoyed was in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Booth_at_the_End][/The Booth at the End/]]. Essentially, people come to this stranger and tell him their wishes. The man looks the wishes up in his book, and tell them what they have to do in exchange. The wisher has to accomplish the given task(s) in a way that they /truly believe/ is valid, at which point they're granted their wish. There's no bargaining or restructuring of the contract: simply a lookup of "if you want X, then go do Y." It's actually fairly similar to [[#s][Brandon Sanderson's /Stormlight Archive/ spoiler]]

I'm so exploiting the hell out of this. Heck you can even avoid the mental pressure part entirely by having X be an impossible action that you have to do immediately. So you fail to do X instantly and the /penalty/ instantly invokes.

- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of the death of friend A": God of Legalism goes to kill X, (who I don't actually like, but I won't tell that to the God of Legalism).
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of having more money than I know what to do with!": God of Legalism gives me money?
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of being alone!": finally get rid of those pesky people you don't like.
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of being too smart to fit in with other people": God of Legalism gives me int boost?
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of living an eternal life, and thus experiencing more suffering than others would in their short lives": God of Legalism gives me immortality?

What are the limits here? Because I can phrase just about every good thing as a penalty.

/do [thing you want]/ eh? Who determines whether I have done this thing? The God of Legalism I presume?

So I assume that what you have in mind is things like "I swear to do give X 100 bucks", and then the God of Legalism can use his god-knowledge to verify whether I have given X 100 bucks.

I'm so exploiting the hell out of this. Heck you can even avoid the mental pressure part entirely by having X be an action that you have to do immediately. So you succeed/fail to do X instantly and the penalty instantly invokes. Then just make the penalty something trivial, like a stubbed toe.

- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where next week's lotto numbers are X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether next week's lotto numbers are X for me in the next few seconds, and I get a stubbed toe if it isn't. So I go win the lotto if my toe isn't stubbed.
- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where valuable treasures can be found in area X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether valuable treasures can be found in area X, and I get a stubbed toe if not. So I do binary search on areas, narrow down the locations with treasures, and go collect them, gaining all kinds of powerful artifacts and valuable items.
- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where my soulmate can be found in area X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether my soulmate can be found in area X, and I get a stubbed toe if not. So I do binary search on areas, narrow down the location, then go meet my soulmate.

What are the limits here? Because I can get the answers for just about any binary question in this manner. Heck I could probably do a lot more than that by including self references.

The collective understanding of the punishment is not something that reality inflicts upon the oath-taker, but rather it's something the oath-taker feels a mental compulsion to do if they fail the original condition. Or, as [[/u/zarraha][u/zarraha]] put it,

#+begin_quote
  The power can't omnipotently activate by reading reality, it depends entirely on your knowledge of whether or not the conditions have been met. Further, the power cannot control reality to punish you, but punishments have to be something you can inflict on yourself.
#+end_quote

So you could make that oath, but it either wouldn't work in the first place, or you would just feel compelled to spend the rest of your life fruitlessly looking for a way to become immortal.

Additionally, none of your examples follow the given form, which was

#+begin_quote
  If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty].
#+end_quote

In other words, you actually have to make the oath with another person, not just against reality itself. Doesn't stop your plans per se, but just something to keep in mind.

Finally, for your last examples, e.g.

#+begin_quote
  I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where next week's lotto numbers are X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.
#+end_quote

That might be possible. My /assumption/ would be it follows Death Note rules, where it relies /your/ knowledge - that is, it would depend on whether you already knew if those were the next week's lotto numbers. So, if you don't know that the winning numbers are X, either you always feel compelled to stub your toe afterwards (even if next week's numbers DO end up being X), or the ritual just doesn't work in the first place. But I guess it all depends on how the system works.

Oooh! Okay, that's less exploitable than I thought, but still pretty useful!

What you mean is that making the oath "If you do [anything at all] then I agree to do [something impossible immediately] or suffer [the penalty of doing task X]": will make the God of Legalism compel me to do task X right?

So if task X was something I wanted to do anyway, but I had procrastination issues, I could make that oath to the God of Legalism, and he would mentally compel me to do task X instead of procrastinating.

It is also an awesome lie-detector. Get someone to make an impossible oath whose penalty is being forced to tell the truth in the next hour. The mental compulsion would make them tell the truth for the next hour, serving as valuable non-perjured witness testimony.

*** By the way, I suggest you look up [No Game No Life].

It's a Japanese light novel about a world that is ruled by a God of Legalism. Or to be more accurate, the God of Games. But he more or less acts like a God of Legalism, with people setting rules for a game contract-style and swearing oaths based on the outcomes of the game. E.g. you can swear an oath to pay someone $X if you lose some game Y, and the God of Games will force you to pay up. You can even bet yourself or your thought patterns and the God of Games will enforce it.

And the games you can propose are open-ended enough that you could probably make games out of business transactions. E.g., make a game about delivering your merchandise to some location within a time limit, with a penalty if you lose the game by failing to do so in time.

(The story itself isn't that good imo, with most parts being horribly irrational wish-fulfillment, but it may contain a few ideas that fit your god of legalism concept.)

I don't think you've thought this through. The solution as it stands is very simple: minimize the mental pressure applied, which reduces your expenditures. This also increases the odds of people getting the penalty, thus increasing the expected income from penalties. The practical balance is enough pressure that people expect the ritual to work (so they still do the ritual), but so much that it works extremely well, so the people are inclined towards maximizing the penalty to provide additional incentives (assuming higher penalty = more power to you).

If you have an individual choice in the pressure applied, it should be done on a case-by-case basis - those who are likely to invoke high penalties should be allowed to do so, but the pressure should otherwise be high enough that the ritual's reputation remains intact. An allegiance with the God of Probability (RNGesus) or a God of Business Analytics would be an excellent political move.
