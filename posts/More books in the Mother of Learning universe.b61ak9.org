The universe MoL is set in has become one of my all time favourite fantasy settings, up there with that of the Malazan and the Stormlight Archive books.

I'm hoping the author continues developing the world with new stories after this one's over, does anyone know if he's said anything about it?

** I've been thinking of the MoL universe as a bog-standard D&D setting (with bog-standard D&D spells, even), with a body of lore worked out to *accommodate* the complete complement of standard D&D sourcebook---and even splatbook---assets (e.g. lizard folk, animal bonds, psionics, Perfect Spell feats, an 8th-level Wizard spell called /Gate/, etc.) rather than the standard approach of working out a setting and then selecting/modifying the sourcebook assets into a form that fit that setting (as seen in /Eberron/, /Ravenloft/, etc.) The standard approach is what it is because bog-standard D&D is tuned to be a fun (if campy) setting to /play games/ in, but doesn't particularly make for a good basis for narrative works like tie-in novels. The various D&D “settings” are built so that they /do/ form a solid foundation for tie-in novels---but at the expense of some of the simulationist playability of “anything goes” base D&D.

But that's not to say it's /impossible/ to make anything-goes “splatbook soup” D&D into a coherent setting. MoL does it. It takes a lot of work, but it's possible.

Presumably, any other novel that has tried to “take the anything-goes simulationism-focused D&D setting seriously as a narrative setting” in this same manner would end up with a similar setting (other than the “time loop” part.) So:

- Do any of the official (TSR/Wizards) D&D-branded novels do this? (I haven't read any, but is my understanding that they don't, since each one comes from one of those settings that modifies “sourcebook D&D” into a more self-consistent setting.)

- Does any unofficial D&D-“inspired” (i.e. basically ripping off) novel/series do this? (I feel like this is more likely.)

Sadly, I don't think any novel/series that's just “based on someone's D&D campaign” would qualify, because those aren't really based on “taking the source material /seriously/” in a self-consistent-narrative-setting sense, but rather upon playing a fun game and then recording the fun you had. Media like /Slayers/ are based on D&D campaign after-action reports, so they look less like a self-consistent setting and more like campy pastiche---if you describe them in terms of historiography, they're a murder-hobo's gonzo-journalist subjective experience of the setting.

(And /Worth the Candle/ is essentially what you get when you try to play a game set in a world with a self-consistent setting and rules favouring narrative interest over game interest---and I kind of doubt that people tend to actually desire to play an RPG campaign that way for any length of time. Though, if [[/r/rational]] were interested, we could try...)

*** If we're being precise, /Mother of Learning/ is the standard D&D universe fused with fanon /Naruto/. The author has a previous story in that setting, and you can see some of the relics of that: shaping exercises vs. chakra control; the similarities between raw mana manipulation and raw chakra manipulation; and a few worldbuilding details that seem to be inspired by it, like bloodlines. If we're really stretching, we could draw a parallel between the primordials and the tailed beasts, but it's such a generic plot element that I'm not super confident about it. Obviously, that's not the only thing that /Mother of Learning/ inspiration from, but it's definitely a component.

******* It's generally well-known in Naruto fanfiction circles - especially back when it came out - for having an interesting premise and being the best out of a batch of Sasori-focused fanfiction. At that time Sasori was one of the more popular Akatsuki members because of the first arc of Shippuden. The officially translated Manga volumes of Shippuden dropped just three months before the first chapter of Scorpion's Disciple, so despite Sasori being the first to die, he was fresh in everyone's mind.

But if you weren't tuned into Naruto at the time, or only started reading fanfiction 2-3 years after it was abandoned, you probably wouldn't have heard of it.

********* I've read a lot of Naruto fanfics in the past two or three years (in addition to HP, Worm, etc.).

One of my favorite Naruto fanfics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]], which I highly recommend. It's an SI fic, but that really only used for perspective, and rapidly drops off after the first few chapters. There's a wide, detailed, amazingly done cast. It's before canon Naruto, and even then, it's clear that it's real life and more realistic than an anime could be. People die in it. It's the only Hurt/Comfort fic I've seen done well, and everything that happens makes a lot of sense. The plot progresses at just the right speed. It's actively updating.

It's definitely my most favorite actively updating Naruto fic, that's for sure. (Vs amazing fics like Sanitize, which has very slow updates.)

I'm the type of person whose favorite fic is MoL. But /everything/ about Hear the Silence is amazing. (I like it more than Chiaroscuro, though that's pretty good too.)

Please go read it. It's amazing.

(At some point I really need to look through all the fics I've read and get some solid recommendations I can copy and paste. I type out similar recs for Hear the Silence way too much.)

********* Everything else recommended /here?/ Because there's a lot of Naruto fanfiction out there - the subreddit for it is [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]]. But off the top of my head, I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8611318/1/Chance-for-a-Prophecy][/Chance for a Prophecy/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10857388/1/I-Am-NOT-Going-Through-Puberty-Again][/I Am NOT Going Through Puberty Again/]] for serious and comedic time-travel, although neither is rational. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][/Dreaming of Sunshine/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][/Deja vu no Jutsu/]] are the two most popular self-insert stories, and I thought both of them were pretty neat. I want to stress that I haven't read the first two in a couple of years and the second two in about four years. There are a lot more that I read, not many of them I'd consider even okay by the standards I have now.

******* That makes sense. The style is more reminiscent of very early D&D, like the basic set and 1st Edition, where there aren't a lot of powerhouse characters. You also don't see a lot of the classes that came into the game later on, like Monks and Paladins (although they do have Rangers and Bards, so it's not entirely basic set stuff).
