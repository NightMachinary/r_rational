So, we've all read a few stories that we'd probably call "rational". Luminosity, HPMOR, The 2YE, Waves Arisen, etc. Now, here's a question I pose. Most of the protagonists in rational stories are rational, but this also comes in a package deal with being really intelligent, it seems. Lots of book learning, calculations, etc. And lots of expose displaying said learning, whether in the character's thoughts or in speeches delivered to other characters (I'm looking at you HJPEV)

How viable is it to write a story featuring a rational protagonist that didn't do this? That didn't bother explaining how he figured out Plot A by using Theorem X and Fallacy Y (Not to the villain, obviously, he's much too genre savvy for that, but often, a rational protagonist will regale his companions with these long, intelligent discourses, clearly more for the reader's benefit than anything else) A protagonist that IS rational (intelligence not necessarily being a part of said character) and makes rational, logical moves, without all the gimmicky book learning that seems to accompany so many of our well known rational work protagonists.

In addition, feel free and link/comment stories where you find rational characters who aren't necessarily ranting on about physics, psychology or math!

P.S It's worth noting I LOVE most of that brainy word vomit. It's interesting and usually teaches me something I didn't know. I just realize that it seems to be a staple of rational protagonists, at least based on what I've read, and was wondering about what else there is to offer in rational fiction.


** Check the sidebar. You're asking if it's possible to have rational fiction which is not rational/ist/ fiction. Of course it is.

Worm is a great example. The characters and world are intelligent and make sense, but there's no HPMOR-style rationality anywhere.

**** *SPOILERS FOR WORM*

You know, I frequently hear Worm held up as an example of rational fiction, but it always leaves me confused. I've forgotten large swaths of the story (it was huge, and I read it a while ago), so maybe there's some important fact that I'm missing -- the fact that Worm is almost universally regarded as an exemplar of rational writing suggests I'm missing something.

Here are some of my issues with Worm as a rational story, laid out according to the points on the sidebar. Would someone please explain to me what I've missed?

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Capes fight each other instead of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CuttingLexLuthorACheck]] because they have alien worms in their heads that are a literal [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][Conflict Ball]].

The worms were put there by giant aliens who are seeking a way to stop the heat death of the universe. These aliens are looking to gain power from (comparatively) primitive alien races in order to further this goal. Their idea of the best way to do this is "put alien worms in their heads that will make them fight each other" instead of "approach them diplomatically and work with them, putting alien worms in their heads for research purposes."

Contessa's "path to victory" shard showed her how to kill one of the aliens but not the other. Here's the way I remember this sequence; please correct me if I have it wrong:

1. The alien (Eve?) crashed into Earth for reasons I don't remember and became injured
2. Because she was injured, she accidentally handed out the PTV shard without meaning to
3. She set the "don't work on me or Scion" bit on the PTV shard, but only after Contessa and Dr. Mother had used it to stab her in the neck
4. From then on the PTV shard no longer worked on Scion or anything related to him. This is suspiciously convenient for the plot. Am I forgetting something?

Scion was a hero because that's what his first human contact told him to be. Then he became a villain because Jack talked him into it.

Scion started wiping out humans in all dimensions, but when attacked by capes he toyed with them instead of just killing them.

All of the capes knew they couldn't stop Scion in a straight-up fight, but that was what they did until Taylor came along and saved the day.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

Did the original Slaughterhouse 9 have an agenda? I remember them simply being sadists and serial killers for the fun of it. I believe that Cherish and some others got dragged in against their will and remained reluctant, but what about the ones we met first?

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

No one really munchkins their power except for Taylor. Who was that Ward who could make hands come out of anything around him as long as he was touching some of the same substance? Taylor was the one who taught him to keep samples of stuff inside his costume, and to make hands come out of the hands in order to extend his reach.

Doctor Mother, Numbers Man, Contessa, think that the best way to handle the Case 53s is to wipe their memories and drop them off somewhere instead of using them in-house.

***** Well, I've never thought about it in-depth, but I feel like the shard shenanigans (PtV being blind to Scion, Conflict Balls, etc.) were implemented so that the game wasn't broken too early, and we still had a story that was somewhat recognizable as our standard caped crusaders style of fiction.

I wouldn't consider Worm to /strictly/ be rational. Like it would never win a "Most Rational(ist) Story" pageant. But it's a lot more realistic than most conventional superhero tales, while also staying true enough to the formula that Wildbow didn't have to break the bank by coming up with a totally revised world landscape (which is what would happen, if we tried to rationalize an Earth that has had superpowers for 50+ years) As it stands, Worm is recognizably Earth, with a few superhero niceties tossed in there (the CIU, Endbringer destroyed cities, Ellesburg, etc.)

In addition, I find that most of our antagonists had reasons for their actions that made sense. The S9 were about wreaking havoc and having "fun" but the end goal for Jack was that he be remembered. That he be the story parents told their kids about to make them behave. He literally derives pleasure from being evil. Even when he goaded Scion, it was fulfilling his utility function which, handily, was to do evil. Now, it was implied that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes management that Jack was doing, to keep everyone held together, so you COULD say that was contrived. I suppose.

The other gangs also fought for their own reasons. Their ideologies were widely varied and fairly deep, and I feel those particular plots were thought out well. Each gang had its own motivation, even the Merchants. And the little conflict worms probably didn't help things at all.

And, as far as Cauldron, I honestly feel like either the PtV directed them to handle Case 53s that way, or Cauldron simply didn't care to risk keeping all of their failed experiments on hand. Some of the mutations would've been a BITCH to keep under lock and key, and it was probably more trouble than it was worth to actually hold onto all of them. The security leaks possible with so many unpredictable power sets in one secret organization facility were probably through the roof. Although I'm fairly certain Cauldron held a few in-house, for a variety of reasons.

#+end_quote

Sure, I agree. I have no problem with the idea of the PTV shards being blind to the entities -- if you were going to hand them out, it makes perfect sense to make sure they can't be used against you. My problem is that we are canonically told that they weren't supposed to be given out, then they actually worked against Eve, and /then/ they stopped working. Did Eve do the switch as she went brain-dead? Did Scion do it? If so, why didn't he turn off everyone's shards when he was fighting them?

No argument from me, but they /did/ keep people locked up. The first scene where Numbers Man fights, it's because a bunch of 53s are trying to escape.

That said, The Reckoning (rational Animorphs) seems to do a good job so far of showing rational characters without book learning or strict terminology.

** I'm sure it could be made to work, but it might occasionally run into difficulty with making it clear to the audience that there was actual rationality involved rather than authorial magic ass-pull solutions - if your protagonist makes a logically possible but /genuinely difficult/ leap of logic in their deducing/planning/scheming, but doesn't say anything out loud to indicate their thought process (and it isn't the subject of an internal monologue or other exposition), then if the audience fails to follow along it just looks like they pulled the answer from nowhere.

Would also need to be careful to avoid swinging too far the other way, and making the plot problems and their solutions too simple/obvious so as to be sure that an audience who aren't having things explained to them will still follow along; then your rationalist looks more like the one halfway sensible person in a world of dunces.

I guess this brave new world of online fiction allows for the author and audience to actually talk, which could be the remedy; constant assurances that there really is a rationale behind it all. Although then your failure mode is losing the trust/interest of your readership if it starts to look like an exercise in obscurantist ego-stroking bullshit, with you expecting everyone to apply mass concentrated effort to your puzzles. Or if people just get plain frustrated with the difficulty level.

So whilst I feel like it /could/ work, I also suspect it would be walking a tight-rope between multiple possible ways that it could also potentially not work. The most promising way I can picture would be to drop the author-screed level explanations and have a more pragmatic flavour of rationality applied, so that the character can summarise their reasons more concisely without listing references or giving lengthy theory explanations. Less rational/ist/ if it stops trying to educate, but could provide enough little hooks for it to be clear that it is at least rational.
