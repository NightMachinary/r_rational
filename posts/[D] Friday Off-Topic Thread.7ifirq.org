Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** What do you guys think about [[https://blog.patreon.com/updating-patreons-fee-structure/][Patreon's recent change in fee sturcture]]?

I think it's a very shitty thing they did. They had a good system of batching pledges to reduce the impact of fees, now they decided to de-aggregate them, screwing over small pledges (each $1 pledge now costs the patron $1.38, almost 40% fee) seemingly to cater to creators who are interested not in small voluntary subscriptions for otherwise free content, but in gating content behind pay walls of more substantial pledges, basically operation a more traditional pay2play business. And they try to present it as concern for creators. I mean, technically, yes, it is concern for creators, but it appears to be only for a specific subset of creators with a specific business model.

UPD: Also an [[https://brianbalfour.com/essays/patreon-onboarding-growth][interesting article]] was unearthed during the shitstorm shining light on Patreon's priorities. How do you like this language for example:

*** I think it's terrible - about a third of my patrons give $1 and another third $2; I'm in that "saying thanks for free content" category you mentioned. /If/ pledge behaviour isn't changed by this stupid fee structure, I'll get more money, but (a) I think that's missing the point as I don't want to trick anyone, and (b) of course it will ouch people to freer larger pledges.

So I'm going to look for an alternative platform - there's nothing to stop me using two, after all.

I was currently happily supporting numerous artists/creators with $1 - $5 range support, and this new fee structure means a hefty increase in outlay from what is only a small discretionary funds budget, which would cause me to have to cease supporting many of them.

[[https://d.rip/][Kickstarter's Drip]] which is supposed to launch soon looked promising, but it looks like they want to charge each pledge individually too, so it would be the same rip off on small pledges, only passed onto creators, not patrons. We'll see what they actually do, maybe they'll implement some mitigating features, like an internall wallet you can fill periodically in large batches and pay out of that without/with smaller fees. UPD: It seems for small pledges Kikcstarter offers a much better fee of 5% + $.05, so even without any additional measures it should be an improvement over Patreon's new exorbitance.

*** That graph is sketchy. They're drawing "2.9% + $0.35" as smaller than 5%, despite the usual low amounts being pledged.

EDIT: they also switched the color scheme and labeling order, and distorted the lengths. The amounts they're showing are 80% take-home + 15% Transaction Fees + 5% Patreon Fees (vs. labels of "85-93%", "2-10%", and "5%") for the first graph, which is flat-out wrong. The second graph is 95%(91.7) take-home + 5%(4.8) Patreon fees + 3.6%(3.4) Transaction fees. Normalized percentages to add to 100 are in brackets. These lengths /are/ correct, but only for single payments of exactly $50.00. Any less, and the $0.35 becomes more significant and the portion paid in fees becomes greater.

Why not just prorate the monthly subscriptions when you sign up in the middle? For example, if you want to pledge $10/month starting on the 20th, you pay $10 immediately, then $10 * 10/31 = $3.23 on the 1st, then $10 on the first every other month. If you then sign up with a second person, you pay $X whenever, then then pay then pay $10 + $X * Y/30 on the 1st of the next month, and $10 + X each month after that.

It seems like a solution to too high transaction fees is to reduce the number of transactions. It also (mostly) solves the patron's issues with being double-charged as far as I can tell.

--------------

Thinking more about it, this seems to go against one core part of Patreon's purpose. (I haven't used Patreon, so please correct me if I'm wrong.) Before I could support 10 creators and only pay one processing fee: now I can't. Before, I could create content for an audience of 20 people and pay only one processing fee: now I can't. I'm not seeing the advantages compared to directly paying creators and cutting out the middleman.

Exactly, instead they increase the number of transactions to make it "like any other subscription service". The batching of charges to reduce fees was one of the reasons to use Patreon. Right now as they want it there's no reason not to just pay your voluntary subscriptions through PayPal directly (it seems PayPal fees will be smaller than Patreon's new ones for all charges less than $14.3). Other than the fact that Patreon is also a DRM system for perks, so if you want your perks, you better pay through Patreon.

Was walking outside to smoke, heard water, investigated. Pipe connected to the water tank had a leak, woke mom up out of a dead sleep because I thought for some reason that she would be able to help me with the situation, but because her brain was still 90% asleep she didn't just hold the pipe in place she wiggled it violently back and forth and that disconnected the corroded screw from the tank and the entire pipe was no lnonger connected to the tank and I had to have my brother hold the pipe and force it downwards to stymie the water while I begged Google for an answer and STILL just GALLONS of water ended up on the floor and every towel in the house is ruined, I couldn't find the shutoff valve outside and ended up literally calling 911 because the chaos made it impossible to think and the operator told me to just shut off the power to the water pump at the breaker box instead of trying to find the water shut off valve...

****** That makes a lot more sense than what I thought you were saying, but to be fair, the situation had my brain burnt out.

Thankfully, the water pump got shut off before we got to the state of "flooded." We piled every towel in the house around the base of the tank and wrapped towels around the pipe-to-tank connection that was no longer connected, so those absorbed a lot of the water and acted as a funnel so instead of going literally everywhere we were able to control the flow and direct it at a couple of large buckets, which ended up collecting about a gallon each. There was probably only about 5 gallons of water on the floor when we started piling towels around the base and they managed to absorb most of it, and after I removed my mother from the situation and replaced her with my brother, the water flow decreased dramatically. We've also got a concrete slab foundation and no carpeting. I think we're getting away with zero water damage, and only have to worry about the water tank itself. The screw that the pipe connects to is built into the tank, and said screw is extremely corroded. If we can't fix that connection, we're gonna have to replace the entire tank, and I've just woken up so I haven't started looking up what to do about it yet, haven't even eaten yet.

*** Yes.

Here're things that I'd do:

- Do an activity that involves human contact (formal dance, contact improv, acro yoga)
- Become emotionally intimate with friends
- Fall in love with myself
- Remember that unfulfilled needs feel bottomless, but they really aren't.

So, #1 and #2 help deal with #4. Sometimes what you're feeling is that lack of deep human contact, and all you really need is that.

And then #3 is really the important one.

An important thing to realize is that there is no closer or longer relationship than the one you have with yourself. There's a lot of ways this looks, but a good perspective is the meditative one: there's you, there's the you guiding that you, etc. Another perspective is: if "treat yo self, don't cheat yo self", who's doing the treating? So, treat yourself well. (And notice what only makes you feel doing, vs what feels good having done.)

A method that is working for me is that, having gotten some kind of fit / in shape, and having learned how to take better care of my hair (and otherwise paying more attention to grooming), I can just stare at myself in the mirror thinking "Damn, but I look good.".

As for emotional techniques... I mean, you'll hear a bunch, but meditate. Not the "clear your mind", etc etc, but the "take dedicated time to check in with your insides". If your computer is acting off, you'll check it's vitals, right? What excess programs are running that don't need to be? Is the temperature good on all the different chips? Is the hard drive well organized or fragmented? That kind of thing.

This practice also works - and you won't expect it to, and it'll start off sucking - when you're feeling things, sit with and dive into those feelings - [and for me] then start saying stuff. I had an event a month ago where I kept breaking down into short lived sobs, and then all of a sudden I said a thing and I realized that /that/ was I was upset about. Having named and realized it, I immediately started feeling better. Like River Tam, it's not the contents of the secret, but that you don't know what you know that drives you up the wall.

Finally - Tripper 101: If you don't like what's happening, start changing things. Then remember Rationality 101: Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change. In other words, pick things to change and start changing them; you do not have to and will not get anything right "the first time". Can you re-arrange where you live to be nicer to you? Can you change your activities to better match what leaves you feeling good / bad? Can you change the people in your life?

  An important thing to realize is that there is no closer or longer relationship than the one you have with yourself. There's a lot of ways this looks, but a good perspective is the meditative one: there's you, there's the you guiding that you, etc. Another perspective is: if "treat yo self, don't cheat yo self", who's doing the treating? So, treat yourself well. (And notice what only makes you feel doing, vs what feels good having done.)
#+end_quote

I realize that you may have a different perspective than I have, and that taking care of yourself is important and healthy.

But /*fuck that noise*/. My problem isn't that I don't understand myself, my problem is that I'm lacking a soulmate. I'm gonna keep looking for one, and I'm going to keep feeling a crushing emptiness in my heart until then. The day I start ignoring / rationalizing that pain away is the day I lower my standards, and the day I lower my standards is the day I die.

Dude. Been there. /I am talking directly from this experience/. I have been where you are /so many times/. I know that what I need is a relationship (and, now that I'm dating someone, and can /feel/ the effect that's having, it's just really confirming it). These things are related in that self-care makes you more attractive and they are unrelated in that self-care is required to maintain a successful relationship.

Think over the people you've met that you've wanted to be with. Do you think they're taking care of themselves? Do they seem like they genuinely like and value being the person that they are?

Have you maybe noticed that most of those people are /already in loving relationships/?

This isn't a lowering of standards, it's a system hack.

Wait... do you meet /your own/ standards?

Let's try something. Outside of sexuality, what are, say, three of the needs that a soul-mate would meet for you?

*** Yeah, I'm going through one of those weeks.

The thing is, my standards are pretty specific, so I do expect finding a long-term romantic partner to be ridiculously hard. Like, of all the people I've met (in person), the number of guys I felt an emotional / intellectual kinship with can be counted on two hands at most. The number of girls is... basically zero, that I remember.

**** Man, reading all this stuff depresses me / makes me feel guilty in a really hard to describe manner...

Like, when I was 15-17, I remember /all I wanted in the world/ was a boyfriend. I was bitter that other people had boyfriends and I didn't. I would get mad at people kissing in the street because they were rubbing it in my face. Etc.

Then when I was 18 I went to university, met people, dated a guy there for a year, was single for 8 months, then met my now-husband at the ripe old age of 19. We were the first in our friend group to get married. And we're also poly so as well as my husband I have a boyfriend who I have been with 5 years now.

And I /want/ to comment on these threads and go, "it gets better guys", but then I remember I'm a straight woman who is in the nerd/rationalist/etc sphere, so I'm in a pretty good position, supply and demand wise (and 15 year old me comforted herself with promises that at university she'd be popular and have tons of opportunities for boys).

Then I start thinking of the systemic problems in society, in the rationalist community, etc and the reasons why there aren't more women here.

Anyway - I don't know what I want to say, or why I'm writing this comment. I /want/ to say "I felt that way too but it worked out for me", I also /want/ to say that my boyfriend was 34 years old and never been on a date, been kissed, etc when I met him and he was also in the early stages of recovering from really debilitating OCD, and now he's got me and aren't I wonderful - but then I'm like, are there dozens of people like him who never had someone like me find them on OKCupid?

But if people had told me that when I was 15, young-me would have cried out that that's all well and good but I'm a teenage girl and I want a boyfriend so I feel loved and wanted and /who cares if it will get better i am lonely now/??

So, I guess, at anyone in this thread who is reading this: you are right to be sad and wish you had love and affection. Try and find things that make you happy or fulfilled in general, without a focus on romance. Meet people. Be kind. Treat women with respect, not as an adversary. Accept that culture treats men and women differently, and just because women haven't drunk from the cup at the altar of Yudkowsky that they aren't intelligent rational people who can't some day be just as keen on signing up for cryonics as you are.

I guess that's kind of something to consider - me and my husband have grown up so much together, and changed a lot in that time, but maybe a lot of that was because of how young we were when we met.

(Oh, and when I met my husband, I was like "oh, he's an interesting guy and he lives a five minute drive away. Exams have just finished and we're having our long summer break.I don't think it'll be a long term thing but it'll be fun to have a summer romance" - so you know...).

Yup. Makes for [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/327849.html][pretty ugly dynamics]] too.

Honestly, I don't really see what you're describing. Like, I appreciate what you're doing, and I do realize I don't need to be limited to the rationalist community (I mean, I'm French, so that'd be a pretty bad strategy)... but this is a definite problem that I have, and I think you're aware the solutions that applied to you won't apply to me.

I'm not going to solve this merely by meeting people, being kind, and looking less hard for romance. None of the girls I've dated felt like people I would grow to love if I spent enough time with them. I don't know what I'm going to do about this... but eh, I'm awesome. I'll figure something out.

****** I don't know. I see the other side - I know people IRL who are in the general rationalist sphere and are just... not appealing partners. And I don't mean /for me/, I mean /in general/. And it's not because of anything intrinsic to rationalism; it's because of the stupid stereotypes about autistic neckbeards are based on /something/.

Some of it is stuff that is "entry level" - poor personal hygiene, lack of life skills (i.e. cooking / cleaning / small talk) - and a lot of that I'd imagine the average guy already knows and does. But at the same time I'd imagine that many people think they're OK but they're really not.

I keep on going back to this one guy I know - and he's the archetypical neckbeard stereotype and turned up to like 12. I tried to give him help with his OKCupid profile ("can it be shorter than 10,000 words and not list every mental illness you are diagnosed with?" - "but any woman who loves me needs to love ME for ME!"), grooming ("I just will let my hair and beard grow out then shave them when they're too long. Rinse and repeat once a year. It's EASY")... And none of that would be a problem if he wasn't like "I want nothing more than to be loved but no women want me they're all shallow" and I'm like ARGH you won't do BASIC ENTRY LEVEL stuff to make yourself more appealing to potential partners, what do you expect???

And yeah, that probably colours the way I interpret a lot of other people in the "I want dates but can't get them" lens. I also wonder how much people do the actual pursuing, etc.

Another thing I wonder is whether people are going for people "in their league" - while personality gets you a lot of places, if you're a 2 you're vanishingly unlikely to get with a 9. I once dated a guy who was a 3 and he had always been crushing on 8s or 9s with no success. He has now been living with a fellow 3 for the past 5 years and they have a beautiful cat together. And I wonder if my neckbeard friend, who is a 1, is going after 5s? He had a girlfriend for a while and she was a 2 and that seemed to go well.

Knew another perennially single guy who was depressed about it. I have ended that friendship because of his attitude towards women that came to a head when he got a girlfriend for ~1 month. Just didn't seem to care about her as a person, only interested in whether he could have sex with her. This was a guy I considered my best friend for some 5 years. In retrospect he had a lot of problems - like, he'd groped me once or twice and I really should have just ended the friendship there because that's a much bigger deal. But so we women are socialised.... Ugh.

I'm sure none of this helps at all. But hey, it's how I see the "nerd dating society" in my little millieu.

(And I'm not exactly in the bay area FWIW - I'm in a small city in Australia with no formal rationalist community)

Yeah. I do remember one summer camp, where I kept going after a 7 colleague, and ignoring a 1 colleague that went after me. I mean, I don't think we'd have connected that well emotionally... but I'd have connected even less with the girl I was going for. It was also kind of cruel of me.

Made me wonder for a long time how shallow I am. Still wish I had given her a chance.

But anyway. I don't know how appealing I am personality-wise. But in recent years, I've started to get dates.

And I'm starting to realize I always end up going for problem girls. Girls who have problems with their family, or who are lonely, or who had a bad past relationship... and I don't know if I keep going for them because I'm more appealing to them, or I (sub)consciously think "I have a comparative advantage here!" or because they're easier to get and I'm not attractive to anyone else, or I'm just attracted by a project. (well, obviously it's all 4, but I'm wondering which is most important)

So... I dunno. I can, with a lot of effort and people-wrangling, get a date, and maaaaybe sometimes get some sex (without going into details, not very frequent), but that's not something I want long term. I read a post a few days ago by a girl on [[/r/relationship][r/relationship]] who complained about how her boyfriend was unreasonable and asked how she could better communicate with him. I asked for an example conversation, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gt9jf/i_need_tips_on_how_to_communicate_better/dqlnx2u/][she copy-pasted one]], and... the thing is, in that conversation she did everything mostly right. The guy was just unreasonable; she could have handled him better, but it would always have been a chore.

So I feel like my situation is a bit like that girl's (but less extreme). I can find girls, and get an emotional connection with them, but it's kind of fake and it only lasts as long as I pour effort into it.

And that aside... I've met people with the rationalist spark. I didn't know they even existed before I read HP:MoR, but now I've met them, both online and IRL. I know they exist, I know how to recognize them, and I know there's a world of difference between them and... these... disgusting normal humans. Like, seriously, once you have seen the difference between someone with the spark and someone without it, you just can't be satisfied with someone who doesn't have it. It just jumps in your face.

We are all shallow people if it helps. But it's a good bias to be aware of when it can impact you and try and not let it get you too much. I was really hesitant about dating my partner because I was 24 and he was 34 and I was really freaked out by the age gap but we hit it off immediately and 5 years later it's a good relationship.

I can see why you might feel that but that's not my experience, maybe it's just some generalised misanthropy but I am always finding myself getting more and more understanding of people who are different and whatnot.

What really helps me is remembering that everyone is an expert on something.

Kind of an example: one of my favourite conversation techniques when I'm at a party is when someone tells me what their job is and my first thought is "wow, a scent-tester at a perfume factory? that job sounds really easy", I go against that instinct and go "wow! That sounds like it must be really hard." - and people always love talking about how hard their job is and you get to hear about how the perfume scent-tester doesn't just smell things all day but she has to categorise them on 17 different axes and test them against exemplar scents and you get a whole new appreciation for that person and that role in society.

Another example: back in the day when I was a young engineer I was supervising bridge maintenance. Seeing the tradies operate heavy equipment or even just a chainsaw with practised skill and finesse was awe-inspiring to watch. I remember having the same feeling when I was watching someone shape pretzels on an assembly line. I think everyone has something they're good at and practised at?? I don't know.

Anyway that's all come across really touchy-feely kumbayah hasn't it?

Again not sure if any of this helps but I think we're stream of consciousing at each other today so...

#+begin_quote
  OKCupid Profile Link
#+end_quote

I just realised you didn't actually ask me for a critique but I wrote one anyway..... Sorry if it was not wanted, but it's below if it is:

First thing that jumps out at me: you say you speak some English. I would never message someone who didn't speak English fluently unless I shared or wanted to learn their main language (et je parle le français assez bien et je veux l'améliorer, donc pour moi, c'est pas un vrai problème: mais pour les autres filles qui ne parlent pas le français....). So put English as one of your main languages, especially because your profile is /in/ English (depending on the number of French people living where you are I'd probably put a sentence in French in each section, but if there are vanishingly few I probably wouldn't bother).

In general your profile doesn't seem... interesting? Like, if I went on a date with you, I don't know what we'd do. The standard geek standby of playing board games doesn't even come to mind as you don't list favourites. That said, I've not been actively dating for the past 5 years or so, but your profile makes you seem bland when from reading your comments on here you're exactly the sort of person I'd be interested in going on a first date with.

And this sentence confuses me: "I'm really interested in perspectives from people who identify as neuroatypical." - I'm not in that demo so maybe I'm missing some important context, but you don't really specify what sort of perspectives you want (like, I'm getting the feeling that you... want to date neuroatypical peopple? You want to interview them as part of a research project? you want to.... tell them that identifying as neuroatypical is stupid and they are dumb??? any of those). It's just.... weird and not in a good way.

You definitely need much better photos, (how to say this without coming across as a creepy old lady?) - I can tell from looking at the photos that you would probably be my type, looks-wise, but your photos don't make you look appealing? Apparently photos are the most important thing in a profile (sad but true) so that's something you should really focus on improving. OKCupid has a bunch of articles on what works well in profile pics that you might want to check out.

I feel like people who need level 1 advice don't take it (c.f. my friend who won't shave regularly or at least invest in a beard trimmer). So they keep hearing it and keep not taking it and nobody wins I guess.

Like, "how do I get a girlfriend?" - "work on yourself to be desireable then do activities where you might meet someone who will find you desireable" - "yeah I already know that where's your level 2 advice" - "oh okay here's my ONE WEIRD TRICK for getting a girlfriend"...

Yeah, writing (basically) "I want to date mentally ill people" does not come across that way at all.

Okay, yes, that makes sense. It's a trust thing, I guess: either the person who receives the advice has to trust the other that the obvious advice they're giving does apply despite how obvious it is, or the person who gives the advice has to trust that the other is already aware of the entry-level stuff and it won't help.

And, I kind of think I'm in the second category? Like, I think I'm basically pareto optimal on a certain level: I can get more skilled, I can get better at presenting myself (obviously), and there are social dynamics I'm trying to figure out; but, as far as the basic "shave yourself", "realize that everyone's a little shallow", "remember that people are flawed but have hidden depth" things go... I think I'm doing okay, or even better than average?

I mean, it's not about giving advice that's new or original; advice doesn't get stale, it's just... I feel like I'm doing as well as I'm ever going to (or close) in most obvious categories. I'm not saying you shouldn't give that advice on general principles, mind you, I appreciate it, and the okcupid stuff /is/ helpful.

I realize that I may have come across like I'm desperate for some magic solution, but I'm not. At worst, I'm bitter that the situation I'm in sucks, but I do intend to solve it through non-insane self-improvement.

** I've been meaning to recommend this book for a while, but never got around to writing the post. The book is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control][Version Control by Dexter Palmer]].

It's, hands down, one of the best books I've ever read. It's a sci-fi magical realism deconstruction/"parody/pastiche". I don't think it quite qualifies as "rational" since it has an element of "magical realism," and I'm not even sure that it's /internally/ consistent. But it definitely /deconstructs/ the genre of magical realism by giving it a sci-fi veneer. Part of the great thing about the sci-fi part is that except for the causality violation device, all the technology is a reasonable extrapolation of what's available today. It's a future that, barring the "time-travel," could really happen. It's a vision of multiple dystopias within one book, and a look at how our choices change depending on the circumstances. I really cannot even put down succinctly in words how good the book is, it's one of those works that, like impressionist art, must be experienced first-hand.

It can be a heavy read. It is, IMO, "Literature" although I haven't read much to compare. But there's just /so much/ you can get out of the book that I'm amazed the author fit it all into one novel. And that is definitely something I look for in a book: that it is well-structured and well-written. Both are the case here.

I've seen on here someone mentioned what they call "perfect" works; this is as close to that as I've ever seen. (Although how I would describe it is it's at a "local optimum": there can be "better" works in an absolute sense, but for what it is, it is incredibly good.)

Highly recommend you read it if it sounds at all appealing. It's probably particularly relevant if you're part of the 20-35 age group.

It may be the case that restriction of information is the way forward. I hope not though. The Internet is a valuable thing, and I really hope lack of net neutrality doesn't catch on. I hope that, as Kasparov also says, the problem can be solved by political will and perhaps compromise. Unfortunately, what we actually have is Donald Trump. It's enough to make a person depressed.

If you want to skip the intro (which is irrelevant and boring IMO) then the actual interview starts at 13:30.

I watched a video that's relevant to this discussion as well: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][CGP Grey's Rules for Rulers]]. It shows how despotic leaders are beholden to their support base and are inherently unstable; the incentives for them are to do nearly anything to hold onto their power because if they don't, they get killed or imprisoned by the next regime. It's a tough situation to resolve, especially since Russia is a fairly powerful country and its actions have consequences for the entire world.

Kasparov seems to have good, realistic advice about how to deal with the situation, from a Russian's perspective who sees the world from both the Russian and external points of view. Highly recommended listening. Thank you for posting.

** I've recently gotten my first “job” as an unpaid bank intern.

And while even doing that much did wonders in regards to solving some of the problems I've been fruitlessly struggling with for years, there's still that one thing that I just don't see any ways of overcoming, dealing with.

My comprehension skills suck, I think. Looking back now, I had this problem standing on my way as far back as during my later school years. I have trouble with understanding and digesting new information, with converting it into knowledge that would be available to me on my “fast-thinking” lane. When I have to understand and learn new information, either the progress is happening way too slowly (for instance nowadays it can be as bad as barely managing to go through just several pages of material per day), or my mind just blanks out when I'm trying to read the text (for instance, sometimes I can't even force myself to comprehend what's being said in relatively simpler paragraphs, and this state of stupidly staring at the page in front of me can last for several hours straight).

And now I have to yet again face the same damn thing that has been poisoning my life experience during both my school and university years. I just don't see how I'll be able to learn all the laws and internal protocols that are expected for the employees to learn with a ”handicap” like this.

Maybe my brain (or me myself) is just being lazy, maybe I'm doing something wrong (with food, with my daily routine, etc), I don't know. I just want to be able to absorb the damn infodumps the way other people are seemingly able to do /while/ they're also managing to maintain at least some kind of a private life and not go to sleep at 21:00-22:00 to keep being functional the next day.

I've tried using the pomodoro technique, but because of the slow progress speeds mentioned earlier one interval can only manage to cover several paragraphs, making me lose the train of thought. And the constant inability to understand what's laid down in front of me and the constant feeling of being stupid are making me almost physically sick of reading educational materials altogether, to the point that I can barely force myself to get back to reading them the next time.

What can I do to improve my situation? At least problems like having poor social skills, etc are of such a nature that you can at least grasp in what ways they can possibly be solved.

With this, I'm just out of ideas. I just feel stupid and like if I'll not be able to find at least /some/ kind of a solution to this, this will be blocking my perspectives for the remainder of my life.

Any advice?

*** That sounds like a really rough situation. I'm not an expert on these things. However, if you have easy and relatively affordable access to healthcare professionals (via insurance or if you are in a country with socialized medicine) I think that a doctor would be able to help you a lot. I've heard that symptoms like these can be related to nutritional issues, sleep issues, various diseases, or ADD, all of which can be treated worked around better once you know what they are.

One of my friends who had similar symptoms went to a doctor and found out he had a sleep disorder where he would wake up several times during the night without realizing it, causing him to always be fatigued and therefore not on his mental A-game. After he got treatment (which turned out to mostly involve changing his sleeping conditions) things changed a lot for him.

You may just not be someone who learns effectively visually/auditorially; given that there are people who simply don't have a visual imagination (something so foreign to me that I can't imagine how they can function) there is probably some weirdness to your specific experience that we can pin down.

I've often felt incredibly stupid as well, in the sense of making a ton of mistakes even at a seemingly easy job. In my case the cause was that I just wasn't invested or concentrating on (and didn't even have the ability to concentrate on) what I was doing. This was because I apparently had a mental illness, and whether that was the cause or the lack of concentration was a side-effect of medication is a question I just don't know the answer to. But I can understand how you feel.

The graduate students at my university are starting to the process, working on collecting cards in order to get to a vote. Talking with my parents (they are both Republicans and thus automatically against Unions), there arguments against seem to be that we should be grateful for getting a scholarship and that we aren't owed anything more? And that participating in the unionizing could potentially endanger my own scholarship (I am pretty sure that would be retaliation and be very clearly illegal if the university actually did retaliate in anyway like that), or at the very least distract me from my own work (possible, but if anything I would just ignore the process and put in the bare minimum effort of voting). They are also ideologically opposed to the fact that if the graduate students worked with the United Auto Workers (UAW) for resources/support some portion of our dues would go to support them. In terms of pros... for me personally, I am happy with my advisor, my advisor is committed to making sure my work helps me complete a thesis in a timely manner, I work very flexible hours, so those aren't a big issue for me... occasionally I hear of other graduate students who have issues along those lines which I imagine might benefit from the collective bargaining of a union.

Organizing at the level of program is simply too small for the overall university administration to have to care, and it is the administration we would need to affect to change some of the larger overall policies.

  Why should the Biology students take action when the Physics students have a dispute?

  so there's no fear of replacement workers coming in.
#+end_quote

I think there is actually just enough overlap to make it relevant in the case of TAs. A math student and a physics student might be able to effectively TA in the place of each other for many undergraduate level courses, for instance. A psychology student and a neuroscience student might both be able to TA for a cognitive psychology class. You are right that the issues that affect sufficiently disparate programs might be pretty different... a literature RA and a biology RA might have totally different types of work and working conditions/issues. However the overall idea, as with all unions, is to make a collective bargaining units, so for instance the Biology students know they have enough solidarity that administration can't just decide to punish them by cutting all of their TA position and replacing them with a mix of TAs from related programs.

In the case of RAs, the idea of striking in the first place is almost absurd... their work to graduate and get published often heavily if not completely overlaps with their work as an RA. So striking delays their own publications and graduation. In the event their professor has mismanaged their work heavily, it is possible that their may be some disconnect between their thesis work and their work as an RA, but this is an unusual case in my experience.

*** I'm not entirely sure what the point of university students unionising is. I mean, I get the point of /unions/ in general - it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.

But - perhaps I'm just being dense here - I don't quite see the point of university students going on strike. The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa - and if a student really wants to object to a university being completely beyond the pale, he need merely withdraw from his classes to deny the university his money.

I think you are unaware of the basic setup that most PhD programs have...

#+begin_quote
  The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa
#+end_quote

It is the opposite for graduate students. Graduate Students work as Research Assistants and Teaching Assistants are given a tuition waver/scholarship as well a stipend. In my PhD program, we typically only take classes in our first 2-3 years (while working 10-20 hours a week for our professor our first year when we take the most classes, 20-40 hours once we've gotten through the first year), and the remaining 2-3 years are entirely devoted to finishing our thesis and working as an RA or TA (work on our thesis and work as an RA tend to blend together somewhat, a 40 hour work week at minimum is typical).

#+begin_quote
  it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.
#+end_quote

The arrangement I described can create [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive][perverse incentives]] in some cases. The professor that we work for as an RA, that is providing funding, is almost always also our thesis advisor/mentor. So letting the thesis drag out nets the Professor a RA for a much longer period of time, which only effectively costs the stipend cost, which is cheaper than hiring a Post-Doc/Assistant Professor/Technician. In some labs there is a lot of highly skilled work to be done. The student has no recourse, they are entirely dependent on that professor in order to complete their research and graduate. For me personally, this is not an issue, and I think in my entire program I've only heard of one or two professors where things even started to approach this worst case, but still, there are few protections for student in the the times where it does come up.

In terms of stipend... it tends to be pretty small, especially if you consider the opportunity cost the graduate student takes by entering a PhD program instead of going into a Master program and then getting a well paid job. In so much as a PhD student is worth a someone with a Master's degree, not counting the value of the tuition waver and mentorship from a professor, we are getting vastly underpaid. Of course the education is valuable and the mentorship is priceless, but those aren't things we can live off of... (see the complaints about the GOP tax plan on scholarships for another case where this has come up)

First of all, I feel more than just a little silly. I /really/ should have been able to figure this out (especially since it's not just /student/ but /graduate/ student).

Second of all, I can now certainly see the benefit of graduate student unions.

** Any My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Fans here?

I ask because I have a persistent plot bunny that I'm thinking of utilizing for a story; most likely a one-two shot as opposed to a full length story.

All Might is transported to the Wormverse and is brought back to peak condition by Panacea. He tries to become the Symbol of Peace in a superhero world that's definitely not as simplistic as his own, and he does his best to come to terms with the Grey on Grey setting as much as possible.

Tbh, the above would just be flavouring because I then plan to have him fight an Endbringer. /And win./

Wouldn't necessarily be a rational story but could be some fun.

P.S Based on the feats we've seen in both Worm and My Hero Academia, I'm fairly certain he doesn't have the capacity to beat an Endbringer. But I would write him to be that way, for the sake of being able to conceptualize All Might using Detroit Smash on a fucking kaiju!

Well, yeah. Saitama's whole power concept is basically 'I have enough force / ability to defy physics to win, under any circumstances'. If you take that as his power definition then...yeah, Saitama wins. And I'm fine with that.

All Might's power set is basically that he's, in the MHA universe, fantastically strong and fast. But we're not talking 'shatter dimensions/levels of physical reality through punching' levels of strength here, which is what canonically would be required to actually damage an endbringer core.

Now, about three years later, WeaselCorp is actually getting around to officially hiring a replacement Boss Weasel, and MagicWeasel has applied for the job. Both she and the interviewers are perfectly aware that she's been doing the job for the past few years, and therefore she is capable, which gives her a distinct interviewing advantage, but there are reasons why she might still fail the interview (such as a New Weasel applying for the job who has a massive long list of relevant degrees and experience and/or an Uncle Weasel in Top Management). Nonetheless, fair employment laws prevent anyone from being appointed on a permanent basis without going through an interview, so therefore MagicWeasel must be interviewed.

All subject to correction from the Weasel herself, of course, but that's what I'd expect to be the case.

I need job B because job A will pay $X forever, but next year in job B I'll go from earning $X+$15 to $X+$100 per week, and the year after that another $100pw, for a few more years. And job B is a more prestigious job on paper so it will help me apply for job C down the road...

If I fail the application I keep doing job A, someone else is brought on to do job B, and I have to hope another job B opens up (there's a limited number of job B's: this job B is open because a colleague is leaving).

Okay. First thing you need to know about neural networks - you need to have a couple of hundred matched input/output sets, that is, data that you know that /this/ input requires /that/ output. Trying to use a neural network to generate /random/ modifications is not going to work well.

On the other hand, if you really want to evaluate random modifications, you might have better luck looking into genetic algorithms. There, you just need some sort of fitness measure for your output (where a more fit output scores a higher number) - which can probably be modelled as how close your code results come to some ideal result.

****** Nah, NN all the way. This is part of a multi-stage plan; this part is about figuring out how to make unsupervised, exploratory systems.

What does it take to make something that, when given a black box, can explore the possible input/outputs of that black box?

Given that I'm still new to NN, but from what I know, reinforcement learning does not require training sets, but something akin to the fitness function of a genetic algo. Perhaps even exactly the same thing.

******* You could probably train a neural network using a fitness function with a bit of twiddling, yes. But what the genetic algorithm does during training is precisely exploring the possible inputs and outputs of a black box with an aim of maximising the fitness function.

If you're going to insist on using a NN, though, there are a few immediate questions you need to answer.

- Will the system require internal memory and a series of outputs over time, or can a given set of outputs be found only from the inputs?
- What are the inputs to the network (a series of real numbers representing noisy data)?
- What outputs should the network provide (a series of real numbers generally constrained to be between zero and one)?

******** V0.1 is likely to be N random numbers as inputs, with M integer outputs, either mapped, limited, or trained to be ASCII codes for characters used in programming. V0.1 will be single input/output.

I still have a lot of reading to do!

********* Directly linking M outputs to ASCII characters is going to give you garbage.

Look at the outputs as probability distributions. If you want to build a neural network to recognise pictures of birds, you would have one output, representing the probability that the image described by the inputs is a bird. If you want a neural network to predict which is the best of four pieces to move in a game of ludo, you would have an output for each piece, with each output representing the probability that a given piece is the best choice to move next.

When you think in terms of each output being a guess at a probability, it should be easy to see how a neural network that's only 50% certain is going to end up mapping to garbage ASCII characters. You need to find some way to describe your neural network's output as a series of M probability estimates (instead of M arbitrary real numbers).

********** Hm. Alright, I think I can figure out something like that. I know it's doable since it's a variation on word sequence-to-sequence (particularly languages like Ruby).

AFAIK, the goal of the architecture would be to allow layers to figure out the possible symbols, just like the CV nets figure out features/edges/etc. But, I'm also talking about of ignorance.

*********** Okay, I have just gone and briefly looked up Sequence-To-Sequence. I'll point out that it used neural networks to generate an arbitrary-length sequence of words from an arbitrary-length sequence, and therefore is probably /exactly/ what you are looking for.

Next question, then. What are your inputs going to be?

************ Right! So, do you mean for training, or do you mean for forward prop? Because I'm actually thinking of M random numbers, where M is a) a hyperparameter I manually(*) tune and b) not one.

B is the complicated one, since the idea is that this becomes a component in a larger system: this component learns to generate working code, then the larger system learns to make this component produce complex / interesting sound; then that in turn becomes part of a larger system to generate sound given a style. I figure that that cannot be done if you're just mapping the real numbers to code, you need to have something more complex. Could be totally wrong tho.

- Meh. I'm an engineer. I'll find a way to automate. (That's likely where I'd want to use genetic algo's, cuz biomimicry).

************* I meant for forward propagation. Because, neural networks with no inputs always produce the exact same outputs - so if you have no inputs, your network is only going to end up producing a single output. I have no idea what you should be using for that input, just that there should be one or more of them. Your input(s) can certainly be a request for a certain style.

Using some random hyperparameter might work, I guess... or, at least, it is theoretically capable of giving more than a single program in output. But this problem still seems to me like something that would be /significantly/ better suited to genetic algorithms.

** I recently backed the [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneshotpodcast/a-woman-with-hollow-eyes/rewards][Kickstarter for the RPG Actual Play campaign A Woman With Hollow Eyes]] and there's still 3 days for you to as well. It's been fully funded, stars professional improvisers from the One Shot and Campaign podcasts, and features a new RPG called Invisible Sun that combines the best parts of Welcome to Night Vale and The Matrix.

I was super hesitant about this because I knew so little about the project and game system going in, and was convinced such an idea was way too good to be true and would end up just being weird and pretentious, but then I listened to [[https://youtu.be/II8MpLIEh20][their world/character building session]] and [[https://overcast.fm/+BIYnVjCrU][the character vignettes from their first roleplaying session]] and was blown away.

This is the greatest piece of emergent storytelling I've ever seen. The atmosphere is fantastic, the characters feel all too human, the world is surprisingly rational despise the surrealism, and the fact that it's *all improvised* is an astonishing achievement. This is something more people should know about both for its uniqueness and excellence. There are scripted audio dramas I've loved that weren't as good as this.

All the play sessions will be streamed on Twitch, where they will allow viewers to interact with the game, and then released to everyone through One Shot's podcast feed and YouTube channel. Backing the Kickstarter just gives them more money for the production and gives you the opportunity to participate in the project. If you have even a vague interest in anything I've said, this is worth checking out.
