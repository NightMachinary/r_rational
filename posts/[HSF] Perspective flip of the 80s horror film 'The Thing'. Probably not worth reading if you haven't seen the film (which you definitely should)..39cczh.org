** I enjoyed this a lot. When the alien discussed the tragedy of the almost immutable, aging, death-marked bodies we inhabit, I found myself sympathising with it, and with us.

Eventually, I hope that advancing science and technology will allow for indefinite life extension. I hope that it will allow for greater bio customizability. I hope that it will allow for greater self-awareness.

If Watts' thing had come to earth only a hundred years later, perhaps it would have found a much more familar world.

*** Have you read Peter F. Hamilton's /Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained/? It has a similar alien I also enjoyed reading about. Takes a bit longer to get to it though :P

** Peter Watts is proficient at making the alien seem familiar and the familiar seem absolutely repulsive.
