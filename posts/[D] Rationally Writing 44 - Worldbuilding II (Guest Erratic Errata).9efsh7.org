** the conversation about anime reconstructions reminds me of how I got into anime, which was through /Madoka Magica/, a deconstruction of magical girl anime. It was my gateway drug into anime and I've been trying to find something as good ever since which has caused me to go through a lot of trash (EDIT: I see that you end up mentioning this one later :) )

*** MM is fantastic subversion. If you haven't already checked out Psycho-Pass or Fate: Zero, I'd recommend them: they're not the same genre, but they're by the same writer, and are both fantastic :) So is Thunderbolt Fantasy, though some people are turned off by the fact that it's not /technically/ an anime...

Hunter x Hunter is also pretty fantastic if you like anime that subverts genre expectations, but it has a pretty slow start. It's a basic shonen anime for like 20ish episodes before it started to really show what made it special, for me.

*** Psycho Pass, Fate:Zero, Serial Experiments Lain, Log Horizon are some classics that could pique your interest.

I'm still set in someday building a Sankarea rational fic about conquering death.

*** Have you watched Evangelion? I think that the reception to Madoka is pretty similar to Eva, in the sense that Madoka was a reaction to magical girl shows that nonetheless managed to appeal to a lot of people who don't have a deep and intimate familiarity with the magical girl genre, in much the same way that Evangelion was a reaction to the super robot shows of the 80's that still seems to resonate a lot with audiences that aren't really familiar with the super robot genre.

Evangelion and Madoka have a lot of thematic similarities, both playing with the idea of taking the underlying genre premise of "hey kids, wouldn't it be cool if you had powers that allowed you to fight monsters and be a hero who saves the day" and flipping it on its head to arrive with the conclusion that "actually, battling monsters can be a really traumatizing experience, and emotionally volatile teenagers are ill-equipped to deal with the stresses of being a soldier; being a hero actually really sucks."

**** I wouldn't really say that evangelion is like Madoka. Even leaving aside quality (Eva isn't bad, but not nearly on the same level), Gen Urobuchi wasn't lying when he said he was writing a story with a happy ending; a combination deconstruction / reconstruction like Madoka is just fundamentally different from a dark deconstruction like evangelion.

** Hey everyone, sorry it's been so long between episodes going up, last couple months were pretty nuts. Guest writer Erratic Errata joins us this time to discuss more aspects of world building, particularly in his serial [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]], which I'm assuming most of you are reading, but if you're not... seriously, get on that.

** Just a note, the music during the intro was so loud I could barely hear EE introducing himself until it faded.
