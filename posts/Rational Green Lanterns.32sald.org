Ok. This is a big project, so I feel it's best to break it down into parts. I kind of felt like working through this idea in the aftermath of talking with AlexanderWales about potential continuations to "The Metropolitan Man". But I'm not sure I can do it alone. So I thought I'd start a thread for it. Please keep discussion productive, so if you're planning to say that rational GL is impossible at least give a few of your reasons for believing so.

Part 1: How does the ring work? What can it do?

In comics, the lanterns run on the collective willpower of every living being in the universe. Rationally all that power has to come from somewhere. In comics, the rings can generate hardlight constructs, project harmful radiation, and even have built-in FTL capability. Rationally you can probably only fit so much tech around one finger.

I think the hardlight constructs are the important bit. You can give the lanterns ships for interstellar travel. The ships can also run on huge batteries that the smaller chargers get power from. That means they won't have to go back to Oa to recharge quite as much. In addition, you can probably limit the size of the constructs by saying that more volume requires significantly more power. This is ignoring the obvious issues that hardlight in general brings forth...

Part 2: What does a society with that kind of tech look like?

Oa is a world that has the capacity to create whatever its inhabitants can imagine. Rational Oa isn't quite so intense, but still highly capable. Are the buildings made of energy? Probably not, due to power constraints. But the planet might have a lot of factories, to replace broken rings and spaceships for their galactic police squad. Which brings us to...

Part 3: The Corps

What exactly do they do? When do they intervene and when do they let it be? How are they organized and how do they recruit new members? I personally see the only way earth wouldn't have met them yet to be that they avoid interfering unless two or more planets are involved, or an extinction event is imminent. The exception being that lanterns are permitted to watch over their homeworlds to a certain extent. Basically, a Prime Directive, except more functional and practical.

Part 4: Red, Blue, Sapphire, Sinestro

How do the other colors of energy differ? The societies seem simple enough once you've worked out the kinks in the GL Corps. But the rings themselves are an issue. Do they just generate a different color to distinguish between their factions? Could a Red Lantern then tinker with their ring to turn it green and get behind enemy lines? Or do they actually use distinct forms of hardlight that have different limitations and advantages? Maybe some don't use hardlight at all, but instead project radiation like the GLs can no longer do. And do we even want to mention the Black and White variations or are they just too much to ask for?

Part 5: Krypton and Thanagar

Now that we've got a larger galaxy of life, what do the other intelligent civilizations think of Oa's enforced authority? You'd think a few of them wouldn't want to have to submit to GL laws. Maybe a few of them even ally themselves with the Reds or the Blues instead. Then there's the issue of how to handle Mars. The easy solution there is to just say that they're not actual martians, and that Manhunter just never bothered to correct anyone until the name had already stuck.


** Firstly, see [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]], a self-insert fic involving an orange lantern. Mostly rational; the main character is particularly rational, and gets a lot of stuff done as a result, but the rest of the universe is basically the canon DC-verse.

Secondly, I'd be inclined to suggest assuming that as many of the comic's conceits are in fact true as is possible. For instance, the emotional spectrum; sure, it's /weird/, but it's also a core part of the existence of lanterns, so if you get rid of it, you're not really telling a Rationalist Green Lantern story, you're telling a story about Sufficiently Advanced Aliens from Oa. This is the DC-verse, it includes beings like Kryptonians, the laws of physics are different. Assume the emotional spectrum is some kind of psionic energy, and that that's actually a valid way to generate Real Ultimate Power, and move forward from that, instead of trying to handwave it away.

*** I strongly agree with both the recommendation and the prescription to not abandon emotional energy. Rationalism and the scientific method can flourish in any universe where there is causality and repeatability - and exploring the DC comics universe from a scientific min-maxxer perspective is perfectly valid; the more interesting to read result in noting that dualism isn't a thing in our universe but it is in DC comics, is not to have DC comics become purely materialistic and then spend forever exploring the resulting setting which only barely resembles DC comics, but instead to have the protagonist learn to apply their rationality to a universe different from what they imagined it was - to recalibrate themselves appropriately.

By the time you scrap enough of the DC universe that you are purely materialistic, you've scrapped enough of the good parts of the setting that you might as well just make a new setting to write fiction in if that's what you want to do.

I recommend reading With This Ring. Note the author updates daily (around 12 midnight to 4 in the morning if you live in the US) and has done so very reliably for a long time now.

Instead of removing a lot of the most interesting parts of Green Lantern cosmology... *you can just totally write Lensman fanfic*. There's no point in taking the Green Lantern world and spending oodles of time rewriting it by scrapping things into the Lensman world, when the Lensmen already do everything you want and you can just write in their world instead.

*** There are a few problems with the emotional spectrum. It seemingly brings energy into being from nothing, which violates a lot of scientific principles. It also implies some special metaphysical quality that the mind of every single intelligent species would somehow have in common. The easiest word I can find to describe the concept is "soul". I agree that it would be better to keep as much mythos as possible. But confirming the existence of the soul comes with a lot of philosophical issues that would have to be addressed in detail. That's why I opted to remove the psychic aspect of lantern culture. But maybe you're right, and the universe is already different enough.

As a reader and a rationalist, I've found that fanfiction often works best if there are set changes to canon.

****** Remember that the universe you write about does not have to follow anything like the rules that our universe does.

I think a good example of this is the Discworld, particularly the witches sub-series. Their world has "narrativium" and so runs on the rules of storybook tropes: belief makes gods stronger, old ladies who live alone in the forest start thinking about eating young children and if you have a "million-to-one chance" it's practically guaranteed to happen. Within this world, following Bayes' theorem would clearly be a mistake and non-rational. On the other hand trying to twist the narrative to suit you would be rational (so long as you don't try too hard, so that it can't ironically backfire).

In the Green Lantern/DC universe dualism is literally true, some manner of gods exist and world-breaking invention is much easier than it is on our Earth. Depending on how far you want to push the boundaries you can: just accept these things as true and try not to exploit them too hard (don't go outside the known, /With This Ring/ mostly does this), come up with your own "outside context" explanation which you may or may not reveal (characters are in a sim, meta-gods exist and punish those who question too much, etc.), you can make discovering more about the universe just as hard as our world (HPMOR sorta did this), or you could go for the "world runs on superhero tropes" as a literal truth.

Just because you are making a "Rational" or "Rationalist" story does not mean that *Science* from our world works in the story world.

**** You can keep a lot of the psychic/emotional aspects of the rings if you assume that the ring has some sort of mind-reading capability. This "only" requires that the ring be some form of weak AI that can read emotional states. That in turn would imply that the ring has been deliberately hampered by some entity for some purpose - likely political or philosophical - which you can work into your imagining of the society of Oa. If you thought that willpower was the most important defining feature of an entity, you might think that it was smart to restrict their ability to control this superweapon based on their willpower, much in the same way that a Christian might think it was smart to make the use of nuclear weapons dependent on the Christianity of the user. (This might also imply that if things got really dire, the gloves would come off and the rings would unlock their full power.)

/Edit:/ Imagine a race of people that really cares about *flangum*. Flangum is the most important personal attribute that a person can have. In the old days, it wasn't possible to directly measure a person's flangum, you had to judge it by how they acted and what they said. Flagnum was the underlying factor in pretty much all of the decisions that these people made. If you had success in life, this was taken as proof of flangum. If you suffered losses, this was proof of a lack of flangum. Just as soon as it was possible, flangum sensors were built, to give an objective measure to this previously nebulous concept. It caused a revolution in their society - the old system of government was replaced by the Flangumnate. The economy was reorganized so that those with more flangum had better access to resources (since it was quietly acknowledged that life did not always perfectly reward those with flangum). Flangum had always been an underpinning of their society, and as their technology grew better, higher levels of power were restricted to those people who were more flangumnic than their peers. It had sometimes been said by sufficiently cynical people that "might makes flangum", but now it was the other way around - "flangum makes might". The Flangumnate's lawmen were all highly flangumnic, because to have power be unrelated to flangum would have been unconscionable.

And for any other society in the galaxy, this would have been a death knell. Stronger, more powerful civilizations would have muscled in without these ridiculous restrictions in place. But this race of people happened to be the first civilization that didn't implode or wither on the vine, and they grew in power enough to outpace the rivals that eventually cropped up, even with all the limitations that a flangum based approach implies. This race was particularly welcoming to sufficiently flangumnic individuals, no matter what their race was. Flangum was the important thing.

** For the colors: it makes sense to do away with the idea that they run on emotions, but if there's 'hard light' clearly you are harnessing some sort of exotic energy or physics unknown to us.

Working with this idea, each color could be using some variant of this exotic energy. Some could be more suited for hard light projection, others can project hard light but it's more fragile/costlier in terms of energy, but have other benefits like better radiation emission or other properties.

For instance, Red constructs can be less solid but abrasive, which more or less coincides with the comics. Sapphire would be much more solid and unable to project radiation (going with the imagery in the comics that their constructs are crystal-like). Green and yellow can be more flexible and versatile.

On Part 3: The restriction of only policing for interactions tha involve more than one planet is very elegant, I think: it goes well with the idea of 'space police', like a world police in a planet wouldn't get into the affairs of each individual country. It's also elegant because the relative amount of GL officers is low compared to the number of inhabited planets, so their field of action needs to be limited. For this same reason, I'd say they don't even act on extinction-level events unless requested.

*** hardlight constructs are a common sci-fi staple. Halo, Portal, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. I figured it was close enough to the science we know that it would be mostly acceptable for Sufficiently Advanced Aliens.

But yes, I definitely think the different "frequencies" of the spectrum would have different attributes. The examples you gave actually match the given emotional spectrum very well, with green being near the center, and red and violet being on opposite ends from each other. Perhaps the redscale frequencies generate radiation easier, while the bluescale is more solid and controlled.

As far as Part 3 is concerned, I think if they were alerted they would probably attempt to prevent any internal affairs that may result in planetary destruction. WW2 wouldn't have gotten a second glance from them, but there likely would have been a lantern on Krypton trying to save their entire culture from being wiped out.

Sure, you'd expect the cosmic police to have gear that's better than the housewives of Oa. But the houses can be connected directly to the power grid (or Oan equivalent), while the rings have to run on batteries.

** How I always assumed the rings worked is that most of their actual processing power or mechanisms were stored in subspace and linked to the ring itself.

Of course you can't store every tool even around one finger, but the thing can do FTL and a bunch of other impossible things, taking advantage of nonlocality and pocket dimensions to store most of its mechanisms isn't really that different.

An uncharged ring might only have the ability to hold a small capacitor charge and generate the gateway or connection to its subspace pocket capable of accessing the rest of the mechanism.

** Part 0: I'm guessing the plan is to use Alan Scott and set the story in 1940?

Part 1:\\
There's a series of artificial satellites located close to the sun that serve as primary data storage, FTL communications relay, civilization monitor, battery pack, super-computer and fabricator. These replicate themselves in order to seed to other star systems not yet part of the GL FTL network and also feed a continuous stream of energy back to the Central Power Battery.\\
Individual Power Batteries serve as power and data relays between these and any Rings in the Battery's immediate vicinity. The FTL connections between the satellites are what allow GLs to travel between the stars, while their primary power source is the local sun, it's energy converted and stored by the satellites.\\
This entire system is overseen by the AI "Ion" (Entity-seeking-stability-through-direct-bond or some such "closest match" translation for it's name) which is extremely limited in it's ability to take direct action (the Guardians have a well-justified fear of proactive AI and have taken steps to ensure the system is only used by "real" lifeforms). It has a tiny selection of actions it is allowed to undertake of it's own volition, including but not limited to: Establishing contact with a potential recruit, expanding the Corps' reach, deciding on and implementing sanctions against rogue Corpsmen and presenting the Guardians in the best light. For all other actions it requires the conscious direction and instruction of an authorized Green Lantern, hence the Willpower aspect. edit: Basically the system AlexanderWales describes.\\
While new Rings come pre-installed with basic combat uses and Ion itself can provide self-augmentation when in the vicinity of a Power Battery, new projections and implementations of the Ring have to be designed and specified by a given GL, then transmitted to their local satellites to design and implement the capability in the same GL's Ring. There is a database storing all such GL designs, but access requires both visiting Oa and having the Guardians judge you trustworthy. Even then "dangerous" designs are restricted or outright banned.\\
The rings themselves are actually tightly-wrapped masses of filaments that extend and shape themselves when in active use. They also extend into their hosts body in order to provide maximum protection, repair and reinforcement. Along with many of the Ring's features, this requires a fully self-aware host to specifically consent to before it can be implemented.

Part 2:\\
I honestly don't know what form the Oan civilization will take. But I do believe that knowledge of them in story should be mostly limited to the quirks and biases of the Lantern system, and Ion's perceived eccentricities. As it was in Metropolitan Man, I feel the canon beyond the essentials needed to match up with the original works aren't too important and are fair game for reimagining.\\
I have some ideas for the other parts that I'll look into writing up later.

Martians:\\
Why can't they be from Mars?\\
Lex is experimenting with space travel, which seems the perfect opportunity to bring the Martians in earlier then they otherwise would have appeared in canon, and right in time for WWII (I think the Green martians would have some interesting reactions to the Aryan philosophy). Couple that with the Green Lantern database likely coming with dire warnings from the last time the Martians had to be dealt with...

For Part 5...how about the primary goals of the Corps is to prevent the rise of Galaxy-spanning threats like strong A.I., and were actively working to contain Brainiac? Brainiac meanwhile works to propagate itself, or even to help the Kryptonians as originally intended.\\
To match up with the re-imagining of kryptonite as FTL-enabling fuel, the Green Lanterns use it as the primary component of their equipment, explaining their FTL capability, high-density energy storage and bright green colour-scheme. Brainiac could have reverse-engineered it's FTL applications from observation of the Corps, then surreptitiously passed that knowledge along, allowing speeds the Lanterns couldn't simply outrun and blow up.\\
Brainiac would edit in various flaws after the fact in the belief that the discovery of the Lanterns would somehow cripple it's plans, whatever those plans are decided to be.\\
Most of this is kind of irrelevant to the actual story, but I think kryptonite-as-Lantern-material would be a good fit, tying the world together and giving Lex additional reasons to be paranoid.

I like Batman because he's a foil for Lex, as a fellow super-rich-super-antihero type character. Really Green Lantern is secondary too. The primary priorities to work in for me are Bruce and Brainiac.

I read a Justice League vs Avengers fic at one point where Hulk radiation was revealed to be an almost identical frequency to Kryptonite radiation, thus functionally taking Superman out of the fight for the whole first round and most of the second. GLs using K is similar in that it helps level the playing field. Maybe Kryptonite doesn't have anything to do with Krypton at all. It's just the fuel for GLs, that just so happens to be harmful to Kryptonian biotech. That's how the GLs were able to hold off Brainiac for so long. Comes with some Nightmare-in-Hindsight for Clark's ship containing a Brainiac fragment, which presumably was the first breach of lantern-enforced AI quarantine of Krypton and surrounding systems.

******** I think Superman says that his powers work on a similar principle to kryptonite radiation, so it interferes with his biotech?

It would provide an alternative explanation for the sudden failures all their colony ships experienced. The GL Corps have been blowing them up then broadcasting back a warning about the dangerous A.I. Brainiac, which gets filtered out by Brainiac. Heh, for all the Kryptonians knew, Brainiac was engaged in full-scale war with the Corps. Krypton and Brainiac could even be blown up BY the Corps when they realize the quarantine is no longer viable.\\
Containment and restriction of self-propagating threats is also in line with the canon Corps, i.e. the Agent Orange situation.

Then you have Brainiac going into panic mode when it realizes there's a GL on the same planet as it who knows about Superman, and that the Corps could at any moment put two and two together regarding Superman's origins as the one that got away.\\
Its self-interested warnings to Lex (the truth that going after a GL could attract the Corps' attention or some convincing lie) would be a good reason for Luthor not to simply crush GL, like the last threatening alien agent he encountered.

  In comics, the lanterns run on the collective willpower of every living being in the universe. Rationally all that power has to come from somewhere.
#+end_quote

In the comics, physics are different, and the collective willpower of every living being in the universe is actually a form of energy. Motile beings - and especially cognitive beings, generate the green "light" (it's not really light, but emotional energy, which is an actual thing in their physics) of will by strongly committing to a course of action, especially in the face of adversity. The first ever being to exhibit will was some amoebaish fish thing that moved actively rather than passively.

#+begin_quote
  In comics, the rings can generate hardlight constructs, project harmful radiation, and even have built-in FTL capability. Rationally you can probably only fit so much tech around one finger.
#+end_quote

The comics have different rules and technologies. Many of the races that were first in the universe have the advantage of knowing the complete physics, including things humans would call psionics, magic, supertech, and how they all unify. A sufficiently advanced anything is indistinguishable from each other.

#+begin_quote
  How do the other colors of energy differ?

They derive from different not-necessarily-competing sources in the emotional spectrum.

The question is how rationally "willpower", a transcendental concept of mind that can only physically be mapped to certain electrical configurations in the brain that would differ vastly from person to person, let alone species to species, can relate so directly to this one huge energy battery in this one place in all the universe. The easiest explanation involves the existence of a "soul" that every sentient species managed to evolve to harness. But that brings up its own separate issues to handle.

** I'll put in another vote for leaving the DCU physics in place. Dualism is perfectly compatible with rationality -- it's just not how /this/ universe works (probably).

Bigger issue: the scale. First, decide whether it's the galaxy or the universe that's divided into 3600 sectors (I strongly endorse the former) and stick with it. Then calculate how many stars that is, pick a fraction of them to have intelligent life, and stick with that. If each lantern winds up with a thousand inhabited planets, then they can visit each of them once a year for 8 hours. That's not enough to take on minor or complex problems. It also doesn't allow any real leisure or friendship. Either take those things seriously or tweak the numbers.

Smaller issue: the colors. Is the mapping of colors to emotions a fundamental principle? Do a lot of species see the same spectrum? If so, why? Alternatively, would a sentient pit viper see a green lantern ring as the shade of near-IR that corresponds to willpower in /their/ subconscious?

*** It has to be limited to the Galaxy, for sanity sake. 100 billion star systems is enough, without expanding to the whole frakking edgeless universe. Firstly, I think the GLs should only watch over about a tenth of this space. The rest would either be neutral territory or belong to some other faction, like Krypton or the Red Lanterns. If we say a tenth of those are inhabited, and only a tenth of those are intelligent, that leaves 100 million societies for the Guardians to watch over. Reasonably, a single lantern can only watch over a hundred or so planets. So instead of limiting ourselves to a single lantern per sector, let's say each sector of space has ten lanterns from there, assigned there. That means they could handle probably ten thousand cultures, if working practically as a team. That means you would need about ten thousand sectors as well, and a total of a hundred thousand GLs, not counting Frontier, Homeworld Security, Special Forces, or any other specialized units.

I would think the spectrum would simply be easily mapped to the frequencies of light. Which I guess would make the Black Lanterns technically Ultra-Violet lanterns, though that doesn't roll off the tongue as well.

** Like many others I like "With This Ring". I think in writing this you would be needlessly trying to reinvent the same wheel. The DC universe is so irrational and unoptimized that writing a Green Lantern Corps rational fic seems too easy by far because Power Rings are so powerful. If you stuck with canon powers and rules, you'd have to work pretty hard not to be unbeatable in fairly short order.

Heck, even a completely normal, powerless individual would soon dominate the DC universe simply by telling all of the heroes and villains that they are using their powers wrong. That's what makes "The Metropolitan Man" so great in my opinion. It would be like the Worm fanfic "Security" except that you don't need future knowledge. You just need to be smart about how powers work, how they interact with one another and how you can munchkin the shit out of them.
