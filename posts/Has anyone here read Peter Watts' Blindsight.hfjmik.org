/Blindsight/ is a hard sci fi cosmic horror flavoured first contact story by author and marine biologist Peter Watts, about a crew of posthumans (along with their pet baseline interpretor) encountering a bizarre alien construct/organism beyond the edge of the Oort Cloud. It's probably most famous for its unique, wizard-killing take on vampires, positing them as a prehistoric subspecies of obligatory cannibals with savant level intelligence, but the core of the story is much more about the relationship between sapience and intelligence, and whether you need the first to have the other. It feels... relevant to this community's interest.


** I have seen it recommended here many times when people ask for novels, along with /Echopraxia/.

General review from what I remember: I really enjoyed his take on vampires, and felt that the story neatly slid in to the cosmic horror genre without actually leaving sci-fi, which is a rare but laudable occurrence. The aliens are well formulated and the suspense is executed well in general, though I didn't like the AI twist near the end. At the conclusion of reading it I felt like the book had effectively argued for the meaningfulness of the core self-awareness =//= intelligence premise.

On the other hand, the characters and much of the social speculation left much less of an impact, even considering the interesting ideas that some of them were based around. Not they they were incompetently executed, just that they didn't really compare to the other stuff in terms of being strikingly memorable.

**** Yes, I agree. The narrative, while true to the protagonist's unusual thought processes, also makes the book harder to follow.

It was an interesting book with some cool ideas, but it wasn't a book I particularly /enjoyed/ reading.

That's what I actually enjoyed the most in this story. Vampires felt kind of beside the point, like an exercise in "how could I describe vampirism scientifically". But I didn't encounter the idea of self-awareness not being a prerequisite of intelligence anywhere else.

Yeah, I think the vampires are a touch shoe-horned in the first book. Which kind of makes sense. The vampires owe their genesis to Watts being press-ganged at a con into a vampire panel, because they wanted a "hard sf" representative. The vampires were something he just sort of made up on the fly.

So yeah, the vampires, to me at least, feel like a fun idea Watts was very fond of, but couldn't figure out a story for them specifically, so he added them into /Blindsight/ for a good pop-culture hook. For what it's worth, I think they add a lot more to the sequel.

Anyone planning to read it should know that discussions on this thread on the nature of intelligence etc may well turn into plot spoilers. OP may want to mark some of their post as such.

Although I don't remember the details, I found myself disagreeing with his take on all that stuff. There was some assumption or other underlying the whole argument that I rejected. Didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, though.

Also he's part of a competent military command structure so there tends to be less of the "arguments with authorities" that turn people off in HPMOR? I'd say that one depends on whether you believe Sarasti on Siri externalizing his disdain for Sarasti's authority.

Sarasti, the captain of the ship, is a vampire- he's a completely different species that humans used biotechnology to resurrect. Neurologically, the book implies that vampires are less sentient than humans but have the advantage of multiple simultaneous thoughts occuring in parallel.

The idea being that autistic traits are at least in part a legacy of vampiric genetics. Savant skills and all that.

The vampire stuff is too hackneyed and silly for me, all it served was to bookend the futility of it all and a greygoo nanomachine monster could have done the same and been more rational.

What I do like very much is how it presents humans as rather inferior, which I feel like is completely necessary in a sci-fi setting that has any sufficiently advanced AI.

Space Fantasy Star Trek TNG never made a bit of sense logically, unless you assumed it was a Matrix/Sword Art Online fantasy world and Picard was cosplaying in a video game. Otherwise it buggers belief that they don't just have a robot doing the daring-do.

I read complaints about how the characters are freaks that had to modify themselves to the extreme just to still be obsolete, and it's like what... you want humans to be a shonen protagonist in a world with mechanical super intelligence? You want someone willing to augment themselves to the extreme, to have the personality of a normie like the people in the alternate reality box? These things can't co-exist without embracing complete fantasy.

Note that Sarasti disregarded Siri's intuition at his (imminent) peril. I don't think this is the story asserting Siri is terrible at it so much as a character.

**** I'd argue that that definition can't really be used here, because (as others have pointed out) "winning" is a term whose precise meaning varies between individuals. You'd change the meaning of that sentence at least a little if you tried to translate it into different human cultures and/or languages, nevermind the mess that results when you try to apply it to non-sentient beings with no concept of language.

If I had to term 'rationality', I'd call it...

#+begin_quote
  A term broadly referring to the absolute level of efficiency and effectiveness with which a complex system affects changes on it's environment, particularly when those changes fall into consistent categorizations such as, but not limited to,

  'Increasing the probability of the continued existence of the complex system.' or

  'Increasing the susceptibility of the environment to change by the complex system.' or

  'Increasing the rationality of the complex system.'
#+end_quote

I would say this definition captures the essence of rationality, /without/ having to involve such incredibly messy, subjective, and difficult-to-define words as 'conscious', 'winning', 'sentient', 'sapient', etc. And it can be applied to humans, the aliens in question, and just about anything else that would be defined as a 'intelligent being'.

****** (bit of a rambling post, sorry.)

I agree that you can more-or-less assign humans (individual-specific) utility functions, define 'winning' as optimizing it, and then define rationality as winning.

But the entire ongoing argument in the other comment threads is based on "winning" specifically and whether or not that term, which is intimately tied to language and the self, is meaningful when it comes to nonsentient beings with no concept of language. The normally-significant ambiguity that people tend to overlook with words is cranked up so far that you can't even begin to figure out the specific definition that the Scramblers would use, because they don't even have language.

So in my eyes, the problem is that /no one is considering other possible definitions for 'rationality'/. The given definition would otherwise be fine, but it just doesn't work properly in this context. So offering a more general definition that doesn't (or at least tries not to) make a bunch of assumptions about the nature of the intelligence involved is prudent.

Also, on a bit of a side note, I bring up the whole "words mean different things to different people, and entire arguments can hinge on that" because everyone is talking about consciousness, sapience, sentience, etc, and, speaking for myself, I have /no idea what those are/ or how they're being used here. Not for lack of thinking or reading about it, either.

Am I conscious? How would I tell? Is it hinged on the ability to recognize one's self as existing in the world and make changes utilizing that realization? Because lots of things can do that; /ants/ can pass the mirror test. And the Scramblers do too, they apparently just don't see themselves as individuals; when one was asked to identify another Scrambler it said 'Rorschach', the ship they were a part of. That's a bit like if you asked a ant to identify another ant and it said "That is Colony." And it goes without saying that they're capable of understanding that injury or death is a impedance.

Does that mean that Scramblers /are/ conscious and self-aware? Are they /not/ conscious or self aware just because they only care about the well-being of their colony/ship and don't bother with individuality? Because if so, you could say that a sufficiently dedicated soldier for whatever country is also less or non-conscious, if they're putting the wellbeing and needs of their country above their lives. Or that individuals from any cultures which value the group more heavily than personal identity are also less or non-conscious.

Are they non-conscious because they don't understand or use language? Are humans who are (metaphorically, literal cases are rare) raised by wolves, and end up with no concept of language non-conscious? GPT-3 is reasonably competent with language, it can regularly write text indistinguishable from human-written text, is it /conscious/? Is the Chinese-room that Rorschach utilized conscious, or is it not conscious because it broke down when it faced a context outside what it was normally equipped for? Because a similar thing can happen with humans with poor language skills.

All of these are very important points, and I'd wager that no one should even be /using/ these words in a argument until some sort of consensus is reached and we know we're using similar definitions, because otherwise we're basically arguing completely different points and it doesn't take a rationalist to know that's bad in a debate.

But we are, and it bugs me.

******* No worries on a /long/ post -- totally disagree about it being /rambling/ tho :)

I don't think 'winning' is tied to language. I wouldn't trust /humans/ to be able to accurately even approximate the actual 'approximation' of their utility functions.

I also don't always know what people mean by 'consciousness', 'sapience', 'sentience', etc.. I'm inclined to think that they're more the result of our confusion than anything. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't used by future people with better understanding of 'intelligence'.

(I haven't read Blindsight yet myself but I've read about it and have a copy to-read too.)

The 'not seeing themselves as individuals' is confusing to me. I can better understand it if the individual Scramblers were, in a real concrete sense, a 'single mind', like the tines in A Fire Upon the Deep. So, one Scrambler identifying another as "Rorschach" /should/ also (easily) understand that their statement was equivalent to "That's another part of me, Rorschach. I am the ship.".

I do remember reading something recently, that linked to a bunch of examples elsewhere too, of people claiming that they remember 'waking up as conscious', e.g. as a teenager. (It might have been the comments on Slate Star Codex's recent post reviewing the 'bicameral mind' book.) Like with other mental epiphenomena, those of us that /are/ conscious might be just /assuming/ that all other people are too, when they aren't. I'll admit that seems like a stretch.

I sympathize with your lament about imprecise definitions, but that seems inevitable when discussing confusing/confused topics. It's perfectly fine to debate or discuss those definitions -- examples help! It's also fine to just taboo the unclear words and directly debate or discuss whatever you think are the relevant aspects or components.

  the question "is self-awareness valuable for winning?" is just as legitimate as any other.
#+end_quote

Ok, but the answer is clearly "self-awareness is required to win, because otherwise who experienced the victory?" A computer does not win at chess; it moves electrons around until a stop condition is reached. 'Winning' is a thing that conscious beings do; victory being a state of mind, it requires a mind to experience it. The question Blindsight raises is rather whether self-awareness is valuable for /reproducing/, which is not the same thing.

***** Well, first of all, victory itself can be experienced without as well as anything else; self-awareness is needed for inspecting one's own mental state during it. And then, if computers don't win at chess, then why do humans? They also do nothing but moving atoms around. Such a simplistic reductionism doesn't lead anywhere, it just derails us into looking for a metaphysical boundary, beyond which chess suddenly emerges from a bunch of atoms.

****** Victory cannot be experienced without experiencing. A non-conscious mind does not experience anything, that's rather the point. I'm taking 'self-aware' and 'conscious' as synonyms here, as Blindsight also seems to do; the vampires are non-conscious in that there is nothing that it is like to be them, any more than there is something that it's like to be a desk.

I do not know why humans are conscious and computers are not, but I see no need to call the boundary metaphysical: Clearly the physics of a human brain is very different from the physics of a Neumann-architecture computer. I'm not claiming that it's impossible to build a conscious computer (which indeed would win chess games), only that current computers are not conscious.

************** Making or acknowledging?

From your subjective perspective, you have no possibility to judge surely what is more illusionary, "you" or the "system."

Even the separation between "objectivity" and "subjectivity" in your mind is illusionary.

However, the "self" is self-made. Once you have the "illusion of self", you have the "illusionary meanings" for yourself. And obviously, all the attempts to act and think as not-self are second order illusions -- and the fragility of these illusions is easily proved by pain for the first order illusion of "your self".

How is it typically solved? We take the concept of Truth. To the question, "What are you?" you answer, "Truth knows." And to the question, "What is meant by it?" -- if you're sincery, you only can start to answer with "That whatever I am, I am not myself."

And once a thinker has thought to a definite end, the person can be called dogmatist.

It's just you can accept dogma and know it, and you can accept dogma and don't know it.

The vampire addition felt pointless to the whole theme. The intelligence without sentience argument did not convince me. IMHO to compete and evolve you need to model the future and hence you need to work with very abstract objects. I believe sentience derives from there.

** Blindsight felt like the science fiction version of some book written by a crank who has an incredibly questionable belief about a field of science outside of their expertise. Which, to be fair, could be said about a lot of science fiction novels, and isn't necessarily a bad thing. But Blindsight is pretty standout due to the pessimism about it all.

Honestly the premise seems to me as kind of humanocentric in a roundabout cynical way, because by positing sapience and self-awareness as unique to humanity it's basically discounting the idea that there could be other kinds of sapience that we as humans would have trouble recognizing as such. In the same way that we often discount the intelligence and emotionality of some species of animals because they don't express it in ways we can relate to.
