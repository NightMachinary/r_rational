Holy /shit/. They figured out how to use mutually assured destruction against a foe that cannot be destroyed.

*** Have we met anyone named David? Over at [[/r/unsong][r/unsong]], [[/u/Fluffy_ribbit]] says:

"David means beloved. David is also a child who takes on Giants. David is also a king. The child that David has dishonorably dies in the womb, but he repents and afterward, his son unites Isreal and Judea."

So, Someone who is beloved, someone who takes on powerful forces, and a king. Hmm...

Someone who takes on Giants as in the corporate giants ie. our main characters?

Ana, who is beloved by Aaron, or Aaron, who is beloved by Sarah?

Aaron relates to Aaron and Moses, who was the high priest, and thus ruler, and thus King?

I predict Aaron is the Messiah ben David.

****** That's a decent argument against, yes, and Scott might decide to go that route, but I hope he doesn't. Technically, it might be trivial within-universe if Aaron happens to have important ancestors. But in a Doylist sense, it would have tension with the everyman theme, however it were rationalized.

******** The fiction/reality distinction isn't important here.

I think that it smacks of destiny and fate and similar things if your character has an important ancestor and gains plot relevant powers from that, even if there are logical reasons which could explain this ancestry without reference to destiny and fate. I think that this kind of connection to destiny and fate and such would undermine Aaron's everyman position, even if it's true that a lot of people are descended from David.

********** Someone said that Aaron might be the Messiah ben David. I said that would be bad because Aaron is more of an everyman and it would ruin that to give him a secret ancestry. You pointed out that lots of people are ben Davids. I responded by saying that, while true, making Aaron the descendant of David would still feel like a plot device despite that. I'm not sure why you're confused.

*********** You offered a detailed break down. You ignored the relevant details though. The comic made the point that your redefining the problem to keep the hypothesis alive. Let's look at the conversation and see if I'm right.

At this point you haven't yet explained how and why Ben Davidship would ruin his everyman position.

You say that it might not be scarce in the book it is still scarce in real life you were after all speaking in "a Doylist sense".

In other words you were only talking about scarcity in the story world and not in real life. The scarcity in real life is the salient point.

I point out that I'm also talking about the scarcity in real life, and there isn't any.

You then decide that it's not about scarcity, then it's not about scarcity in the story world, then it's not about scarcity in the real world. In other words you are redefining the hypothesis.

************ I never claimed that scarcity was what would potentially ruin Aaron's everyman position. I think that a secret ancestry ruins his everyman position regardless of whether or not lots of other people share that specific secret ancestry. The trope of "secret ancestry" calls to mind ideas from other stories using that trope, and those ideas being brought to mind would hurt the everyman position, even if those ideas don't apply as well within this specific story. "Doylist" should be read to mean "thematically, in the sense of what ideas it brings to the mind of the reader", not "is this true in the real world". My comment wasn't intended as an argument, just as a description of my point of view that others might or might not share. Nobody else had a problem with my statement. But feel free to disagree with my opinion if you wish, I guess.
