Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This is some freeform, public worldbuilding, partly for the fun of it; skip it if that's not your thing.

--------------

Continuing on /Shadows of the Limelight 2: Electric Boogaloo/ ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aq7h6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/egesvs9/][last seen here]]), some examples of verb domains, doing some of the "work forward, then work backward" oscillation process that I like.

*Verb Domain: Cut*

An illustrati with the verb domain of "cut" can cut things with supernatural ease, where the definition of "cut" is defined memetically (that is, by the collective conscious relating to the "cut" meme, rather than any standardized definition or linguistic tradition, modulo Sapir-Whorf effects).

/Domain enhancement:/ A cutting illustrati can cut more cleanly and deeply with blunter instruments than a non-illustrati, typically employing blades. This ability depends on both physical proximity, sensation, and whether or not the illustrati is the one cutting: enhancing a cut made by someone else is very difficult, bordering on impossible, as is cutting using an implement at a distance.

/Domain generation:/ A cutting illustrati can cut things without the use of any implement whatsoever, sometimes aided by a cutting motion or other notional link to the verb. Range and power depend on standing (fame).

/Domain sense:/ A cutting illustrati can sense when someone is cutting something, with perception being easier for longer, more powerful cuts, and the sense increasing with standing (fame). With greater standing, this can extend into the place (i.e. sensing where cuts have happened).

--------------

So the big question is how much this generalizes to other verb domains, and whether there are other broad abilities that need to be a part of this. From [[https://www.randomlists.com/random-verbs][a random verb generator]] we get the following: dress, admire, worry, report, skip, spot, check, explode, mourn, tour, inform and zoom.

Some problems are immediately obvious:

1. Some verb domains are worthless. This is probably okay, and fits with the existing magic system, but I worry that there are too many duds in here. "Dress" in particular just doesn't work, at least within the system as described; you can dress yourself faster and possibly more completely, but it's not a noun domain, it's a verb domain, and the act of dressing has almost no combat or mundane utility whatsoever. It would be easy to create a superhero with a "dress" keyword (pulling different customized outfits out of hammerspace?) but the magic system would need extending. I'll have to categorize different ways in which verbs are useless.
2. A lot of these verbs work a whole lot better if you can affect other people with them (admire, mourn, worry), and thus, /domain compulsion/ is born, a cluster for mind-affecting effects, the details of which are TBD. From a writing perspective, I don't know how much I like this, given that mind-affecting stuff can be difficult to write and interfere with character stuff too much.
3. Some verbs are long-term, like "tour", and I'm not entirely sure what to do about that. I suppose there's no big problem with that, given that all the existing abilities still map pretty well.
4. Some words have two or more different meanings: those will just be considered memetically distinct from each other, so that a checking illustrati can refer to either an inspector or someone who stops or slows people (you get one or the other, not both).
5. Illustrati aren't illustrati of words, they're illustrati of concepts that somehow map to the real world, and words are just a quick shorthand and a quick method of generation. I'm struggling to think of memetically distinct concepts that don't have words, but I'm sure they're out there (though if they were important enough, you'd think that someone would make a word to describe them).

*** I suspect that the gulf between 'words that happen to be verbs' and 'concepts that happen to be actions' is bigger than the one between 'words that happen to be nouns' and 'concepts that happen to be objects, substances, or energies', but also both the space of words and the space memes are extremely slippery and soft. For example, if verbal (or 'active' or whatever) domains are a thing, is 'Sound' a verb domain or a noun one? If so, why is it that one and not the other? Is it both, or are there two separate ones that happen to brush shoulders?

**** With a greatly expanded register of domains, there will be a lot of them that overlap in one way or another, assuming that it's a full expansion, rather than "here are the 16 verb domains". We could imagine that "Pierce", "Cut", "Slice", "Puncture", "Slash", and "Wound" are all active domains, and then there are adjacent material domains for "Knife", "Edge", "Sword", "Scalpel", and so on. All of these have overlap with each other, similar in presentation with some mild differences, and since these base concepts are only exposed to the illustrati through their powers, they might mistakenly believe that they're the same, even though they're not.

"Sound" would be a material/phenomenal domain, and then something else would be a sound generating active domain, e.g. "Sing", "Clap", "Yell", etc. (And we could divide up "Sound" into high and low frequencies, or particular manifestations of sound, at least under the new scheme.)

*** I made a similar suggestion on the discord, but I'll repeat a modified version of it here:

Convert verbs to nouns, either using the gerund “-ing”, or using the agent noun “-er”, (or both) depending on which version seems more ‘memetically salient'.

Then treat the gerunds like material domains (with powers based around inducing and controlling the domain externally), and the agent nouns more like the animal domains (based around alteration of the self).

Some verbs aren't memetically salient as either agents or processes, and so don't appear as domains.

*Examples:*

/“Dress”/:

/Dresser/, as in someone who dresses, is an uncommon word but does seem like a plausible entity in memespace. Such an illustrati would have intuitive knowledge of fashion and tailoring. And may be able to subtly alter themselves to be more dextrous or have a more cutting figure.

/Dressing/, as a process, doesn't feel salient to me. But such an illustrati could sense when someone is getting dressed, and telekinetically help or hinder the process.

--------------

/”Explode”/:

The agent form /exploder/ is not salient.

The process of /exploding/ is. In fact, we have a word for it. Explosion. This domain fits right into the established paradigm, alongside fire and sound.

--------------

/”Mourn”/:

Both forms of this seem salient. /Mourners/ are an actual profession in some cultures. This illustrati would be very very good at feeling sad, or at least appearing to be so. Might be hired by the wealthy to appear at their funerals and write laments about their deaths.

/Mourning/ is the one you're worried about. Clearly, this domain should involve inducing mourning in others. I don't think this needs to be thought of as another cluster of powers; it's just domain creation. To make it manageable from a story standpoint, maybe make the emotional effects dissipate quickly once the illustrati leaves the area. As in, the Mourning illustrati can make you feel intense sorrow while they are next to you, but as soon as they leave, there is nothing to sustain that emotional process, and so your mind quickly readjusts. Maybe a mental illustrati could only induce long-term compulsions via pavlovian conditioning. (Or maybe the precursors excluded mental process domains just like they excluded nerve tissue as a domain)

**** Domain immunity would be included, and seems simple enough, most of the time, though given overlap between domains, that would probably have to be ironed out a bit more than it is. Domain alteration seems (to me) to be an analog of domain enhancement, which can already alter the properties of [whatever].

*** If a "cut" illustrati reaches the point where he can cut non-material bonds, then he becomes super powerful - cutting someone off from their allies is just /ridiculous/. And cutting them off from their /power/...

But even a 'dress' ability has at least some combat utility - especially if the domain power can be /reversed/. That is, if you can - in an instant - undress an opponent and then dress him in a strait-jacket (presumably, a Dress illustrati will have a selection of strait-jackets with him just in case). It might not hold up against other Illustrati powers, but it can take a non-powered person out of the fight with a touch.

Probably the easiest way to find such a concept is to look for words in other languages which don't have a simple English translation. A brief google bought me [[https://www.ef.com/wwen/blog/language/13-words-with-no-english-translation/][here]], which includes suggestions like Toska (Russian), a word which means “A sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without a specific cause; a longing with nothing to long for” - a single emotional state for which there isn't an easily-found single English word.

*** For #5, there are concepts in other languages that feel like they should be in English, or concepts with multiple words in them. Does Shadows of the Limelight have multiple languages in them? Do people in other cultures have different illustrati? Is the general perception of the words the general conception of the word or the concept itself?

If the power is bound to the culture, I wonder what would happen with people who belong to two different cultures. Would it be based on personal identity or how the people around them view them? Frequently people w/ multiple cultures codeswitch, so if it's personal identity that can change. If it's public persona and they're fairly split between two ethnicities then depending on the people that surround them the public's perception of them can change.

** Blend Pokemon with Anne McCaffrey's /Dragonriders of Perm/ series and more than a touch of /The Expanse/.

The native beings of the planet, a form of Boltzmann brain, have been domesticated to serve the human population. Different breeds are created for different purposes, suited to their roles in human society. Crossbreeding with wild Boltzmann brains results in wider speciation. Different regions have different conditions, leading to the "Regional Pokedex" clusterings of Pokemon seen in Pokemon lore. This planet is a human colony.

To keep the population safe from wild Boltzmanns, what government may exist encourages humans to capture and train these Pokemon, to befriend them, and to use them to keep society free of these ferals. Sort of like various Nuzlocke-run Pokemon fanfiction. The government subsidizes these trainers through R&D focused on training captured Boltzmanns, on improvements to Boltzmann-capture technology, research on Boltzmann biology and life, and healing of Boltzmanns damaged in battle. This is commonly seen through new Pokeballs, Pokemon Centers where Pokemon are healed, and the Pokemon Professor's research.

Does this idea fit better in a high-tech Expanse-style setting, where interplanetary travel is assumed, or in a low-tech Dragonriders setting, where much tech has been lost, and Greater Humanity has forgotten about this colony?

Why would a government in that setting allow or encourage young adults to become Boltzmann trainers?

​

I would say the easiest explanation is that the government is actually very effective at keeping the threat contained, and the Pokemon League is essentially the Boy Scouts, combined with 4H.

​

Those kids aren't generally going toe to toe with the bigest threats around, they are actually exploring wilderness that is really more of a curated park/preserve, and they generally do it with adult supervision, and as part fo a program that includes a lot of safety and general skills classes as well. Sure everyone's heard about that one kid who ended up being in the right place at the right time and was the first responder who caught a dangerous pokemon that had gotten into the preserve, but that's not typical.

​

It's even easier if you remove the battle-sport bit and focus more on competitions where the 4H parallel is stronger, and the kids are presumably being taught useful husbandry practices. Also if you use the Alola region's challenges as your thematic model rather than the gyms form otehr regions.

**** The 4H/FFA/Scouts idea is a good one. Gym battles would be something akin to college, then, but there's still expanded tiers of other forms of competitions.

With the idea of a preserve comes the idea of a border, then provides structure for introducing Pokemon Rangers, who are the ones who enforce that border and provide for the expansion of civilization. Kind of like the Hunters in RWBY, I guess.

*** Interesting idea. I think it works best in a more isolated setting, in part so you don't have to answer questions about what the wider world is like or how outside forces impact society, but I tend to be a fan of smaller, more constrained settings, since they can be a bit more focused on whatever their primary subject matter is.

One of the ideas that I've been kicking around for a while to justify a "young trainers" type of thing is a society with fairly good healthcare, but really poor birth control. Assuming that infant mortality is no longer a large consideration, overpopulation (or just surplus population) might mean a devaluing of human life, especially in third or fourth sons, depending on how the society is set up, similar to how third or fourth sons were over-represented in the Crusades among nobles, or how children were sent to nunneries/monasteries at least partly because there was no money/prospects for them. I'm a little iffy on the sociology, though I think it at least passes the sniff test for a layman reader.

*** I think you could do this with an interplanetary setting, it'd be interesting to ask and answer questions about tourism, trade, what happens when you export Boltzmanns or import off-planet species. Medicine! Cuisine! Boltzmanns going wild on other worlds due to a mix-up in shipping ("what do you mean they escaped?")! The isolated setting has been done a la Pern, I think it'd be more interesting to mix it up and throw that in.
