*** Straw Vulcan is when you use an extremely "logical" character to show that emotion is better than logic. That's not really the point of this story; that passage is used to show social maladjustment more than to say anything about rationality.

**** That's the point of this passage, though. The follow-up introspection is all about "truth", "valid arguments" and "not compartmentalizing". Had she ignored 'logic' she would have had a better experience. Real logic would have involved investigating her sense of revulsion. A bad version of logic leading to bad consequences that could be avoided emotionally: that's exactly Straw Vulcan.

I'm not sure if the "omni" trio is canon in Judaism, but why does she lose her faith entirely because "must be electromagnetism lol" when it could easily have been "hashem did it lol"? It would be no stretch for her to view it as god specifying physics to not work conventionally in the tablets.

  The first assures him, in so many words, that she won't cheat on, desert, or cuckold him---but the second can produce evidence that she's incapable of these acts.

** u/notmy2ndopinion:
#+begin_quote
  Two cars race toward each other on an empty freeway; the first to swerve is the chicken. How should you play if you want to preserve both your status and your life? The answer is clear: in full view of your opponent, rip out your car's steering wheel, blindfold yourself, down a bottle of Jack Daniels, scream. If you can persuade your opponent that you're incapable of making the decision to swerve, then he has to swerve. In other words: the stupider, more ignorant, more irrational you can prove you are, the better the chance you have of winning. How much of human life follows the same pattern?

Great quote. Is this original or is it from something else?

*** I don't have my copy on hand, but I believe the core concept was first laid out by Thomas Schelling in "Strategy of Conflict" (circa 1960). It might have been Bertrand Russell (around the same time) if it wasn't Schelling. The wording would be different, but not by much; "chicken" is one of the classic games in game theory.

This is one of those fics where I'm not sure if the author is subtly hinting that the real problem is her mental problems, or if I'm just being overly optimistic and reading into it because I don't want to accept that the author thinks that being smart is worse than being dumb.
