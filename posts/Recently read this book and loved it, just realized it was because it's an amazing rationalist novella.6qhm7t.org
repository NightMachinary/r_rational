** I decided to buy and read the book because I love stories that involve the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel][Library of Babel]] concept in one way or another.

It was well written and I personally enjoyed it, but I don't see how it's actually rationalist? The characters are vivid, but I don't see how anyone is behaving in a way that appears intelligent/rational to me.
