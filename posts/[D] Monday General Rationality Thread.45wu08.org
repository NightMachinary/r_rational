Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** If anyone has watched [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi][Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi / Erased]] anime, highly recommended. Its about a guy that's blessed/cursed with the ability to go back in time and is forced to stop bad events from happening.

He is chased by a serial killer from an unsolved crime of his past and he must travel back and figure a way to stop him. I enjoyed the protagonist as he takes a head on approach to solve the problem without falling into needless angst, the characters feel somewhat human (besides some small cases which may or may not have a reason to be) and I enjoy how the author has the protagonist gather clues and piece things together in a logical progression.

Also got some really nice music and the cinema approach to several scenes.

**** Yeah though those are like the type of cliffhangers I can enjoy. When there's information overload and they give you all the pieces you may end up solving the mystery beforehand and it doesn't give you time to enjoy the complexity of the show.

I like that they give you a week as buffer which you can use to interpret the given data and come up with hypotheses of your own to test the next week. It helps to immerse in the story.

*** it was nice, and I even mentioned it here a while ago, but the story turned on worst side. Not that it was too surprising, seeing as it was obvious where it was going. But it was still unfortunate that it ended up aiming so low. [[#s][recent episodes]]

And that is really unfortunate, because the parts where the story was actually trying it managed to convey emotions and immerse very will. But instead of going for those strong points its just going on with cheap writing tricks to produce forced tension. Which makes all the clues scattered in the series uninteresting because it is obvious the entire point is to go for twists, so the author has no reason to make it "solvable".

He doesn't think twice before doing this, because he is Link.

One of the big challenges I can see is coming up with a thoughtful link, when sociopathic Links seem to be an immutable rule of the Legendary Hero reincarnation process. Sure, their mission may be good and they're very bishi, but every one of them kills and steals like it's nothing.

˅: basically, an attempt to account for the star wars universe's defining characteristics (droids, no internet, not much science, no AI, no immortality, mixing of alien species with similar levels of development and augmentation, /all of which is totally bizarre from a futurist standpoint/), rather than the ridiculous stuff like Jedis, The Force (although there will be features comparable to that), The Evil Empire, which isn't all that interesting IMO. Though, TBH, if a reader finds those aspects of canon interesting it is probably easier than you'd think to convey that interest to me. Before proceeding to do so, please consider the weight of the problem constraints I have already taken on, any more just might break my back :p

#+end_quote

Why not? I suppose that any strong intelligence would have protections against child processes harming their hosts, you and I, for instance, may find such things difficult to conceive of because early social apes who found recursive processes hostile to their hosts easy to conceive of were all castrated by them, as they imagined too vividly what their rivals might want to do if they realized they could have been a mental process being emulated by their own rivals in turn. It doesn't seem like there'd be any advantages, anyway.

But if you look at cruder information processing systems like modern computers, child computations subverting their hosts is a common occurrence. My thought is, it looks quite a bit like the wind fish's dreaming capacity is probably just that crude. It clearly is already running malicious processes, for one thing. For another, the wind fish doesn't really look like something that would have been born entirely of evolution, that would necessarily have protections, it looks like a one-off. The fact that it's wearing clothes strongly suggests that its people have technology (which, in hyrule, includes magic), it may have been born of some kind of spell, and its capacity to dream does seem to transcend its individual intelligence, as if it were just bolted on after the fact, it's plausible that it wouldn't have the ability to instate any of the required limits on resource consumption or secure a sandboxing perimiter around its agent-models.

I am kind of disappointed to find this quote, though: Owl: "But one day, the Nightmares entered the dream and began wreaking havoc" Entered. Like they didn't emerge there. It's possible the owl is wrong, but, unexplained incursion of mysterious dark forces would fit the pattern of the series =__=

*********** Well, Link is also a foreign body (albeit a rather exceptional one), so it's clear that being in the right situation and possessed of the right power can enter the wind fish's dream.

Anyway, you have a good point. It is rather untenable that the NPCs are fully intelligent and aligned with the wind fish. Is the opposite possibility valid, though.

Perhaps the models are simple enough to not be of significant moral weight?

  - If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?", I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.

  - My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.

** So, recently I've been thinking about something. For me at least, a great deal of rationality's benefits have come from chains of self modifications only made possible by some realizations about myself. My own rationality, developed on my own starting when I was at about the age of 15, helped me see myself more clearly, and that included my various flaws. But that wasn't the most important bit, the noticing of the flaws. The important bit was getting rid of them, the long slow work I did on those flaws, from my temper, to my tendency to be uncharitable to people I disagreed with, to a hundred other things. Many of those flaws weren't something I could remedy simply by realizing they were flaws, I actually had to work at it, it wasn't just something I could snap out of. However, over time I have dealt with these things. I now no longer have an unusually bad temper, and can keep calm much better than almost everyone I interact with. I don't feel shy in social situations. I am no longer habitually uncharitable to the groups I have realized I was being habitually uncharitable to.

I'm not sure how typical this is, the ability to simply excise bits of my personality I don't like, and slowly shape who I am, to the extant that I am capable of. I have some evidence to suggest most people aren't quite as capable of changing themselves as I am, as I frequently see rationalists mention that they have a specific irrational emotional reaction to certain circumstances, or are less charitable than they should be of a particular group, and just lament that fact, instead of ending with "... and I expect to have this problem solved withing a year, at the outside." The me of five years ago is scarcely recognizable to the me of today, and as far as I can tell, I'm speeding up, not slowing down. But everybody else seems to be standing still. All the people I know are all the same as they were half a decade ago, and probably will be half a decade from now. It's not just that I'm learning new things, it's that who I am is changing, and it doesn't really seem like anyone else is.

I honestly don't know how much of this is unique to me within the rationalist community, but I suspect the answer is that it's actually rather typical, but most people don't really talk about it too much.

EDIT: Also, that type of slow effort to change who you are has been the keystone to much of my progress towards becoming the person that I am, but I don't see many characters in rationalist fiction deliberately undergoing such changes. It's all accidental, or just picked up. Nobody ever goes "Oh, I seem to have a problem where I react with strong anger to anyone who intellectually defeats me, I should deal with that." Anybody have any idea why?

*** For me there's usually an /incident/ where I realize the way I'm conducting myself is rotten. Changing isn't much of a conscious effort, after that. The way I was becomes ugly, to me, and I no longer wish to be it.

So for me the more difficult processes are the ones where it's difficult to consider the problem ugly. I make no effort to network, because nothing about going out of my way to make connections seems virtuous. Most networking seems like a waste of time, and most of the social practices the west promotes seem childish, pathetic, sick, rife with crutches and bad habits. It's plain, though, that the insight into the way others think, insight into the demographics of the market and the audience, and earning the trust of people I could use(the nice kind of using though!) (you can probably guess I could be better at this) would all be very valuable to me. At the same time, I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd hear about how rarely I go out and how few connections I maintain and respond "what an unappealing character trait, obviously you suck and I don't want to be around you". That just doesn't happen. People like the hermit. They find them interesting, and unthreatening, their sense of virtue might even praise them, and so my sense for virtue ethics cannot help me out of this hole.

From the inside, you see your reasons for acting. From the outside, you see the trends /in/ your actions. Since your actions are a noisy result of your reasons for acting, which may not be consistent, checking that outside view is helpful for observing where your actions deviate from your reasons and where your reasons conflict, fade away, or fail to be tied to realities outside yourself.

*** I've had similar experiences, but they've been rather hit-or-miss, in some sense. A few months ago I finally figured out how to activate this at will. Disclaimer: This might not generalize to all people, I've just found it works very well for me.

My trick is to write down the observations (e.g., in a journal) that made me realize I wanted to change something, and then to just sorta go off on various tangents exploring the idea. Half the time I have some pretty awesome insights into the situation, because I'm literally sitting down and thinking about the problem, as opposed to instantly trying to toss out a solution as people are wont to do. Note that there's no real pressure to actually /do/ anything -- it's just a nice mental excursion.

Within one or two sessions of this, the change process activates and becomes mostly automatic. I think it has to do with the act of writing and thinking deeply somehow focusing unconscious parts of your mind into action. Otherwise you wind up having System 1 and System 2 at odds, and your entire effort fails.

Interesting observation: It doesn't work if I type things, only if I write them. Not sure why this is the case. Maybe because I tend to slow down and focus on shaping the letters or something, inducing a mildly suggestive state.

There's a lot of self-improvement stuff that we can steal from various mystic and meditative traditions. The annoying thing is having to wade through all the metaphysical cruft to get to the actual meat of the ritual.

- Anti-akrasia: I used it to get lots of boring shit done that I would otherwise have procrastinated on.
- Productivity improvement: I spent several days writing down descriptions of my experiences each day, and picked the mental states and behaviors that correlated with high productivity. Spent some time thinking about those, and my productivity skyrocketed within a week.

After a couple of sessions of consciously practicing those, I found I didn't need to anymore -- they sorta faded into the background. Tricks that I didn't write down and pontificate about at length didn't seem to get absorbed the same way.

Generally it takes only a couple of days before it kicks in, though that probably has to do more with the size of the change than anything else.

****** Thanks for replying.

Does it work only with writing by hand ? How you found any other ways to make it work?

Out of 100, how many times did it work? (you said it was hit or miss, do you mean 50 times out of 100?)

*** I use CBT to change thought patterns and paradigm shift all the time, so progress is slow but steady. After ten years, though, I don't notice as much that needs changing, and don't know of any other method beyond introspection and CBT for changing how I think. What are your methods?

**** Often they are custom to the situation. For example, I noticed that I had a disgust reaction when thinking of dating mtf transgender people even if they were utterly indistinguishable from someone born with a female body, and that I had some strange apparently out of nowhere negative reactions when thinking about transgender people in general. So I read some stories written by transgender people about their experiences to force myself to empathize with them more. I also tracked down some strange ideas in my head completely unconnected to reality that I didn't really verbally believe but had somehow inherited from my father and got rid of them. So introspection is definitely a part of it.

Most of the time, solving each individual problem that I find is unique, but taking the time to figure out how to solve it takes at most a week, whereas the actual solving takes longer, so it isn't really a drain on my time compared to the actual solving of the problem.

*** In some regards it was similar for me (like with the anger management you've mentioned).

What I currently seem to be stuck on, however, are "disabling" \ ignoring the felling of anxiety and being able to choose long-term rewards instead of short-term ones.

The first is the simpler one, because I think learning to perceive the feeling of anxiety as just another type of "pain" (i.e. as a physiological reaction instead of a psychological one, roughly speaking) will gradually allow me to ignore it and learn to choose my decisions without fearing the fear.

The second, however, is where I don't know what to do. It's like when you haven't slept for several days, and your thoughts almost constantly revert back to the idea of going to bed and just falling asleep. Everything else seems unimportant by that point, doesn't bring /joy/, doesn't motivate your brain to be invested and stay focused on the task at hand.

So using this analogy in regards to pursuing long-term interests instead of shorter ones, it's like trying to switch from unenlightened to enlightened hedonism. As an example: factually you'd /understand/ that overusing drugs right now will fuck up your organism (eventually killing you) and make you incapable of getting pleasure out of anything else in the future. But in practice, you just can't make yourself care about this fact because your brain got used to short term gratification and will not choose delaying it for higher benefits later.

I'm not sure whether I'm expressing myself clearly enough or just rumbling. Basically it's like for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][kid that usually eats their one marshmallow right away]] to be aware that waiting would be beneficial for them, to try to switch to waiting and delaying the gratification, but to continuously fail because their brain is not interested and motivated in switching.

** I've recently read "The Anvil of the Gods" and the ending really irked me. The plot is that Earth was destroyed by Von Neumann machines, and some of the survivors, aided by an alien race, go out to seek the civilization that created the machines and destroy them.
