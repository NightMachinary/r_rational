So the Talos Principle is a puzzle game from a few years ago where the player character is an AI (hopefully an AGI) in the final stages of its development. While the gameplay itself isn't really anything special beyond some really great puzzles, the game's story and characters are all pretty interesting. Very little of the philosophical ground and concepts in AI development will be new to people, but here I think it's still worth checking out for a pretty solid story that focuses on the interaction between the three main AI characters, as well as all the little background details and lore like the audio logs from the Lead AI Researcher and the messages left behind by other AI.

** If you do want to watch an LP, I highly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kL6tclhB0&list=PLN9s4vA_ONwAN8v3nAFNv4WdRdkg2b5Jv][Dan Burns' (CannibalK9) Let's Play]] of this game. He shows every bit of text and lore in the game, and provides quite high-level commentary and context throughout. Semi-scripted, and pretty funny at times. On top of that, he completes every single puzzle in addition to finding every easter egg.

** Personally I didn't think the story was particularly interesting, being just a retelling of The Garden of Eden with some Tower of Babel and some scifi elements we should all be familiar with mixed in, and the characters stuck pretty closely to those archetypes with little character development up to the point I stopped playing. The puzzles were pretty fun though.

*** It definitely gets more interesting towards the end, and the DLC is even better, but it's hard to explain why without spoiling anything.

** The story didn't really have much punch till right at the end... Let's just say it presents you with a certain kind of transcendent beauty that might be rather fresh to an AI safety ideologue.
