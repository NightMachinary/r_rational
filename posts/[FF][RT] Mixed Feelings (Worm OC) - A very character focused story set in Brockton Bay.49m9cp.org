** Oh shit. This is brutal. This makes Wildbow look like J.K. flippin Rowling. The protagonist starts in a horrible situation, with no possible escape and no hope for a better future.

The thing is, it's not just very, very intense abuse we're shown. It's vicious. The protagonist's father has years of experience at abusing and manipulating people, and it shows. What we can see is /optimized/ abuse, horrible, relentless, and creative both in the physical and the psychological department.

Seriously, I have caught up to the current last chapter, and I'm feeling awful. This is really well written. I don't think the author is going for Wildbow-style escalation of awfulness, and I think that Astrid's situation will get better. I hope. Please?

**** Well, yeah, but that very fact is kind of a spoiler, so I didn't want to put it in the top comment. Also, yeah. When Leviathan comes, Astrid will probably be like "heck yeah, something I don't have to talk to before or after I beat it up" :p

** Stumbled across this on [[/r/WormFanfic]], lost an entire afternoon catching up to the most recent chapter, and am shocked it's not more popular. Seriously great writing. Like 9.5/10, and the -.5 is just because /it's not finished yet and I'm impatient./

Fair Warning: Astrid's home life is /brutal and awful/, so if you're particularly sensitive to seeing teenage girls suffer physical and verbal abuse, you might want to sit this one out (as well as Worm fanfiction in general, actually). Seriously, the first arc's tone is not for the faint of heart.

However, Astrid is incredible, and I bet you guys would love her. She's clever, creative, driven, has (and is) struggling to maintain her rationality and morality in the face of strong external pressure to change (her father's a Nazi of some kind). Her powers are also a munchkin's wet dream - and are understandable and predictable within the actual science of chemistry and physics, rules the author seems to have gone into a great deal of effort to get right.

In that regard, character and wordlbuilding is astounding as well. The military-esque protocols and attitudes feel incredibly genuine (which may not mean much from someone with little actual experience/knowledge of military), but the author seems to go out of her way to make sure the features of the setting are actually deep and connected.

Oh, and it has updated with ~10k word chapters every 3 days /or more/ since it started in Feb. No idea if such a pace will be maintainable in the long run, but so far it seems so. And that outpaces just about any other serial fiction I think I've ever read.

Watching how Astrid copes and thinks and works through that suffering, though? Much more palatable than just witnessing it happen. And that's definitely where she begins to really shine as a character.

****** This may be just my opinion, but I think it is because people who experience abuse don't, or rather cant see themselves as the logically and obviously stronger.

This can be seen in some examples of parental abuse that go on even into adulthood, or even those situations when males in relationship are abused by females who aren't strong or even big as the males.

Psychology plays a big part in abuse, so I think that's whats going on here.

But to SPOIL the plot a little SPOILERS!!!(Astrid does get angrier and eventually fights back her abusers, either due to realization of her powers, or by shard mental manipulation)SPOILERS OVER!!!

I feel like I should read this because it's so well written, but because of that it's just physically unpleasant to read. The things it's describing are uncomfortable and harsh. And it doesn't start off easy, let you get attached and then ramp it up, no you get dropped in right away.

Because of all that, despite it's probably literary worth, I just don't feel like putting myself through that.

** I'm writing this as I read, for myself mostly.

This is the most paranoid person I've ever read, awesome. I am enjoying the dramatic irony of the first chapter where we get to see her emotions and her attempts to conceal those emotions from /Gallant/ of all people. I guess she wasn't paranoid enough, if she didn't consider the possibility he was getting a direct line into her brain. Hahahahahaha.

Also, judging by her reaction to the iron, she might counter the hell out of Kaiser.

As a hero, Gallant has encountered abused people before, I would imagine. So, he might plausibly know exactly what is going on.

#+begin_quote
  Dad's lips thinned, his eyes glinting coldly as he tightened his grip on my shoulders; fingers digging in hard enough to leave bruises.
#+end_quote

He's not a very skilled abuser, is he? The author should have said "almost hard enough" in my opinion. As it is, I don't see how he's going to continue to get away with this for longer than one minute. I had been assuming up until this point that he would have to be very smart and skilled at emotional manipulation, but I don't see how he can be smart if he's choosing to leave bruises right now or undisciplined enough to not notice that this would be a mistake. Surely it should be on his radar that the heroes might have found her, right? The possibility of them doing a follow-up seems obvious.

The military references might mean that he works with a foreign government and has access to powers somehow. Otherwise, I don't see any possibility for a realistic protracted conflict here.

A gang, huh? I don't see how that can work unless this gets pretty AU with lots of new capes.

I am having a hard time getting inside the mindset of the Dad. I don't understand people like that. Obviously, but let me be more specific. To me, there is sometimes more power in creation than destruction, because it is harder and thus rarer. A good soldier is not a soldier who is so terrified she can't even think. An effective military unit would communicate frankly, and the free exchange of information would be incentivized rather than penalized. Dad calls her weak, but all the aspects of her weaknesses that I see are of his own making. Is he brain damaged somehow? I think that is true of people like that, literally, but even that still seems inadequate to help me understand him. Even blind people can understand that others see shapes and colors. So why can't psychopaths, adrenaline junkies, and control freaks grok the concept that their ways are not always the best ways to achieve even twisted desires like their own?

Also, fuck Gallant for being so hands off in a situation like this. I choose to blame everything that goes wrong on Gallant, as the only person who is reasonable and understandable enough that I can consider him a human being. Gallant is literally the worst hero ever. Worse than Scion, or Armsmaster even.

  Ignoring Lance completely, I focused all of my attention on the delicious, delicious bacon roll. (Protein, gluten, starch, sugar, fat, salt, various elements and minerals... Wow, gluten was really elastic. I bet it would be fun to play with.)

She would be almost a tenth as scary as Panacea could be, with a differently oriented training, I think. I wonder if she can create simple biological materials. Or a poison of some sort. Knockout gas? It seems her power can't manipulate gases or liquids, but that is potentially different than turning a solid into a gas or liquid. Or she could use mundane means in combination with her powers.

I hope she chokes her father to death. I'm really mad.

  Pain flared in my scalp as my head was jerked backwards. He'd grabbed hold of my ponytail, I realised, and even amidst the fog of fear and fury that shrouded my thoughts, I couldn't help a distant flare of vindication. (I knew long hair was a bad idea in a fight. I fucking knew it.) A sharp blow to the kidneys made my knees buckle, but I loosed my grip on my power, just a little, support lines lashing out ahead to keep me upright. My neck felt like it was about to snap like a twig, but both it and my lines held. Bracing myself, I flicked out a hair-thin cutting wire as I pulled my head as far forward as I could. My scalp burned, but that didn't matter one bit. What did matter was that my hair stretched taut between my scalp and Dad's fingers, giving me space to slice the wire through.

  (Pretty fucking extreme way to get a haircut, I couldn't help thinking, with a certain bleak humour.)
#+end_quote

That's badass. She should also consider using her own hair as a weapon. Maybe at some point she'll lop off her own arm and use it as a club.

I wonder if she could make or use magnets somehow. They might give her some kind of limited macrokinesis. Might also help with her electricity block. Then again, her electricity block might apply to magnets instead.

I like the suggestion of one of the commenters to call her father The Thing. His power is like a mix of The Thing and Mr. Fantastic's from the fantastic four, I think. He's basically an immortal rubber rock human shaped object. You could still suffocate him though, I expect. Maybe he wants her to kill him and that's why he is teaching her suffocation techniques? Or he wants her to realize that suffocation techniques would be a useful part of her arsenal.

If I were her, I would be hoarding rare and precious useful metals, hiding them inconspiciously on my person. Can she make things denser?

  “They took your mother from me,” he said, quietly. “I'll be damned if I let them take you, too. No matter what lengths I have to go to to make sure that you can protect yourself.”
#+end_quote

Okay, so her mom is probably Purity then? 1. She is blonde and tall. 2. Her daughter's name is Astrid. 3. Racism. 4. Somebody, possibly the Empire, took the mother away from Dad. If so, this would explain why he doesn't want to work with them. I'm not sure if the mother and her Dad ever even had a thing, though, or if he was just a creepy background lurker who somehow stole her daughter.

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't going to kill those people. Of course I wasn't. I couldn't. More importantly, I wouldn't. It was... It was wrong. They hadn't done anything. They weren't hurting anyone. They were just living their lives, going about their business, trying to do the best they could in this sorry little scabrous shithole of a town. They didn't deserve this. It wasn't their fault that there were people out there that hated them just because of the colour of their skin.

  It wasn't their fault that Dad was a fucking nazi!

Here is an alternative!: Go kill Kaiser right away, instead of doing your Dad's plan.

#+begin_quote
  Oh God. I was really doing this, wasn't I? I was running. Again.
#+end_quote

Take Lance with you! You will regret not taking him so much...........

If I were her, and I joined the Wards, I would shave my head as symbolic protest.

I wonder if her Mom, whoever she is, was actually a totally awful person. Maybe worse than her father. She seems to idolize her mother very much, and it might hurt her a lot to find out the true details.

Gallant's powers would be so awesome to have. Actually understanding people, perfectly empathizing with them. It would suck to experience their negative emotions, sure, but the pragmatic awesomeness would be awesome. Literally perfect social intelligence.

Gallant seems kind of shady to me now for not disclosing to this obviously paranoid girl that he can read her emotions.

Hopefully, she gets to talk with Yamada eventually.

#+begin_quote
  “If you say so,” Gallant murmured, sounding a little disconcerted. He took a breath. “I was wondering,” he said. “Would you like to meet some of the other Wards? I know at least a couple of them are around at the moment, so I was thinking I could introduce you. I mean, I'd have to check with them first, but I'm pretty sure they'd be interested in meeting a potential new team mate.”

Oh God, is she going to be best friends with Shadow Stalker?

He was similarly abused by his own father. He does not perceive it as abuse (and neither do Astrid or Lance). Just tough-love child-raising that has made him strong. He's merely reproducing the same pattern (with an extra layer of awfulness because his children must also grow into tools for the Mission). Why wouldn't he? He knows how to do it and he knows it works.

This is how real-life abuse works, unfortunately.

Lance is probably going to grow into the same kind of parent, and Astrid partially so (well, she would've if she hadn't been yanked off that path; now hopefully she'll learn new norms).

** This was a great read; eagerly waiting for updates.

This is much like /Brutal Harry/ that was shared in this sub recently, except a billion times better written.

Now I know it's not a fluke: I really enjoy the "abused fish out of water" scenario. Possibly because you know they're going to /keep being pleasantly surprised/, over and over again, and that is just so adorable (though Astrid would hate me for saying that). It's hard to be so pessimistic that you routinely undershoot reality, they say...
