*** Oh... The Sovereign Gate is a computer!

This is all a computer simulation.

Sovereign gate has this fancy AI that your soul can hook into. Then it simulates the world, but it can't handle simulating gods or stuff.

User gets better at magic, because it interacts with the admins soul and magical power is about information, which the soul can get there, and the computer is so fast multiple time loops can happen instantly until it runs out of power.

The computer can simulate souls and hook any real soul to a simulated soul, which is how Zorian got there. It can also save the data back to the real soul, which is what Z&Z are trying to do.

Probably not the first to think about this. There was the talk about ADMIN keys and stuff after all, when they touched the gate.

Time looping really is impossible. But they bypassed that by having blazing fast virtual reality that can feed you back what you learned.

That's also how the black room operates. It's just very very slow compared to that and the area is very very limited.

EDIT: black room can't operate like that, could be real time magic, but is probably a trick of some kind as it's closed off the world for the time.

**** Essentially, what you're saying is . . .

The sovereign gate is an elaborate illusion, and by illusion, I mean a magical and purely graphic/haptic interface that models the world---a literal computer simulation.

Rather than rebuilding the world atom-for-atom, it just models the world graphically/hapticly. This approach would require significantly less mana to do, especially because the area you would need to time dilate would not need to be bigger than a freaking laundry closet.

The marked soul would /feel/ like it's interacting with real stuff, thus giving realistic training for a fraction of the mana cost.

Yes, and magical power is just data in the soul. They probably didn't know enough about soul to just tweak some numbers with "hexedit", so they simulated the thing instead. Like we can't just code AI that is good at playing Go, but we had to show it games and make it learn instead.

In fact, as a rule, knowledge may be too complex to efficiently upload into someone's mind wholesale. Running a computer or a person through a speed simulation may be, surprisingly (or unsurprisingly, giving the current state of machine learning), the best way of assimilating knowledge.

**** oh, and probably the strongest evidence to contradict a simulation is the one month limit. the Guardian has stated that the whole reason one month was set is because mass killing of souls is unethical but killing a copy is tolerable. one month is within tolerance of a copy soul being "the same" as the original as there's not enough divergence to claim they're different. but if it's all a simulation, none of the simulated souls are actual, real souls. then there should be no ethical issues at all in wiping it out, is there?

Turning it off is equivalent, or at least is nearly equivalent, to killing a person, and that should give us just as much pause.

I'm glad this theory was proposed and explored by you guys. It led to some interesting places.

1. souls can be differentiated if souls really are records for the gods

2. souls can be checked for dmg. there's many different things that imply such, with soul bonding, soul magic/sight, soul scans, etc.

Sure, some magic could check for some damage. Maybe it /does/ have some of that, but not enough of that has happened?

But as I said, not saving simply wouldn't be enough. If Zorian went through the loop without remembering last one, it would be just like the last one. Except ofc for the fact that there are other loopers now.

The thing is, the maker of the loop didn't probably mean the thing for reckless shit like taking on liches. There is no reason you should have such soul damage. It's not developed with ultimate security in mind and everything thought out, we know that already.

The one real mistake on my text was the black rooms, might be real time magic there, they do use the food and stuff they take there.

We can still answer your question about updating the original, though, because that's what Zorian will have to do: The pre-loop soul is thrown out and the new one replaces it. Or if Zorian can physically leave the loop, he also has the awkward option of just letting pre-loop Zorian live.

In the end the original gets overwritten by the version that has learned stuff. Why would it go agaimst something? Updating parts would imply enough knowledge, that's why it is total.

edit: Just checking if the person is the same that came in isn't enough to check for damage. If you look for 100% match, you'll automatically fail. Learning makes changes to you. You aren't the same person you were a year ago. So you'd have to check for bigger differences. It wouldn't be exact enough I think.

************** as I said, I changed the question/counterpoint to your scenario with a different approach. so I wasn't referring to dmg check past my first comment

a swap would mean killing the original and putting the simulated into the original body and that is what's against the basis of the loop, thus this is probably not what you were going for.

and as I mentioned, there's ways to check for the identity of a soul even after changes. I was never asking for a 100% exact confirmation. hence why the marker works in the story and is pointless to copy but also doesn't backfire and reject the intended Controller one second later when the soul grows/changes. this identification process already exists

if the real soul is overwritten with the simulated soul, why even have this extra degree of separation? why not just send in the real soul (which basically makes your computer simulation scenario effectively the same as the story's current hypothesized scenario)? as you mentioned, the loop wasn't built with ultimate safety in mind nor (in your opinion) made with fighting OP liches in mind so it shouldn't be an issue. you could say it's for that safety in the off chance that the soul is dmged too greatly, the loop can abort with 0 changes to the real soul (ALL progress aborted) but eh. as you mentioned, it's pointless to revert to a previous copy of the simulated soul since it'll just repeat so an abort is the only option in that case

and imo, if the Creator is at a good enough lvl with soul magic to overwrite souls, he's capable of identifying souls

It kinda is... If content of the soul is just information, there should not be a problem with 1:1 rewrite of the information in the soul. So there should not be a problem with a rewrite that is like the original, but has learned stuff either. It doesn't swap the soul, it swaps the contents. The devil is in the details I guess. It's also possible that soul is not 100% information, but the relevant parts are and that's what is used here so that not whole soul gets rewritten. Ofc one can argue there are ethical problems.

Because you can not. It's a computer. It can't handle souls. It can communicate with them and can handle information. It gets the information from the souls and plays with them and can then output the information back to the souls.

**************** I guess you just assumed that the simulated soul can't physically leave the loop at all since the simulation is just that. a simulation and thus not real. but still, I obviously didn't mean a data swap? first, the process you described is effectively the same as overwriting except with the added action of rewriting the simulated soul to become what the real soul originally was. what's the point of that added step? plus I already explained what I meant explicitly. physically switching the positions of the simulated soul and the real soul. so the simulated soul now resides in the real body while the real soul is in simulated loop (and thus wiped/killed)

the soul is also not just information. there's life force/mana and there's also production of and processing of mana. and this last part is also an important part that grows

let's take another approach to your computer scenario. let's take it to the logical extreme. if the simulated is not real at all, then there's absolutely and utterly no way for loop!Zorian to escape at all. ever. his only option is to overwrite Zach's soul but that'd require sacrificing Zach.

the other extreme. if it's all a pure computer simulation, then to some extent the computer must be performing all calculations for every action. in that case, it should be quite simple to rewind to the exact moment before any and all soul dmg. at the very least, it'd be easy/obvious to include this function: if the soul takes too much dmg, record time into loop this occurs. reload the soul from the start of the loop. allow soul to repeat exact loop up to point where they suffered soul dmg. force restart early right before the time recorded

why's identifying souls important? that was what I was arguing for the whole time and you were denying the whole time. the marker currently always identifies its host soul to check if it should be working. so there's already no denying that the Creator (or the computer in your scenario) can identify souls. and I was arguing it'd be safer and more foolproof to compare the real soul to the host soul rather than simply checking the host soul

Backing up the previous loop's copy of Zach's soul to use as a replacement in case of soul damage would be entirely feasible.

However, rewinding is more complicated. This depends on how the simulation is run. It's more likely that a simulation as complex as this is inherently chaotic and cannot be rewound.

And if the simulation throws away information from previous loops except for information belonging to marked "souls" (garbage collection in programming terms, which saves memory usage), then rewinding would be impossible even if the simulation were deterministic.

  and imo, if the Creator is at a good enough lvl with soul magic to overwrite souls, he's capable of identifying souls
#+end_quote

I disagree with this. From the perspective of programming, overwriting data couldn't be simpler. I'll use Python for the sake of simplicity:

#+begin_example
  # The state of pre-loop Zach.
  zach = {pre-loop data}

  # Overwrite with new Zach.
  zach = {post-loop data}
#+end_example

Marking data as having or not having a tag is also very simple:

#+begin_example
  # Give Zorian the marker.
  zorian["isController"] = True

  # Zorian pings Sovereign Gate.
  if zorian["isController"]:
    giveAccessTo(zorian)
#+end_example

However, identification of a complex piece of data can be a very involved process. Often times you have to store an entire copy of the data in question, so you'd have to basically have a template Zach lying around to check against anyone claiming to be Zach. And then to perform that check, you'd have to take /every aspect/ of your Zach template and check it against /every aspect/ of the person claiming to be Zach, one aspect at a time, until either a discrepancy is reached or you've checked the entirety of the Zach template against the person who claims to be Zach.

#+begin_example
  # Make template.
  zachTemplate = zach

  # Compare each in Zach...
  for eachX in zachTemplate:

    # ...against each in Zorian.
    for eachY in zorian:

      if eachX == eachY:
        sameSoul = True
      else:
        sameSoul = False

  if sameSoul:
    giveAccessTo(zorian)
#+end_example

It's eight lines of code compared to two lines of code in the previous example. However, considering how much information is stored in a soul, those eight lines of code represent innumerable checks as each aspect of a soul is checked against each aspect of the template. Compare that with a tag that can be examined with a single check!

And then, even the above algorithm wouldn't be appropriate to check a soul's identity because Zach's soul is supposed to change and develop over the course of the loop. So instead, the developer of the Sovereign Gate would have to think very hard about what aspects of a person's soul are unique and immutable.

If the soul has an immutable ID number, then the check is easy, but soul ID numbers are unlikely. Souls were created by sentient beings, and recognition of a unique individual is not very difficult for sentient beings. You said earlier that we can easily recognize a person even if they've aged, so there's no reason for the gods to have stamped every soul with an ID number. However, how do you teach a programmed spell to repeat that trick? It takes sophisticated software to identify a person. Can you articulate clearly what makes so-and-so unique in a way that a program can easily check?

This kind of recognition is a major difficulty in computer science and has been in the works for decades---and you're asking a spell to do this in a world where magic can change so many aspects of a person's identity.

Even in philosophy, these are serious and complex questions without easy answers: What makes you who you are? Is the person you are now the same person who existed a second ago or a month ago or ten years ago? In philosophy, a well-supported and popular answer to that last question is, "No, past you and present you are not the same person. You are two people who are similar, share many properties, but are different in important ways."

Compare that rabbit hole with the straightforward process of attaching a marker to a person's soul. And in Mother of Learning, there are many instances where a ward needs to identify whether someone is friend or foe, and this is always done by attaching a marker to the person, either as a physical object or as a mark on the soul, which is much easier than grappling with the complex topic of the Philosophy of Self.

Yes, indeed some drone strikes are now carried out by physical recognition. But it took decades and a large army of researchers to figure that out and it's still imperfect---and in this magical setting, the recognition would involve deep, deep soul probes to make complicated equivalency judgments based on complex criteria.

Compare that with attaching a soul marker, which might take a master soul mage a few seconds to do. In fact, Zorian casually alludes to the process when thinking about how Sudomir grants entry to his mansion.

Strangely enough, that assumption may be incorrect. From a programming perspective, there's a stark difference between checking that something exists versus counting how many of something there are, then checking if the number is valid.

Checking for existence:

#+begin_example
  if zorian["isController"]:
    giveAccessTo(zorian)

Checking for existence, counting, and comparing if the number is acceptable:

    controllerCounter += 1

  if controllerCounter == 1:
    giveAccessTo(zorian)

If the Maker did not expect the possibility of multiple controllers, then, as strange as it sounds, there's no reason to believe the Gate has a way of dealing with that issue.

It really makes one appreciate the inner workings of the mind and our ability to deal with unforeseen problems on the fly. Simple control algorithms can only do precisely what they are told to do, so dealing even simple departures from the norm require foresight and tailored error handling subroutines.

#+end_quote

Are you saying that hundreds or thousands of computer programmers with years, even decades of experience working on a problem over the course of decades are equivalent to one or even a small group of soul mages working in secret?

Remember too that face recognition is an incredibly simple problem when compared against soul recognition, as souls are even more complex.

And on top of that, soul recognition isn't the point of the Sovereign Gate. The point is to accomplish the unbelievable feat of recreating an entire planet in all its detail, recreate all the bodies, all the souls, store it in a pocket dimension, temporally accelerate that dimension by a factor of . . . what's 1000 years / 1 second? About /ten billion/. And then destroy and recreate the world and everything hundreds or thousands of times. That's already super difficult.

Then, add the difficult feat of soul recognition, which would be significantly more complex than facial recognition, which was already very difficulty. I see no reason to go to all that trouble to prevent an edge case scenario of the controller encountering an enemy that would mangle the controller's soul in a very specific way, especially when putting a little marker on a soul is so much simpler and accomplishes the task more efficiently, except in certain extreme and possibly unforeseen cases.

To top it off, in normal circumstances, the controller would be well-trained in basic soul magic to begin with---which would not only allow the controller to access the switches on the marker as a fail-safe, but would also give the controller basic soul defenses. Not only that, but we already know that the loop resets if it senses Zach's soul getting tampered with---but in the case of QI's fateful spell, that fail-safe did not occur quickly enough.

It seems to me that the Maker put a decent number of safe guards in place. This is just a very strange scenario where Zach (if he actually is the original controller) was unexpectedly ill-prepared to use the Sovereign Gate.

What's more is that the Maker had the good sense of not allowing the loop to collapse if a controller exited. It's possible that the program instead checks if a controller exists inside the loop before collapsing everything. In this sense, the Gate may be working perfectly: Although soul shenanigans happened, the controller(s) are still alive within the loop and are able to try to find the Keys or maybe some other way out.

Also, I believe the Sovereign Gate is over a thousand years old. In that time, maybe some exotic spells were created that the Maker did not anticipate. We can't expect a piece of hardware to account for all subsequent advances a thousand or more years down the line; even with all our technology, we can barely account for the advances of the next five or ten years.

******************** then at least answer this. how does the marker know its host soul is the Controller? it has to identify the soul somehow and said soul is also changing and growing. I already pointed to a problem with a marker that grows with the soul since Zorian and Zach's marker would diverge enough that the ritual to find said marker should've failed to find Zach's.

also, at this point in time, since we really don't have the information to conclude definitively, that you think soul identification is difficult is only a conjecture/your opinion. what makes you think souls are so unidentifiable? just because they're complex? you do not know if souls have anything that would be usable as a unique identifier. there's nothing that says each soul can't have a unique, unchanging portion that the marker (or any soul sight/scan) can't use to identify souls. souls are also aren't so complex that they can't be understood at all either. otherwise soul scans wouldn't be possible and identifying foreign soul matter would also be impossible. I believe identifying souls is roughly at the same lvl of difficulty as facial recognition. heck, Zorian can recognize different minds, including differentiating individuals of foreign species and I'm sure we can both agree the mind is very complex

putting things another way. if the gods created souls to be used as records, why wouldn't they build in a method of identification?

and yes, I'd say that the mage(s) is equivalent or surpasses that of our world's programmers. they are vaaaaaastly powerful. the marker is way too sophisticated for anything less than very indepth knowledge and understanding of souls. who's to say they didn't have as much time either? the more difficult/powerful the looping process and the more powerful/resourceful the Maker, the more likely the Maker is able to do something like identifying souls imo

in any case, there's a glaring contradiction with the theory that the loop is a simulation. if nothing in the simulation's real then there's no ethical issue with wiping everything and no reason to set a 1 month limit on loops

The marker wouldn't need to know the host soul is the controller. For example, say I have a shirt and I attach a tag to it that has "Controller" written on it, I can do a lot of things, drastic things, to change that shirt---paint it, sew new things on it, cut it down to be a rag---and the tag will still be attached as long as I didn't alter the part of the cloth where the tag is attached.

That's a physical metaphor, but in programming, there are a few different ways to create data structures that work in the same way. To avoid going into too much detail, here are some terms you can Google if you want to know more: "Python" and then one of the following---lists, dictionaries, objects. The first two are pretty straightforward to understand, whereas objects are a complex topic.

#+end_quote

You're right, it's somewhat conjecture, but it's also an educated guess based on observation of how the Guardian has been portrayed, but I'll get to that. First i want to clarify that I don't mean to say that souls are unrecognizable. I believe that it depends on who/what is doing the recognizing.

For example, I'm assuming that for sentient beings that can perceive souls well enough, identifying a soul is as easy as recognizing a face. This means that since the gods are sentient and would be able to easily recognize a soul, they wouldn't need something like an ID number to identify a unique or matching souls. On the other hand, maybe gods are so beyond us that we all look the same, so an identifier /would/ be useful. What's more, an ID number might also make the mass storage of souls in some kind of afterlife databank more organized and easier to work with---like an indexing system used by a library.

So, that's recognizability for sentient beings. However, recognition for [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI][weak artificial intelligence]]---like what we've seen of the Guardian---is another matter. The statements I am making about how markers work is based on the observation that the Guardian---at least for the actions we've seen it do---does not seem to be able to distinguish between souls. On the contrary, it seems like it only responds to the presence of the marker. This inability to distinguish between souls is why the loop was able to accidentally include more than one Controller. It seems to me that the mark is all that is being looked at when determining who is allowed to loop and who is allowed to access the basic functions of the Sovereign Gate. Otherwise, why did the Sovereign Gate allow a second and third person, both of whom have different souls from the original Controller, to enter the loop? Because of this, if souls do have unique IDs, at the very least we know that the Sovereign Gate is not looking or is unable to look at these IDs to determine who loops and who can use the Gate.

I'm also not saying that the Sovereign Gate is totally unable to recognize souls or their IDs---I'm just saying that it isn't recognizing that information to perform the functions we've seen so far. Maybe when presented with the Keys, higher functions become available and some of those functions can recognize souls. However, the functions we have seen so far seem to operate merely on the presence or absence of a controller marker---probably because the process of attaching and checking for a marker is faster and simpler.

On that note, the SoulKill spell seems to place a "Do not copy" marker on souls.

Well, we can both agree that astoundingly complex things can be examined, recognized, and understood at least in part.

The body is very complex, but I can tell if someone is bleeding, is missing an eye, has a pulse, etc.

But my mind is doing the recognition. My mind is an incredibly complex machine with astoundingly powerful pattern recognition and simulation software, i.e. imagination, running on it.

So, Zorian might be able to recognize a mind, but that kind of capability is /really/ hard to give to an object. It takes a lot of programming---programming that would allow the Sovereign Gate to recognize that two or more souls all have been incorrectly marked as Controllers. The Sovereign Gate doesn't seem to be able to figure that out, so I don't think it has same recognition software as a person.

********************** we've already agreed that the Guardian doesn't do what it wasn't programmed to do even if a sentient person would be able to do very easily. so just because the Guardian refuses to acknowledge that there are in fact 2 Controllers (via soul check) in front of him doesn't mean he is incapable of doing so if programmed for it (the major question is if it's possible to program this rather than if the Guardian is programmed with this). just as you agreed that the Guardian can't necessarily be able to check that there are indeed 2 Markers present. the marker is definitely checkable but the Guardian simply wasn't programmed to check that (just defaults to its knowledge that there is only 1 and thus doesn't bother checking). thus, just because it hasn't shown to do so doesn't mean it can't do so.

if we're following the analogy that we can identify faces (even partially obscured) and we've been able to program AIs that can do the same (arguably better than us), and that soul recognition by sentient beings (including humans, not just gods) is comparably easy to us identifying faces, I've already argued that they can make something that can identify souls via AI as well. pretty sure the looping mechanism has way more than enough processing power for that

maybe the Guardian indeed does not have the programming to identify souls. that doesn't matter. I've been putting the onus of identification on the marker anyways since that's the thing that has shown the possibility of having soul identification built in (and the main question is, how difficult is it to identify souls rather than can the Guardian do so). in the case of the marker locking down a portion of the soul, that has a few issues. it's very susceptible to failing if that portion is ever dmged. so if a soul attack happened or if an experiment on self (enhancements rituals) fail badly, you just killed the loop. there's also the case of Zorian's copy of the marker. we can assume one of two methods this happened. the two souls mixed a bit before separating (think dissolved) or portions of their souls were spliced. for Zorian's marker not to reject him, he'd have to have a soul portion equivalent to the locked portion in Zach's. however, in the former case, that portion of Zach's soul would have to mix with Zorians and thus would have changed, thus should make the marker invalid. in the latter, Zorian would now have the locked soul portion and should be the only one looping. since this is the case, I'll assert that the marker is identifying the soul holistically

**** I don't think that it's clear yet whether or not the primordial and its prison are duplicated by the loop.

Presumably other pocket dimension contents, like Silverlake's house, are cloned. Things would get pretty weird otherwise (eg entering and leaving the temporal acceleration). And there's no indication that her comings and goings are treated as a loop breach, so presumably they are considered to be part of the loop.

We can presume that the Maker knew lots about the primordials and their prisons. So it's possible that they have special rules. And if there are special rules to keep primordials contained, then that means primordials are a threat to even a pocket dimension. Which tends to support the idea that the Maker would /not/ have the Gate create thousands of copies of them and then attempt to dispose of them each time; instead, it would just continue the strategy of keeping them contained, by destroying the pocket universe and thus the bridge when there is a danger of escape.

But it's only speculation.

Actually, we can't presume that. The Maker clearly didn't even have a solid grounding in soul magic. We can tell this because the Sovereign Gate's UI has no idea how to deal with multiple Controllers, and seems to think that having multiple controllers is impossible. At the very least, the Maker didn't know about the soul fusing curse. Even though they were capable of creating a hereditary soul marker for controlling the gate, they didn't know that it would be possible to use mechanics in the loop to bug the system and didn't bother creating any contingencies for them.

This is why I think it's more likely that the Maker just made the gate force end the loop because they didn't know what else to do about that kind of disaster. They didn't know how to re-bind a Primordial, and since they were already creating and destroying a massive pocket dimension anyway, why not just push the ultimate panic button? It's the simplest solution when you don't know what else to do.

Seriously? Every soul mage who has taken a look at the soul marker was awed at how well crafted it was. The loop has mechanisms for detection of soul damage (to the point where wrenching it out of the controller's body is enough to trigger it) and it did protect Zach from damage by the soul meld. The addition of Zorian to the loop was a fluke that is most likely irreproducible, and the Guardian not understanding the presence of more than one controller just shows that the Maker was a little too confident in their knowledge of soul magic and was certain that there couldn't be two controllers.

The system has failed not once, but twice, in the same loop instance. Obviously when Zorian was permanently included, but also when Veyers managed to escape without ending the looping. If two such errors, both of which should have been impossible according to the Maker's understanding of magic, happened in the same loop instance, what does that say about the relative frequency of errors in the loop, especially when one considers that a fully charged loop should last hundreds of subjective years?

The thing which created the Gate was clearly far from omniscient, and made numerous errors in the process. This implies that they were mortal, in my mind. If they were a god, they weren't the kind of deity I'd be interested in worshipping.

Like Zorian said, the mechanism of the loop was created following some assumptions that simply are true anymore. The gate hadn't been activated for several cycles, according to the Serpent, so it's possible the maker decided it shouldn't be used anymore because human magic had advanced to the point where they could breach it, but also didn't bother to remove or destroy the Gate. We don't know why the Gods went silent, maybe the majority of them decided it was time to leave mortals alone and overruled anyone who went "okay, let me just remove this incredibly powerful artifact that mortal magic might mess with in a few centuries".

***** These are very good points. I suppose if pocket dimensions weren't duplicated, Zorian and Zach could just exit the time loop via Silverlake's house. That would be far too convenient.

Since this is the case, I'm very unclear on what Zorian's logic is re:Primordial prisons. Perhaps he also thinks primordial prisons are somehow exceptional when it comes to pocket dimensions within the loop. Maybe the reason why the loop automatically terminates when the primordial is summoned is because the gods can't actually destroy a world with a primordial in it (since this would involve destroying the primordial, which they apparently can't do). Successfully letting a primordial into the copy world might stop the looping mechanism altogether.

The real world is the bubble A. The loop is a separate bubble B, that connects to bubble A at one point..

Pocket dimensions are tiny bubbles attached to their main bubble. Non-loop pocket dimensions are A1, A2, etc. Loop pocket dimensions are B1, etc. These tiny bubbles only interface with one main dimension, so only one speed of time needs to be observed.

However, a primordial's dimension interfaces with both the non-loop and loop dimensions. Thus, when the primordial's dimension is accessed, the sovereign gate senses a new connection to the non-loop dimension and ends the loop to break that connection.

********* Er, I should have specified:

The prison would be an A-B bubble, as it intersects the temporal reference frames of both dimensions A and B.

Accessing any A-B-type dimensions would create a temporal conflict due to the time dilatation that would have to be reconciled between the normal and loop dimension.

However, this analogy may be incorrect if Zorian can successfully access the primordial's pocket dimension by wrapping it in a second pocket dimension:

The sovereign gate restarted when the primordial summoning occurred---it has a fail-safe. If that fail-safe is indeed to prevent conflicting time references, then a loop pocket dimension B1 with a time dilatation of B that wraps around a primordial A-B dimension with a time dilatation of A would not bypass the fail-safe.

Wow, I feel like that explanation is going to be confusing to read. Sorry :P

If time dilatation conflicts are somehow not an issue for the sovereign gate, however, then my guess is that wrapping a primordial A-B dimension in a pocket dimension /should/ allow Zorian to tunnel into non-loop dimension relatively easily.

I say relatively easily because if Zorian learns how to wrap a primordial dimension in a secondary pocket dimension, then learns how to tunnel into the primordial dimension, then my guess is that tunneling into the non-loop dimension will already be a subset of what he learned.

Yes and no. Remember that, regardless of your skills, pocket dimensions only connect to others at specific points.

It could well be the case that tunnelling through the primordial's prison back into the real world requires more skill than passing through the direct connection located at the Sovereign Gate. However, if it allows Zorian to bypass the Gate security system, it's still worthwhile.

They're still trying to reach Silverlake, who is likely to have some impressive stuff to teach them if they can actually earn her respect. Depending on what pocket dimensions can do, they may or may not be fantastic tools for ambushes and "procurement" jobs.

Yeah, this seems sub-optimal. Cannonballs are meant to deliver heavy impacts to large, easily-hit targets. In this case, the target is highly agile and essentially immune to bludgeoning damage. We don't need a powerful impact, just contact.

All in all, I think that it's feasible to snipe QI. Both the gun and the bullet seem quite possible to construct, and if they can catch him with shields down, I don't think he'll be able to react fast enough. Consider the end of chapter 59, where Zorian spotted him just watching the battle; that would be an opening right there.

Yes, but cannonball is /larger/ than a bullet, and hence has way more area for spell formula. You can add some sort of guiding system to it too, whereas it would be simply too big for a bullet.

** Zorian should take the Bakora Gate activation ritual to some experts he knows.

The aranea have more practical experience with opening the Gate, but I doubt that they're soul magic specialists. Being secretive and lacking hands, they'd have an even harder time making soul sight potions than humans do, if they even know how, and their smaller natural mana reserves would make enhancements less affordable. So I suspect that none of them have soul sight.

Kael and/or Alanic may be able to offer some valuable advice about why the Gate activation ritual is so hit-and-miss, and how to fix it.

On the contrary; if they can quickly and reliably activate the Bakora gates with a single aranea, then they indeed have huge advantages over other webs, both military (logistics, communication) and economic (directly trading transportation services, or using it to efficiently trade other goods and services).

He can delete memories and fudge senses.

These abilities don't mean he implant memories wholesale like a movie. Remember how long it took him to learn how to interpret the memory packet? If I recall correctly, it wasn't merely hard to read the memory packet because it was given to him by an aranea. There was also the difficulty of successfully opening a memory packet without damaging the information.

And mind you, this took a lot of training for someone who had already spent years learning mind magic and is a natural mind mage to begin with.

I may be totally wrong and maybe he can implant movie-esque memories into people's heads, but I feel that's stretching it. And I should also mention that he had to train his kind to be able to store high-fidelity memories in the first place---which is not skill that even Zach seems to share.

I doubt so-and-so ritual master will be able to do all that, or would be happy with Zorian blatantly implanting memory packets in their mind. Anyone he hires is essentially a stranger.

But I hope I'm wrong about it because it would be very convenient for him to simply go around hiring prominent ritual specialists, implanting all their minds with a perfect memory of the Silent Adepts ritual.

Unrelated to this chapter, but I was wondering why Witches used things like enhancements if their cost is so high. It's possible the reason mind magic lowers Zorians mana reserves significantly is because enhancements don't inhibit the growth of the reserves. Since Zorian was young and had yet to grow it seemed like his reserves were below average, but if not for the mind magic ability it might have been closer to his brothers! That's maybe why he can cast expensive spells like the gate spell and keep simulacrums. It's so simple and obvious but I never thought of it like that until now...

For example, Zorian is magnitude 8; let's say that his mind magic costs him 2 points, so he would normally be 10. In that case, he'll eventually grow to 38 = (4 * 10) - 2, not 32 = 4 * (10 - 2). Although his increased magic missile skill makes it infeasible to measure that.

******** Maxing reserves doesn't seem to be difficult, just a slow matter of casting magic frequently for about 10-20 years.

Depending on the permanent enhancement type, (ritual vs blood magic?) it might be passed on to their descendants, and too high a mana cost would make them stillborn/inconceivable. Inherited abilities are at minimum cost, and acquired ones have varied efficiency compared to their actual cost. I'm guessing an inherently 2 cost ability might end up needing anywhere from 2.5-6 from the reserves if it is an acquired ability, with the higher end being it done badly. Actually, maybe blood magic is minimum cost too, I can't remember for sure and can't remember where exactly nobody103 mentioned these things. The wordpress page's comments?

There's also a risk of permanent soul damage, again depending on the quality of the enhancement ritual.

But I agree, Zach, and to a far lesser extent, Zorian would benefit from enhancement rituals, but I kinda doubt it will go down that route too much. It would be interesting if Zach decided he needed 40 or so improvements to up their success rate upon leaving the loop.

** Okay, I've had a day to mull over this chapter. Here are some thoughts:

*Immortal Eleven Theory*

#+begin_quote
  ...I heard there are people who gained great powers by binding the blood of primordials to themselves
#+end_quote

All this talk about the ancient blood of primordials has got me thinking. If the blood of Panaxeth can be used to give people shapeshifting abilities, what sort of properties do the bloods of other primordials have? In the worldbuilding blog [[/u/nobody103]] recently mentioned that the Immortal Eleven “are a group of eleven mages that created and drank a potion of eternal youth,” but he seemed reluctant to talk about them any further. I wonder if the basis for the Immortal Eleven's “potion” was actually the blood of another primordial (besides Panaxeth). Maybe when Zach and Zorian get around to visiting the other elementals, they will find that they are not the first humans seeking such information.

Maybe, if the other elementals are unwilling to further cooperate with humans, they end up seeking out the Immortal Eleven for the location of another prison?

This is, of course, all highly speculative.

*Primordial Prisons for Loop Escape*

After some discussion with people here, I think it's unlikely that the primordial prisons are duplicated in the copy world. They are instead anchored to both the real world and copy world simultaneously.

Some compelling evidence for this conclusion is that the gods (who presumably built the Sovereign Gate) seem incapable of destroying the primordials (which is why they're imprisoned). This is likely why the time loop is designed to terminate when a primordial is summoned. Destroying the copy world with a primordial roaming in it requires destroying the primordial in particular, which the gods (and by extension, the Gate) simply can't do. I think Zach and Zorian will need to be extra careful while investigating the prisons. I think tricking the Gate into allowing a primordial into the copy world could break the looping mechanism. This would be extra bad since if they're killed in this scenario, it's effectively game over for them.

*Second Date with Akoja*

I'm disappointed that [[/u/nobody103]] didn't talk about the followup date that Zorian agreed to so that he could “give her employment materials.” Everybody seems to have forgotten about it already...

I agree that the inability to kill the primordials may be the nail in the coffin---it's unlikely they and their pocket dimensions are created and destroyed every loop if killing them in the first place was impossible.

And I would very much like a follow-up on the dating life of Zorian's simulacra. I really love the character development chapters, although I believe the author is trying to balance the pacing, so it's always a hard call.

**** Ooh, this is an interesting idea.

The only mention of the Immortal Eleven in the story proper (so far as I can tell), is Taiven discussing Oganj in Chapter 16:

#+begin_quote
  And I heard he killed two of the Immortal Eleven too.
#+end_quote

This made me think that the Immortal Eleven were a well-known group, with public identities. This comment also directly followed Kael's anecdote of Oganj annihilating an army sent to subjugate him, which made me think that the two who died were attached to said army, and that the Immortal Eleven had government ties. This could be me reading too much into a passing comment though. It is more than possible that not all members of the Immortal Eleven revealed themselves to the public, or that Silverlake has multiple identities (likely).

I guess we'll just have to wait and see, presuming the story ends up incorporating them at all.

** So, the Bakura gates are simpler than thought. They basically just consist of spellcasters making a gate together like Zorian and his copy did to Koth. The spellcasters are probably artificial and can contact each other in some way, probably similar to the telepathic relays (bigger range?).

They work like phones and you need a phone number to contact another gate. The Aranae know the number, but not enough about how the machine works, so they are trying to input a phone number while wearing a boxing glove. Very hard to do, but it will succeed if you try often enough.

It surprises me that they need so much crystalised mana to open the gate. Wouldn't ancient mages want the gates to be built somewhere they could cheaply open them?

So, flight nullifies tremor sense and an overcharged sound dampening spell dulls hearing and the spider's air current sense. They're pre-battle buffs. If they make it harder for the spider to react to the situation (I grant you, that's an important "if"), then why not?

***** The problem I see here is that due to the grey hunter's superb magic sense it might be possible for the grey hunter to deem the area as a trap and thus remove itself from the area. Presumably the area under effect would be perfused with mana.

So in order to confuse it's physical senses by using magic you'd either have to have such a large area of effect that the grey hunter can't possibly escape in time or you'd have to overload its magic sense. Maybe the latter can be achieved by evaporating tons of crystallized mana.

So flash bangs in the form of extreme ambient mana perfusion, ground tremors, and turbulent air.

I think one thing Z&Z are overlooking is simple biology. Spiders are cold blooded and become less active in the cold. Even warm blooded animals don't function as well in the cold. Simply cast a large area of effect spell to lower the temperature such that the eggs are still intact but that biological reactions take longer to propagate. Think stiffer muscles, slower propagation of neuronal signals, etc.

Agreed, both the air sense and mana sense would be able to detect a dead zone.

And holding a large volume of air motionless seems to me like it would require quite a lot of energy. Air is about 1.2kg per cubic meter, so for a cylinder with 50m radius and 5m height (which is probably too small), you'd be holding nearly /50 tons/ of air. Against whatever internal and external pressures are acting on it. Sounds infeasible.

#+begin_quote

Freezing spells have indeed played an important role in the spider's defeat before. I suspect, however, that it's not as easy as that. Just lowering the overall temperature might slightly slow it down, but I don't know that it will make much difference while the spider is on the warpath. And directly targeting it is insanely hard, because Matrix-style dodging plus high magic resistance. The previous occasion that we know about, the spider was hit with a freezing spell after going berserk, meaning that it didn't try to dodge - but that happened because they already incinerated the eggs.

I know that Zorian was worried the Guardian would try to stop him looping or something. But remember, the Guardian is supposed to avoid killing diverged copies. It gets to turn a blind eye when the Controller chooses to include someone, but in this case, Zorian diverged because of the Guardian's own mistake (pulling him in with a damaged copy of the marker), so arguably it has a duty of care.

They cannot be taken off, though the simulacrum can don additional stuff on top of them. The items 'copied' by the spell are really only mimicked - they are cosmetic only, and do not possess any magic or inner workings that the originals had. Simulacrum guns and grenades will not fire, and magic items will no longer have their supernatural traits. So no, it would not give any false alarms to Zorian.

*** I'm not the author, but he has confirmed on his blog that yes, a lich could make a simulacrum - or, for that matter, a fully- functional second body. However, it would be very dangerous to do so, because the copy would have all of the necromantic skills and self-preservation instincts of the original, so it could and quite possibly would try to take over.

Zorian's simulacrum was homogenous despite giving the appearance of humanity. I'm guessing clothes are all part of the illusion. Although QI doesn't wear them anyway, just armor.

And I doubt that a homogenous ectoplasm construct could fool the marker into thinking it's a magical artifact.

** Chapter 54 thought:

The fact that collecting the 5 key pieces will un-bar the Gate seems odd. If the number one priority is to keep the loop contents from spilling out, and that's why the Gate was barred to begin with, why put in a back door that a Controller can easily bypass?

However, it makes more sense to me if we assume that this was never meant as a failsafe emergency exit at all. The loop was supposed to collapse when the Controller left. I think that what's actually happening is, the Keyholder is supposed to un-bar the Gate /for the next loop in 400 years' time/. And Zorian's question was simply, "How can we un-bar the Gate?"

If the Guardian had been sapient, it would have told ZZ, "You can't leave." But since it's not sapient, and since the fact that the Keyholder prepares for loop initiation is not restricted knowledge, the Guardian simply answered their question, inadvertently giving them a way to bypass its cardinal rule.
