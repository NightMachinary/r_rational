- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?

*** Standard [[/r/athiesm]] advise is to tell your parents you're an athiest at a dinner you paid for in a house you own.

If you are, or expect to be able to, relying on them for any kind of support, do not tell them, for it may disappear.

*** My experience may not be relevant to your situation, so forgive me if that's the case. I come from a Hindu background from India and my parents though moderately religious are also progressive/intellectual. So I met only with mild disagreement when I made my beliefs (or lack of) clear. Also, when I was growing up, identifying as an 'rationalist' was considered a valid political affiliation, believe it or not.

Anyway, it seems to me that among moderate communities, any opposition is more a fear of losing the way of life, than any threat the world views. (Obviously this is false for non-moderate families.). Based on your situation, it might help if you make it clear that you still support your community/way of life, and its only your perception of reality that has changed. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck.

If this is in D&D, you only have a limited amount of spells you can cast per day. I think you can fill in slots with lower-level spells, but still, this gives you only a few minutes of foresight a day. Although you can get the information from minutes in the future without actually casting those spells, but I'm not sure you can really recurse Instants like that.

*** The Paris attacks are not at all comparable to the drone assassinations.

ISIS /wants/ to kill as many innocent civilians as it can.

The US does not try to kill innocent civilians. The drone strikes aim to assassinate military fighters from the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and so forth. We may argue whether they are a good idea, but fundamentally they are not unjustified, given that they are targeted at fighters from groups who are waging war against the United States.

Innocent civilians do die in US operations, but this does not mean that those operations are comparable to what ISIS does in any moral or otherwise meaningful sense.

Intentions matter.

For example, you mention (in a comment below) the bombing of a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital -- the US admitted this was a mistake, apologized to MSF, and promised to hold members of its military accountable if an investigation finds this was anything more than an error (source: [[http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/07/us-afghanistan-attack-msf-idUSKCN0S10SX20151007#WeGo8tfDuhPql0SQ.97]] )

TLDR: in judging military actions, it is morally imperative to distinguish between actions which aim to kill as many civilians as possible (e.g., 9/11, Paris Attacks, London Subway bombings) and actions which only kill civilians as a by-product of attacks on military targets (e.g., US drone strikes).

Suppose person X shoots and kills person Y. Does it matter if X did it in self-defense, knowing or reasonably believing that Y was about to kill him if he did nothing? /Of course it does/. Any other answer here is too ridiculous to contemplate.

Thus the same action (X killing Y) could be either right or wrong depending on X's motive.

Second: like people, governments put out statements about their goals.

After the MSF catastrophe, the US apologized and vowed to investigate what happened and make changes in its operations so that this does not happen again.

After the Paris attacks, ISIS put out a statement saying this was only the beginning; going on to say, regarding that people of France, that "the scent of death will not leave their nostrils" provided several conditions continue to be met, one of which being that "they dare to curse our Prophet."

There is nothing difficult about comparing intentions here.

I don't think so. You haven't provided any argument, you're trying to reductio ad absurdum without showing the absurd part. What is absurd or ridiculous about ignoring intent? Self-defense vs aggression matters, but those are different in more than just intent. It is important to understand if force was used as a last resort to protect, or used to threaten and intimidate. I would not call this razor "intent" but rather "aggression." And if X kills Y in self-defense but Z is also killed as collateral damage, then you can see why a parent of Z would not really care about the intent of X.

Yes. And those government statements will always, 100% of the time, say they did not mean to cause harm to innocents. Since the statement is the same regardless of intent, professed intent provides you no knowledge of the actual intent. "Those drugs aren't mine officer" is not evidence, it's an excuse literally everyone uses, guilty and innocent, and should be ignored as such since it provides no information.

No. We judge motives based on actions *and* words.

As I've already pointed out, there is a stark difference when we look at the words.

Now let's look at actions.

If the US /wanted/ to kill a lot of civilians, it could create infinitely more devastation than the destruction of an MSF hospital.

See: Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

At the moment, the US has tremendous destructive capacity at its disposal -- and does not use it.

That tells you something about its motives.

Instead, it uses drone strikes that are targeted sufficiently narrowly to kill specific people:

[[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/09/reports-isil-leader-killed-drone/29900883/]]

[[http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/01/world/asia/pakistan-violence/]]

This should be enough information to demonstrate the truth of my initial statement, namely that drone strikes are in no way morally comparable to the Paris attacks. In the latter, ISIS sought to kill as many civilians as possible. In the former, the US did not. Rather, the drone strikes are aimed at military targets. This is not to deny that mistakes are occasionally made, e.g., the MSF hospital, that civilians are inevitably killed in warfare, and there is no suggestion here that the drone strikes are a good idea.

********** The fallacy in your argument is "because the US didn't cause maximal damage intentionally, it hasn't caused any damage intentionally." My argument is not that the US kills civilians intentionally, (though it does, see [[http://www.democracynow.org/][this interview]] with 4 ex-drone pilots) it's that the US simply doesn't care about the collateral damage it is causing. And that deaths from this are just as deathly as deaths from any other source. Incompetence and becoming comfortable with collateral damage is just as dangerous as intentionally killing.

[[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/obama-drone-war-isis-recruitment-tool-air-force-whistleblowers][Guardian article]] on the ex drone pilots.

[[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2515596-final-drone-letter.html][Their letter]] to Obama.

Additionally, there is much evidence to show that the US specifically armed, and armed proximately through Saudi Arabia, the rebels that eventually turned into ISIS. The policies the US has pursued in the region have created a vacuum and an impetus for young men to join ISIS. In the expanded moral context of the situation, this needs to be noticed, and these policies need to be stopped as they are creating more terrorists than they are killing.

"Mistakes were made" is a phrase that shirks any responsibility, and it's disgusting when used about intentionally bombing a civilian medical installation.

#+end_quote

This is either playing with words, or extremely confused from a moral standpoint. I will attempt to explain one last time.

It is a goal of ISIS to kill innocent people.

It is not a goal of the United States to kill innocent people.

This makes an enormous moral difference.

In particular, drone stroke are not at all comparable to the Paris attacks -- not in any moral or meaningful sense.

Now: innocent people do die in US military operations.

(More generally: innocent people die in all wars.)

The US knows this.

It conducts its operations anyway -- successfully killing leaders of ISIS and the Taliban in drone strikes.

Knowing that innocent people will die.

Nevertheless, this is *completely different* from when ISIS actions kill innocent people.

Because it is a goal of ISIS to slaughter.

Motives matter in morality.

Imagine you could kill the entire leadership of ISIS (say, the top ~50 people in the ISIS chain of command) with a bomb that would kill 50 innocent civilians along with them.

Would you?

I would.

I'm not sure how many people ISIS has killed -- but it is at least in the tens of thousands. The number of refugees it has created is many times that.

It will kill many more.

Being able to put a dent in that by killing its leadership is worth it.

In fact: I believe that killing the top 50 ISIS commanders along with 50 innocent civilians is an act that /saves lives/.

The number of innocent lives you would save by doing this (thus disorganizing ISIS if not crippling it) would likely far exceed 50.

The point: there is an enormous moral difference between attacks which have civilian deaths as a goal and attacks on military targets which also kill civilians.

Now about those drone pilots. No one disputes that civilians die in war, so I'm not sure what the relevance of anything they said is. It sounds like the most obvious thing in the world -- innocent people die in wartime. You can say this means that the US kills civilians "intentionally," but then that statement has no moral force -- it is just playing with language.

#+begin_quote
  "Mistakes were made" is a phrase that shirks any responsibility, and it's disgusting when used about intentionally bombing a civilian medical installation.

Whether the bombing was "intentional" (in the sense that the US realized it was bombing a hospital) is precisely the point the US disputes.

Mistakes /are/ made in war. That is a fact.

Once you start labeling arguments which invoke such facts as "disgusting," you are no longer interested in truth. In my view, this sort of thing does not belong at [[/r/rational]].

The fact is the US aggressed a region and poured weapons into that region, causing much violence, directly and indirectly. Even the civilians killed by "the other side" would not have been killed if not for US aggression.

This is the reason that in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression#The_Nuremberg_Principles][Nuremberg trials]], aggression was considered the largest warcrime:

#+begin_quote
  In 1950, the Nuremberg Tribunal defined Crimes against Peace, in Principle VI, specifically Principle VI(a), submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, as:

  (i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;\\
  (ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

  the chief American prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson, stated:

  To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
