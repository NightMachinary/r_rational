**** I think his intention is to say something like:

The best movies should have philosophical questions or moral conundrums to keep you thinking about it long afterwards. This is especially true for sci-fi movies which can explore sensitive current issues with a layer of abstraction (Deep Space Nine great example for a TV show). The cartoon, whilst catchy and amusing, completely ignores the interesting questions that could arise by just spacing everything and then everyone.

*** Why are you giving it straight 'No's? The main character has clear reasons to decide to implement intelligent solutions to their problems through creative application of their resources (IE, the airlock), as an explicit deconstruction of the low-effort sci-fi plots that might otherwise have ensued. An attentive watcher can probably figure out the solution to the climactic problem ahead of time, too.

I mean, yeah, there are a lot of precautions that realistically should have been taken, and events just happen to line up conveniently for the sake of a punchline. It's not a fully rational story. It's just a joke. But it's a joke about an intelligent way to respond to threats by non-intuitively expoiting the features of a particular exotic environment.

**** Throwing a machine out an airlock is not an intelligent solution to their problem. It's not something a real person would actually do (think of how much easier it would be to flip a hardwired power switch) and it's only in use to make a throwback to HAL, not actually because "In Space" is relevant to the threat model.

The main character's whole thing is about how you should respond to threats /in space/, but each of the risks we come across have threat models that have nothing to do with being in space, except that some idiot put said threat on a spaceship, and the proposed solution in each case (airlock it) is the kind of stupid solution you would only come up with if your goal is to relate back to space tropes.

Again, this is fine given what the video is trying to do. It's just that the video isn't rational fiction.

*** As far as I'm concerned, the current definition is irrelevant and the only criterion for qualifying as "rational fiction" is having a main character who reacts rationally, ie their reaction mirrors the way a real person would react in that situation as opposed to reacting in a way that allows the plot to happen. As far as I can tell, the main character of this short reacts rationally.

**** If you have an AI that outright says it is evil despite having not gained any sort of control at that point, and there is an eject button lying around that the character can use to instantly solve the problem, my impression is less that of a main character with Level 1 intelligence, and more that of a plot that exists solely for the main character to make a point. Similarly for "eject the whole crew" or "here's a dangerous alien I'm holding in my hands with no quarantine protocol". These are only coherent actions because the plot has set up implausible dichotomies that leave no real space for intelligent thought. Which is fine for a skit, but it's just not what rational fiction is about.

**** I disagree with your viewpoint, but I understand that people read this fledgling genre for different reasons. It sounds to me like you'd be perfectly happy with a crime drama if the characters just behaved rationally, but to me the "MC is a rational agent" aspect is just one of many aspects of the genre, and isn't even a necessity.

After all, it's my understanding that Ra is generally accepted to be "rational fiction," but many events in the story are motivated by more human elements rather than pure rationality.

***** Obviously my personal beliefs about the qualities which qualify a work as "rational fiction" aren't quite as simple as that. General consensus seems to be that "rational fiction" is its own thing, with "rationalist fiction" as an offshoot of it; I believe the opposite, that "rationalist fiction" is its own thing and "rational fiction" is the offshoot. I just feel like that makes way more sense.

"Rationalist fiction" is hard to write because /showing/ "level 3 intelligence" is hard to pull off successfully, so "rational fiction" exists as an attempt at emulating "rationalist fiction" by invoking its related tropes and themes without having to do the hard part of /showing/ the viewpoint character thinking in a way which is /reproducible/ so that readers can imitate the character's thought processes in the real world and get /results/.

I think ultimately your argument is resting on the idea of "it worked therefore it's rational", but I'll note that this proves too much---you could use the same justification to claim almost any winning protagonist is rational, which is clearly false. I think it's fairly obvious that recommending a safety protocol of "if something goes wrong then throw it out the airlock" in real life would simply just not work, but I'm not going to justify that claim.

********* When judging sci fi or fantasy stories with impossible powers it's normal to rely on the nature of their tech. We know from this sci fi story that airlocks work to kill things, and they repeatedly use them to kill things.

That's a refreshing change from many sci fi stories, where they forget the powers of their ship when the next crisis comes along.

Likewise in real life, teleporting things into space isn't a reliable safety protocol, but in Star Trek teleportation is a known power, but they forget to use it to teleport invaders into vacuums. Stories that regularly use reliable solutions are appreciated. You can't claim Star Trek people are rational, because they forget a power they have when space aliens come to eat them.
