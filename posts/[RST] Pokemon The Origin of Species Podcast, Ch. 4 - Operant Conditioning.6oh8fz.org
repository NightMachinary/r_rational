** It's really cool that making podcast audiobooks of webstories has become a thing. I'm looking forward to more.

** Great job! Thanks again for doing these :) I've been thinking about ways to contribute, and though it's a far way off, I feel like the Mewtwo interludes are the best opportunity to add something special. Unless you already have something planned, I'm going to try to reach out to Jay Goede or Dan Green (voices of Mewtwo from the first and second movie) and see how much it would cost for him to narrate the interludes. It's probably a long shot, both in terms of his interest and his price, but If he'd be willing and it's not too much, I feel like it would be a good use of my Patreon money.

*** Wow, now that would be quite something!

Speaking of Voice actors and readers, I am open to having some guests assist on the Interludes. Anyone shoot me a message if you're interested.
