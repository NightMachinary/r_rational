Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** There was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f3b6b4/review_why_you_should_read_the_emperors_soul/][thread]] a few days back recommending Brandon Sanderson's Novella /The Emperor's Soul/, with specific mention of it appealing to those who are not usually Sanderson fans.

As someone who definitely falls into that category, after reading the Novella I would wholeheartedly pass on the recommendation. I'm a little shocked in the disparity in quality (imo) between this and his other works because frankly I thought this Novella was superb.

(The thread linked above does a fine job detailing what exactly the Novella does well)

****** Actually, 'pass on' here is a prepositional verb which means you can treat it as a verb such as 'impart.' It's an idiomatic use rather than the use of the verb 'pass' and the adverb 'on.' The confusion is that 'pass on' has three or more idiomatic meanings (refuse, impart, die) and can be further interpreted as a construction of the verb 'pass' and the adverb or proposition 'on,' words that are themselves ambiguous.

I'd ask you though not to move it to PMs - clutter isn't really a thing with how reddit hides threads by default. I see no downside to having it in the open, and it lets anyone else who might open the thread this deep join if interested, however unlikely that might be.

Back on topic:

#+begin_quote
  If it isn't clear, I am talking exactly about grammar, and what is grammatically correct
#+end_quote

I think grammar is just a tool / convention for carrying meaning. Perfectly grammatical sentences that don't convey your meaning are a mistake; 'ungrammatical' phrases that convey your meaning are not. Whether something is grammatical or not is secondary to whether it is understood in the way you want to.

#+begin_quote

My honest point is that OP's phrasing is ambiguous; it would have multiple potential readings in isolation, and one of those would be the one intended.
#+end_quote

Even granting that (and I do think that most people would not see the phrase as ambiguous in isolation), if you can say something in either an ambiguous way or an unambiguous way, and you don't intend to be misunderstood, why wouldn't you want to know of and use the unambiguous phrasing?

#+begin_quote
  Beyond that point, I'm not going to touch your strange ideas about objectivity and universal 'default readings' in language.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure where you thought I'm making claims about objectivity/universality.

What I'm trying to say is that the parsing of an ambiguous phrase is going to be biased by what other phrasings are easily thought of for each of the possible meanings. In a situation where one meaning has an immediately obvious unambiguous phrasing, and the other doesn't, I would bet that most people will default to the latter meaning until contradicted by context.

#+begin_quote
  The Socialist Dominances of Solstice/Ayvarta is a Hindu-African Soviet Union.

  The Federation of Northern States is a German speaking United States analogue that acts as WW2 Germany. Geographically, it seems to be a counterpart to Europe, but ruled from a Scandinavian counterpart. One recently subdued and incorporated state is Frank, which is a close counterpart to France.

  - Achim Lehner is a close counterpart to Hitler, but crossed with distinctly American elements such as criminal connections and a love of capitalism and technology.

  The Kingdom of Lubon is the Kingdom of Italy but full of elves and a royal family more closely based on Britain.

  The Svechthan Union is...Russia. Again. But full of hobbits this time.

  The Empire of Hanwa is a pretty straight Empire of Japan. Kitan is implied to be China, but hasn't been referred to much.

  Hanwa, Lubon, and Nocht ally early on to attack Ayvarta, with the promise of helping take down the Svecthan Union and Kitan in the future, forming a counterpart to the Axis powers.

  The Confederacy of Helvetia seems to based on a much more powerful Switzerland with some British influence (Elves seem to be universally British in this universe, and Helvetians possess ULTRA) but not much is known about them. The Pact they mention could be a counterpart to the Warsaw Pact.

** Since there's people asking for military/alternative history in this thread, I might as well mention Youjo Senki/The Saga of Tanya the Evil, which is kinda rational-y and kinda-sorta this.

tl:dr; a sociopathic Japanese businessman shit-talks God and gets reincarnated in "not quite" "just before WW1" not-Germany with a bit of magic thrown in. Not full Harry Potter with wands and wizards, what's mostly used is augmented bullets/explosives, flight, and magic shields.

It was originally a light novel, and there's an anime with season 1 (and a movie that came out a few years later I haven't seen yet) that covers the events of, if I remember correctly, book 1 and most of book 2. The anime is pretty solid as far as animes go, but there's a shift in tone from the novel. While the anime plays up the battle scenes, the novel is more focused on the processes, both administrative and thought, that go on in the story. The 6th book just got translated into English not too long ago, and each is 400+ pages in length. The detail in the thinking is why my first thought is to place the books in the rational-adjacent category, but I haven't exactly examined the novels in detail.

*** I'm going to vote against this and say that it's explicitly irrational.

1. The wizarding population doesn't notice an assload of people getting killed/dissapeared by death eaters

2. Death eaters are ludicrously competent. When a death eater wants to kill a wizard, they win, no consequences or complications or discovery, unless they go up against taylor

3. Death eaters are suicidal. Does it matter that Taylor mows through literally dozens of them? No, they have an infinite supply of death eaters who don't mind getting sent into a suicide mission.

I had to drop it after those three facts kept getting abused, until it became clear that the story wouldn't get better.

The story is ENTIRELY about Hard Taylor making Hard Choices, for The Greater Good, and literally every element is only in there to serve that end.

If you like a story where nobody is a good person, because everyone is either stupid, violent, or stupidly violent, /A Wand for Skitter/ is fucking amazing. If that sounds like a chore to read through, then it's probably not for you. Personally, I think it lacks the qualities that made /Worm/ rational, and it lacks the qualities that made /Harry Potter/ fun. /Worm/ makes it pretty clear that Taylor is in the wrong, even if you don't know how. /Harry Potter/ makes it clear that things like the Ministry and the Wizarding World are parodies or caricature. If /A Wand for Skitter/ does either of these things, it doesn't seem to be intentional. At the very least, the peanut gallery in Spacebattles doesn't seem to be picking it up.

I think this is overstated by fandom, due to people wanting to signal their sophistication. Strong arguments in defense of Taylor's actions can be made, except the naive initial decision to infiltrate the Undersiders. Even keeping Dinah to fight the end of the world after opposing Coil for kidnapping her would not necessarily have been wrong - the average person who kidnaps children is not suitable as a reliable partner in crime.

***** Doing conventionally immoral things because you can vaguely construe them as being in service to the greater good is /usually/ not a recipe for good decision making. Taylor isn't an exception to this. Sure, she quickly moves past her "infiltration" phase with the Undersiders, but saving Dinah is a similarly weak justification, mostly made so she can stick around with her friends for longer. Taylor didn't /know/ whether or not she had a better chance of busting Dinah out from within Coil's organization than without. It's an /understandable/ decision, but it's not a good one.

Also, "keeping" Dinah would have been stupid. Nevermind the dubiousness of trying to keep someone who can see the future contained, Dinah was /already working with Taylor/ to steer her towards a future with the best outcome. That's what Dinah's two notes were all about, that's why Dinah outed Taylor to the Protectorate. All that keeping her under Taylor's supervision would have done was limit Dinah's ability to influence the heroes.

***** That was another thing. An author can rationalize any inaccuracy by saying it's an AU story. But if all of the AU changes just /happen/ to complement the mindset of the main character perfectly, the story becomes boring, because the character is never surprised by anything. The world of /A Wand for Skitter/ surprises Taylor on occasion, but not nearly often enough to be fun. Not only that, but it starts to blend the viewpoints of the author and the main character together, until they're impossible to separate. Does ShayneT believe a person should be armed to the teeth at all times, ready to kill at any moment? /I don't know/, because he didn't do a good enough job at making it clear whether he or Taylor believed that. It certainly wasn't the opinion of Taylor at any point in /Worm/ canon.

** Does anyone have suggestions for stories involving realistic population genetics and forced selective evolution in humans? It occurs to me that most of the popular points of reference on the topic (e.g. [[https://diyhpl.us/%7Ebryan/papers2/bio/The%20use%20and%20misuse%20of%20Brave%20New%20World%20in%20the%20CRISPR%20debate%20-%202019.pdf][Brave New World]], or [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh][Star Trek]]) are not particularly literate, usually being structured as morality tales.

One missing element I'm thinking of is the concept of genetic purging, where harmful mutations are reduced in frequency in population bottlenecks due to inbreeding, which causes recessive alleles to be expressed. The usual way "eugenic science" is portrayed in fiction is with a "master race" that is pure-bred and therefore considered fitter than the base population, but with this effect it's actually kind of the other way around (inbred organisms are normally /less/ fit, and this gives a chance for the bad mutations to die out, such that later generations of the inbred strain can strengthen the base population when they outbreed).

So a dystopian scenario about a villain / villainous regime that wants to make fitter humans while not caring about the cost to the individuals involved, might involve setting up many groups of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234482/][70 or so]] individuals that are only permitted to be fertile within their group. The genes of these strains of humanity would be made available to the base population of humanity, but not vice versa, making them net producers of /filtered/ genetic diversity.

Another way to use inbred strains would be to create hybrids, as is commonly done in plants. Members of a given inbred group are near-clones (so there's quality control), and when mixed 50/50 with any other such group that is dissimilar, you get a robust cross that has some attributes of both, and none of the recessive alleles. This is different from crossing the inbred strain with the base population because the 50/50 cross is just as predictable as the inbred variant. While hybrids are fertile, their offspring do not have predictable traits. Hybrid individuals, although and mentally and physically fit, would be plausible targets for sterilization in the name of social order or what have you.

** I'm here once again asking for your base/town/kingdom building reqs.

In the meantime I have tried to pick up:

1. Doulo something? Xianxian giving it a hard meh. It suffers from the amoral ish mc and and some weird scenes involving slightly sexual moments for 6 year olds. TLDR: kinda creepy wouldn't recommend.

2. A will eternal - comedy and 50% rational. Gets repetitive around chapter 200, but I will probably finish it.

3. I shall seal the heavens - edgelordy mc in an unsustainably brutal sect. He just made inner sect and shamed a super powerful cultivator and killed a bunch of other potential inner disciples. Seriously how do these sects sustain any kind of population?

4. Worth a candle - at one point dude pics melee over magic in terms of specialization. The story seems to be leaning towards Harem and the existential shenanigans are getting pretty tedious.

EDIT: Xian xia dive was me trying to find someone doing something interesting with formations or pocket realms.

Edit 2: Good Reads bookshelf. I'm not gonna lie some of these are pretty crap, but others are good. YMMV - [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/92192.Empire_building_conquering_ruling]]

#+end_quote

FWIW that is one of explicit plot hooks and addressed in the story directly later on. If you're worried that it'll turn into a wish-fulfillment harem show you can rest easy.

(also there were good reasons for taking melee over magic in that context, and again it's something that the characters revisit later)

The existentials shenanigans otoh are part of the core story and don't go away, so if that's what's bothering you it's a valid reason to drop :P

*** Dungeon Keeper Ami ( [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/]] ) is both pretty close to this and quite good. Some familiarity with Sailor Moon and the Dungeon Keeper games is helpful but not required.

*** There's been a few good Kingdom Building stories recommended in the past but they didn't do too well lately. Off the top of my head, Release That Witch ended a while ago (rushed ending), there's also A Hero's War but it updates at a glacial (monthly) pace.

I think the proper term for the kingdom-building genre is "uplift", maybe you could search older threads for more recs.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] is a fun non rational litrpg. The story is fun, comfy, with a ton of good progression porn. The basic story person become a monster ant and they try their best!

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z2XRg3dy9k][Last week tonight is back on!]] It feels like a lot of the politcal comedy & satire have gone to shit the last few years but I still really enjoy John Oliver.

Does anyone have suggestions for buddy novels or movies? I want to see best friends doing thing best friends do.
