I am starting a book club with my 5th grade students (age 10-12) and am looking for fiction they could get through which would introduce them to modern SF themes -- especially rational-type stuff, or anti-death-status-quo type stuff.

For instance, I would want kids coming away from reading the book ready to discuss themes and implications of hibernation, time dilation, time travel, space elevators, ramscoops, etc. Not all of these, necessarily, but certainly some.

Do you have recommendations? Do you remember SF you were reading at that age? Thanks.


** Ender's Game was taught at my highschool to 14 year olds. Probably too mature/difficult for 10 year olds, but I think it could be okay for 12 year olds.

I think just going through Asimov's short stories would be best for 10 year olds.

*** Asimov had a short book that's perfect for elementary school students, "[[http://asimov.wikia.com/wiki/The_Best_New_Thing][The Best New Thing]]." I first read it in a fiction anthology textbook at that age, and later found it in the library as its own book.

It's about a couple of kids who live on the moon who build up their strength with exercise in anticipation of their first trip to Earth, the homeworld of their parents. It combines a sense of wonder and a love of science, and I remember it to this day. I'd recommend starting their SF adventures with this story.

** Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series is great, though probably better for ~7th grade and up. Lovely blend of hard SF and character-driven epic fantasy.

Arthur C Clarke's /Dolphin Island/ is classic SF and great for younger readers.

Maybe /Rendezvous with Rama/?

TBH I'm not sure there's much kid-friendly hard SF; and my own childhood solution of "read it all anyway" may not suit everyone (especially if you're a teacher). Maybe play /Kerbal Space Program/?

Going a bit softer, Asimov's robots short stories are also good, and not too adult. Anne McCaffery's /Talents/ trilogy (fairly short).

Actually, David Weber wrote a young reader's trilogy in the Honorverse, that would be great too.

** for time dillation and early sci fi themes there's a book i read at that age: marcos millions ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco%27s_Millions]]) the main premise is a boy who likes to explore and then finds a portal to this other world and solves a problem and then manages to get a box that can change the speed of time so there's a lot of things relating to that in the book though its not the central focus.

Echoing some other posters i think asimov is surprisingly approachable at young ages. I would probably recommend the foundation books as a particularly good example.

People live with the recorded, simulated personalities of their dead ancestors talking as voices in their head, to preserve culture and knowledge in a world where knowledge is trending down, instead of up. It should be enough to get them started. Once they're hooked, the prequels and sequels to that book touch on many of the themes you're talking about.

** Second the /young wizards/ suggestion.

SF is really tough 'cause the themes are usually more adult (not necessarily romance). Most SF is going to be YA which is 12-13+

But, some thoughts: /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine][The Time Machine]], Animorphs, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16060193-ship-s-boy][David Birckenhead]] (if only for the anthropomorphized/uplifted bunnies), probably and all of [[http://www.laury.dahners.com/Stories.html][Larry Dahners' series]] (though it should be noted that while good, all his books are basically the exact same story rehashed yet again), [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/114468-the-songreaver-s-tale][Songreaver's Tale]] (not SF, but feels more rational-y), [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6948420-grand-central-arena][Grand Central Arena]], Card's [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40410-homecoming-saga][Homecoming saga]] could be fun/

** Different Kinds of Darkness is short and about kids their age. I don't think the language is too difficult. The totalitarian theme might need to be explained to them.

I was mostly reading nature books at that time. Jack London, My Side of the Mountain, Swiss Family Robinson. These seem almost like SF precursors to me. There's a focus on mechanics and engineering and rational planning for survival in a lot of them.

** There are probably a lot of "actual paper" books out there that do a good job of introducing someone to SF themes; but I'm not sure which to recommend.

The anti-death theme is probably mostly in stories whose authors have read HPMoR. Most of those are fanfiction or other web-published works.

For fanfiction, the best starting point would be something based in a world that the student is already familiar with.

--------------

If they've read Book 1 of Harry Potter (or watched the movie / etc), HPMoR itself may be suitable. I know some (at the time) 8th-graders who have read it, at least, which should put them at around 13 years.

Another world that most kids are familiar with is Pokemon, so maybe daystarEld's Origin of Species would be okay. I'd encourage you to first read through whatever you end up recommending, though, as I'm not sure I'd remember any problematic scenes. There's a scene where somebody's been killed by a Beedrill, iirc, but I don't recall how graphic the description of that actually was.

** /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ is both a fun read /and/ teaches people some interesting things from a number of different subjects such as psychology, and...some others.

Also, it's important to remember that children past the age of eight have clear concepts between fantasy and reality, so they can probably handle rather visceral stuff (just not too visceral, mind you), but it's mostly the administration that will get on your case if you show anything that you can't reasonably justify.

Compare with [[https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-are-in-harry-potter/][the original /Harry Potter/ books]]:

| Title                  | Wordcount |
|------------------------+-----------|

| /Chamber of Secrets/   | 85,000    |
| /Prisoner of Azkaban/  | 107,000   |
| /Goblet of Fire/       | 191,000   |
| /Order of the Phoenix/ | 257,000   |
| /Half-Blood Prince/    | 169,000   |
| /Deathly Hallows/      | 198,000   |
| Total                  | 1,100,000 |

I read the first three /Harry Potter/ books in middle school (that's ages 11-13 for you non-Americans). They took me one week each to finish, and I'm a pretty slow reader for a nerd (I /still/ subvocalize!). So if we assume the kids can read one /Methods/ book per week, they should be able to get through it in one and a half months (if the club meets monthly, you could assign the first three books on the first month and the next three books on the second, so you could get through the entire work in two months).

However, this is all theoretical; I agree that the content of /Methods/ is a poor match for 10-12 year olds. If /Methods/ were a movie it would be at least PG-13, maybe R depending on how graphically the troll and graveyard scenes were adapted.

****** Consider, however, that one of the benefits of a book club is discussing various facets and themes of a book in detail, moreso than trading reviews at the finish line. In a way, it would be missing a different point of having a book club.

Especially for the kind of thinking-heavy content OP wants to introduce, reading material should be paced moderately and discussions frequent. Like in the first quarter or so of MOR, where each chapter is basically a series of parables and thought experiments loosely tied together by plot, those kids would have arbitrage, fermi estimates, energy conservation, and so on blow right through their heads because there is way too much going to comprehensively discuss at that pace.
