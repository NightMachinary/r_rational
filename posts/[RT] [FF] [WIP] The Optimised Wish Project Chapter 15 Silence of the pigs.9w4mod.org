** I was so paranoid during this chapter. Puar could be anything and anyone, and he's in control of the computer in a fully computer-controlled complex. First I thought he was impersonating Bulmas father or mother, but probably not - he's still having trouble with details, and Bills would notice inconsistencies in their behaviour. I did call him being the fake Bulma-voice and messing with the clock, but I would probably have called fake on anything.

And now we have a rampaging giant ape Goku in the middle of a populated city. Except for characters we don't know are present suddenly swooping in and saving the day, the only way to stop him is cutting off the tail. Problem is, how would they know to do that? Maybe spooky squad figures it out somehow, but Puar will of course still be working against everyone. Difficult situation.

**** Nope. Exact opposite in fact, this Goku is horribly scarred by his murder of his father figure in Great Ape form and fears that because of his instincts that tell him to kill that he's actually a monster on the inside.

** Oh, God that was an amazing chapter. I love the fusion of horror with Dragonball's world. I knew Yandere Puar was going to lead to something great but never expected it to go this amazingly. Props to you OP, I can't wait for the next chapter.

** New chapter is up! Besides, I also created a new [[https://www.deviantart.com/ganhope326/art/The-Optimised-Wish-Project-772158503][piece of cover art]] that I think looks a bit better than what I used before.

** I've been waiting for this chapter and it turns out to be fairly good. The only thing I find strange is Puar character, is he really supposed to be so bad?

Nice trick with Puar leading Goku out, I had to read that part two times to understand what really happened.

*** Not in the original story, of course. But I've retconned a few characters already, I'm not being super literal. For example, Mai isn't a double agent for the Red Ribbon, and the Instruments aren't even a thing in the original DB. Spike & the others are real supernatural creatures, not men with fucked up histories and a serious case of chuunibyou. I'm following a bit the example of EY in HPMoR here - keeping a lot of details similar or close enough, but occasionally changing something around in order to make things more interesting and fresh.

** Pretty good stuff, though really wish somebody just said it wont be a problem if you're lying about your magical status, heck if nothing else they could have hired Yamcha without Puar to work security and jobs requiring super strength.

*** They weren't hiring for security, they were looking for super strong fighters who also have magic for Bulma's science research. Bulma was looking like she'd take pleasure in rejecting Yamcha which is why he needed and used that magic ace up his sleeve.

Bulma would've hired Puar by himself though seeing how Puar hates being used and only wants to spend time with Yamcha...

*** Doesn't it? On Fanfiction.net, I mean. Two things: it's Dragon Ball, not Dragon Ball Z, and it's M-rated, so it's excluded by default searches. I may want to lower the rating since anyway I think the content is pretty tame. Unless you mean another archive, in which case it's probably because I don't know about it. I only cross-post on FF.net and AO3.
