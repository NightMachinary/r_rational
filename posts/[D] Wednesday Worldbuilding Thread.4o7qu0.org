Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have an idea for a rational take on the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause?from=Main.PrimeDirective][Prime Directive]] where aliens avoid contact with pre-singularity civilizations because it would cause an Outside Context Problem. If they uplifted a species, then the uplifts would just become an extension of the alien civilization instead of its own, and the aliens think diversity among the stars is better for everyone.

It could probably work as some combination of The Culture and Lensman, where the aliens covertly share the truth with a select few humans to protect Earth from invasion. The only problem is, does this plan really do more good than harm? Can it be argued that humans would be better off if aliens didn't share their science and technology with us until we achieved a singularity?

*** I think you could pull this off, if you managed to really sell the readers on the fact that the aliens think drastically different than us. Like Baby-eaters/Super-Happies level of difference (check out that story, Three Worlds Collide, by Eliezer Yudokowsky if you haven't already). The aliens really would be helping us by not intervening, because if they did, their morals values and psychological values would completely screw up ours. In addition, the aliens can't really agree on a common moral code. (Maybe one race in the alliance of aliens thinks we should be modified to remove the sensation of pain as part of our uplift, maybe another race thinks we shouldn't regard toddlers as people because they are nonsapient, maybe a third thinks we should give fetuses the full rights of grown adults, a fourth race thinks painful death games should be encouraged if we have mind uploads). The Prime Directive also acts as the best compromise on the fact that every alien race has different values and ethics, so letting them decided for themselves is the only consistently fair way of doing things. If you can play up the cognitive differences of them as well, you could also work the idea that our creativity could help them (to give the human protagonists relevance).

So... the hostile invading race might kill us, but at least they wouldn't leave us a warped caricature of ourselves. The aliens want to help us, but all their good technology (mind uploads, immortality granting biotech, strong AI, cybernetic intelligence modification, etc.) would warp our values. Just giving us weapons wouldn't be enough, without an upgrade to human rationality or a restructuring of our society, we would end up destroying ourselves (the alien races have AI that is really good at modeling and predicting this sort of thing). Thus the human protagonists need to come up with a set of technology that will minimize the cultural impact on Earth culture while still letting Earth defend itself.

***** I didn't quite explain my reasoning there. Deconstruct what you mean by creativity. I think creativity is a huge grab bag of different cognitive processes, cultural constructs, and life experience that lets humans come up with novel solutions to problems. The Alien races each have their own "creativity" which can also generate novel solutions to problems, but if human "creativity" is different enough it might be able to generate ideas unique enough to be valuable even if the aliens will have thought of most of them one way or another. It will require good writing and serious brainstorming and empathizing with how alien mindset might think to pull this off will enough to satisfy the [[/r/rational]] crowd though.

******* Now that you've pitched it, I kind of want to take a shot at it. I haven't done any big writing projects before, just snippets, but this has got me motivated enough to at least do a few one-shots... I don't actually have a good idea for a concise plot though. I can think of plenty of alien races, but doing the human responses to them and avoiding "talking-heads" is a challenge... Maybe I could manage a few prolonged conversation:

- secret first contact information package scaring human government people with its implications that every alien society has a few features we are likely to find immoral

- human ambassadors meeting the aliens representatives and being disturbed even more

- humans getting over themselves and brainstorming solutions with the alien representatives

- shock as the humans realize the hyper intelligent alien races each have weird cognitive blind-spots and/or strategies they overlook because of weird ethical hangups

- eureka moment of an idea, making that idea workable (the aliens are all smart enough to grasp an idea even if they can't necessarily think of it themselves)

- a brief scene implementing the solution and resolving the story

- 1st epilogue each alien race takes turns making their pitch at small samples of technology they might offer humans that would turn them to their way of thinking (not prime directive breaking, but using the aftermath of the crisis to skirt the line)

- 2nd epilogue scene, the human governments all vow to keep everything a secret and wait a few centuries for the human's singularity to render everything moot anyway.

Actually, do you want to try a collaborative project? I could write alien perspectives and snippets and dialogue if you could manage to keep the human characters moving their side of the plot along?

Like races with individual sapient members may have tribalism, but our tribalism has a bunch of weird features. Like the way tribalism can apply to small personal groups, sports teams, religions, states, and nations all at the same time in the same person is possibly weird.

Our governments' limited investment in science and technology even though we are so good at imagining its potential via science fiction might also be super weird. Like some races may have had less imagination than us as they were developing technologies for the first time, but at least those races were smart enough to focus their society on developing the technologies they did imagine.

As humans, we have limited introspective control of our own thoughts. Like think how much effort learning meditation requires just to be able voluntarily and willfully quite our own minds and become more aware of our own thoughts, much less reach any arbitrary mental state. People can also have emotions that they consciously know are bad for them, but they can't help themselves. Also, think how much human memories are prone to confabulation.

I am not saying every other alien race has perfect mental self control, but most of them could have developed better introspective awareness and control as they developed civilization, making humans one of the more limited races in this aspect (Several races were like us in this, they modded it out when they went through their singularity. Only a few races actually currently have limits on their cognitive control close to as poor as humans... these races did think it an advantage in coming up with unexpected strategies, even if it is a major trade-off in raw intelligence).

Your idea of a secret think tank that makes contact with aliens is just as good, though, and you've put much more thought into this idea than I have. You're welcome to take a shot at it, and I'm glad you care about delivering interesting human characters and dialogue because that's a common issue I've found in stories here.

I'm willing to collaborate on this with you and others, but I'm really not a good writer. However, I am a very good editor for both style and substance so I'd be happy to do that. I'm not very experienced with rational fiction and am a bit more concerned with how a story makes me feel than how it makes me think. I love HPMOR for doing both very well, but hated Fine Structure for using interesting ideas for a plot and characters I simply didn't care about. I definitely prefer a compelling narrative over realism.

**** That is both everything I was thinking of and way beyond anything I was capable of imagining. The only difference I had with you was that I was thinking peaceful coexistence was only possible between post-singularity civilizations, otherwise the less advanced species would be destroyed or assimilated even unintentionally. The evil aliens are okay with that happening, but the good aliens want a primitive species completely unlike them to maintain their uniqueness.

This premise basically subverts the entire theme of Three Worlds Collide with the notion that coexistence between species is possible and preferable. It'd be like if the humans came across the baby-eaters before they'd invented interstellar travel and decided to both accept them and encourage their independent development. I was confused as to how to justify that, but your idea of novel creativity does that exactly how I wanted it to.

***** Keep in mind even the terms "good" and "evil" only loosely correspond to the aliens interests.

The "evil" aliens might think they are genuinely helping us (this also justifies why the story doesn't end in relativistic kill vehicles wiping out planets). For example, conquest and enslavement was a common part of many ancient human cultures, and xenophobia and tribalism still are. They might genuinely think a state of perpetual warfare and struggle would best actualize the coherent extrapolated volition of humanity, even if we don't realize it now. Or for another example.... humans restrict sex and gender to precise roles. This limits are happiness and pleasure. We might object in the short term, but in the long-term we will thank them for changing us all to bisexual and gender-fluid with just one small retrovirus.

The "good" aliens might include a variety of races with biological characteristics we might find horrific (Babyeaters), customs that we find cruel or bizarre (I think it was on [[/r/hfy]], an idea about a rat-like race that had dimorphic sexes with larger male-eating females, that developed civilization as the more intelligent and sapient males learned to band together to trap and rape the vicious and feral but still sapient females in order to reproduce), or just be completely alien to us (a race that reproduces asexually with no genders might find all of our sexual customs bizarre, or a hiveminded race like the Formics in Ender's game that have trouble with the idea of individual lifeforms being sapient). We only call the "good" aliens good because they are more or less trying to live and let live, even if they find aspects of our biology or culture horrifying and we do to them likewise.

For the singularity, you could go with the common criticism of EY's claims as to why it is limited. "Intelligence" is a mix of cognitive features, there is no single algorithm that results in general intelligence that can be enhanced. Improving memory and processing speed in general improve intelligence, but even these things hit bottlenecks and limitations in the space of cognitive architectures. The post singularity races are smart enough that their interactions with primitives are fundamentally unequal (how do you have a conversation as equals with beings that you can almost perfectly predict the responses of. For most things, you could say exactly what is necessary get the results you want from the more primitive race, is it really a meaningful conversation?) but not so smart as to make the plot go away or the value of interaction with other species to go away. (Think of the Entities in Worm for an extreme example, [[#s][Worm spoilers]])

Also I am planning at more hints at the implied meta-plot [[#s][spoiler]] Of course, this CYOA is meant to be open ended enough that the reader doesn't have to take this implied plot line as canon if they don't want to. There are also hints leveraging the rings to uncover extinct or nearly extinct forms of magic in the past. Finally, I was thinking of another page allowing for some minor bonuses and trade offs to the ring, to give the reader slightly more choices to customize their ring and the story they will tell themselves with it.

**** The Atlantean Rings also doesn't fit thematically, because it makes travel to other realities too easy, so I am almost certainly removing it.

Not sure what is wrong with the Planeteers ring. You could create a tornado or tidal wave with it, but it would cause ecological damage. Seems like a reasonable tradeoff for raw power.

I actually had someone else think that the DnD Ring too versatile... but compared to the Green Lantern ring, it is weak. I think I will add 1-level-1 spell to to it. For thematic reasons I am thinking of moving the +5 buffs to another ring that gives multiple +5 buffs (+5 to saves, +5 to stats, and +5 to 5 skills).

I was going to add Martial Trances (the berserk combat state dwarfs can go into in dwarf fortress) to the Dwarf Fortress ring. And maybe one more Dwarf Fortress themed buff to it? Video game like skill/stat increases (repeating the same action over and over boost skills and stats)? Or maybe ability to turn ordinary thrown object into deadly weapons? Free conjuration of materials for the strange moods? Precise control of the materials required for the artifacts? Still brainstorming.

I am definitely nerfing the Green Lantern Ring. I was familiar with the Justice League Cartoon, looking at the JLU and the reboot and the comics, high end Green Lantern Ring is too OP. I was thinking no power battery means it needs charging directly from willpower. Slow flight and weak shields can be almost charge real-time, but fast flight and powerful constructs/shields requires hours to days of charging, and high end feats may be weeks of charging, months for the one-off feats shown in the comics.

I was thinking of nerfing the Genie ring, but I was thinking in the opposite direction of you. I would nerf the wishes to having to be just within the theoretical upper limits of current human engineering and technology, and to have the ring get 1 more wish a year (also adds to the moral dilemma of keeping the Genie bound). (Weaker but more spread out effects to be more balanced with the other rings). So you no strong AI or nanotech factories, no instant massive intelligence boosts, but you could get an intelligence boost equal to the best combination of nootropics or a fabricator equal to the best 3d printers or an AI equal to the best combination of Google's algorithms, Deepmind, self-driving cars, and Watson. Sounds more balanced? The Genie will protect you if you free him and perform small favors and may be persuaded to occasionally perform larger favors and teach you magic.

Do you have a beta? Maybe you could compromise between the Calendar release and the chapter organized releases. 1 day per release might not be enough time if there are twists, or clues, or foreshadowing for the readers to figure out.

*** It's best to release chapters in logical narrative chunks that hopefully either comprise a single complete arc of the story, or a single section of an arc. Since arcs tend to be fractal in nature, this can be difficult, but I would aim for chunks of no less than a thousand words, and ideally no greater than 10K words. I think in the past, writing serially, the longest chapter I ever posted was ~11K words, and there were never any complaints about length (there were numerous complaints going the opposite direction though). Aiming for a proper splitting of the narrative seems much more important than aiming for consistent length (to an extent).

** One fairly known evolutionist and a fantasy fan once said that the existence of multiple independently evolved, sentinent civilized species on the same planet is absolutely improbable, if not impossible.

So I'm thinking about a world that is populated by several such species, while fully adhering to that principle. High fantasy setting, of course.

The easy way would be just say they were created that way by Gods, but let's not go that way.

One solution would be to simply declare that magical practises are highly mutagenical by their nature, and simply having a different culture with a different magical tradition would quickly - in a span of a few hundreds years - turn a nation into species. Since only sentinent species with some civilization would be able to develop a magical traditon in the first place, the evolution process that took that species to sentience would remain singular.

The other way is to have different sources of those secies. The world I have in mind is a home for, so far, three of them: 1) Native species 2) Interdimentional travellers, whose homeworld was connected to this one for exactly thirty years by a dimensional rift, which closed the same way it opened, unexpectedly. Thirty years were enough to build some colonies here, though. Ah, and that was about a millenia ago. 3) Elementals, living manifestations of magic and nature, who are exactly as sentient as the planet's magic users are - since they are reflections of their surrounding magicsphere. They always existed, even before the appearance of organic life on the planet, but only became capable of high thought when other species did so, and only in heavily populated regions.

Thoughts? Additional races for the second version? Thanks!

*** I like the first. If the mutagenicity is consistent across magical traditions, then you can have plotlines where one can tell by how inter-species someone is in which magics they're proficient, or two lovers separated by species who, together, vigorously practice the opposite magical tradition in order to converge at a shared state of sexual or reproductive compatibility. It allows for more character agency.

*** I'd say you can definitely have closely related sentient races achieving civilization at the same time as a result of normal evolution. Homo sapiens and Neanderthals lived at the same time, after all, and both were sentient species who possessed basic culture and technology. Neanderthals, of course, eventually died out, but I'm not sure what about the transition from the stone age to the bronze age you could point to as preventing the survival of more than one species in every possible world. It's only one data point, after all- which can suggest a possibility, but not rule out alternatives.

**** I go by what a paleontologist and a rational writer Kirill Eskov wrote in 2000, when asked about having orks, elves, humans on the same world and how does it bode with biology.

Translation mine:

  As a scientist, I - alas! - I find it quite impossible: just recall how our beloved ancestors - Cro-Magnons - made a "Final Solution to the Neanderthal Question".

And then he continued:

  But as a writer - I do not see anything special, why would they not, for example, have developed in the course of natural evolution in different, "parallel" worlds, and then meet? What was the term pan Sapkowski used - "the Conjunction of the Spheres"?

***** Sapkowski solved that quite nicely, also solving the problem of the origins of monsters and various seemingly ridiculus lifecycles, and monsters cmoing from different mythologies coexisting.

I also like how he has 2 parallel worlds with different time passage, and the slower world uses the faster world for genetic experiments :)

But in that case, Tolkien's elves and humans weren't separate species either. They might not be biologically, but for pretty much all writing purposes, they are.

*** How is "species" defined here? Rather than being different species, humans, goblins, orcs, dwarves, elves, et cetera, could all simply be different races; fully capable of interbreeding. Is this kind of variation within a species also implausible?

**** A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals are capable of reproducing fertile offspring, typically using sexual reproduction. While in many cases this definition is adequate, the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem.

Simply having different races is perfectly fine, but not the point here.

*** I assume the objection is that they would compete with one another for the same niche, or that evolution of intelligence is so rare and civilization so fleeting that even two independently evolved species on the same planet would never have overlapping histories? If the argument is /improbability/, I've ever had a real problem with that, so long as it's a worldbuilding conceit and not used to resolve story conflicts.

Personally, I wish that more fantasy blended in scifi stuff like magical uplifting and gene-tinkering for their distinct races, but that doesn't seem like what you're going for.

**** I don't actually know a full argument of the objection. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aku6h][This]] is what I go by - basically an offhand comment, but made by a person who knows his stuff.

I have, in fact, considered magical gene-tinkering. However, this is indeed not what I'm looking for, since an uplifted race wouldn't have a separate culture for at least a few generations, and even then, it's culture would be pretty much secondary to it's parent species.

*** If you're looking for a really-well-thought-out scifi with two intelligent species on a planet, check out Mary Doria Russell's /The Sparrow/ and /Children of God/. It's a predator/prey relationship, and a lot of blue/orange morality problems between the residents of the planet and the humans that go visit them. I guess it's not an independent evolution, though, since they're both mammal-analogues.

Parallel evolution is tricky. I think that that pair of books shoots the needle with the premise.

Different sources of those species is likely, though now you might want to do the math behind a magical version of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation][Drake equation]].

****** Nah, it's just a probability thing. Now that I think of it, Drake doesn't work here /at all/, since there is no "willing to make contact" element - just a rift that opens randomly, connecting two worlds that both might or might not contain sentinent life. The number of worlds is infinitely big, the probability of a rift connecting any two of them is infinitely small.

******* There is a "willing to make contact" element in the case of aliens that voluntarily begin contact.

So you have four populations:

- don't make contact
- involuntarily make contact
- involuntarily make contact but would have made contact voluntarily
- voluntarily make contact

So the probability becomes more complicated, but it's probably still estimable.

*** We don't just have multiple sapient civilized species, but multiple sapient civilized /clades./

Great Apes, Elephants, and Cetaceans at the minimum, and possibly corvids as well.

Not everyone is at the same level of civilization or sapience, but we're all social, tool using, communicators.

And I'm suspicious that humans are placing evolutionary pressure on the other species and clades to get smarter, in order to live in a more complex human-centric world. (Dolphins, at least, seem to be getting a little better at tool use.)

Yeah, if you look at modern society it's sharply different to how the other species live, but modern society is, well modern. An early hunter-gatherer using wooden spears to catch animals, and crafting crude clothing isn't too different from a gorilla coaxing ants out of an anthill with a branch or a dolphin using a sea sponge to extract difficult prey.

Now, I admit I'm being a little encompassing with my definition of "sapient," but it's food for thought, no?

You can do different things, and make some changes to time, but history seems resilient, partly because there's an organisation of ouroborans called the Cronus Club who object to you changing anything significant. Cronus club can help you with money (because betting and investing are a lot easier if you remember the last time round) and also send (slow) messages from one instance of the world to the next, via messages from old ouroborans to younger ones and visa versa. One reason they don't want to change things is that one such message talks about the end of the world...
