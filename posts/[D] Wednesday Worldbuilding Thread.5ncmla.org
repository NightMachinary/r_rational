Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** In a D&D campaign that I'm running I have a three mile high cliff with a city running down the side of it to the ocean (or technically a crevasse that splits the cliff a bit). In my head, this is super cool, but I think I only have the knowledge base to take a very shaky stab at it. Figure a population of 2.5 million, roughly the size of modern day Paris.

The biggest issues for a three-mile high cliff city would be ... transportation, waste removal, water, and stuff falling. Since it's D&D, many of those problems can be solved via magic if necessary, but I'm not entirely sure how serious those problems are, or whether you could solve them given purely 16th century technology.

Transportation can be done with elevators, but that requires some form of motive power, which I suppose you could get with water, but that then requires large amounts of water capture at the top of the city and some kind of long-distance piping. But that then bring meteorological considerations up, because you /probably/ need weather systems producing constant rain at high altitude in order to be caught by your catchments in order for your elevators to keep running. (Which I guess leads to the sort of worldbuilding thing that I like.)

(Yes, in the real world cities are built for a purpose, but one of the conceits of this setting is that there are magical cities whose existence is a constant, even over geological time. h/t to [[/u/nighzmarquls]] who posted that idea to the Discord, which I took for this campaign because I thought it was Neat.)

*** Three miles is enough for noticeable differences in atmospheric pressure and temperature, so I'd imagine different trades or classes of people preferring different levels which could lead to cool zoning by level - fishermen at the base, wind farmers at the top etc. You'd need to decide which level the rulers prefer to live, which I'm guessing depends on defendability as well as comfort.

You could have a lot of birds on a cliff like that, and if you have some mythically large flying beasts they could be used as transport - especially if they're the sort that roost at the top and use the sun's rays to get going in the morning before swooping down and climbing back up in the evening - then you could have a whole day night cycle of human activity based on that.

*** A simple way to give the city a source of fresh water is to have a waterfall from a large river flowing off the cliff. The locals could build some kind of vertical aqueduct system that would fill counterweights for elevators, which just dump their ballast into the ocean. Assuming Roman-era technology, a simple sewer system could work the same way or even use the same aqueducts (sanitation didn't exist back then). If things falling is a big danger, they could just build large nets beneath the buildings.

*** If magical desalination is practical on an industrial scale (and it should be due to enchanted heating stones and the like), your elevators could use seawater as ballast, with animals/slaves/bound skeletons as their motive power at the top. The seawater is brought to the top of the city while people are moved around with it, and at the top that water is desalinated and sent through pipes to the rest of the city. This allows for gravity - powered indoor plumbing, with the highest water pressure at the bottom of the city. The salt from the water becomes the city's primary export and reason for existence due to D&D's wacky economics and fixed pricing. The families who own the city are fabulously wealthy and employ most of the denizens in this industry.

*** Waste disposal is going to be a big issue for this city, especially if it's been there for a /geological timescale/. My first thought was primitive people can just throw shit in the river, but with a city that size, or even with a smaller one, over geologic time that's just going to fuck the whole river up.

A landfill would need to be used, and having one on the side of a cliff is a /massive/ engineering project. I have some very minor expertise in landfills and they collapse regularly, and they're effectively giant landslides of garbage, and that's when they're reasonably properly planned by civil engineers and not /placed on the side of a three mile cliff/. Especially with 2.5 million people. It's going to be a huge issue even if we assume it's medieval technology so they're doing things like composting food scraps and there's no plastic packaging to contend with.

Since it's D&D you probably want a guild of wizard garbagemen who make the rubbish go poof, or teleport it elsewhere. Maybe the town has an artefact that's a dimensional portal that puts the rubbish into some desert somewhere and it gets stolen or blocked up so they need to find some other way to dispose of their rubbish (or the portal puts their rubbish into some powerful being's Private Dimension, and now it's full enough that they want revenge?).

*** depending on where precisely on the cliff you are a waterfall actually is rather difficult to get power from, check out the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Falls][angel falls]] the falls turn to a heavy drizzle at the bottom. also similar stuff will render most liquid waste to drizzles if there is enough distance between the out pour and the unfortunate folk below.

Interesting potentiality is the city might have been built somewhere sensible then remained through an uplift/landslide. so look for city ruins above and below the cliffs or subducting below it.

** /Magic is Radiation/

Thaumons are the particle of magic. Produced by mages/magical artifacts, mages have the ability to partially direct and detect thaumons, allowing them to perform magic. However, high thaumon concentrations quickly become uncontrollable, and result in an extremely destructive magical blast. Magic must be carefully regulated to avoid loss of control.

Mages intrinsically emit thaumons, which are absorbed and re-emitted by other (non-mage) animals. However, mages release more thaumons than they absorb, making it especially dangerous for mages to live in dense population centres, and even more dangerous to have large gathering of mages. Two low-powered mages working together can amplify their powers significantly, but two high-powered mages can barely stand in the same room without resulting in a magic blast. This makes it difficult to teach new students, and when a mage does receive formal training, it is done mainly through master-apprentice relationships.

New mages are often found as a result of a magical blast in a densely-populated area. Mages are feared and discriminated against due to their power and the danger they pose to society.

Recently there has been the discovery of element Null, which absorbs thaumons without re-emitting them, making them indispensable to magical shielding. A single magical Academy has been established, where all mages must wear Null robes to prevent a magical blast. Magical artifacts can also be stored in Null, but Null is still extremely scarce and valuable, resulting in a monopoly by the Queen for usage at the Academy.

Magical artifacts are infused with a large amount of thaumons, and their efficacy slowly decays over time as they emit thaumons. They have the same problem as mages; it is unwise to store powerful magical artifacts together.

And of course there's the Philosopher's Stone, made from powerful mages, a physical manifestation of pure thaumons. Mere exposure to the Philosopher's Stone can turn a non-mage into a mage, but is extremely volatile, as exposure to even the most middling mage can result in a magical blast.

** Idea:

You're a secret agency/task force tasked with dealing trans-dimensional travelers.

Earth has become a destination in the multiverse, and strange denizens are starting to make their way to Earth.

Already, you watch over four teenage girls who are monster hunters in training, and an elf enchanter/artifacters who thinks all the round-ears are actually the elves.

How long can the masquerade last? What will you do if some other nation, hostile to you, play host to a trans-dimensional traveler? How do you detect and locate the whereabout of trans-d travelers?

There's also the mundane matter of ensuring your superpowered teenagers going to school and not making a fuss......

*** Hum, lots of variables here. First I must mention teenage monster hunters seems a bit strange and worth farther investigation. It's a common trope but makes next to no actual sense. We don't see teen police officers or bounty hunters very often, especially if earth is for some reason newly accessible you'd expect to see mostly experienced people. Possible solutions include them not actually being teens (magic healthcare for the win) or some incentive for the young to go into this kind of work. Magic is stronger when people are young. Monsters have some form of instinct not to attack the children. Even unicorns with the classic myths.

On to your actual question though. You'd be hard pressed to keep it secret long and the real question and problem is why would you? Are you gaining financially because of this? Are you worried about a destabilizing effect. Here also is where other variables come in. Is the transdimensional travel restricted in some manor? Does it have just one exit point or can you predict where a traveler will appear? Do travels have a reason to keep their presence a secret? Let's assume the following. Travelers can only arrive at the full moon and you can predict their exit point down to about a squire mile up to a week in advance. Travelers themselves don't really care one way or another about exposing themselves with maybe a slight bias for secrecy.

Here I think you could maintain things but the last thing you would want to do is send people off to school. If at all possible if you really have a strong motive for keeping it hidden you'd try to turn back the tide. Either imprison anyone coming through or send them back. Maybe if there was enough reason even kill them. Maybe though you need to let them through. Monster will invade Earth or some other disaster occurred otherwise. In this case you let them in but minimize contact between them and other people.

This is of course everything I think you'd actually want to do in this situation. In reality it would make terrible fiction so either come up with really strange starting cases (the teens are rebellious and misbehaving and they are going to public school one way or another with or without your help). Here again you try to minimize contact. Choose a small school somewhere out of the way. Greenland would be ideal. Maybe contrive to cause an internet outage to the area. Through out the key to keeping it secret will be to limit the number of people who know anything. It will be useful to have a team ready with stories meant to discredit anyone coming out with the claim. Without good evidence it shouldn't be hard at first.

** So, what do you think about my vampire society??? Any thoughts for obvious consequences of the below, or ways to extend it, or things I might not have considered.

Vampires are super intelligent, good senses, etc. Drink blood, almost always has to be from a human. We can go into details as you want but they're pretty normal as far as vampires go really.

The major thing their social framework runs on is sending letters and gifts. The gifts all have symbolism - think [[http://www.allflorists.co.uk/advice_flowerMeanings.asp][Victorian Flower Language]] but taken up to 11. You change the arrangement of laces in your shoes to communicate subtle things, the exact shade of your clothing matters, etc. Same with gifts; you send someone a silver bull statuette, the angle the horn comes out at could make it either an apology or a grave insult. Vampires live a long time and have astonishing memories, so they're quite able to keep track of all this. The letters are similarly full of subtleties, and run for dozens of pages at a minimum.

They also have very strictly ritualised ceremonies. The only one that's really been presented is a blood drinking ritual, where there is heated blood and chilled blood served in separate cups. The cups have to be drunk from in a certain order, the handles angled differently, and so on. If you do it wrong, it's considered a grave mark of disrespect.

(All the specifics of the meanings of different things are not addressed in the story, thank /god/, because that would be hideously boring and hard to keep track of)

I also want there to be a "red in tooth and claw" aspect, with ritualised combat - I am considering that maybe it's like martial arts in that you don't actually kill your opponent, but they tap out and are considered to have lost. But I do want vampires to be pretty blase about killing humans, because the difference between a vampire mind and a human mind is like a human and a chimp, or a cat, as the vampire gets older and older and thus smarter and smarter.

My story is about the love that dare not speak its name between a vampire (William) and his human consort (Red). As a plot point, I want Red to mess up during one of the aforementioned ceremonies with a high-status vampire (Elodia). Elodia is then considered socially right to kill him, and she goes to do so. William can't have this, because True Love, so he either kills Elodia (bad: unrational: she's powerful, not as powerful as him but still, it would make him look bad; good: power of true love), or Elodia's human servant (good: plot drama, sensible since William thinks of humans as subhuman, and so on).

But.... does it make sense that killing the humans would be on the table at all? I guess humans are considered chattel by vampires, you can eat them to death if you choose and nobody will care, but humans like Red and Elodia's servant have time and energy invested into them, so it would be analogous to destroying an artwork that someone was halfway through completing.

But I feel like vampires aren't /really/ vampires if they aren't violent.

Thoughts?

*** One parallel that you could draw is that we kill dogs that bite people.

If humans are about as valuable to vampires as dogs are to humans, and messing up the ceremony is as bad to vampires as a person getting bitten is to humans, then you have a start on your justification, in familiar terms.

**** Oh, of course. A dog is actually a perfect analogy. You have everything from mangy stray dogs, to family dogs that are neglected, to beloved family dogs, to well-trained police / guide dog. In my story, Red at this point is probably on the "neglected family dog" level of respect in vampire society, whereas Elodia's human (Lucia) is on guide dog level of respect.

William killing Lucia in retaliation for Elodia threatening to kill Red is a bit irrational though. Especially because Elodia could still kill Red. Maybe William will kill one of Elodia's expendable servants, and keep Lucia "prisoner". I like that. It will be a fun dynamic. Lucia would be all stoic, "you know how it is, Red. Vampires get into their little spats. Either your master will keep me forever, or I'll go back to my master." - she's probably been held captive before.

Incidentally, this whole "William killing Elodia's human" problem is going to culminate in a "gift war", where they each have to provide more and more extravagant gifts. I figured it's probably a sensible way for vampires to solve conflicts. William will ultimately lose the gift war when he is given a living statue that is essentially a slave to its owner. This will hit Red's last nerve and open up the obligatory "omg they almost break up" part of the plot.

EDIT: Though Lucia is a "thrall"; a human who drinks vampire blood and in return gets a deep, unmovable devotion to the vampire they drink from along with, you know, magic powers. Being kept prisoner results in one of these things:

a) Due to lack of blood, Lucia detoxes, becomes "free" until Elodia takes her again

b) William feeds her his blood. I don't want this to overwrite Lucia's devotion to Elodia, so it just maintains her previous state

c) As part of the generally accepted etiquette of keeping other vampire's thralls as hostages, she provides him a vial of blood that he can feed to Lucia as needed (she only requires a few drops a night to maintain).

I think the last one is probably the most sensible...

** There is a human sized magical automaton made largely of strong, heavy metal. You cannot see its exact location because magic, but you can tell if it's within line of sight. Using only pre-1950 technology, including heavy machinery if necessary, how could you destroy it? It is not trying to harm you, but if it realizes you know it is there that will change very quickly. Luring it somewhere specific is fine, but you better get it on the first attempt. Although animated by magic, sufficient blunt trauma will destroy it, as will melting a large part of it, cutting its head off, etc. It has 360° vision, but no other special senses or protections. It weighs about 15 metric tons. You can sort of determine where it is by narrowing your field of vision, but if it thinks you are looking at it it will assume it is about to be attacked.

My current plan is for it to be rammed into a magical vortex of doom with a great big battering ram, but I'd like to consider alternatives that don't rely on the vortex.

I actually have access to the load ratings data of all the bridges in my state, so I'd probably make use of that.

That said, the load rating data isn't necessarily accurate - a report for example said that a bridge can't handle the traffic that has been travelling on it every day for 15 years - but I'll just keep taking the creature to progressively weaker and weaker bridges since it will probably just think I'm playing chase with it?

**** In order:

Until it realizes you know it is there, it will only walk, neither run nor fly. If it realizes you know it is there, it will turn into a flying murder machine and kill you.

It can apply steel bar pretzels levels of force, but will take care to stay unnoticed, so won't apply much force at all unless the gig is up.

Human shaped, human sized. A little smaller than average for a fit woman.

Its power source is magic. You can't reasonably disrupt it other than by 'killing' it because you don't have magic, nor do any of your allies or any other faction you could reach out to.

It is not bothered by water.

Acid, strong enough and in enough quantity, could damage its body like it could any other metal. It is made up of (to you) unknown metal. Judging by its weight and size it is probably mostly made of something heavier than gold, but probably not gold because that's not terribly practical. After the initial shock of the attack, however, say a second or two, it will switch on the magic and just stop taking damage.

Fire... Well, its temperature can be raised, and you could melt it, but again, you have about two second before it goes magical terminator. A nuclear bomb could take it out, but that would involve rather a lot of collateral damage.

You do not have retaliatory magic. There is a magical vortex of doom in a fixed location, and that could destroy the thing, but it knows it is there and will be very cautious if it has to go anywhere near it. Sudden battering ram or explosion could possibly throw it into the vortex, but it will never be more careful than when it is near the thing. It can sense the vortex from a distance through any barrier you could put up.

Its long term intentions are to watch you and your group and make sure you steer society in a direction that serves its ends. You don't know what these are, but they seem to involve a lot of death. Its plan seems to be to stay hidden and discretely murder anyone who looks like they are pulling in the wrong direction.

You do not know how much blunt trauma would be required. It is not made of adamantine, but it is likely sturdier than steel.
