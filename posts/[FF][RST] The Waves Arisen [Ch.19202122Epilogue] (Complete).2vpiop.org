** The Shadow Council using Pein's own mind reading against him was hilarious and awesome. I can respect Naruto decision to hold off on the unlimited resurrections until he had gotten things under control, but it seems like he should at least resurrect useful allies like Kakashi or historically trustworthy people like the First Hokage to help him.

I like how Pein's plans seemed shallow/hollow compared to the way Naruto thought things out. He didn't really have any ideas that would make peace last more than a generation.

Also, I like this part so much I just want to requote it:

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe not, but you've reminded me of something important---something I think I might have forgotten lately, with all this focus on getting stronger... It's not enough to be strong, even if you do need a lot of strength to get anything done. You've still got to figure out what should actually be done, and whoever ends up with the power to fix things is going to have to deal with a lot of big questions, because we don't understand even a fraction of what the ancients knew, yet, and I don't think I can trust you to navigate a situation that requires regularly acknowledging your own ignorance. Maybe I am just being stubborn, but I make a thousand mistakes before breakfast every morning, and I've hurt too many people with my own stupid decisions to ever think very highly of my stupid little thoughts. I'm terrified that I'll screw up once I start changing things, and if you're not, then that's a weakness I can't accept in a leader. So I'll just have to beat you and do it myself.”
#+end_quote

Excellent synthesis of Shounen determinator tropes with Rationalist fiction tropes.

Not impressed by Alan Moores Watchmen, I take it.

I was kinda surprised that Naruto didn't resurrect anyone. I agree with his statement about not doing mass resurrections, but none at all is a little surprising. Maybe just Jiraiya? They were trying to rescue him anyways.

My only objection was Hinata -- she stayed a plot device the whole time, with no character development and no power ups. Nothing would have changed in the story if she had been completely removed and Naruto had gotten his Byakugan by killing some random Hyuuga and then had Sasuke give Naruto the rinnegan at the end.

I think mastering the healing under Tsunade is a pretty big achievement and reflects her level of talent fairly well. If you took away the ridiculous power-multipliers of Naruto and Sasuke, she'd probably kick their asses at that point. It's thematically fitting that she's had the most progress out of all three teammates and is the weakest. The universe (in this fic) does not grade on a curve and unfair advantages pretty much decide everything.

My main criticism was that you clearly cut corners in order to bring the story to a close within X number of words, rather than allowing it to play out at its natural speed. One chapter power-levelling and then /surprise/, final boss? You can't /possibly/ think there won't be people who will find that incredibly unsatisfying. Other than that, great!

*** Perhaps less subjectively, I feel like the implication of "the same thing we're going to do every night, Sasuke" is that Naruto will continue to have difficulties and challenges in the utilitarian pursuit of his goals, while the implication of the epilogue is that Naruto, through overwhelming strength, will soon rule everything and cause everyone to live happily ever after. I find the first implication more satisfying for epicurean reasons and also because it is more compatible with the idea expressed earlier that simply having strength is not enough and one must also figure out the troubling logistical details to be a good person.

If they don't intersect, breaking three shields per second, each maintained by a different person standing 0.5 meters apart would result in 1.5 m/s of physical movement. I'm not sure if that's taken properly into account in all cases.

If they are allowed to overlap, then should it even matter that they can only surround Naruto? Couldn't you trap and squish most of the Peins by trapping them in partially overlapping barriers?
