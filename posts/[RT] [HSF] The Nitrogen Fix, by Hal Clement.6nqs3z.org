I would like to recommend this, since it doesn't seem to've already been. At the least, it's a book I really enjoy.

Brief synopsis: On a world where oxygen is much more rare in the atmosphere, how must humans change and adapt?

Reasons that it is [RT]: - three factions with distinct goals, none of whom are 'evil', but who sometimes come into conflict with each other due to their goals; - characters who consider their actions; - consistent-seeming science (which I think is backed up by real chemistry), although in some cases it does feel like a parameter is being 'squeezed' into a narrow range to make the plot work; - viewpoint characters whose minds work quite differently from the reader's. Some of the characters do non-useful things because of psychological limitations (example: 'cannot lie'); I don't feel this means it's not [RT].

I'm only halfway through, but it's good enough so far that I wanted to share.


** Hal Clement-?

That's a name I haven't heard in a long time. I think the first story of his that I ever read was /Needle/, a sci-fi mystery about one symbiotic life-form hunting down another.
