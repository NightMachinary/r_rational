I submitted this story for the Reverse Portal Fantasy prompt a couple months ago. I'm still updating it, and I'm curious to see what people on here think of it.


** Like chaosmosis, I was bored with the first scene. I skimmed over that section without really reading much. After that scene, it got a lot more interesting.

My advice is to just start with the second scene. The first scene's information can be included later on, once people are sufficiently invested in the story.

** For the sake of providing feedback no matter how useless it is, I started to read this and got bored within a paragraph. The situation itself wouldn't necessarily be boring, but your description was. You just say "gods", "outer realm" or whatever. Maybe if you had given a visual description my attention would have been better hooked.
