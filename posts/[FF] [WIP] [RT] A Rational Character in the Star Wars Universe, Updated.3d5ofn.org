** This story seems promising. Out of curiosity, is Nerra based loosely on Kreia from KOTOR II? They both have white hair, brown robes, an affinity for force sight, and a philosophy of viewing the light and dark sides of the Force as two parts of a greater whole. If Nerra starts talking in cryptic, manipulative half-truths, I'm calling shenanigans.

*** Nerra backwards is Arren. As in, "[[http://lparchive.org/Knights-of-the-Old-Republic-II/Update%2058/][Arren Kae]]". ;)

** Ch 1: "his performance seemed to be deteriorate with" should be "his performance seemed to be deteriorating with"

Ch 4: " I take it things did not go well Gil?" should be "I take it things did not go well for Gil?"
