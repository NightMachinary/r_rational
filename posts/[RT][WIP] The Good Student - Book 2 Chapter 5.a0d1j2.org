"hey Davo, I want to go climb a forbidden mountain on Christmas because I might be able to fight a demon inside my soul nobody knows exists for sure."

"say no more fam. 3 sets of climbing gear from our winter collection. When do we leave?"

**** They're all pretty good. You can imagine Davo's nose slightly raised in the air and eyes looking down on everyone as he talks. Fanny is the butt of comebacks and jokes but rarely he gets the upper hand, and those times always feel great.

Simole's flirting/teasing is amusing, especially when combined with Dizzy seething in the background. Nic originally feels flat as a character given his passiveness, but now he dishes it out just as hard to anyone who isn't Dizzy.

**** I'll admit, Davo is a very close second for me. He's certainly provided me with the most laugh out loud moments.

The rest I find forgettable or downright infuriating (Dizzy). That said, yes I do realize a lot of the excellent moments happen when everyone plays off each other.

**** I agree with that. I posed the question in the last thread about whether he's had any real meaningful character growth and I frankly think he hasn't.

His behavior and outlook and approach to things make sense when we start this novel. He's nothing but a small town kid who has spent his last years studying. For some reason, the world changing events he has been at the center of haven't really affected this. Nothing that has happened since the end of book one has shown him to be any different. The only difference is the circumstances around him.

***** Besides getting over the girl? Not really, but I don't know how to feel about it because he has yet to really /win/ with each victory he has he gets another blindsided by the fact that it wasn't really a victory, just him being hilariously outmatched and outplayed all the while thinking he is in the lead.

He also doesn't have any real ambition, the whole 'I don't want to be here' thing is getting annoying.

****** I really don't think he's even over her. His recent awkwardness kind of hint at that. He's just sidelined it for now and is kind of ignoring it. It's annoying and unrealistic and weird.
