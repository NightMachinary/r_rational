Ha, nice Absence demon reference.

edit: Gods, Akua, that's fucking amazing:

"Still, a responding battle cry was in order. It was the heroic thing to do. Something about Callow? Akua pondered her understanding of Catherine's temper. I am angry, the sorceress decided, because I am disappointed as I have mystifyingly failed to grasp that the Heavens prefer their pawns powerful yet rather dim. I must now protect the venerable sanctity of farms and countless peasants everywhere, as I am very concerned with their fate even though they are ignorant and full of lice.

“Fuck off and die,” Akua called back, tinting her voice with wroth."

edit 2: With that ending I'm beginning to actually like Akua now. *That cloak must be burned before further damage is done*

  With the coming of dawn, Tariq had been able to Forgive the death of Mansurin. The young man, displaying the famous fortitude of the Champion lines, had only been spurred to greater zeal by his stay Above. Little Sidonia, with her laughing eyes and quick wit, would have to remain under shroud of preservation until tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Since we have Forgive only useable once per day, used on sword and board on the day Cat fought, this means Mansurin must be Hammer Wielder. Also Champion lines seem to prefer blunt weapons, which makes sense. Furthermore, all the resurrected heroes were mentioned, but not the sword and board.

I'm assuming that Myrmidion and Silent Guardian were used to protect Forsworn in the previous battle since they were on protection duty again here. There is some implication of heavy armour here. However, Cat did fight two different swords and boards and if Francois is one I'm not sure who the other would be.

I'm not sure I agree with that. Encounters that Cat has spent a lot of time planning in the first 3 books:

- The final school battle.

- The defense of Marchford.

- Her resurrection scheme.

- The duel with the Duke of Violent Squalls, arguably (the one where she gets her first Winter title).

- The Battle of Four Armies and One.

- The whole attack on Diabolist.

I think the major difference would be, in this book she's starting to do more long-term planning.

On the other hand, I'm with you on the hypocrite part.

******* It's a joke :-)

In Chapter 4, Thief and Cat discuss the invading host's heroic makeup:

#+begin_quote
  “We'll untangle that particular mess in full at the briefing,” I sighed. “What've you got on the heroes? None of this matters if they just splatter us across the countryside at the first scrap.”

  “Wasn't able to get all the Names,” Thief said. “But I do have a number for you: there's *fourteen* of them.”
#+end_quote

When GP and Cat meet up and talk in chapter 8, she promises not to use demons and warns GP that they believe one may be somewhere in Callow, possibly trapped in a legion standard:

#+begin_quote
  “Done,” I grunted. “As a gesture of goodwill, I'll add a warning. There's a demon from Dread Empress Triumphant's day bound somewhere in the vicinity of Harrow. My people believe it might be one of *Absence*.”

  “A Hell Egg, after all these years?” he said, brow rising. “I thought none remained within Callow.”

  “Would that this were true,” I ruefully said. “I don't know exactly where it is, or what keeps it bound. Odds are it's an old Legion standard but I can't guarantee it.”

  He inclined his head in thanks.

  *“I will discuss this with the others,” the Pilgrim said. “If we can slay it, we will.”*
#+end_quote

Absence is a particularly nasty demon, because its corrupting effect is to basically erase things around it from existence - even from memories. When previously released, Absence apparently wiped an entire country from existence, with no one even remembering it. From book 2, chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  A shiver went up my spine at that, I was unashamed to admit. Every Callowan was raised on stories about what demons could do when let loose, and both of those kinds had famous legends to their names. An absence demon was widely believed to be the reason the entire Yan Tei Empire had no mention of it anywhere during two centuries and then had suddenly reappeared in the histories. People hadn't even noticed it was gone, or even that anything had been missing at all.
#+end_quote

In chapter 10, Archer and Cat discuss the heroes again:

#+begin_quote
  “It's *just twelve* heroes,” Archer shrugged. “Nothing to worry about. Worse comes to worse, I shoot a few in the eye and run away.”

  *Strange, it hadn't occurred to me before now that the muster of heroes on the other side was essentially a tenth and two officers.* I /had/ been tired, and there'd been a few days a while back where I'd had vicious headaches. Must have been the lack of sleep having unforeseen consequences. We were all feeling the pressure: even Vivienne and Masego had been out of sorts.
#+end_quote

The implication here (and referenced again in this chapter when GP tells the heroes to remember they were twelve once and to never "forget") is that the demon was found and fought. Two heroes were erased from existence, as was any memory of the battle. Hence the headaches suffered by characters, and the subtle references to a smaller number of heroes than originally discussed.

It was probably quite the battle, but no one remembers it.

** >If Akua had always known heroism was this entertaining, she would have begun dabbling /years/ ago.

I feel like this line holds some significance. Akua, villain of the old breed, has come from viewing Cat as a disgraceful upstart of a Villain to viewing her as a (lower case h) hero. I'm fairly certain Cat is gonna get a new name with the next chapter "the Queen returning from slumber in the hour of her kingdom's most dire need" is such a powerful trope.

There's no way Cat's gonna be a Hero, but maybe her new name will be neutral? In terms of alignment it's worth noting that the Heavens don't view Winter as something that must be destroyed (as seen when blessing the water failed to fuck up the Winter!Zombies).

EDIT: Fuck, maybe Cat has inadvertently offered Akua a shot at a redemption arc? I'm not sure if I like the idea, Akua deserves to suffer, but that would be quite a heroic or at least unvillanish thing to do.

A Name is a consequence of acting the part of a Role, and I don't think Cat wants anything to do with getting locked into playing the Gods' narrative games anymore. She wants to break the story of Callow being the beleaguered battleground for the fight between Good and Evil. A Role is a groove worn into Fate, a path tread by countless individuals in the past. She wants to forge a new path for Callow, and so there's no Role (and thus no Name) fitting for what she wants to do.

Besides, she's plenty powerful already as the Queen of Winter. As Akua just showed, she can stand on her own against two of the most mighty Heroes we've seen to date and eight fodder Heroes. She doesn't need a Name.

**** We've seen new names before though, or at least names that haven't existed in living memory (see Hierophant). If not for that I'd think you're completely right. With the fact of new Names being a thing, I'm not so sure. Cat is carving a gauge in creation rather than following a grove, and that fits a new Role and Name better than no Name at all.

I guess the real question here is whether Cat wants to /break/ the story, or if she wants to create a better story. I'm honestly not sure, I'd say the chances are even or close to it. Watch me get proved wrong next chapter though.

***** Both Cat and Black want to create institutions that can continue to function after they're gone, making Praes and Callow less reliant on and less susceptible to the influence and whimsy of Named. The fact that the Dread Empress/Emperor of Praes is a Name is a problem for Praes, not a good thing.

Cat talks on many occasions about abdicating as soon as there's a stable government in Callow that can survive without her. If she gets a Name that makes her the savior of Callow and the guarantor of its peace, then she's basically ensuring that this will never happen. Callow will be reliant on the Black Queen (or whatever her Name is) forever, whether that's Cat herself or claimants on the Name down the line.

I dunno. I don't really think it's impossible that Cat gets a Name, but I think that's the least interesting way to go.

Really liked the creative use of Winter's powers by Akua. Reminded me of Ice-Man from the X-Men comics in their overwhelming, indiscriminate control of water/ice, which is terrifying.

The action was anime af, which is great. I liked Akua's arrogance and internal monologue in the midst of battle. It's a shame we only got to see her as a Classic Villain, because she really is a fun character (assuming she's not on the other side). She felt like a mini-Triumphant here (may she never return): quick, witty, and hopelessly arrogant.

Presumably Alaya heard it before and that's how Black knows even thought it "wasn't for him". I wonder if the crusade would consider that a win? Praes reformed under Cat and Callow as a tributary state to Praes, but not headed by a Named.

There was a few more lines in this one that I was thinking on:

The line about resurrections. I wonder if the side of good using such a potent ability will empower the side of evil to maintain the balance?

I wonder who else would call what Cat is doing heroism? It's clear that compared to Akua she could be considered heroic, but Cat reminds me too much of Doctor Doom or Magneto. Still considered Evil.

What does it mean that Cat's soul is completely fused with Winter? Did that just happen from the magical backfire or has it been like that since she became the last titled entity of winter?

  Starlight stolen
#+end_quote

I always got the feeling that Pilgrim was not using the Summer Sun with his weapon - to call it starlight instead of Summer's sun doesn't seem to match thematically, since thematically stars are associated with night and suns with day, and this world if nothing else, follows theme more than logic. It was something else entirely, as the staff he has has made appearances beforehand. I feel like the Summer Sun was more him breaking the control and reshaping the leftover magic rather than usurping Hierophant's miracle. Like in the way he breaks Hierophant's 'light has no effect' circle, or Cat's portals.

It seems to me that the Pilgrim's staff is a completely different power source that is tied to the breaking of power. Like the power of a fallen star or something - thematically fits with the idea of breaking power and it's lack of effect of Pilgrim who doesn't wield personal power to break.

#+end_quote

Neat world-building about the Dominion of Levant. Looks like their heroes have two ways to become Named (or as they call them, Bestowed) - either through Blood ties to a former Named, or through being Bestowed by the Heavens. If the Named has a family, their descendants form a new Line; a lesser line if not one of the Names shared by the founders, or a greater line if it is (I think?). Valiant Champion, slayer of Captain, wasn't born into a greater line but inherited the Name of one of the founding heroes - so her kids will be, effectively, royalty. Speaking of royalty, Grey Pilgrim is apparently both from a greater line AND inherited one of the founders' Names. I find that interesting, especially since he's so close with Saint of Swords, who is known as the Regicide for her history of murdering royalty. I wonder if there's potential conflict brewing there.

Hoping that's not the case, but it seems too lucky and easy to have her just pop back and be "normal" Cat.

This also doesn't solve the issue of Masego. Unlike Cat he doesn't have an Arcadian hardcopy to tether himself to and reassemble. I wonder if a potential solution would be for Cat to deputize him with a Winter title, and then use her power to yank him back. Although I worry what that'll do to a guy who's already pretty amoral... mix in Winter and he stands to get his personality turned cold. Suddenly rather than just an academic interest in everything, he may find his passion in hunting prey or figuring out how to freeze all of Creation or something...
