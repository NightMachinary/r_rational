I've been thoroughly impressed by this subs ability to rationalize fiction. Let's try and finish our DCU. I have a dream, of a Flash story where "because Speed Force" isn't the only answer to every question about power, plot, physics, or character motivation. A dream that Plot-Induced Stupidity isn't required for Speedsters to fight non-Speedsters. A dream involving quantifiable numbers applied to exactly how fast The fastest man alive is.

Now, I think first priority is figuring out what exactly the Speed Force is, and what exactly can it do. My take on this is much the same as the Higgs Field which grants every particle in the universe its mass. Manipulating the association with it could make things functionally weightless, or allow lightspeed travel. I think the Speed Force is a similar field that grants every object its individual acceleration, and Speedsters get their powers from altering their connection with the field. This actually allows Flash to keep most of his powers, as well as giving logical scientific limits to what he can do.

Second problem, FTL doesn't mean time travel in DC. There's an entirely separate Time Barrier which is much faster than the Light Barrier. There's also, from what I can tell (correct me when I'm wrong), a Dimension Barrier, a Space Barrier, a Reality Barrier, a Life Barrier, and finally a Speed Force Barrier. At least a few of these have major logical ramifications. Let's figure out which ones we really need and apply numerical values to exactly how fast the rest have to be. I'd say the only important ones are Light, Time, and Life, the last of which relates to the Black Flash who is my personal favorite representation of a reaper in comics.

Speaking of villains, we have to take a hard look at the Rogues Gallery. We have to figure out how each of them poses a threat to someone who can run FTL and travel through time, without relying on him to stand in the path of a Boomerang or other such nonsense. A lot of them need upgrades, or optimised origins. For one, let's give Captain Cold access to actual Absolute Zero, and all the horrors that that entails. Now he can freeze molecule-thick walls of air to be stronger than steel. Now he can make patches of floor so cold that once you step on, you can't step off. Maybe Grodd can telepathically steal brain-processing power from those around him, explaining why he's as smart as he is and simultaneously making him exceedingly more dangerous by stupidifying everyone within range. Can anyone figure out a rational take on Mirror^{Master?}


** I love the Flash. He would be my favorite superhero ... but his powers don't make much sense, and his villains are pretty lame. I have a piece of Flash fanfic sitting in a folder somewhere (titled "Flashback" because it's a time loops story - god I'm clever) which is never going to be finished.

Good to luck to anyone that wants to try it, but it's going to be an uphill battle. You either need to power the Flash down by a huge amount, or power the threats he faces up by a huge amount, maybe both.

*** I was thinking both. There are ways of planning against an FTL opponent, regardless of what people on [[/r/whowouldwin][r/whowouldwin]] believe. So given the right set of tools, you only have to slow him down enough to where there's actual travel time for the villains to stand a chance.

**** I'd actually like to hear your take on how you can beat an FTL opponent when you're not FTL yourself. The obvious thought would be "lay a trap", but I can't think of any trap operating at sub-light speeds that could affect a FTL target, short of a wall.

That reminds me of EVN:Delphi, in whose universe it was discovered that putting FTL drives on your nuclear missiles was really quite effective and rather hard to counter. Nowadays, capital starships do battle at very long distances, and whoever has the best sensor technology wins. (The game is a yet-unpublished mod that has been in the work for nearly 10 years, but the author /still/ regularly posts high-resolution graphics for more ships he's designed. It's honestly ridiculous, and I will play it some day even if I need to dig up an ancient computer to run the game.)

**** I like how happy he is. He takes some real joy in being a superhero, in a way that Superman, Green Lantern, and Batman only rarely do. He runs at a significant fraction of the speed of light, and he's /laughing/ because of how amazing it is. Spider-man is one of the only other superheroes to do that, and with him it always comes off as something of a defense mechanism. With the Flash, he's laughing because he likes his life. (Which is not to say that Flash hasn't gone dark and brooding - but DC superheroes are mythological, and they cover a much wider range of characterization than Marvel heroes. The Platonic ideal of Flash, in my mind, is happy in a way that the other members of the Justice League are not.)

When the writers aren't in the middle of forgetting about it, his powers are amazing - catching bullets in mid-flight, solving problems in seconds, coming in like a blur and just ... fixing everything in the blink of an eye. Superman does that too sometimes, but with Superman it's often more about brawn, which I find less awe-inspiring. The Flash's powers are more constrained in many ways, more focused around this one single thing: /speed/.

And with that said, I think that there have been far fewer "good" Flash stories than there are Superman or Batman stories. But I like Flash better all the same, because he seems to promise more of the things that I like.

Superman has laser beam eyes because /reasons/. When the Flash wants a ranged weapon he has to use tools -- usually flung rocks. Superman flies and can therefore catch falling window washers because /reasons./ The Flash has to move really fast to set up cushions of air. And so on.

***** Glad to hear that a number of people here like my stories. Flicker was indeed inspired by the Flash--in particular this quote about him (in an old obscure issue of Swamp Thing by Alan Moore):

"There is a man who moves so fast his life is an endless gallery of statues."

I wondered what that would be like, and what it would take to have a vaguely plausible world with a speedster who could go close to the speed of light in it... and I created Flicker. Similarly, Doc was inspired by my frustration with how 'smart' characters were portrayed in fiction.

The first two novels, "The Fall of Doc Future" and "Skybreaker's Call" are complete and available in web-serial form here: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories]]

I'm working on the 3rd book now, "The Maker's Ark", and posting new chapters every two weeks.

There isn't a battle really worthy of Flicker's power until the second book, I'm afraid, as it took some doing to set up. 8-)

Oh, and there are telepaths, but no gorillas yet. Sorry.

**** I didn't actually read very much of it (I found the style somewhat odd), and I'm not that knowledgeable about Flash, but in the first chapter the main character has to save her friend from getting hit by a truck when her friend is in an unknown overseas country. It ends up taking her 3 seconds to travel from somewhere in the U.S. to London.

EDIT: I found the summary. "This is the first chapter of a novel I wrote, The Fall of Doc Future, set in a world similar to the present day, except with metahumans. I consider it Science Fiction or ‘Hard Fantasy'--there are unusual abilities, but I try to treat the consequences seriously and consistently. The main characters are Doc Future, the smartest man in the world, currently having issues with insomnia; his adopted daughter Flicker, a speedster and high functioning autistic; her best friend, Dr. Stella Reinhart, a mind control researcher who does a few other things as well; and Donner, a metahuman rock musician with an unusual voice. It's about 170k words. I will be publishing a cleaned up ebook version at some point, so watch this site if you are interested. Follow the previous and next links at the top and bottom of each chapter to read in chronological order. Enjoy! - WDR"

** I think first you need to flesh out the mechanics of super speed. Does it involve high kinetic energy and momentum, with all of the destructive potential that brings? If he carries a magnet with him or gets a static charge somehow, does it result in an EMP? Can he think at super speeds? Does he have super reflexes, but no real conscious thought at that speed? Does have ordinary reflexes, so he has to plan out his entire path before running and he has no way of reacting to obstacles? Does he have less obvious results of the power, such as being able to vibrate through walls and wear pants made of goes fast?

*** Well the Speed Pants obviously have to go. Under my revised definition of the Speed Force, he is actually going that fast, with all the energy and strain that implies. That means he likely can't go FTL except in a vacuum, since he'd be torn limb from limb by atmospheric interference. His reflexes and thought rate are probably superhuman, but still limited by the speed of neurons, and thus not real-time for a Speedster. As far as vibration intangibility and arm vortexes and similar side-powers, I think I don't know the physics well enough to know if they'd actually be possible for someone who's Just That Fast.

**** Can he travel faster than sound without sonic booms destroying everything in the vicinity? Running even the speed of sound should probably shatter his bones, along with the ground. Does Speed Force allow him to speed up without the necessary action and reaction stuff? Or does he just have super strength and nigh invulnerability, along with the floor?

How does FTL work? My guess would be that light is massive, visible light moves at around the speed it does in real life, and the Time Barrier is the DC equivalent of the speed of light. This would require messing around with some stuff. Radio waves would travel at speeds comparable to the speed of sound. Either nuclear bombs would weigh almost exactly the same after they go off, or they could potentially be much more powerful, depending on exactly how fast the Time Barrier is.

Could you take him out by shooting him from behind? If the bullet's travelling faster than sound, he won't have a chance to hear it until he's hit. But if he can survive running at that speed, a bullet shouldn't do much. He might be able to keep running so you can't target him, but from the sound of it I'm not sure his reflexes are up to that.

***** Sonic booms are a problem he'd have to deal with regularly, assuming we don't up the Sound Barrier to make Speedster combat more viable. Like I said previously, my redefinition of the Speed Force allows him to essentially grant himself momentum without gaining it legitimately through effort. In essence, speed without acceleration. That means G-Forces won't kill him but air and debris still might. Although he'll still be a bit tougher than human, with probably a pretty good healing factor from an enhanced metabolism that would require a higher caloric input.

I don't entirely understand the bit with atomic bombs. Could you explain that some more?

The bullet question depends completely on if he's already moving or not. If he is, he's going to be almost impossible to hit. Speed of thought is still faster than speed of aiming. If he isn't, he might at least be able to rob the bullet of a great deal of damage by running forward at similar speeds. But if the bullet hits, he's gonna get hurt.

If you can fill the air with debris, then he can't use his power. I don't imagine confetti would do more than papercuts, and anything more substantial won't stay in the air long. You could hang a bunch of beads from the ceiling with string.

  I don't entirely understand the bit with atomic bombs. Could you explain that some more?
#+end_quote

An atomic bomb converts a gram or so of mass energy into heat energy. If you're in a universe where c is a thousand times faster, then mc^{2} is a million times higher, so converting the same amount of mass energy would result in a million times the energy being released.

Come to think of it, all the potential energy stuff should be the same, so elements would just weigh a lot closer to the mass of the protons and neutrons. Although if protons and neutrons still weigh the same, beta decay would be much more energetic.

So the question is: can he enter the scene, do everything he needs to do, and then leave without ever stopping? And possibly without running around in a repetitive pattern while he thinks?

Maybe Mirror Master's power involves forcing such a rotation on a target (always exactly halfway round for access to the mirror world, any other amount for discrete pocket dimensions)

I also feel like, even after overcoming the conceptual limitation as above, he should keep using mirrors because a) themes and b) secrets are fashionable in the super community.

  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics][physics]], *mirror matter*, also called *shadow matter* or *Alice matter*, is a hypothetical counterpart to ordinary matter.

  Modern physics deals with three basic types of spatial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry][symmetry]]: reflection, rotation and translation. The known elementary particles respect rotation and translation symmetry but do not respect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry][mirror reflection symmetry]] (also called P-symmetry or parity). Of the four fundamental interactions---[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism][electromagnetism]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction][strong interaction]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction][weak interaction]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation][gravity]]---only the weak interaction breaks parity.

  Parity violation in weak interactions was first postulated by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsung_Dao_Lee][Tsung Dao Lee]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Ning_Yang][Chen Ning Yang]] in 1956 as a solution to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaon#Parity_violation][τ-θ puzzle]]. They suggested a number of experiments to test if the weak interaction is invariant under parity. These experiments were performed half a year later and they confirmed that the weak interactions of the known particles violate parity.

****** Originally, my thought was that it was really just the regular world, as viewed from behind, and maybe someone gets stuck there.

In Flatland terms, a scalene triangle (with the appropriate superpowers) could visit Mirror Flatland by flipping all the way over, appearing to everyone else to suddenly be facing the other way; from his perspective, however, everything else would be backwards.

Or like the Mirror tracks in Mario Kart games. Unfortunately, the adventures of a guy who has trouble reading, writing, driving, and digesting food aren't that compelling by themselves, so my second thought was to add some metaphysical quirks to the setting. Maybe souls usually only exist on the one side. Maybe if you rotated only a tiny bit out of line instead of all the way around, you'd end up in a slightly distorted Smudged Lens World, with some real Hell Dimensions roughly perpendicular. Of course, at that point, it would also start to matter which /direction/ you were rotating in 4d each time you used the power if you ever wanted to make your way back.

"Esprit the Hyper-escalier"; Thanks to an encounter with an alien auto-doctor that decided to treat a neurological disorder the obvious way, your brain has been scooped out and replaced by an equal-sized chunk of computronium running a Moravec upload of your gray matter with the problem edited out. Computronium is, of course, orders of magnitude more efficient at computing than neural tissue, so even after paying the emulation "tax", this gives you the ability to slow your subjective perception of time down by a factor of up to 951 to one. This does /not/ make you able to move 951 times as fast. Your body is flesh and bone. At maximum speedup, you are effectively a lock-in case inside a statue that responds at the speed of a glacier.

**** I'm studying physics, so that'll be the topic of this particular comment.

Your comparison to the Higgs field is very interesting. Since the Higgs field is really slowing things down from the speed of light by adding mass, if the Speed Force was really just a way of manipulating the Higgs field, is could decrease individual mass + increase individual speed. Except that Barry obviously isn't losing mass as he speeds up, and one needn't be massless to travel at the speed of light.

By the way, there's huge warfare potential in the form of relativistic kill missiles. But I digress.

So yeah, the ability of things to go faster than the speed of light, but not travel back in time through any reference frame, is a little bit crazy. On the one hand, I'd like to imagine this as a nigh-perfectly Newtonian universe, where /yes/ two things can happen simultaneously because /yes/ there is an objective reference frame. But it /is possible/ to travel backwards in time, so.

Does something just go faster than light? The particle-carrier for the Speed Force, in this case, whether it be a modified Higgs repellent or something much more complicated. I can't even imagine what the Dimensional Barrier would be beyond the Time Barrier, and the ultimate Speed Force Barrier seems to be "instantaneous travel/existence" when really that should come before Time. Whatever.

Or - and this is probably the best theory, and also most in-tune with the DC Comics universe: an ancient race created the Speed Force. It's not natural at all, and it has very little to do with existing physics. It's an artificial imposition on top of the laws of nature, maybe a la /Fine Structure/. Easy transport, easy communication, that sort of thing, and while they could access it naturally, humans need to mutate (via chemical reactions or time travel) to gain access. [[#s][]]

***** I actually wasn't thinking the Speed Force and Higgs Field would be connected in any direct way. I was just using Higgs as an example of the kind of system I wanted the Speed Force to operate on. That is, the Speed Force gives things speed in the same way the Higgs Field gives things mass. Speed Force as Higgs-disruptor is also interesting, with its own separate set of physical ramifications and logical limitations.
