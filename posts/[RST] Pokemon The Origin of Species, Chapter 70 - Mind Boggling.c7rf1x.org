** Yep, gotta admit, the scene with Jason was great, and Ghost Pokemon are genuinely fascinating as you've portrayed them. Do seem to be by far the most interesting type of Pokemon. And the fact that Jason isn't strawmanned despite his fundamental opposition to a major aspect of Rationality is another point in your favor, it brings to mind Methods!Dumbledore a little bit.

Though I gotta agree that, despite the great scene that I'm glad I got to see, there wasn't much plot progression. These are all new characters that you're attempting to get us familiar with, and there is quite a lot of them.

** It interesting to me to see Red flawed in ways that are neither small, inconsequential character quirks or overwrought, tragic and crippling. He's got his view on the world which is incomplete and he uses as a crutch when examining new ideas, but he's come to rely on it precisely because it's generally better than anything else he's come across.

He doesn't always understand and click with other people (and the psychics seem particularly standoffish) and is cutely forthright in his attempts to bridge that gap. I feel like in a lot of stories we'd be repeatedly told that Red is bad at socializing and communicating, and then he'd try and make friends and say things that immediately bond people to him and we'd ride off into the sunset. It's nice to see him repeatedly try "I feel like you don't like me. Why not?" and actually get rebuffed.

*** It is good to see him try and get friends. If you don't try, you won't get anything after all. And good for him to actually try to understand others perspectives instead of trying to "correct" them which would be too adversarial.

However he's really not that socially suave perhaps due to his age. He looks a bit try-hard as expected since he doesn't have that much experience in that regard. He comes of as a value drain to others. He should have made small talk with them more, and then invite them for a coffee or something instead of knocking on their doors and be like "I feel like you don't like me. Why not?". Value can also mean providing good conversation as well, he doesn't necessarily have to be top dog in terms of psychic prowess.

Props to the author for creating such nuance.

​

Not many thoughts this time, I did like though that this one *didnt* end in "oh my god this seemingly-unrelated encounter taught me *just what I needed to solve the puzzle*". Rat fics often use that trope, and you should sometimes, but it can get predictable and feel unjustified if everything keeps slotting in nicely for intellectual revelation. Sometimes you learn something that only maybe sortof helps a little bit! It makes the insights, when they are discovered, feel a lot more earned when there is more to the struggle.

** I finally get the Sabina Gym training I've been waiting for, along with a surprising dose of how this universe handles Ghosts. Now I'm /much/ more interested in the latter. Excellent update! As much as I enjoy the Endbringer-like Legendary Birds or the various battles and characters, if the entire story was in the vein of this update I'd be equally interested.

I like how he's attempting to make friends, even if in a calculated and systemic matter. Aside from just the social benefits, the different perspectives will be useful in his learning process and training. Reminds me vaguely of Naming lessons in Rothfuss's "Kingkiller Chronicle", but with a teacher who is upfront in her intent and a bit more hands-off, subtly encouraging them to work together. Both seem oriented toward opening up understanding of the subconscious through changes in perspective.

Interesting tidbits, which surprisingly were all about the Ghosts:

- I'm wondering if the Ghosts are similar to the old theory about the Ghastly/Haunter/Gengar line. Namely, that the creature is from another reality (with vastly different natural laws) that slowly extends into ours. Gastly being it peering through and sticking a small amount of its essence through, Haunter being about halfway through, and Gengar is it having pushed all the way into our reality.
- This somewhat makes sense for things like Oricorio and Jellicent and Robinhoot (Decidueye), it's just going in the other direction, a creature from Red's reality using or extending itself and its abilities through the adjacent one that Ghosts are 'native' to. Jellicent uses it offensively in the form of 'draining life energy', as an alternative to using physical poisons like true jellyfish. Decidueye uses it in an offensive manner as well, sliding partially into an alternate dimension to avoid attacks, sneak up on foes, and as a direct method of attack by shooting the 'shadow' of its target. They might not cause the 'surrealism' effect unless they are using their abilities in some way, or simply because they are more than just the Ghost type.. but then Gastly wouldn't be as bad. Unless that's tied to its emotion...
- I wonder if our perceptions of them are backward. If they are from another reality, then the way their minds work might be as alien. In Red's reality, emotions follow from the mind. Structured and orderly minds have emotions that are responses to experience and stimuli. But perhaps the reality of the Ghosts is different, and as opposed to the mind creating the emotion, the mind is *based on* the emotion. The emotion itself is the building blocks of their mind, in which case each Ghost would have a 'prime emotion' that defines its existence. It's entire thought process might seem completely alien simply because everything is based around that concept. This would make it almost impossible to understand Ghosts fully as a whole, as each one would be a different 'kind' of mind based on an emotional state.
- Symbolically, Lampent being Fire type as well is tied to the emotion of hunger. Metaphorically, fire is the /hunger that can never be sated/. Whether Lampent is an incarnation of the emotion of hunger and thus has the Fire type or whether it is hungry because of the Fire type itself is up for debate, assuming any of this is right at all.

Occam's razor. Their minds being alien is an independent idea, and an excellent one, particularly the fire/hunger connection, but there's no need to introduce realities with different physical laws since poorly-understood psychic powers already exist, and all observed effects could be variants of those.

**** That razor's a bit dull.

You /do/ realize the Pokémon games are /built upon/ a multiverse model, yes? Each game is a separate universe. And I don't mean each game release, but /each person's individual playthrough of any game/. Within each of those universes are time travelling mon that can change the future, creatures which can both bend and /create/ time and space, creatures both native to /and imprisoned in/ alternate dimensions, mon that can travel between dimensions at will by running through wormholes, and world's linked to the original that follow vastly different natural laws but are still populated with mon. "Ghost essence" being from a slightly offset reality isn't exactly a hard sell, here.

Ultimately, it's not your or my job to decide how /this/ particular reality works--that's the job of the author. But the plausibility of it isn't nearly as far fetched as you would like to believe, and psychic powers may not explain absolutely everything 'weird' in the setting.

Or, you know, maybe they do. Who knows? Certainly not us. /Yet/.

***** You are, of course, correct about the nature of the game universe, but in this one, those are almost certainly mere legends, based on what Aiko says (Chapter 48): "Magic like [bringing back the dead] isn't real. Celebi, if it exists, probably doesn't actually travel in time. Jirachi can't grant wishes."

I expect more of the author than to introduce elements like time travel (I know there's teleportation, but it could be subluminal) and parallel dimensions, and if he did, I'd be disappointed. One of the things I love about the setting is its immersivity, which the game universe doesn't really aim for, and while some mystery is, of course, perfectly fine, those would certainly break it.

In any case, I think you've misunderstood my use of the razor. Your two ideas, alternate realities and alien minds, can be made independent, and if one only wants the latter, as I do, one don't need to conjecture the former.

*** Idea: it's actually the other way around.

Originally it evolved as a distinctive pattern naturally, only appearing to a human as a skull and crossbones due to the same reason we see faces everywhere. Then, the humans used the koffing and weezing symbol to mark poisonous substances because it was an instantly recognisable symbol from a poison type, and thus a symbol recognisable by people no matter their language or literacy. Which is very useful for warning symbols.

I should make sure to say that this is just a theory/idea, and the in-universe reason in the fic might be entirely different.

** Interesting--so gastly forces aphasia on anyone who looks at it? I think what just happened was that Red was seeing a Gastly as we know it, but was unable to match the shapes of its face with the words "eyes, mouth, fangs, tongue."

The lampent seemed to just be a little jarring to look at, like when you see someone in a pane of glass and you can't figure out if it's a mirror or not. I don't think it had the same dissociative effect that gastly had. So, surrealism is different from pokemon to pokemon--which makes sense, given that its whole thing is "a phenomenon that defies explanation."

On the other hand this chapter felt slow. My understanding of this pokemon universe has increased appreciably but it seems like the plot barely advanced. I wonder if once this is all complete, whether a reader would actually notice anything if they accidentally skipped this chapter.

** Alright I'm mixed up a little, what's the psychic ruleset on mind manipulation? Here's my vague understanding:

- Psychics can passively read surface emotions, very strong psychics can read surface thoughts. This does or doesn't require some level of merge?
- They can "merge" with minds to get a much deeper picture, though this is still pretty shallow.
- Red is unique in that he can... copy and retain the emotional state afterwards? Or can anyone do that and he's just particually good at it?
- Psychics can hard block mindreading (shield), though this requires some degree of conscious effort?
- Are shields more or less perfect, or can stronger psychics try to break them?
- Non-psychics can have some degree of imperfect defense, with training.
- They can't project "false" thoughts and feelings, they need to be feeling what they want to put out to some degree. This allows a fair amount of trust between psychics, and if Mewtwo's method could be replicated it'd be a cultural upheaval.
- They can quarantine memories and thought patterns (partitions), and give themselves amnesia by partitioning the memory of them partitioning.

Never surface thoughts without a merge, but no merge needed for emotions or mood with sufficient skill and ability. How much can be gleaned comes down to psychic's training/practice and innate mind-reading capabilities.

Yep, and there are levels of strength to the shield, though it's less about brute mental strength as much as finesse and creativity in finding ways to get around it or find a weak spot.

  Non-psychics can have some degree of imperfect defense, with training.

Correct, mostly by redirecting their thoughts or focusing on something hard enough that it's all that gets sensed.

So they'd know they've used amnesia and roughly when, and /could/ unpack it by breaking down the secondary partition and then breaking down the newly remembered regular partition. Although that'd be like "Hey let's remember all the shit I wanted to forget at once!" which is probbbbably inadvisable.

  Ah, so do Pokemon have trouble breaking human shields or are they just "powerful" enough to brute force it?
#+end_quote

Psychic pokemon are way, way more powerful than humans in virtually every way, but their "finesse" is terrible, so human shields can stand strong against virtually all of them. Ghost pokemon, on the other hand, don't giveafuq.

Yeah, there are basically two layers to partitions that are needed for it to be amnesia, but there is no "true amnesia" where you permanently lose the memory other than over time through natural memory degradation.

(Memories + Partition X, some idea of what Partition X is about)

(Memories + Partition X (which is of Partition Y), no idea what partition Y is about)

So right now Red has a partition for his emotional reaction to the deaths of Aiko and his dad, but it's only one partition, so he knows what it is and more-or-less what's behind it. If he were to make a second partition enclosing all that, he would actually forget it all until that partition goes down.

A little time on Google tells me you can see mountains on the horizon about 160 km away (100 miles), a good example being the view of the rockies from Fort Morgan, CO. They don't dominate the sky at this distance, but rather just barely visible.

I don't actuary know tyre distances between any of the places in tohjo though, so this may be hyperbole.

******* If we assume that the planet is a sphere, some simple trigonometry will give an approximate distance to the horizon, with the triangle defined by your viewpoint, the horizon, and the centre of the planet. Not sure offhand of the exact equations when both the viewer and viewed are elevated, but I imagine they're not too bad.

Edit: Yeah, it's not too hard. At the limit of your vision, your line of sight skims the planet at the horizon and then continues on until it touches the elevated point you're looking at. So, you simply have to calculate the distance from that point to its horizon, calculate the distance from your viewpoint to your horizon, and add the two.

For myself, at least, it's more an acceptance that there are things we don't understand, like FTL travel, or in this case the nature of Ghost Pokemon, and maybe we'll figure them out or maybe we won't, trying to work them out is good, but even if we don't succeed, I can be content. Traveling to the stars would be wonderful, but there's no "wormhole drive or bust." The priority, rather, is how we treat each other. Trite perhaps, but true.

** Jason noted that ghost Pokemon are dead /Pokemon/, not people, unlike what a lot of in game info suggests. I assume that in any world with things like ghost Pokemon, mythology would be built about about them being dead people, so I wonder what makes him confident they are Pokemon spirits.

Red and Jason both had very Daycare-man like attitudes about not being sure how the ghost pokemon emerge. I can't quite recall from the chapter were we learned about Magnemite origins, but have people actually ever witnessed/documented the spontaneous generation of tech or ghost pokemon? They both kind of talked about it like they knew the answer, but I didn't.

The description of ghost power was really interesting! A great imagining of an esoteric concept. I really like the thinking put into the semi-ghosts.

I really like that you had other characters explain why they dont like Red much because its kinda the same feelings I have. Having it pointed out will hopefully help him overcome that and grow.

I very much hope he can resolve the partition situation soon and be a mix of both. Putting the partition back up all the time seems to be a mistake to me... growing used to it being down and working through your issues slowly until he can get his ambitions back the old fashioned way with depression treatment has got to best route. Red is looking for a hotfix that doesnt work on the human mind and its only going to get worse. Its already negatively affecting his decisions and thought processes so im not sure how he continues to justify putting it off. The folly of a 12 year old I guess.
