** Can you briefly give our reasons for posting this story? I just wanted to know what you found rational about this before I start reading it. Thanks. ;)

*** The end of the story shows two different rational choices I've rarely see elsewhere. In one, [[#s][first spoiler]], and in the other, [[#s][second spoiler]] For the time it was written, the story was even a decent deconstruction of the whole 'Master PC' micro-genre, whose protagonists tended to resemble 'Steam Engine Time''s antagonist.

I will admit that, from the perspective of an LW reader, there's a lack of any interest in exploring Friendly/Unfriendly AI; which can probably be explained by being written before those concepts were much more than "Don't build SkyNet".

** Very NSFW. One of many stories sharing the conceit of the 'Master PC', and IMO, one of the best of them.

This story has a prequel, '[[http://www.mcstories.com/MasterPCMeeting/index.html][Meeting the Master]]'.

*** I'm reading the original story for context, and I have to say, it is the pinnacle of 90s high school erotica, much like the majority of ASSTR. The setting archive had a story about a nerd named 'Myron.' These people had a body image complex or something...
