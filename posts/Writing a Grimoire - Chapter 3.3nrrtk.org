/There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things./

/The next chapter will feature the most upvoted experiment proposed in the comment section/

--------------

Emma was instructing Matt and Daniel on how to draw the pentagram just like she had.

"I didn't finish it, it turned cold as soon as I completed the triangle in the middle. See, Ralph's pentagram has a triangle with a line through it. But do it exactly the way I did it anyway, just be careful."

Her hand was bright red where it had been in contact with the paper; it looked like she was going to get a blister from the cold burn.

Matt was looking at Daniel and Tom working. Before starting to fill in the symbols of the pentagram, Tom took a picture of it with his phone, and glanced up to look at Matt. "Is your hand okay?"

"I'm fine, I just don't think I can make a nice drawing like that with my finger the way it is.", Matt said with a nervous chuckle. The "paper" cut on his index finger was deeper than he cared to admit. He turned his attention over to the paper Emma had drawn the pentagram on.

It was still really cold. A piece of paper like that weighed, what, just a few grams? Matt didn't know the math to calculate how fast the wooden table would conduct heat to the paper, but his intuition said that the paper should have reached room temperature by now. A possible explanation occurred to him: the pentagram had not only changed the temperature of the paper, but also the mass, making it take longer to heat up.

Using a pair of compasses, Matt pierced the paper, and held it up in the air. It was just as heavy as you would expect a piece of paper to be. And it certainly wasn't /static/ or behaving like a thin sheet of steel like Ralph's suicide note.

"This is really strange", he said out loud. "It's just like before, except really cold. Does anyone know if paper freezes?"

"No, or at least card board in the freezer doesn't", Daniel replied.

"This is colder than your average freezer", Matt said, not taking his eyes of the paper dangling from the compass in front of him.

"Alright, only one line left", Tom interrupted, as he took great care not to touch the paper with his hands as he finished the drawing. There wasn't any visual indication that something had happened, but sure enough; "It's cold.".

"OK", Emma said. "Finish it. Draw the line through the middle triangle like on Ralph's pentagram."

Tom took the pencil and ruler and drew the line without too much difficulty.

"It worked! I can't pierce it with my compass. Maybe we should have drawn that last line before the triangle?"

Daniel looked down on his own half finished pentagram. Just a few hours ago, he had worried that he would be expected to sleep in the same bunk bed his roommate had hung himself from earlier that day. Now he had given up on sleeping tonight at all.

Emma inspected the paper Tom had drawn the pentagram on. It was still cold, but seemed to be getting warmer by the second. And it was definitely as hard as Ralph's note. Meanwhile, the paper she had drawn the incomplete pentagram on was as cold as ever.


** This time, I recommend the next actions to take is to:

- Experiment with the frozen papers. Will they ever warm up? Try burning them or putting them on top of a radiator. Check how quickly they warm up if it occurs. Check if other objects are actually getting colder while in contact with the paper. It seems like it should be, but you can't be too sure when dealing with magic.

- EDIT: I'd also touch a thermometer to the paper for it's temperature and putting the sheet in a bowl/tray of water (check it later if the water freezes).

- Experiment with the hard papers. Is it sharp? How sharp is it? Test it on metal, wood, diamonds even if you can get it (I'd be willing to spend money for this test). You want to know how hard it is on the Mohs scale based on what gems it can scratch or be scratched by.

- Experiment with the hard papers. Will they break under any amount of pressure? Try placing them as a bridge between two chairs or anything that's available to rest two edges of the paper on (don't let anyone hold it during the experiment). Does it snap or bend under any amount of pressure?

- Experiment with the hard papers. How elastic is it? This can be tested based on how high things can bounce when you drop it from a high height onto the paper. So I'd use a lot of materials such a a rubber ball, a metal object, wood, or some plastic pen to see how high it bounces off the paper compared to how high the same objects bounce off the floor to measure how well the paper is absorbing energy from outside forces.

  - Note that testing for the Mohs scale, pressure resistance, and elasticity are all very different [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness][notions of hardness]] which is why a diamond can be a 10 on the Mohs scale and still be easily crushed by a hammer.

I'd recommend the next pentagram experiment to be:

- Try drawing the pentagram the same way except with the lines drawn first, the top two triangles drawn and then the middle triangle.

EDIT: I should probably explain how to do a [[http://www.oakton.edu/user/4/billtong/eas100lab/hardness.htm][Mohs test]].

If the paper scratches the following:

- a fingernail, it's hardness is 2 to 2.5.

- a copper penny, it's hardness is 3.

- a nail, it's hardness is 4.

- a knife blade, it's hardness is 5 to 6.

- window glass, it's hardness is 5.5.

- a steel file, it's hardness is 6.5.

- a streak plate, it's hardness is 6.5 to 7.

- a quartz, it's hardness is 7.

- a diamond, it's hardness is 10 or higher.

Note that materials of equal hardness will have difficulty scratching each other or only make small scratches (which is why our fingernails can't scratch themselves).

This [[http://geology.com/minerals/mohs-hardness-scale.shtml][site]] gives good instructions about how to safely conduct the Mohs test.

**** Assuming that it's not just extremely cold and taking a while to warm up? Then increasing it. Which is a bad thing for the goal of preventing the universe's heat death.

But it's great news for anyone who ever wanted a super-efficient cooling system! Your laptops, refrigerators, TVs, air-conditioners, and any other technological systems are all now half as thick!

** 1. Fold a sheet of paper into a rectangular prism. Draw the pentagram on one side so that the paper stiffens. Does it remain in its rectangular form?

If the answer is yes, then do the following:

1. Stiffen three sheets of paper, A, B, C. A and C are flat, B is a rectangular prism. Place A and C at the ends of B so that you have a pillar with a top and bottom. Pile stuff on the top. Can you make the pillar come apart, either by collapsing B or having C be cut?

If the answer to the last question is "no", then you have an (infinitely?) strong building material.

NO. NONONONO!

/DO NOT/ experiment with blood and magic pentagrams until you understand the underlying principles. And honestly, I wouldn't do it even then.

**** That's only true if we assume that the myths about magic have any truth to them about blood. For all we know, a red marker will have the same effect as we imagined blood would have. Of course while blood being dangerous has a higher prior probability than for anything else, I'd still treat /any/ unknown, potentially dangerous, experimental procedure with caution and not just ones where we're using blood.

Of course, you're probably right that we should hold off on using blood until after a number of experiments have been done.

***** Oh, we should absolutely be cautious about any procedure.

However I think the discovery of 'magical' effects from drawing pentagrams, especially in such circumstances, bumps up the probability that our cultural background on magic is actually grounded in fact from negligible to considerable.

Given the state of the world and the kinds of powers (or Powers) required to keep this a secret, and it's not looking like the conspiracy is friendly. So I'd avoid blood magic; it could be catastrophic and there are safer tests to try first. Like FOOF etching.

** Next step is to study the transition point, see if there's any way to detect what exactly is happening with the stiff paper, cold paper, etc, at the moment of the 'magic shift' or even afterwards. Not sure how you'd go about that, but maybe start with simple things like an EMF detector, thermometer, etc. See how cold the cold paper is getting, see how stiff the stiff paper is getting. Are we talking about something with an infinite tensile strength (instant space elevator!) or does it have an upper limit? What sort of weird shit is happening with the atomic bonds?

Other basic tests should be done (carefully) as well. See if what making small changes to the patterns do. Change one symbol and see what happens when you finish the design. The center symbol seems to be the key, but can anything happen before you input the center symbol?

Also, the symbols (triangle with line through it, etc) are clearly basic alchemical symbols. They should probably research the symbology, test other symbols with a similar history of use in 'magic' what happens when you use the same inner symbols, but use a hexagram or septagram instead of a pentagram?
