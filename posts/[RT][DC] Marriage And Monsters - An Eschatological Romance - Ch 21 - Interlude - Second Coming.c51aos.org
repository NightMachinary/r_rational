** And the sasapariller strikes again!

Gotta say, I didn't realize it was Haley's perspective till the end since I was using firefox's reading mode. I thought for a second it was Sean who had revived like Jesus. At this point the story still makes sense, Aslan's used his giant pivot to kill Sean, but the narrator-switching shenanigans ensured that it wasn't his victory even after. I wonder whether Aslan even knows if that kind of thing is possible.

This is the longest arc of the story so far, and it seems to be coming to a head; I'm excited to see how the author will handle this. For truly rational story shenanigans, he would only use mechanics that are known to us - this pretty much necessitates that Sean be revived at the stone tablet.

*** Well, again, there are about 37 different ways to revive the dead or prevent death in Pathfinder, and we know that Haley has a munchkin's Pathfinder ruleset, so Sean's death doesn't really have weight with me. There are so many ways to reverse or avoid it. I think this is supported by the "I'd rather live forever with you" angle because that's entirely possible with the power Haley now has.

Though narratively it also makes sense that he would be revived at the tablet. I actually thought that would happen anyway and that he would hijack Aslan's resurrection, but I guess not.
