We already know Cat could raise intelligent undead well before she was to transition into Black Queen, and there's no reason to believe she's lost that power since. Her line about 'this one's already claimed' fits the theory, too.

This seems to me to just be begging for a Hero to show up with an aspect that would free the undead from their shackles mid-fight.

At which point Cat is surrounded by 4+ full adventuring parties of heroes with a high motivation to kill her, in poetic turnaround. Maybe she can cry out "Impossible!" when it happens. Redemption and vengeance for a full score of Heroes all at once in a single move is too tasty for the narrative-fairies to leave alone forever.

No, much safer to have them raised and sent to do good elsewhere on Cat's terms.

***** Raising dead is a big deal in the Guideverse. The only time we've seen it happen or mentioned is when Cat tricks a bunch of angels into declaring her a queen by going through one of the most recognizable patterns for gaining power. Yes, it's still known well enough that Cat can reasonably guess that winning the race for the sword would mean she has to be resurrected, but Black doesn't mention anything like resurrection at will in his "heroes are OP, plz nerf" rant. His interludes don't show any concerns about killed heroes returning to haunt him, while angelic intervention - something that already happened one and a half times in the series already - is mentioned as an element in the stories he heard, so we can safely assume for now that mass resurrection sin't in the cards.

Looks like it's just a superstition in the Guideverse, though.

The second bit comes from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/chapter-56-recess/][chapter 56 of book three]], where Catherine makes a drunk joke about naming Robber the first and only member of the Lesser Lesser Footrest Tribe.

Thoughts:

- Still kind of confused why she even bothered with this rigamarole in the first place. Why /not/ have them corpses at the bottom of the Hwarte before they even noticed? She won (granted, it wasn't an easy fight nor was it won by the skin of her teeth - but Cat won) but why risk it at all? I understand that she doesn't want to be like Black, but she seemed certain that their intent was to kill her from Day 1. The extent of the prep she took here means that she was fully expecting a fight. Does she think that she'll eventually get through to a band of heroes if she keeps plugging at it? That, to me, seems /kind/ of far-fetched.
- Good to see Larat as her left-hand man. Good interplay between him and Cat. I very much enjoy how she acknowledges him as her 'treacherous lieutenant,' and I wonder how she plans on dealing with him when the time comes.

#+begin_quote
  "/She rose, and as she did the air cooled and her flesh knitted back. She shed the burnt skin like a snake, and her pupils broke as fresh ones forced themselves forward./"
#+end_quote

- What fresh hell is this? A glamour? Winter magic fuckery? Name power nonsense?

- /Twice/ the Stalwart Paladin recieves an eleventh-hour superpower, threatening to deus ex machina his way into a victory, and /twice/ Cat clamps down on that shit. She's getting good at hero-killing, and it is simply glorious to behold.

- Stal-Pal's induction into the choir of Endurance reminds me of Black's legendary Motive Rant in Book 2, Chapter 36.

#+begin_quote
  "Gods, I've even heard of Choirs stepping in to settle a losing fight. The sheer fucking arrogance of it."
#+end_quote

- I am confused, however, at how she managed to gatecrash the Stalwart Paladin's shonen power-up. Good on her for breaking a potential Pattern, but again, what fresh hell was that? Masego memes? And who is the "beautiful, dark-skinned woman?" I'm half inclined to believe that might be Archer, but I'm not sure how she'd be able to help Cat and co. break into a heaven. Could it be Diabolist?

Practice, I think, is the most likely explanation. Both in directly fighting heroes in a relatively low risk setting, and also for trying to find a way to actually convince them. Butchering hero's works well enough in the short term, but eventually her goal has always been to rise above the petty good/evil squabbles and /actually help people/. If she is to accomplish this, however, it will eventually require some accomodation with the nominally good side.

**** Judging by the behavior of the innkeepers it also seems Cat's getting a lot of good PR out of public hero-killing. The anti-Evil wife was practically rolling her eyes at the foolishness of heroes, calmly accepting that this new lot was doomed. Then there's the husband, talking about how everything is fine until these meddlesome foreigners stick their noses in.

Feels like we're making good progress towards that cultural victory.

  Why not have them corpses at the bottom of the Hwarte before they even noticed?
#+end_quote

Because to have power over them (to either have them join her or to turn them into Winter zombies) she needs to actually make the offer and/or them to be in Callow.

#+begin_quote
  What fresh hell is this? A glamour? Winter magic fuckery? Name power nonsense?
#+end_quote

Probably Winter pushing through, likely at the cost of Cat's agency (notice how her descriptions channge).

  I am confused, however, at how she managed to gatecrash the Stalwart Paladin's shonen power-up.
#+end_quote

Remember the one time /Cat/ tried to get an eleventh hour superpower? Well, an epiphany triggered early has a cost to it, and angelic intervention seemingly follows similar rules, which allowed Cat to follow Iason in his empowering dream sequence, just like the demon of Corruption followed Cat into hers.

** Reposting from the other thread since I just realized what made me feel that mild disgust:

May I take a moment to bitch about how the heroes treat the locals like bloody NPCs? Seriously, I get that Iason is a former lay brother, and Lergo is a highborn, and more likely to be antisocial as a mage, but them being annoyed at the innkeepers was more offputting to me than their lack of any solid plan. Cat may have cut them off early when they started explaining their reasoning, but what she would have never done is resorting to using the verbal equivalent of "skip dialogue" button on the elderly couple, and not just because they're Callowan.

Remember the one time Cat tried to get an Aspect too early? Well, an epiphany triggered early has a cost to it, and angelic intervention seemingly follows similar rules, which allowed Cat to follow Iason in his empowering dream sequence, just like the demon of Corruption followed Cat into hers. How much of this is due to Akua' lingering influence or Catherine being her fairy opposite is up to debate.

** Wow, this is really bad.

- Opening with a meaningless quote, attributed to a fictional character I neither know nor care about.
- Starting with a giant infodump, about characters and places I don't know or care about yet.
- Constantly Telling instead of Showing.
- Bombarding the reader with so many Dumb Fantasy Proper Nouns that the narrative is impossible to follow.

If I picked this up in a bookstore, I would have stopped reading by the third line of the first paragraph. People think this is good storytelling?

EDIT: I am an idiot.

From other comments in this thread, and the lack of clear labelling in the text itself, I assumed that this was the prologue to the first book in the series, re-posted for posterity. I judged the story from that perspective. I realise now that this was a mistake. I have not read any of the previous books - I intend to rectify that soon.

Mea culpa.

*** While, ideally, eventually having the book published is Erraticerrata's end goal, it's still a web series. A web series that's currently on its fourth book, so a lot of story-related names and terms (that were referenced before multiple times) are to be expected.

Partially the infodump is caused by the introduction of a new PoV, and partially it's the writing style leaning heavily on its medium, but I'd say that the end result has enough story told through interactions. Besides, the heroes assuming a lot of stuff without checking is kind of the point of this chapter, it makes sence that most of the dramatic buildup would be mainly in the central character's head.

I see from your comments on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] that you, indeed, picked up the story likely without reading the three previous books. While your other comments suggest you don't come to discussions like that to enjoy the read, did you consider starting with the beginning, to see if the more down-to-earth perspective would make the narration easier for you?

EDIT: Sorry, I thought you /did/ know that this is the latest chapter, and made some seriously uncharitable assumptions about you. Upvoted.

*** ... while I have seen a series where an interlude or a prologue to a middle book makes sense when flying in blind, I cannot name more than a handful. That's a really high standard.

I'm having trouble guessing why you would apply that standard to this? This isn't a bookstore or even a standalone book.

More to the point, please point me to the web-fiction that meets your standard. I'd like to read it.

*** Regarding the edit, after your comment I reread that prologue while "forgetting" what I know about it.

Yeah, it would be really really bad that way.

But most of the stuff that's "told" is something the reader is supposed to know already and the point of it is to show (and not tell ;) ) how the events we know of are perceived by others.

** Frankly, I really hope a hero comes along that's actually smart enough to bring a massive fuck off army along with them to burn down the country around Cats ears. The endless villain wank in this story started getting old around the same time it stopped bothering and just started putting her against other baddies. And now it's come back because we haven't had enough of this story being smug and boring.

*** "Bring a massive fuck off army along with them to burn down the country around Cats ears" is exactly the kind of thing she tries to prevent. Besides, a hero resorting to shit like this is what you no doubt would call villain wank.

Seriously ,what's so smug about the protagonist trying to both avoid perpetuating the war "for the greater Good" and to prevent crazies from getting power?
