[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/24233583]] Just updated, author says more coming soon

For those who don't know what this is about: Overwatch fanfic with significant transhumanism, anti death, pro rationality and this chapter specifically contained magic is real discusion between 2 opposing sides


** Huh. It's from the author of /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/][CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good]]/. I advice mentioning it when reposting the story to better advertise it.

** I do love this story, mostly because looks at all the weird stuff happening in Overwatch and tries to actually explain it. It's awesome, especially Angela's character and how well she's been written (even though she's rarely the POV character). T

The only complaint I can possible think of is actually pretty unreasonable, because it's about my favorite character in the game. I kind of feel like Winston, being a super-intelligent gorilla from the moon who has built shield generators and rocket packs, and done a a considerable amount of work on Athena (I'm not sure if he designed her, or just helped keep updating her) should be a bit smarter? So far he's worked wonderfully as a short of quasi rational viewer stand in that helps explore the setting and characters, but I can't help but hope Winston gets to show off his own intellectual chops soon enough.

*** It has been mentioned that he has. In chapter 14, the hostile AI Lakshmi says "Winston's work manually improving her Turing conversational skills had masked a true growth in intelligence," making it seem more like he has been working with her, just hiding some of her growth.

**** Exactly! I feel like a dude working so closely with an AI would have a decent understanding of the brain, at least enough to notice he's been bamboozled a bit earlier than he did in the story.

** I've never played Overwatch, and while that makes some of this story confusing (or completely nonsensical) I love what I've read so far!

*** If you're willing, you can probably just read the overwatch character bios (there's like 23 and they're each like 500 words max) and that should give you enough background to understand the story. Bonus points if you watch the Overwatch cinematics too.

** I really enjoy this fic as well. I see the author said he rebuilt his buffer so I'm assuming that means He has an update schedule of some sort. Would you happen to know if that'sethe case?
