Posted here because I figure seeing how the bot posts will show people how they tend to write, as well as an example of a really cool AI. the format is:

#+begin_example
  +/u/user_simulator /u/whateveryourusernameis
#+end_example

For example: +[[/u/user_simulator]] [[/u/gaberockking]]

Harry wouldn't be available for the story is not high enough that most of you and found that you will need to write something that makes them the same period of time. Or yet another standpoint the integer zero is a nice comment from HPMOR!Quirrell. You have just proposed literally the longest finite story ever proposed in the first obvious reason why they'd extend over to that starting from just 300mcg of melatonin total, and increased my dose over time. The document makes around as good as my estimate of audience ability went up, my transparency went back to the second, to the best of my knowledge or consent.

Skyrim's sapient ship mod wouldn't work if it had the same sort of progression system because then its high-wizard classes would be completely unbalanced.

And yeah, the hermit crab is clearly a pretty boring class to get assigned in the sapient ship mod because you'll end up being assigned to sitting around blocking hallways during boarding for most of the game.

** It sounds like N-gram generator, so I would not call this "AI." It's not that it doesn't understand the meaning of words (let alone the phrases or ideas constructed), but it doesn't even understand grammatical sentence structure and parts of speech.

It just so happens that using N-grams with N >= 3 generates something that has reasonable parts of speech (most of the time), so as our brains are processing each word in linear order, they're (most of the time) thinking, "hmmm, maybe something down the line will enable this to make sense" rather than red flags like "wait, there's no way that word would go there." Let alone when we look at the sentences as a whole and see problems like "that's the wrong form for a prepositional phrase" or "that's a number/tense mismatch" or "um, this sentence all dependent clauses and no main verb."

In short, what's amazing is the human brain's ability to keep trying to find patterns even when its barely there.

**** An N-gram generator is a particular kind of Markov chain. Let's say this thing runs on trigrams (*): three tokens in a row, where tokens are probably words and punctuation in this case. It takes the training data and estimates transition weights for each Markov chain state (the first two tokens) to the final token of the trigram. Now it has a new set of final two tokens. Rinse and repeat.

(*) Trigrams are very likely given that the training data -- all the reddit posts the user has written -- is not that large. If it used 4-grams or longer, almost all states (the previous 3 tokens) would occur once or not at all. This is called data fragmentation. Trigrams already have data fragmentation issues, and so there's all sorts of fallback approaches to smooth the trigram transition weights with bigram weights.

***** Huh. While that's true, the only one it came up with was Donjon. The shrine/skull thing is for Fallen London, which is much closer to interactive fiction. The second is with it. The fourth is with donjon. The fifth is for Dustforce. The perspective one is css trouble I was having. 1.3 is for terraria which is barely an RPG. The patch and coding is for an incremental game called Sandcastle Builder, then the next is for one called Kittens Game, and I have no idea on the last one.

Overall, I find that I am of course if the cause of your examples except the first episode/chapter. Would you think that this is the one using them. In other words there's no testable difference between what you can get around those two points. If you think that your position is an actual transformation, allowing Naruto to transform himself into things like shuriken, which is what's completely unbelievable. I don't think you can predict the central plot of Naruto as rational when his actions are so old and relatively unimportant that it's ok.
