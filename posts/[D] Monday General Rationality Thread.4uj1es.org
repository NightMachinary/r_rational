Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** The [[https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers][vlogbrothers]] (John and Hank Green's popular YouTube channel) *[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dtzfu9RpTs][tried something interesting]]* last week that I thought I'd mention.

Hank was sick of the cesspool of hate and intolerance that is YouTube video comments, and suggested that the reason they are so universally terrible is the YouTube comment promotion algorithm, which tends to feature the comments that get the most replies. Due to reasons explored in Scott Alexander's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][The Toxoplasma of Rage]] or CGP Grey's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc][This Video Will Make You Angry]], this inevitably rewards the most controversial, divisive comments instead of the comments that bring the most to the conversation.

Having no control over YouTube's algorithms, Hank asked vlogbrothers viewers to game the system, by replying with a single plus-sign to high-quality but uncontroversial comments. It's been working fairly well so far at the stated goal of vastly improving the quality of the comments that appear on the front page of their videos.

It has had the side-effect of making genuine discussion difficult, because substantive replies get buried in a sea of "+"s, but (a) that's still a strict improvement, since there was no genuine discussion happening /before/ either, because no one was ever /seeing/ the good comments, and (b) that's a potentially fixable problem; e.g., someone has already written a [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-plus-filter/lhjhfienbklemmabjgkepbiihihnhacg][Greasemonkey script]] to hide all "+" comments.

But I've never seen a legitimately pointless, legitimately purely hateful comment at the top of a youtube comments section.

And frankly, sorting reddit by controversial isn't really a bad experience either. It would be nice to have both options on youtube as on reddit of course.

** I just caught up with A Hero's War and it made me wonder. Does anyone know of a book/website that is a "Guide to the Modern Era"? Containing most of the details you would need to build up an industrial civilization from scratch. It seems like it could be really interesting to read. Also, anyone who has made a real life "tech tree" civilization style. If it doesn't exist, it could be a cool variant on the "How Stuff Works" style books, as a tool to teach kids (and adults) about how the world around them works and was made.

*** I've been collecting resources about that subject for a while. As Traiden04 said, Dartnell's book is exactly what you're looking for. I can also recommend The Way Things Work by C. van Amerongen. There's another version of these same set of books which you can find as How Things Work Volumes, I to IV by Roger Jean Segalat but the other one is cheaper.

From the amazon.com description:

#+begin_quote
  These volumes are not a reference in the ordinary sense. They have been designed, instead, to give the layman an understanding of "how things work," from the simplest mechanical functions of modern life to the most basic scientific principles and complex industrial processes that affect our well-being. The result is, we believe, a unique series - a graphic and original introduction to the modern world of technology. Here you will find the answer to the question posed by the inquisitive child who wants to know how a vacuum cleaner or refrigerator works, or by you yourself, puzzled by the complexities of lasers or the secrets of Polaroid color photography. The various subjects are shown in the list of contents, overleaf, and may prove useful for cross-reference purposes. In addition, there is a full index at the end of each volume, in which both machines and topics are listed alphabetically.

--------------

Not exactly related but "mechanical thinking" has been always a weak spot of mine. I've never been good with cars or other mechanical things and someone interested in "making things from scratch" will need to get good at that kind of thinking. Here's some books I've found that will help:

- Basic Machines and How They Work by the U.S. Navy
- The How and Why of Mechanical Movements by Harry Walton and Ray Pioch
- Mathematics Meets Technology by Brian Bolt
- Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts

** I'm approaching US politics as if I'm reading a rational fiction, and trying to interpret everyone's actions like that.

I have hit a brick wall with one action though - Hillary appointing DWS as co-chair of her campaign, literally the day after revelations of collusion. What possible reason could Hillary have for doing this so soon, it looks like a terrible mistake to me.

Obviously she was going to give something to DWS in exchange for running the DNC in her favor, and as hush-money so DWS wouldn't talk about the collusion. By why appoint her to the campaign? And if you're going to appoint her to the campaign, why the day after corruption news? It seems like such a stupid move by probably the most adept player in the game of thrones.

*** Assuming that all players are playing some game of four dimensional chess at cross-purposes from each other, which is definitely not the case:

Hillary doesn't make obvious mistakes and she doesn't make blunders. So why in the world would she do something so contrary to party unity and so blatantly corrupt? Simple: Debbie Wasserman Schultz is also a player in the game. She didn't get where she was without her own political accumen, and in fact gained her position despite ranking very unfavorably among contenders. The best thing for Hillary would be to burn DWS in effigy ... but DWS has prepared for this eventuality and made some very pointed threats which Hillary is inclined to believe that DWS would follow through on. (The nature of these threats is a matter of almost pure speculation, but it's entirely possible that DWS has "dirt" that isn't out in the open and hasn't been exposed by Wikileaks. Alternately, she might have been willing (or perceived as willing) to torch the convention to the ground and spike any chance of Hillary becoming President by simply fanning the flames of disunity on any cable television channel, all of which would be happy to play host to internal party conflict.)

The optics are horrible for Hillary, but that indicates that the alternative would be worse.

***** Politicians make big, gaping mistakes all the time which are unconnected from any plan of action or concrete motivation. They do things that are simply, objectively wrong given their stated and implied preferences. It's tempting to think of politicians as being Machiavellian figures weaving this intricate web of alliances, and some politicians even like to see themselves that way, but even from the outside there are too many screw ups. This is why people get undone by sex scandals so often or make huge gaffes that blow up in their faces.

Hillary Clinton has debatably weaseled her way out of a number of scandals, but many of those scandals happened because of her own idiocy and incompetence. The worst is probably the Bosnia sniper fire scandal, where she lied about having been under fire /for a thing that cameras were around for/. A rational politician might lie, but not for something that they'd be so easily caught out for, so it's probably the case that Hillary just made an unforced error. For a lot of things that happen to politicians, a combination of Hanlon's razor and Occam's razor lead you to the belief that politicians are sometimes just not that clever.

*** An alternative to the others' ideas is that Hillary simply realized that the loss in votes spread out across the country would not matter compared to the concentrated loss in Florida without DWS. This state is far more in danger of turning Red than most others, and getting the Old Jewish Vote isn't a sure thing.

As anecdotal example, most of my family/friends are voting Hillary (many with their noses very firmly pinched), but a decent amount of the extended Jewish network I'm in contact with is on the fence or pro-Trump.

There's also the party-wide belief, reinforcing her behavior, that nothing to the left of wherever the Democratic Party is (and that location doesn't /really/ matter) /ought/ to exist.

** Earlier today I was thinking and driving, when I realized that the concept of a near future post need society has a severe problem.

The mass of unskilled labor is too great for there to be a need for innovation in agriculture. Food costs have been much flatter than most other costs over the last thirty years or so.

Innovation in agriculture is required to feed a post need society with minimal or no human labor.

Expenses drive innovation.

Expenses are kept constant by excess availability of cheap labor. In the US this cheap labor is normally kept cheap by utilization of illegal immigrants.

It seems to me that illegal immigration is preventing us from developing and utilizing technologies that can lead us to a post need society.

*** As I'm in my 3-5pm work slump, I'll take the "expenses drive innovation > agricultural labour is cheap because of illegal immigration > less innovation in agriculture" theory to be true and reply with some cached knowledge rather than think too hard about it:

The US isn't the only place where innovation happens. In NZ for example, our primary export/industry is the dairy industry, which we know is not sustainable (fertiliser run-off, water scarcity, overseas competition etc) and rather negatively impacts our "clean and green" image thereby impacting tourism (fewer rich people come to fly-fish in our rivers for example). So a large proportion of the government's and grant organisation's science investment/funding goes towards agriculture and dairy innovation. As a result, NZ has done some of the leading research in certain aspects of the industry like twinning vaccines to produce more livestock, kiwifruit plant varieties and milking equipment as some examples.

So competition and challenges in particular regions can drive innovation - then areas with less drive for innovation in those industries can take advantage of it.

*** You do have somewhat of a point, though all immigration, not just illegal, reduces labor costs. I think that the wage pressures of immigration will probably level off though, particularly because of remittance. If immigrants are sending money back home, then it seems likely the pressures to immigrate away from the home country will be reduced. Similar to how people freaked out about employment pressure from China, but now China's wages have risen enough that it isn't necessarily cheaper to employ there. Does that make sense? I guess the best thing would be to look at historic precedence to see how it has previously effected the economy.

**** Sure. You describe a market driven labor wage. If the economy of home countries gets stronger, and/or the economy of the host country gets weaker, financial incentive to immigrate grows less intense.\\
Still, farm wages will have to go up immensely before automated pickers for crops that are not fairly simple to pick. Bushes, trees, perennials, etc. We can already do most grains with machines, and a lot of annuals. But for post need, machines will need to be able to plant, tend, pick, and process crops.

A secondary concern - as more low-medium wage jobs are eliminated due to wage costs making them attractive automation targets, I think a lot of those people will be forced into agriculture jobs, keeping the wage low on farms even without excessive immigration.

***** I think you are right, and I see two main forces fighting the other direction. One is increasing demand for food as countries develop, and the other is education. If education was cheap, many people in the farming labor market will want more than the very low wages of their current position, and could move up into higher paying industries. Neither of these look like particularly powerful forces, as historically social mobility is just not that high and increased food demand doesn't seem bigger than increased productivity.
