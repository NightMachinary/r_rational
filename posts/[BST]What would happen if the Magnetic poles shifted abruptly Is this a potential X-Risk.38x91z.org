I'm trying to design a rational "fantasy world" in which a series of catastrophic events occur to cause the creation of "classic magical races." (By that, I mean I'm building [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ofzm9/of_medics_and_magics_story_synopsis_for_a_new/][my own version]] of elves, dwarves, goblins, orcs, etc. from the ground up.)

So far I have a magical version of the Singularity, a nuclear threat, a bioengineered microorganism and some radical climate change types of effects in mind for my world-building.

I've been toying with magnetic pole reversal as well, but I'm not convinced its as deadly as I initially thought before I started researching it.

I'm tapping the collective rationalist brainpower for physics expertise on this issue. * Is sudden Geomagnetic reversal an existential risk? * What are some potential causes? * What are some potential side effects?

  What would happen if the magnetic field of the Earth suddenly changed?

  #+begin_quote
    If the magnetic field of the Earth suddenly changed, and this DOES happen naturally every 250,000 years or so, the consequences would be fascinating. For life, we can see from the fossil record that the past field changes had no significant effect on living organisms. This is most curious because the field reversal ( North magnetic pole shifting to antarctica and the South magnetic pole shifting to the arctic region in the Northern Hemisphere) one might expect the field to go to zero strength for a century or so. This would let cosmic rays freely penetrate to the Earth's surface and cause mutations. This seems not to have had much effect in the past, so we probably don't really know what is going on during these field reversals. There have been a dozen of them over the last few million years, documented in the rock which has emerged and solidified along the mid-Atlantic Ridge where continental plates are slowly separating. These epochs form parallel bands all long the ridge where the rock has stored a fossilized image of the local orientation of the Earth's magnetic field for the last few million years.

    Magnetic field wandering would let the aurora borealis occur at any latitude, but other than that there would be no noticeable effects other than changes in the amount of cosmic rays that penetrate to the ground. Even this effect is minimal because we can visit the Arctic and Antarctic and only receive a slight increase in cosmic rays. So long as the strength of the field remains high during this field wandering event, the effects should be pretty benign.

    The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by the rotation of the Earth's molten iron-nickel core. The period of field reversal is determined by the rotation rate of the core and its electrical conductivity. If you were to change either one of these, the field orientation, strength and '250,000 year cycle' would be increased or decreased. We also know from studies of the Sun's magnetic dynamo, that this phenomenon can change abruptly as it did during the 'Little Ice Age' on the Earth a few hundred years ago. There were no sunspots observed on the Sun for 50 years or so, then rather abruptly, the familiar 11-year cycle started-up over the course of a few decades. A similar 'chaotic' phenomenon may occur with the Earth 'suddenly' loosing its magnetic field for a few million years. Already, geophysicists have begun to notice a decline in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, suggesting that the next field reversal epoch may be about to start. It may, however, take a long time to get here, and we don't really know if the decline is just a natural, ripple, or the portend of something far more sinister.

** Migratory birds and such which rely on a magnetic sense to guide them over the ocean will be more likely to get lost when they're blown off course by wind. You'll have a greater dispersion of species. Many will still reach their destination using geographical landmarks.

There will be a minor increase in cancer. The atmosphere will protect most from cosmic rays. A magnetic field is hardly that great a protection. It accelerates some cosmic rays. Plus it'll still be there, albeit in a weakened form.

You'll have aurea borealis in all sorts of unusual places as the weakened magnetic field moves from place to place.

During the shift you'd have a fluctuating mixture of fixed and wandering poles that people could use to move around.

Satellites would be pretty fucked, with reduced protection from their local star's cosmic rays and no or little atmosphere to protect them.

*** Could you even call it Aurora Borealis/Australis at that point?

(btw, this totally fits with my idea of magical 'ley lines' visualized throughout the sky as magnetic poles all thrown off-kilter with local N/S regions.)

**** To clarify, birds have excellent eyesight and primarily rely on their memory of weather conditions and geographical landmarks and stars and polarized light and other birds to find where to go. They do have some trouble during solar storms that disrupt the magnetic field, but only on cloudy nights. Otherwise they can rely on other senses. It's not inherently going to be deadly to migratory birds.

I actually don't think you'd see this at all. Migratory species use the magnetic field, true, but it's not a blind instinctual "fly toward magnetic north" or whatever. Instead, they use the field to maintain heading, especially when they can't use other clues like the sun or landscape features. And they learn the pattern. Since pole reversals happen over the course of years, they would likely adjust to the changes as they come.

**** Yeah, but what if they're at the ocean and wind blows them off course and then their magnetic sense is attracted to a different north pole? That sort of thing would make it harder to adapt.

***** What I mean is, unless the magnetic field actually changed while they were flying, I think they'd be ok. It's like "take off at magnetic heading X, use it as reference to keep going in that line"...and they rely on other mechanisms as well.

But you are probably right. If the field was weak or multipolar, there'd be more chance of getting lost in bad flying conditions. I just don't think it's a death sentence.

****** Yeah. It wouldn't be a death sentence. With that, as I said, I'd mostly expect it to result in a lot of unusual birds and animals in places they probably shouldn't be. That's something that you could show in story that might interest some people, especially if some of those species had fun genetic engineering/ magic.

** Pole reversals happen all the time (geologically speaking). It's really not a big deal, and you never see effects in the fossil record.

** It would be a very strange few hours, followed by a few days/weeks trying to figure out where the new poles are (This will take awhile because the shift is not instantly and there will likely be several competing poles for a short period before it settles down. It is not likely to be a true reversal in that the current north pole will become the south pole and vice versa, but it will probably be in the same general area). Oh, and I'm afraid you are going to need a new compass.

But yeah, for humans? Weird lightshow, and a slightly increased risk of cancer, and some confusion for hikers trying to use a compass. We'd be fine. Maybe some sats would be trashed if they aren't properly shielded, but most are for obvious reasons.
