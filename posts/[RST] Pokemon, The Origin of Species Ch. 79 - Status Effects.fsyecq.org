** /sigh/

Previously at the end of the last chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Red!"

Beginning of current chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Red chapter. Who cares about Blue? I just want to get to Red already!"

End of current chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Blue!"

Beginning of the next chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Blue chapter. Who cares about Leaf? I just want to get to Blue already!"

End of the next chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Leaf!"

Having three protagonists is doing wonders for your story with the interweaving natures of Blue's, Red's, and Leaf's coming-of-age journey/self-discovery, but at the end of every chapter, I'm tormented with the /need/ to find out what happens next to that person and have to wait at least 3 chapters to find out!

  He'd missed his chance at a vulpix yesterday, but got a houndour just before they broke for camp instead, which he's definitely satisfied with.
#+end_quote

Is this a nod to version exclusivity in the games? Very cheeky, if so!

Also, I was racking my brain trying to think of what the new pokemon could be, and was definitely thrown off by Blue and co.'s guesses. But then I finally thought of porygon, which would make total sense. Blue's list of prizes lines up with the games, so it would make sense for porygon to be the big prize. And it fits Silph's claim of stolen goods, as they invented porygon. If my guess is correct, I'm very interested in seeing how it plays into the story, as it's one of my favorite 'mons!

Is the "Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperium" distinction of kinds of status something you believe and are trying to transmit, or just something you've made Erika believe?

It's a model of social power that seems useful in a descriptive sense. I think there are natural "joints" between power from status/law/personal power, for example, and so the Roman's framework makes sense to me.

** Caught up in chapters recently and I can see that I'm going to experience withdrawal symptoms every month. Have to say that this story became remarkably good from what I considered to be shaky beginnings.

There seems to be a deliberate tension in this chapter between the strict and the permissive that I found very effective. I was expecting hippies and got lectured on Roman civil ideas about power by a kimono-wearing Japanese Pokemon gym leader who makes her own possibly mind-altering bayleef tea. Hope she keeps being oddly normal.

[[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]], Do you think you can find time to make a concise list of the main influences (of any kind) on this story, especially on the main characters? I remember Dawkins being quoted by Red. I get the feeling that many of the ideas presented so far have gone over my head because I'm unfamiliar with the cultures and people behind them.

  At 29 she's the youngest member in the Indigo League, and he remembers being star-struck by her the last time they met.
#+end_quote

This is playing a bit of a ruckus with my mental model of gym leaders' ages, though. Wasn't it said in one of Mewtwo's chapters that Sabrina was a teenager when he awakened, and that now that ten years have passed she is in her twenties? I remember it being something like "A lot has changed in the last ten years, some people have gone and some new arrived ...... Sabrina has changed too, she is now a gym leader and has grown from being a teenager and is now in her twenties." Then, How can Erika be 29 and the youngest?

Also, a bit of a side note, but, What about Bugsy? Johto's leaders are part of the Indigo League too, aren't they?

** I can't help but feel like him accepting the deal without talking to the group is a mistake. Like for sure the group is arguably "his" but it feels like an over commitment of his uhh authority? i'm not sure what the word would be. But like he has de facto leadership, but i'm not sure that he has or explicitly has the kind of authority over the group to make this kind of long term commitment in the entire group's name.

Like he outright states that he doesn't know parts of the group that well and that he is to a certain degree alienated(?) distanced(?) something by the fact that he's the trainer leader of a group of trainers. There's a conversation about not overstepping the bounds of your authority and that moment feels like he may have.

Also do we see Erika drink from the bayleef tea? It would be kind of a multi-level reference that she was "causing a status effect" on Blue while negotiating and that i'm not sure if Blue himself was wary enough about it, while it's not as egregious as doing the same for say Koga the poison master it is kind of hard for us to not make the leap of Gym and Gym Leader doing drugs to mildly drugging someone while negotiating.

And looking at the wording of their agreement, I don't think it's binding on anyone else. He said that, "Everyone on my group can get in on it," and he certainly viewed that as a great opportunity for them, but if someone said, "No, I'm just going to face the gym like normal," then nothing stops that and Erika would still keep Blue in an advisory role.

** Status eh?\\
Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperius.\\
Can't say those concepts feel very intuitive to me. But I don't deal with status much. This memeplex made sense to me, when I read it thru it all ages ago:\\
[[https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/men-and-status-an-introduction/]]\\
Forgot almost all about it, though.\\
Potestas maps to ascribed status.\\
Auctoritas possibly maps to achieved status?\\
But I don't see how Imperius maps to Embodied status.\\
Though the ascribed/achieved/emboided trio is explicitly a model for male status, so not something that would work for Erika 🤔

I think a Champion challenging a Professor would also not work for the same reason, the Champion doesn't have any Imperius in the academic realm.

** Really good chapter! I like the way it seems to be going in this gym; Erika's laying out the ulterior motives in the conversation and then talking Blue around to a mutually beneficial arrangement was super interesting, as is our seeing more of Blue's attempts to avoid being, well, the rival character who stomps you down. I'll gladly look forward to next month!

** I really like how much development is going into Blue's relationship to Leaders and Gyms in general. I wonder if it will play into Blue's eventual running of Viridian Gym.

** I'm doing a reread, and in chapter 9 it says that Surge gives out flying licenses. Did none of them get certified because of the disaster? Or are their pokemon not capable of carrying them yet?
