Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Heya [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I'm pretty new here. Started with being linked to HPMOR via [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], which led to reading Rationality: From AI to Zombies, and I've chewed through most of the weekly challenges now and a lot of the "major works."

I really like rationalist fiction because it is a powerful weapon in the ongoing memetic war; when it's done well it spreads useful information that may even immunize against bad information. I'm now inspired to try my hand at a rationalist fanfiction of One Piece, but I'm still at the planning stage. *Warning - Some One Piece spoilers from this point on.*

The first reason I want to do a rationalist fanfic of One Piece is that it already has many of the rational fiction elements described in the sidebar: the characters and their desires are usually the drivers of plot, factions (Navy, Pirates, World Government) are nuanced and defined by their values, characters solve problems through intelligence and resources (The Straw Hat crew commonly uses deception, disguise, and planning during all the episodes leading up to Luffy finally beating up the Big Bad, and many antagonists do as well), and the world has consistent rules that it sticks to (for the most part - still not clear why Shanks lost an arm to a Sea King if he's such a badass). Because of this, I think it will be easier to reshape the story to universally fit those characteristics while still keeping to the broad strokes of the original plot.

One Piece has a lot of strange aspects that are left mysterious. Devil Fruits are the first example of this - as far as I know, the series has yet to explain their origin or why touching the sea or seastone turns them off - but there are more: world geography (The world is mostly islands, but humans evolved there? No way.), some of the strange abilities the characters have even without Devil Fruits (Nami's weather sense, Zorro's very super-human strength, Usopp's intuitive ballistic accuracy), super-size animals (Sea Kings, giants), and the explicit mystery of what happened during the Lost Century.

I have ideas about how to plausibly explain all of these (though some of them are going to be like the invisibility cloak in HPMOR, basically hand-waved magic/sufficiently advanced technology), and I've chosen my explanations with the goal of pushing the story into areas of concern to the rationalist community, in particular existential threats. *My first request for responses, then, is for ideas on other themes to include to maximize the memetic impact of the story.*

Besides these explanations of fantastic elements of the world, it wouldn't be a particularly good piece of rationalist fiction without the characters using rationalist techniques and methods that the reader can emulate. HJPEV started off knowing most of the techniques that he used through the series and mostly applied them to the wizarding world as he became exposed to it. I'm envisioning a different path for Luffy, one where he learns these techniques as he journeys through the world, and combines them with the powers he's been granted from the Gum-Gum Fruit to increase his agency in the world. Current plan is to try to line up plot points in the show as best I can with the ordering of R: A to Z, as that is an example of an ordering of those ideas that conveyed them well (to me, at least). *My second request is for ideas on how to order introducing the various rationalist methods.*

Finally, I wanted to present a couple of my ideas for interesting spins on character powers from canon: in particular, Luffy and Nico Robin.

Luffy's Gum-Gum power, as demonstrated in canon, gives him the ability to stretch his body. He seems to be able to control this, though flashback episodes to his time as a kid with Ace and Sabo show that he did not immediately get the kind of control that he demonstrates even when rescuing Zorro in the first few episodes. I plan to make some of his more remarkable new uses of his powers (Gears) rely on rationalist revelations.

I plan to add a twist to the Gum-Gum power, however: it will give Luffy's /mind/ similar flexibility. This will allow me to make Luffy a satisfying rationalist protagonist while still being a total goofball most of the time: the first mental Gum Gum power he discovers is the ability to "store up" thinking ability while he has his mind in a relaxed state. When he "gets serious" as he's observed to do in canon, he's going to be tapping this resource.

Nico Robin, in canon, is substantially older than the rest of the crew (except Brooke), and tends to be the most reflective member of the crew. Her power of temporarily creating controllable copies of her own body parts is typically used to make stuff out of hands, or to grow arms on other people to put them in headlocks. These copies don't persist, so it doesn't seem like she could clone herself, but there's no apparent reason that she couldn't copy her brain repeatedly. All this extra thinking meat isn't much good if that processing power isn't properly applied, though, so that's going to have to be her character development arc. She's likely to become a mastermind figure/advisor to Luffy, since her powers are less versatile in direct confrontation. *My third request is for feedback on these ideas - do they seem like something that would make an interesting story?*

*** If Luffy could "store up" thinking power, why not other aspects too? Like speed, strength.. (ref Mistborn).

I think the main reason Robin doesn't make a brain-copy is because she have to directly control the things she made, controlling a few hundred extra hands or mouths is one thing, but control other brains (minds) is a whole other bag of rubish.

**** Luffy canonically stores up big punches before his fight with Crocodile, and has vastly more strength than his quite skinny frame would suggest - and not just his rubber powered punches, but lifting huge boulders or moving ships. And the Feruchemical similarity did not escape me, it's at least partially where I stole the idea from.

Robin will copy the parts of her brain that control her power, first.

** You awaken to find yourself in a D&D 3.5 or Pathfinder world. You're a 20th level spellcaster (class of your choice), but you've been exiled to a country-sized dead magic zone, in what seems like an otherwise mundane late medieval to early Renaissance society. You are certain that if you leave the zone, you will be subjected to scry-and-die tactics and constant attack. You realize that although your spellcasting ability is severely limited in this area, it's not actually gone. With a decent spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level Ã— 4) you can actually manage to cast a spell on yourself, but only yourself.

Treat everything beyond your own body as though it is inside of an antimagic field. Note that teleportation, scrying, and plane shifting are impossible. All magical means of communication (sending, dream, etc.) are also impossible.

The number of spells you can cast is also limited by a shortage of available 'mana'. Your normal available 'mana' is equal to the sum of the cube of every spell slot you possess (e.g. for each level 1 spell slot, add 1^{3} = 1, for each level 2 slot, add 2^{3} = 8, etc.). Each spell costs that same amount to cast. Within the dead magic zone, you can only use up to 10% of your available mana.

How do you munchkin your ability to use magic in a dead magic zone?

However, to use the Initiate of Mystra approach, your alignment must be good or at least true neutral to remain within one step of Mystra's alignment. I suspect you could achieve much more munchinkiny mischief without that condition.

*** What is the effect of the dead zone on non-spell magical abilities like a druid's wild shape, thousand faces, and the like? Because 20th level druids are nearly unlimited shapeshifters and can even turn into things like Huge elementals.

And is the dead zone defined by a clear boundary? Is it some sort of ruin, or merely an otherwise unremarkable region where magic does not function?

Regardless, druid seems like a solid choice. Water and food are nearly free even with the reduced mana - /create water/ and /purify food and drink/ are 0-levels and /goodberry/, /hidden spring/, and /dream feast/ are 1st-levels. Some combination of the above can keep you going indefinitely regardless of surroundings.

If shapeshifting works fast travel is easily available with intelligent choice of form - air elemental, albatross, various raptors, etc.

/Expeditious construction/ and /expeditious excavation/ are nice 1st-level spells that help with making a secure fortress.

Should be fairly straightforward to make a base and stay well-supplied. After that, do whatever you want. Is the goal to escape the field/defeat your enemies?

--------------

Edit: 20th-level druid has a base of 4 slots per spell level, which is 8100 mana using your cube-sum equivalent, and 810 mana within the dead zone. A 9th-level spell is 729 mana, so everything is potentially available to you if you're conservative with your high-level casts.

**** Aside from the extremely limited usage of spells, all other supernatural and spell-like abilities are suppressed just like they would be in an anti-magic field. Druids would not be able to shapeshift, though they have some pretty amazing extraordinary abilities which would still work, like immunity to poison.

There is a boundary with the dead magic zone sharply transitioning into a deadened magic zone, then sharp transition from deadened to normal magic zone. On the ground, there is nothing to indicate which zone you might be in other than warning signs that people have placed near common border crossings. The region within the zone looks like a sparse grassy plain with farms, towns, rivers, streams, small hills, etc. Beyond the zone lies thick grasslands, forests, jungles, etc. The zone is about as large as France or Spain.

Remember that your spells in this area can only target yourself, everything beyond your own body lies within the antimagic field. For example, /dream feast/ would work, but /create water/ would not. You could cast /levitate/ on yourself, but not on anyone or anything else.

The goal is simply to exploit this limited spellcasting ability to the maximum in a region where people are otherwise unfamiliar with magic and unprepared for anything you might do with it. If you can imagine the action making your GM go "Oh shit", you're on the right track.

***** Well, the restrictions mean you'll be much more interested in self-buffs and the like. There are also some spells that are only cast on yourself yet grant information about your environment: /commune with nature/ can locate all people within 20 miles and /lay of the land/ gives you free knowledge of the surrounding geography. Both are considered personal spells.

I'm always a fan of stacking carrying capacity and movement buffs: /ant haul/, /aspect of the stag/, /longstrider/, and maybe /bull's strength/ and /cheetah's sprint/ for short distances.

Movement tricks: /water breathing/ or the more powerful /ride the waves/ let you sneak places via waterways, and if people aren't used to magic they won't consider this possibility seriously; /earth glide/ allows slow movement through the ground; /air walk/ isn't nearly as good as flight but is still impressive in a magical dead zone. The more expensive /geniekind/ can give you a 60ft fly speed.

/Echolocation/ for getting around in caves/utter darkness.

Combat: /spit venom/ is a nice surprise for a close target; stack /aspect of the stag/, /thorn body/, /ironskin///stoneskin/, and maybe /aspect of the salamander/ for regeneration, defense bonuses, and melee attacks. /Raven's flight/ and /vermin shape/ are effective get-out-of-jail-free cards when nobody expects a shapeshifter.

Here's the kicker: /absorb toxicity/ is a personal spell that lets you transfer the absorbed diseases/poison to somebody else. Combine with /greater contagion/ cast on yourself and you can now inflict your choice of (non)magical illness on anybody you can touch, and it *can't be cured without magic*, which is not available to the victim!

*** Well one obvious tactic would seem to be to attempt to protect yourself from scrying and thus allow you to safely cast spells outside the dead zone. Without referencing the books, my best guess for making that work would be exiting the dead zone inside a lead box then having a contingency/readied action immediately cast various anti-divination spells.

Once you've done that then the possibilities for exploiting 20th level spellcaster abilities are basically endless, so I won't go over those here.

**** At least for me, the complexity of 3.5 does make it a more interesting setting than 5e. Imagine taking the path used with 5e to the extreme - no more rules or mechanics whatsoever, no classes, no feats, no levels, no numbers to remember, every DC is set by GM fiat when the GM perceives more than one way that events could go, and the dice lend surprise and tension to everyone in the game. I can imagine that being fun, but it would be difficult to share the experience with others since there's little common ground between players with different GMs. It would also be somewhat difficult for a player to surprise the GM with a brilliant idea.

Now imagine going towards the opposite extreme, with a small library of nuanced rules for every action and situation. If the players have mastered the rules, it will be relatively quick and a lot of fun, and players with different GMs can share stories of their experiences with each other relatively easily because the games maintain substantial common ground. Of course, the drawback is that a larger ruleset makes it less likely that players will actually master the rules, so the game could turn into a slog of constantly looking up rules. As such, players could easily and frequently surprise the GM with brilliant ideas drawn from infrequently-used rules.

Obviously, the ideal is somewhere in the middle. A ruleset small enough that mastery of the rules is achievable for a large number of players, but broad enough to ensure a great deal of common ground, and enough space for players to surprise their GM with clever exploitation of their characters' abilities. For me, the ideal is closer to 3.5 or Pathfinder than to 5e.

** I've had some...interesting revelations about Fantastic Racism against AI lately. I always found the idea of humanity creating sentient life and then not giving them the same rights as humans to be absurd, then I learned about how American companies treat employees that aren't considered Americans. Undocumented day-laborers, terrible working conditions in developing countries, and even ties to human trafficking syndicates for overseas mining and construction. Apparently slavery isn't as old fashioned as I thought.

Black Mirror's normalized abuse of uploads pushed my suspension of disbelief even further, given that the AI had once been human and all of the humans seemed to believe they were still people, until I remembered how common abuse and discrimination of women and LGBT people really is. Plenty of humans believe that other humans exist to be treated less than human and there is insufficient protection for them against people like that.

So I guess this is just my advice on where to look for inspiration when writing Fantastic Racism in sci-fi. If you don't know how to write the mindset of an abuser, go look at where the actual abusers hang out.

I am playing with having the world actually be made of 4 elements, air, water, fire and earth, and am exploring the implications. Surely things that can burn contains fire, as the fire escapes when you ignite it but that's the only one that's super obvious. Where does the fire go afterwards though? Does it linger around in their air until plants can suck it back in to grow more?

In order to do this, you have to face down the atomic theory. Understand that even in antiquity, proof of the existence of the atom was available; the only trouble was that they didn't have the mathematical sophistication to understand it. In order to avoid breaking (my) suspension of disbelief, you'll have to reconcile the atomic theory with the 4-element theory of matter, creating some kind of bizarro chemistry. Which means you'll also have to deal with the chemistry of the ancient world: chemicals like lye and lime are essential, and you're going to have to explain how they work.

Or, you could do like everyone else, and sidestep these problems or lampshade them if they ever come up.

*** I suggest [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html][Unicorn Jelly]] for a story that is set in a world with very different natural laws that still sort of give a recognisable world at a human scale. Even if the forces that cause this are different, and the large scale structure and geometry are drastically different. For instance: there is no gravity, just a constant downwards force called Linovection. There are no planets, but triangular world plates, which don't fall due to other fundamental forces. But if you fall off you just keep falling. [[#s][And then]]

Be warned that while the story will get to dealing with the universe-spanning catastrophic threat eventually, it does start off slowly and at a much smaller scale.

And then there are the sequel/spin-offs/side-stories.

Brain injury could still affect personality - in the same way as (say) subjecting someone to a continuous, irritating whine can affect personality. Or losing one's eyesight.

Just because it doesn't affect the hardware that the personality is running on, doesn't mean the personality is automatically immune.
