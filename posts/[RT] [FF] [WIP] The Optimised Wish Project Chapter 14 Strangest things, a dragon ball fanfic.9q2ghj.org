** The opening with the traumatized invisible boy was really visceral. Great writing! I kinda want to read more about the origins of the band of misfits now..

*** Mmmm. Dunno if there's much room for more flashbacks in the main story, but I wonder if that could be a good spinoff idea.

(BTW: that opening segment was sort of similar/inspired to a fanfic I wrote years ago in Italian which was instead about Hinata Hyuuga, from Naruto, suddenly awakening up her Byakugan and having no control over it)

** I can't decide which is more horrifying. Caroline integrating herself into Puar and taking over, or vice-versa. Hopefully this doesn't become some Saw/AI doomsday scenario.

*** Caroline isn't very smart, she's basically a very clever version of Alexa or Siri. Still science fiction, but a specialised system, not a true GAI. Puar, on the other hand...

**** Well Caroline taking over Puar is me being horrified of character death. Puar taking over is me afraid of AI doomsday. Since it seems like his obsessions will only magnify with computational power. Kind of like a paperclip maximizer

** In light of the recent discovery of an exploit in Fanfiction.net, I'll post the AO3 link too:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14091411/chapters/38291600][Archive of our Own - Chapter 14]]

I may just use this from now on until they do something to fix it, though reading the stories only should be safe. Anyway I've been cross-posting since the beginning so you may just switch to that if you prefer it.

Eh, it's a common enough phrase that it's weirder if the kid in the basement didn't get it wrong

**** I'm actually not sure it's wrong either way. "There are more of you" feels more proper, but is the opposite, treating "more" as a sort of collective noun, even considered wrong at this point? Use changes the rules... I'm half resigned at this point that one day I'll have to write "it's" as a possessive /and it will be correct/.
