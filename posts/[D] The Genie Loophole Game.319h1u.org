This game will get harder as it progresses, as I incorporate suggestions and/or patch loopholes.

The rules this specific genie has, which (I think) cover the biggest and more obvious loopholes:

1: No metawishing (No wishing for more wishes, genies, etc. You only get three wishes, no more)

2: Each wish must be phrased beginning with "I wish", but there is no limit on the length of the wishes.

3: No paradox wishes. (Time travel can only be observation of the past, no "I wish this wish will not be fulfilled", etc.)

4: No persistent supernatural effects or abilities that last longer than a week *Changed, thank you [[/u/Prezombie]]*

*5: No changing the rules. Thank you [[/u/Psychobeans]]*

I don't think I'll last very long against this subreddit, but I'd like to see how you could get around the restrictions.

*EDIT: I was right, this didn't last long at all. I can't come up with anything else, I'm giving up. Someone else can be the genie, this sub is too smart for me.*


** I wish to be temporarily omnipotent (except changing the past) for Graham's number of years.

That is not a persistent supernatural ability.

** *The programming loophole.*

"Let the following term - skribbitz - describe the following situation:..."

(books and books describing everything you could every possibly want)

"...end definition for skribbitz. I wish for skribbitz."

*The not-quite-meta loophole.*\\
"I wish to be brought into existence a non-genie device, golem, or being of sufficient power and nature to quickly realize any and all desires I present to it, to the power level of approximately half a genie."

(Basically, genies are able to instantly and trivially grant any wish a human could think of, so a device or being of only half that power would probably still be able to bring about the wishes of anything a human could think of. If a genie could move stars around, for instance, to create a more pleasing constellation, or could put the sun out and rekindle it the next day, or could spin the moon to show the other side, a half-genie-power creation probably wouldn't have a lot of trouble doing anything short of bench-pressing the planet. And it wouldn't have the limited-to-3-wishes restriction either.)

*The super-charisma loophole*\\
Even without persistent supernatural abilities, there's nothing stopping you for wishing to have charisma equal to the maximum natural human ability. Every politician, celebrity, conman, and religious figure in history would have nothing on you - you could ask anyone for anything and they'd be almost orgasmically happy to do it for you. You'd pretty much have total power anywhere there were other people, which is most of the interesting parts of the planet. Tell everyone that war and corruption were to stop and everyone was to get along nicely and help each other, for instance, and the globe would probably be a much more pleasant place to live.

You'd never want for creature comforts; everyone would be more than happy to give you anything you wanted. You wouldn't even /need/ wealth or its trappings.

Heck, even 'merely' wishing for charisma equal to that of the most charismatic person on the planet right now would get you insanely large benefits, and it wouldn't even be asking for something that no-one else had, or something beyond human ability.

*The super-knowledge loophole*\\
Wishing to know everything that any human knows, along with the improved mental capacity to be able to retain, recall, and use that knowledge without deleterious side effects, wouldn't give you knowledge beyond current human capability, but it would give you access to every secret, every idea which couldn't be realized because of lack of resources or opportunity, insider knowledge of everything ever, all languages, all mental skill and experience at all professions, all knowledge of things which the knower couldn't or wouldn't necessarily make use of themselves themselves, all knowledge of how to build and maintain anything humans have made, etc. You'd instantly become the most powerful person on the planet.

Would this count as 'persistent supernatural ability'? I don't know... rebuilding your brain so it could hold and use all this information /naturally/ shouldn't count as supernatural any more than wish-granting you a body equivalent to having great genes and having worked out for twenty years. It's not supernatural; it's just a natural possibility you didn't previously take (or have the option of taking).

*** Super-Charisma: You will be very convincing, but you wouldn't be able to convince people of anything you want, as no human is capable of that. You would likely get into high-power positions though.

Super-Knowledge: Assuming a natural brain could hold all the data, that would be valid. I think. But, you would also need your other bodily processes modified to meet the heavily increased demand from your brain for oxygen and nutrients.

This should be valid because meta-wishing seems to be about getting more wishes or changing something about the wish-granting function. I'm just asking for knowledge of wishes.

Wish #2 - I wish (whatever wish I learned about from Wish #1).

Wish #3 - Emergency wish to become the Genie if the previous two wishes go wrong somehow. I'm not wishing for an Undo Wish. I don't like maintaining a "status quo" like you always see in stories involving wishes gone wrong.

** Short of CEV or the world-improving trick of the year, my wishes are usually fairly selfish.

And also include persistent supernatural abilities, huff. So no polymorph any object / greater teleport / shapeshifting / a DWIM mental interface with a high-end computer?

In that case: I wish for the optimization of my body and mind in accordance with my desires (weighting for understanding?), extrapolated over time, from birth to the present.

(So phrased because I've noticed preference/desire/belief changes that I can't undo, that are not completely useless, but that I do not want to have all the weight on just because they are most recent. I at least know that the way I phrased this wish should make me smarter, if nothing else.)

If that doesn't work, undo the wish, or collapse wishing to a prespecified safe-state if the "optimizations" didn't screw with my ability to wish intelligently.

If it works, wait and see what happens.

Other possibilities, though lower priority and might not make it in, depending on how the first one goes:

1. I wish for a meteorite containing primarily platinum to appear in a crater no larger than 1.5m in radius on the area of my property where it would be least likely to disrupt my normal activities were I not to attempt extraction. (The meteorite is as large as possible such that it does not cause any serious destruction to any buildings, or the path from the house to the road, or concrete, or the flower bed / rose bush / trees, although minor tree damage or even a damaged window might be acceptable if the market value of the platinum is at least 100 times the price to repair said window damage. It will not break any power lines, phone lines, man-made cables, or water gas or sewage lines.)

2. I wish to know how to find and optimally interact with (where optimal means "to the satisfaction of myself and the other party/parties") people with whom I am most likely to form and maintain mutually desirable relationships. The "how" should take into consideration the limitations of my present situation (this one goes last because the self-optimization wish could greatly decrease the complexity of this one. It /could/ go in the middle, if I need a third wish to actually benefit from it, but I want my body and mind in a useful state more than I want magically-arranged friendship, and I want a crap-ton of money to get me financially secure enough so that I can make the most out of my magically-optimized self.)

**** So could I, say, wish for a voice-and-intention-activated DWIM polymorph any object ability, whose effects are permanent, so long as the power only lasts for a few days? 'Cause I could do a ton of damage* with just a few days of that sort of power. Even if it has arbitrary limitations like "no resurrections, but healing is ok", "no food", "objects must have a reasonably solid bounds, so a bucket of saltwater can turn into a bucket of freshwater, but water and air on their own cannot be morphed", etc?

Combine with something like Greater Teleport, except the philosophical identity stuff gives me the jibblies**, so it'd need to be something a bit more complicated which would ultimately make using it for space exploration impractical.

That does, of course, ignore people wishing to be god for a week outright. I would assume you can't wish for any power that would do things you couldn't get from a carefully worded wish, and that the duration is inversely proportional to the energy cost (or something like that; genies kinda make energy costs incoherent).

So "I have all the abilities available to a level 12 Wizard" wouldn't last long at all, while "I wish for the ability to shapeshift into any human form" might last the whole week (allowing restrictions so you don't shapeshift from some dude with a phone in his pocket into some rich-looking fellow with a lump of gold in his pocket, because that would be cheating).

Probably safer to just forbid supernatural abilities entirely, since they come close to wishing for more wishes (since wishes are the only way such things could be accomplished otherwise).

Time travel is sort of banned, but it's just listed as something that could cause a paradox, so time travel to the future presumably isn't banned. Thus, the genie could presumably instantly give you and all future versions of you omniscience.

** Another one! Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinquishable, but still categorically different from magic. How to phrase this...

I wish for a very small, but damn powerful. virtually indestructible computer, implanted to my brain in a way that lets me use it at it's full capacity, to make me a lot smarter and remember practically everything. It should also have wifi or similar way to connect to Internet.

I wish for practical immortality, medicine for youth and switching my bones to something way harder and my skin a lot tougher and my eyes for similar looking mechanical eyes with... Yea just cyborg me up completely, I'd still like to have my flesh brain though, with some youth medicine to keep it top condition.

Still not sure what to do with the rest of the wishes. Maybe world peace and immortality for other humans if they want it too.

** 1. I wish for the most powerful computer that would have been built by humanity in the absence of this wish, ever.

2. I wish to have a library of 100 million books (this is less than 5 Libraries Of Congress), where until the books run out, every living and future Fields Medalist and Physics/Chemistry/Medicine Nobel Prize winner will be able to name 1 book per person-year and find that book on the shelves, like how if I walk into a bookstore and say "Twilight" I can find a book about vampires, they could say "The Riemann Hypothesis", and every book will be an unremarkably hefty textbook explaining the most detailed, thorough, and advanced form of the requested topic that is comprehensible to the given mathematician/scientist, with a fair compromise struck between depth and breadth, and while the library will contain no duplicates, if the mathematicians/scientists ask for increasingly precise titles, those books shall be present, like they could ask for "Autoimmune Diseases" and then later "Multiple Sclerosis", and none of these books will have content that would violate your rules, like if some joker asks for "The Structure And Interpretation Of Genie Wishes", their request is simply ignored.

3. I wish to know, genie, are you still there, if so, reply "meow" (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 letters).

(1 is [[http://qntm.org/aum][Ra]]. 2 is the most broken thing I can think of, that nobody else will think of. 3 is [[https://xkcd.com/1354/][Heartbleed]], with 2^{64} - 1 because greedy.)

I've possibly given up at this point, I can't defeat most of these and I don't know what rules I would have to add to defeat many of these. Huge mistake on my part. Truthfully I'd prefer is someone else could be the genie for a while, 99% of this stuff is going directly over my head

I wish for medical devices which reside inside me that can maintain me in perfect health, and can also reproduce themselves using common materials gathered from my bloodstream. Three of them should exist at any given time, and a fourth ready to come online. If at any time one is lost or destroyed, another is rebuilt. They can be transplanted and be fully functional in another human body. If transplanted, the new host's medical device will reproduce itself until there are three active and one standby machine.
