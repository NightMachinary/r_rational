** I like this interpretation of Tobias.

I worry that the Yeerks are too strong. There seem to be two ways that this can play out in a non extinction event. 1. The Animorphs turn into rationalist munchkins and save everything. 2. The Elimist gives them a bunch of deus ex machinas until they win. I don't particularly like either of those options. Here's hoping there's a more detailed plan to success in the mind of the author.

** Awesome.

Tobias strikes me as OOC for the books, but meh, it works pretty well.

I've gotta say, I like this kid. I hope he stays.

Justified everyone-using-a-different-morph! What are the odds, right?

Speaking of odds, gosh. Ellimist schenanigans as an explanation for plot convenience. Not sure whether that's brilliant or incredibly worrying.

********* There were some inconsistencies regarding the rules of thought-speak in the early books. Eventually it seemed that the canon settled into the decision that as long as you were in a morph, you could thought-speak. Ax and Tobias used thought-speak while in human morphs in the later books.

Usually, I just like speculating out loud and finding out through the story itself.

***** The morphing technology is pretty elaborate, it seems implausible that they would allow something to morph itself. The technology creates a "base state" when you first get it, which is just your own body. When you acquire an animal, it not only stores the animal's DNA as a new state, but also the transition required to reach that new state. Therefore, if you acquire DNA that matches the base state, the transition required is null, so no morphing takes place.

***** Yeah, that sucks. I found these characters and sent them to the author; they're indistinguishable from <> in FFN's document system, but I guess they use a different font for stories than the docx for some reason. This really sucks; I'm not a fan at all of the (()) notation. Guess it's back to the drawing board.

** A solution for at least mildly cooperative Yeerks:

1. Give Yeerk ability to morph.

2. Allow Yeerk to aquire one human.

3. Yeerk morphs human.

4. Wait (at least) two hours.

Now you have a Yeerk who doesn't need a host. Interference / resonance might wear off given enough time as a nothlit. I think this was involved in canon.

--------------

Potential risky move: acquire a Yeerk and investigate the pool.

--------------

Hilarious move: Nest all of the Animorphs in one body by morphing a Yeerk, controlling the next one in line, then morphing a Yeerk again. I seriously doubt this would be useful and it would still have the same time limit.

--------------

Andilites vs Yeerks: why not just ram enemy planets with a ship traveling near the speed of light? That should do it.

--------------

Elimist: be very very careful that you're not robbing characters on either side of agency. Omnipotents have a tendency to do that.

*** The nested yeerks idea is actually really interesting, but only if we can figure out how Visser 3's morphing works. If his Yeerk body is pushed into z-space along with his host's while morphing, then nesting is possible. It seems like this would actually be necessary for him to control his host while in morph, because he has to stay in contact with the Andalite brain.

It's one of those things that you would never, ever try if you value your life, but it's an interesting thought experiment.
