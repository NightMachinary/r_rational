** *Speculaaaaation tiiime (unstructured stream of consciousness, just the way I likes it)*:

Aight, so I'm fairly certain Sasapariller isn't going to pull a teddyx3 on us, which means I can say what I'm really thinking. There's some parallels to the guide here tbh, but only cursory in that knowledge of the overarching reality-bending physics-defying but subjective-rule-following metagame can help you accomplish objectives better.

​

In Sean's case, this metagame happens to be loosely defined fictional worlds, which can impose their own rules around reality, but kinda fall apart when he tries to scrutinize them. As the rationalist in the story, he's one of the few who can 'defy the story', remembering that the cake is a lie, indeed. He already shown he can do that when logic-bombing the alice in wonderland story.

Haley can't do it because she's living a story; you can see a dragon and find it incredible(literally lacking credibility), but when you are a dragon, not so much.

BAM - its time to logic-bomb them Aslans. Jesus is fake, evil isn't a single witch you can beat, and two can sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. I rest my case.

That's the only result.

There should be an explanation paragraph somewhere written by someone who was on the discord during it

** How nice that we got to see Cecilia again, looks like she's doing well for not having a body anymore.

I've never played Pathfinder, so most of the metagaming went over my head, but the results of it are pretty neat. Can you really make a separate plane of existence and scale it up to world size and make it a hyperbolic time chamber all in the size of a bag? This seems so far out of the scale of magic that I'm used to in a typical game of DnD 4/5e.

Also, I started reading The Dark Tower because of Cowboy Boots. It's every bit a gritty western as I expected.

*** Re: your question, yes! Recastings of [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/genesis/][Genesis]] will tack on 60 feet per cast. This turns out to be a massively better investment in terms of planar volume gained per cast than [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-demiplane/][Create Demiplane]], which only allows you to stack a few cubic blocks per cast. Technically Genesis is a higher level spell than Wish can reproduce safely, but if you were in a PF world you could also get a high level cleric and cast the spell directly a million times with him, using something like the simulacrum trick. There are /many/ ways to make one caster into many casters, with PF, and it does tend to break the game.

As far as the hyperbolic time chamber aspect, it's something of a fudge. Technically the spell allows you to set "Double Speed vs Material Plane" as a maximum which is far less broken though still quite OP in distorting the action economy of the game. But the entry for flowing time does /describe/ realms where 1 round of material plane time equals 1 year. That makes it RAW in terms of what is /possible/, but you're going to be hard pressed to trick your GM into setting that up for you, unless you need it for other purposes.

** Sadly you still have the problem with italicized words lacking spaces towards the end of the chapter.

A very good chapter though! I'm going to have to ruminate on what his plan is.

*** Aaaaaaargh my italic-spacing annihilation has gone too far in the opposite direction! Fixed one paragraph, don't see any more immediately. My eyes glaze over after about the fifth time combing through these things.

**** It might be because of the spacing issues drawing extra attention, but the italicization feels like it's been multiplied by 10 in the last few chapters, to the point where it's a bit difficult to read at times. I remember when I was a kid realizing that /every single page/ of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had at least one italicized word--this is starting to feel a bit similar.

**** Found some more. Paragraph that starts with: “Me neither,” I said. "I get magic items too?She" Paragraph that starts with : Some experimentation proved that I could not, in fact, use anyof it.

***** weird, spoiler didn't save my line breaks. There are three examples there. One sentence and two paragraphs.
