** I mean i would never say that some of the chapters are better off binged, but this one is high on background information and the feel of the land and low on the actual story moving forward. It's interesting that Adjutant is so keenly aware of Cat's needs tho. I do love how flavorful the descriptions of the reveling the little details of the both the banners being added to and Adjutant's personal taste in orcish women, but as a chapter it's mostly setup more than substance. I do love the setup i have to say that i really like how ErraticErrata writes the more Tolkien-esque details, but man i cannot wait for the next chapter, i mean this last what month's of chapters have been really good.

*** This is one of those times where the format affects the reading of the story. Taken in the context of all of the Interludes that will be written in this section of the book, one full of background rather than plot is nothing but welcome. Forced to be read piecemeal like this, it exacerbates a non issue into a problem. (IMO to at least some extent the same thing happened on a large scale with the Underdark arc, given how much of the payoff from it has come after the arc concluded)

And to be fair it goes the other direction. The constant cycle of cliffhangers every 3 chapters (aka every Friday) works well for the current release schedule, but I could envision it not being to everyone's taste reading the whole book at once

**** I mean the other thing was that the Underdark generally had some forward movement with the more background information so i was kept pretty rapt even if i know there was some discontent, but this is like an entire chapter that could conceivably happen within the time it takes for someone to read it which leaves me at least wanting more.

***** By the format and I suppose by ourselves. In theory one could just wait a few weeks/months and read everything at once. But basically by definition the people in this thread are those who don't have the desire and/or patience to do so

It's his Name. It's literally his purpose.

***** You're right. He's always uncannily /known/ exactly what Cat was going to do before she did it, but this is the first time that we're told it's his name literally telling him "Cat's going to be there".

****** It kinda takes a little bit of the magic away from him for it to be so explicitly Name driven rather than him knowing her so inherently that he could anticipate her needs.

******* It's the other way around: The fact that he was already so perfect an adjutant is how he got the Name.

****** Perhaps it has something to do with how she has been story empowered lately, perhaps this is a ripple effect on the weave of the story, Adjutant is getting some story Assistance because Cat is and they are so closely related on regards to the story.

******* That makes sense also that this moment coming is as has been said a pivot in the story so it makes sense that he might be given an extra nudge because of it's importance.

** I think I must have missed some details. How do the soldiers already know about the 7 crowns and 1 thing? Did this come from the visions?

How does Akua already have the soul? The band of five got the soul but when did they deliver it back to her? Is everyone but Cat and Tariq already back?

*** So in order the survivors of the seven princes left the pocket dimension and also there's an implication that some amount of the sleeping soldiers were given dreams about the basically the major points of the two chapters before the interludes. It seems like it came from the visions.

So i'm not exactly sure when they ended up stealing Black's soul back it makes sense given that the last time i could find a mention of it was chapter 41 where Tyrant stole it along with the crowns from Rogue Sorcerer when he betrays them the first time in the pocket dimension, i'm not sure when it was delivered back to Cat's camp, and i don't think Archer, Tyrant, Rogue Sorcerer, or Masego's unconscious body are mentioned in this chapter so they may still be getting back, they weren't mentioned in the previous interlude either.

We saw it directly from Saint's point of view in Interlude: Repudiation.

The Saint tried to grab the soul but Ivah got there first.
