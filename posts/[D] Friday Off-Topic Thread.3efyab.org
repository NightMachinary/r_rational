Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Started playing Terraria again since the 1.3 Update, and I never noticed before how the game subtly encourages the transiston from a scorched-earth extraction policy to careful conservation. Acorns and seeds are plentiful, and but wood and herbs are scare enough (compared to how much you need) that you are incentivized to replant forests after cutting them down and to cultivate gardens of dayblooms, glowing mushrooms, etc. in their respective biomes.

I also like the truly fantastical nature of the game, which has absolutely no compunctions about giving Magic Missile and a handgun as loot from the same area, and how there's just enough lore to seed a nice fanfic but no real story whatsoever.

I want to say it's an excellent little game, except for the fact that it isn't little at all. I'm currently working on a grand castle with an underground apartment and biome complex, and probably won't be finished till after summer is over.

*** Hey I'm playing Terraria again too! Maybe we should set up a server...

Anyway it's much easier to just level a bunch of worlds for wood than to replant. Hey don't look at me like that! those worlds were doomed to be consumed by the corruption anyway. Deforestation is the least of their problems.

*** Find better books. Try to read them more deeply as well; it might be that you're just going through the motions of reading without making an attempt at investment. (Edit: I will say that I had some temporary setbacks in this regard; once you've read enough fiction, you can eventually get to the point where you say, "Oh, powerful mentor figure, he's either going to turn bad or die at the end of the first act." If that's your problem, the solution is mostly to stop caring.)

The last work of fiction that really moved me was /Inside Out/, which I saw about two weeks ago, but there are a few works that have personal resonance that I can continually get an emotional response from. (For reference, I'm nearly thirty.)

The Mother series in particular is poignant for me; just hearing some of their songs is enough to make me cry, much less in association with the recently deceased Satoru Iwata. But even that aside, Mother 3 is an utterly heartbreaking game.

*** Hmm, I've definitely experienced less empathy for characters as time goes on. But I have found a method of sort of meditating myself into an equivalent state of sorrow. It mostly just requires slow breathing, and focusing on your core and the feeling of the negative emotion until it expands.

It doesn't quite get to the level I've experienced when people I know have died, but I haven't really practiced it that much because I prefer psyching myself into joy than sorrow.

Sorrow is my second favorite emotion though. I wonder if that's unhealthy...

Edit: Come to think of it, the fact that I tend to psyche myself into joy regardless of circumstance might be the reason I have less empathy. Hard to feel the suffering of others as much when your own lever is glued to happy. Maybe I should practice sorrow more after all.

*** VR (like a lot of platforms) is going to live and die by the apps that run on it. Right now, the use case seems to mostly be novelty and immersion, roughly in that order. I have two friends who have the Oculus Rift, and I've played it quite a bit, but ... what's the killer app for VR? An exercise program combined with a videogame?

Without a killer app, early adopters are the only ones that buy in, which means that development resources aren't put towards building with the platform in mind, which means that new apps aren't made, which in turn slows adoption. I've seen this happen quite a bit with other platforms, and it's part of why I'm of a "content first" mindset.

This is part of why I think AR is the one that's going to change things. I can imagine lots of virtual things that you'd want to tack onto the real world.

*** [[/r/replicatingrobots]]

Self replicating robotic machinery in space.

Reason:

1. The energy and materials available in space are abundant, so replication rates of greater than once per year are almost certainly feasible. The abundant vacuum lets us use vacuum deposition of ions in place of current electrolytic methods, and the negligible gravity reduces the material costs for supporting structures, while permitting fine structures to be formed with less distortion.

2. Exponential doubling at an annual rate or better is fast enough to reach megascale engineering levels within a matter of decades. Megascale engineering allows for the creation of trillions of parallel robotic laboratories for running experiments which can improve efficiencies and resolve nagging human problems like aging.

*** Do I have to research it myself, or can I just throw money at the problem? Will I have people working with me?

I guess if I don't personally have to do it, I would say self-sustaining systems, though I don't know if that violates "precisely one". In other words, I want to research how to attain small-scale homeostasis for an environment, preferably one that has humans in it. This would be useful in space, but also useful in creating sustainable cities, as well as creating pockets of civilization which can exist independently of each other (ensuring long-term species survival).

If I have to do it all by my lonesome ... natural-language processing, I guess. Automated text generation is going to be one of the big new fields; you already see some of it for simple business news articles and sports reports. Some day (probably sooner than we think) it's going to be possible to have a computer write a book that people would actually want to read, and not just for the novelty of it.

** I've been pondering how to approximate a mesh for collision detection by packing it full of ellipsoids. I had a uniform sphere packing algorithm working decently, which placed spheres at grid points that were inside the mesh and then ran a few iterations colliding them with each other and the mesh boundaries to get a tight packing. However for thin objects you have to use way too many tiny spheres, and allowing variably oriented and sized ellipsoids could vastly reduce the particle count. I'm really not sure how to structure that optimization problem though.

But perhaps you could have a stage where your spheres grow? Throw some spheres in, grow them until they're filling the space. Obviously your grow them on each axis independently.

Then pack in more spheres. Repeat. You probably actually want to be using capsuleShape if you're using bullet.

I'd be inclined towards trying to segment the mesh into convex-hull-able shapes, generally.

**** I'm actually using my own real time physics engine (based on positional dynamics, I can go into more details if anyone is curious).

Inflating ellipsoids is an interesting iterative approach, but the trick would be adjusting the orientations. Ideally as it inflated each ellipsoid would rotate to fit the space. That might just mean implementing full rigid collision resolution during the packing process so that resolving against the faces can apply a torque.

The other tricky thing is choosing good seed locations... it's probably best if these ellipsoids grow at the same time and collide with each other as they grow so you end up with a roughly uniform packing. Consider the following test case: a board that is 2m x 0.5m x 0.1m. I would consider an ideal packing to have an 8x2 rectangular packing of mentos shapes all slightly overlapping each other, but if I grow one ellipsoid at a time I will likely end up with a big one occupying the whole board and then a couple tiny ones in the corners.

How about inflating shapes? Start with a sphere of some minimum size in a random valid location. When your shape isn't in contact with anything, increase its radius. When it's in contact with things only on one half of the sphere (in practice, things that are almost opposite may be a problem, so one-third or one-quarter might be better), inflate it by moving it away from the contacts as you increase the radius (the farther apart the contact points are, the more you have to move). When you can't grow as a sphere any more, find the average plane that the points of contact lie in and try to grow as an ellipsoid with long axis normal to that plane.

There are some interesting problems with this approach, but I bet someone else has worked out a good implementation.

This tavern brawl has been really fun for me. I play mage and make the terrible choice of when second to mulligan entirely for chromag and arcane intellect just for the joy.

I also wondered how they decided hero powers should only get one use a turn, and how the game would be different if they hadn't designed it like that. Also I wonder if classes had no hero powers and it was only class cards that made heros different.

Does anyone else feel that Hearthstone design seems to encourage less and less skill and more on random chance. Obviously card games will have chance elements but it seems like they are too impactful.

*** I'll be more hyped when the expansion actually drops; this slow roll of card reveals is killing me.

I've been running priest for the current brawl. It's really surprising to me how many people are just going around with big stompy decks. The ideal distribution of cards seems to be roughly half utility and removal, with the other half being huge threats. That already basically described the priest deck that I've been using to ladder with (Burn Priest). I've been playing around with other classes, but priest is still my favorite, both for this brawl and in the general sense.

Historically speaking, before there was Hearthstone there was the World of Warcraft TCG, which came out in 2005. I played that quite a bit with my friends; almost all of the artwork (and a few of the mechanics) came to Hearthstone by way of that game. In the WoW TCG, you had a hero power that you could use once per game, and I think the idea for per-turn hero powers probably comes from a similar place. As for restricting it to once per turn, I think the worry was that hero powers would come to dominate the late game; there are already hero power "match-ups" where some heroes have a worse time than others strictly on the basis of what their hero power can do. Without being able to spam the hero power, it's possible to "run out of gas", which is a desirable result.

Priest seems to be the flavour for this, easily the most common, which I'm happy with since Priest has been the worst class in the game since its inception and I used to play it in beta.

I don't know if I agree that people are front loading their decks with big ones . Two sw:d, two bgh, two light bomb is already 20% and I imagine all priests are running that. Mage has it even easier with fireball and pyro being burn and removal. My deck runs 8 secrets too which might be too much as coining away my counterspell seems to happen a lot. How many wins do you have with priest?

Do you have a large collection? It is a very p2w brawl though I won on na and asia with heros that weren't even level 10.

That's a good point regarding late game. Warrior versus priest in a control match up used to be a disaster for priest since end game hero power pass was normal. If warrior could gain 10 from that it would be no surprise to see them dominating even more.

I'm not sure what you're saying you find irrelevant. Dysphoria may be irrelevant to those unaffected by it, but those who have it also have disproportionately high suicide rates.

I'm aware that this is something that people experience, and willing to take them at their word on this. But I have no idea what it's supposed to feel like from the inside. I've heard people compare it to the trauma of waking up as the opposite gender and being stuck that way, but that doesn't seem traumatic to me. I immediately start thinking about the differences in utility associated with gender, rather than any emotional component. Being transgendered has been described to me as feeling a "wrongness" associated with gender ... but I don't feel a "rightness" associated with gender right now. I don't feel any particular attachment to maleness over femaleness, beyond arguments of utility.

So I'm all for transrights, but the part I find confusing is the internal psychological aspect of it. Mostly because I don't have an attachment to my gender (or feel that it matters too much). Whenever I read someone trying to describe what being transgender feels like, they always start with this assumption that people feel like they have a gender that they're supposed to be? Which doesn't square with my personal experience, and makes it hard to relate.

I think it must be that I have no strong attachment to my gender. That's probably where the disconnect is coming from. My gender /isn't/ important to me, and it's hard to see (on an empathic level) how gender is important to others. Like ... when I imagine myself getting turned into a woman, I don't imagine that making any particular difference to me? My life doesn't have gendered activities in it right now. None of my friendships are contingent on gender. Even my sexuality would remain pretty much unchanged. And I guess I also don't really understand admiring one gender over the other, if that's what you're saying.

Like I said, I'm more than willing to accept that gender dysphoria is something that other people experience, but I'm starting to think that it must come from some experience of gender as integral to self that I don't have.

The problem is that gender is /not/ a choice. There are physical differences in the dysphoric mind that we can detect, and I'd bet a whole bunch that we can't yet, and those cause a disconnect between the physical characteristics of a body and those that the brain feels should be there. Those who are trans have this disconnect; those who aren't don't, and don't understand the problem. The disconnect causes great amounts of suffering to those who have it, and a good deal of it is exacerbated by society's current state of acceptance when trans people try to do something about it.

When I say that gender conversion works about as well as sexuality conversion, I'm saying it doesn't work, because neither "conversion" actually /does/ anything. The difference is all in the brain, in ways that we cannot change, which is why those who decry acceptance of transition because dysphoria is a "mental illness" and should be treated in the brain are themselves utterly mental. The only option we have to decrease suicide rates and suffering of trans people in general is to accept transition as a society. We cannot change the brain, so we must allow changes in the body. All of us, as individuals. The culture needs to change.
