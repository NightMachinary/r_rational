Hello fine folks,

In these WFH tes, I have upped my reading game a little, one of the Monday recommendations brought to my notice a HP fanfic on RR called "Born in a Magical World"

The MC was reborn in HP world, the story so far has had elements of progression, with focus on learning and growth of character and a some plot.

I am looking for something in similar vein.

Some books which I have read which follow in similar vein :

Supreme Magus

Cradle

Paragon of destruction

HPMOR (Learning part of it)

MoL

I hope this gives an idea of what I am looking for


** You might want to look over on [[/r/progressionfantasy]], it sounds like that's pretty close to the style you're looking for. Aside from Cradle, Will's Traveler's Gate series also works pretty well for what you're talking about. You may also enjoy Forge of Destiny, Delve, Mage Errant, or my own Arcane Ascension books.

** I'm not familiar with any of those except the last two, I'm afraid. Your description doesn't help me much...isn't "magical fantasy" tautological? Don't all good stories feature progression, learning, character, and plot?

Regardless, I'll take a swing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] is one of the most popular stories on this sub, and for good reason. Ongoing. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  A teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in a fantasy world - one which seems to be an amalgamation of every Dungeons and Dragons campaign they ever played together. Now he's stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

In the "shameless self-promotion" vein, I've got two that might work:

[[http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Two-Year Emperor]] (free download from my Patreon page); it is complete and did reasonably well on this sub when it was in progress. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  A young man is summoned to a fantasy world that runs on D&D Rules as Written. He's told he needs to run the country, his bodyguard will kill him if he breaks the law and, oh yes, the magical Mongols are invading. Jake starts getting frustrated after the second time that the gods drop by to say "Hey, stop breaking the world, okay?"

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-patchwork-realms-arrival.63045/][The Patchwork Realms: Arrival]]. Ongoing, still fairly new. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!

Back to things by other people...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] Complete, sequel in same thread is on hiatus. Summary:

After Voldemort's death, the Death Eaters summon Milo, a wizard from the Forgotten Realms D&D setting. Milo promptly escapes their clutches and goes to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] In progress. Summary:

The aliens show up to destroy the Earth, but they aren't building a hyperspatial bypass. Nope, they're building a reality TV show consisting of an 18-level dungeon chock full of monsters, traps, and explosives. Carl and his cat, Donut, go in to get out of a blizzard and find that not only can they not leave, not only are they fighting for their lives, but Donut is now intelligent and they both have video game stat screens!

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] Much more heavily LitRPG than WtC, very different from the others on this list. Pacing is slow but it pulls you along anyway with excellent characters and interesting worldbuilding. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  What would you do if you woke up alone in a forest in nothing but your pajamas?

  This is a story about a man trying to answer that question as he navigates a world of monsters, magic, adventure, and numbers going up. It isn't all fun and games, though. Survival is tough when you are alone, and the dangers of this world are not to be underestimated.

  This is a world governed by a system of stats, skills, and dialog boxes. It is vital to know how the system works if you want any chance of having a life of meaning. Too bad someone forgot to include the instruction manual.

*** I specified magical fantasy because I was thinking of Chinese Cultivations as part of fantasy elements.

I meant progression as in where the main focus of MC is learning and keep growing in power.

The Two Year emperor was fantastic and so was HP and Natural 20(I think it was stopped?)

Gotcha. I haven't read any cultivation fiction because everyone who has told me anything about it has literally said "It's trash." Maybe I'm simply talking to the wrong people.

Thank you! It was my first published novel and I'm always delighted to hear that people enjoyed it.

The first book is complete. SirPoley did either 1 or 2 sequels with the last one being on apparently-permanent hiatus. They're in the same FFN 'thread' as the first novel so it's not entirely clear that they are distinct, but they definitely are.

** The Wandering Inn is a LitRPG that's very heavy on the lit and light on the RPG. It's one of my all-time favourite pieces of fiction.

The protagonist, a young woman, is dropped into a fantasy world with levels and skills (but again---very light on the gamelike elements), specifically in a region with the majority of the population being nonhuman humanoid species. She decides to start running an broken-down inn outside the walls of the city. Other Earth characters also show up later.

Edit: what I forgot to mention is the obvious part, which is that the setting is a medievalesque fantasy setting.
