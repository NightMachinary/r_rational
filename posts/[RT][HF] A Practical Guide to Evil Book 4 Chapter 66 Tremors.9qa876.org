** My guess is that Cat is going to invest her title into Callow itself, making it the Kingdom of Moonless Nights, so that all the power that she's acquired will be able to be used by any of her successors to protect Callow, this protection enforced by Fey promises ingrained into the title itself.

As a call back, she could condense a sword of pure Winter and jam it into a stone for people to try and pull out to become her successor.

Kingdom of Moonless Nights sounds a little bit cheesy for me, close second to the “Black Princess of Night”, but making a regalia like the Deadwood Crown that would allow for the title to switch hands is very much in the cards.

I hope, for the sake of variety, that the seasons would also change with it: can do only so much with a power built around not having sufficient resources to sustain itself. Maybe it would even be a Tyrant of Helike kind of deal, where the rising or falling influence of the country would call for different basis of power.

She's planning to transfer her title into the parchment upon which the Liesse Accords are written.

There's her enforcement. Not only will each nation be signing a magically binding fey treaty which will kill them and their successors if they break the treaty, but every remaining Drow will also declare war upon them. The Mighty she is going to be binding might start bidding a thousand or more years, that threat will be around for an incredibly long time.

** This made me want to see if I could find an exploit in Cat's oath to Thief.

(Chapter 29).

Context: Cat asked Vivienne if she wanted "the soul" destroyed.

#+begin_quote
  “For small slights, long prices," "Let Akua Sahelian see the light and taste freedom. Let her believe she has slipped the noose, so long as she remains of use.” “But there will be a day where the world we made no longer has place for her,” “When we have faced all the horrors before us. And on that day, when she has glimpsed victory?” “Snuff her out, Catherine,” “Slowly. Painfully. Excruciatingly aware of what is being taken from her.”
#+end_quote

The biggest potential exploit that seems likely would be if for whatever reason the individual we've been calling "Akua Sahelian" doesn't count as Akua. I can't remember if the Akua we have now is Akua's original soul or the copy of Akua's mind she put on another soul. If it's the latter, it could be that she doesn't count as Akua Sahelian. This would also I think be the best shot Akua has at a plausible 'redemption' arc in the eyes of Cat and the audience, arguing that while she's certainly similar, the soul is meaningful enough that she isn't actually the same person responsible for Liesse.

This is a pretty broad set of conditions that would trigger the need to kill Akua. She's already working on making herself indispensable (and thus having a place in the world), and facing all the horrors in front of them is the sort of thing that might not have an end - there's always room for another threat, as Cat herself has proven.

#+end_quote

This is probably unavoidable, but I still think the Drow chowing down on the Night is a vector for risk. You don't want Drow becoming powerful enough that they can test their bonds, or gaining knowledge on how to escape magical oaths.

  “She can manoeuvre all she wants, she's not getting the job,” I said. “I'm still debating who'll oversee when I'm not around, but she's not in the running.”

#+begin_quote
  I have begun to worry, Catherine. Urulan was perhaps in the twenty strongest drow of Great Lotow, and likely close to the bottom of that division. It fought... better than I expected. You came close to death more than once.”
#+end_quote

Yep. Why is it Akua who always seems to be the one bringing up reasonable points? That's actually a worrying trend.

But Cat better have some damn good contingencies for the upcoming fights, let alone for Sve Noc (who is apparently a Dead King level threat).

#+begin_quote
  “I compel you to answer my questions and do so truthfully and completely,” I Spoke.
#+end_quote

Oh good. We haven't seen much of Cat reigning in Akua recently, so this was comforting to see.

I feel like a (admittedly small) hole might open up immediately though. Take

#+begin_quote
  “We have,” I murmured. “Have you walled off any memories or knowledge, or considered doing so?”

  “I have not,” Akua replied.

  “Do you have any hole or holes in your memories?”

  “I do not,” she said, then cocked her head to the side. “I do not. Oh my, you have been thorough.”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “From and including the word ‘marker' I spoke earlier today, you will remember this conversation as idle chatter from the moment this sentence ends,” I Spoke.
#+end_quote

And it becomes fairly obvious. Cat's checking for holes in Akua's memories, but apparently modifications to her memory can go undetected. It's a fairly small hole, all things considered (especially as Akua would probably have to erase the memory of considering to do so), but it's still a thing.

#+begin_quote
  “Have you plotted or acted against my interests?” I asked.

  “I have not,” she replied, sounding amused.

  ....

  “Have you manipulated the greater or lesser oaths, or both, so that you can exploit them in any way?” I asked.

  “I have not,” she said.
#+end_quote

This is all very good to know.

#+begin_quote
  My only long-term objective is survival.
#+end_quote

Although this I find quite surprising. I'd have figured Akua would be a little more ambitious, whether she's backed into a corner or no.

#+begin_quote
  I'd ask again tomorrow.
#+end_quote

A daily check in like this is definitely a much needed policy.

*** As to the memory holes going undetected, I think this is the case only outside the marker. At least the way I read Akua's response to the memory question, the first command appears to restore the memories of previous check-ins in addition to compelling truth. Or possibly because of that compulsion.

Of course, this opens up a second hole wherein Akua has time to scheme during the check and can hide the memories of doing so after the memory question is asked. So long as she uncovers them before the next time Cat asks, anyway. Might be best practice to ask the memory question at the beginning and end of a marker conversation.

**** I wondered about that, but the two commands have no such clause for Akua remembering her interrogations during her interrogations.

***** My initial thought on reading it assumed that to answer Cat's questions truthfully and completely, Akua would have to regain the missing memories. Having thought about it some more and reread that section, I think you're right. Akua's reaction is from deducing that these conversations have happened before without even leaving holes in her memory when she considers the answer to the memory question.

However, I've become even more certain that the reason this one took place on screen has to do with my hole- Akua used the time after the memory question to scheme and it will likely pay off soon. Either Cat doesn't get the chance to 'ask her tomorrow', allowing the schemes to begin to play out or she does ask and it comes out that Akua began making plans against Cat, meaning she's become too dangerous and has to go back in the box despite how difficult it will make the rest of the Drow takeover.

**** Yeah, she can have manipulated the oaths, and erase memory of that before cat asks that question. But this relies on cat asking the same questions in the same order each time. I feel like cat has a pretty good understanding of loopholes, and should have seen that one.

Even just a "have you created, repaired, or can currently detect the presence of any memory alteration during this conversation?" would be a solution.

The only way around this would be to alter her memory in a way that cannot be detected by her... literally changing who she is by replacing parts of herself with new but indistinguishable parts.

Which, given her statement that she would try to survive in a way that keeps as much of herself as possible, is actually a bit of a concern.

I'd have guessed Vivienne- the person Cat uses as her morality compass and who she's entrusted what's basically a kill switch for herself to. If not Vivienne, maybe Hakram. Heck, Abigail and Kilian would probably rank higher in the succession than Larat.

Larat is her treacherous lieutenant. His goals aren't at all aligned with hers, the best she could do is make him swear a series of oaths that put him pretty much on rails but that'd require assuming context never changes and he can never slip the bounds given infinite time.

Taking the prior point as a bit of foreshadowing, would Cat still actually have the power to Speak if she's functionally Nameless? I would understand if it drew upon her mantle of Winter (as Ubua is bound to obey it), but I thought Speaking was always a Name thing?

Praes and Callow already personify the same aspects as winter and summer: constant greed and treachery on winter/praes, as well as the direct equivalence of praes always needing callows food.

Having one fae kingdom in the real world wouldn't work, so my guess is vivienne would become the summer queen and rule callow. This */might/* be currently foreshadowed with Vivienne losing her role, though its quite a stretch.
