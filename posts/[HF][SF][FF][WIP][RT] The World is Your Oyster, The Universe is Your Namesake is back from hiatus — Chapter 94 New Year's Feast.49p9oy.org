** Making the hiatus more bearable. A bit of a slow chapter, but it certainly set up a lot for the next one. It also reminded me a bit of a feast from a Brian Jacques novel, which is both a good and bad thing (good more than bad, I think).

My only real worry is that you haven't really had a villain yet. There's been some emotional conflict, and that's all well and good, but I think the lack of any real antagonist is starting to make the story feel like it isn't headed anywhere.

Still, I'm enjoying this a great deal. You write the characters well using the rational style, and manage to capture their canon counterparts well enough that it feels like the show.

*** Well, 'Slice-of-life' is right there in the tags.

I know that there are some pacing problems, but I can't really skip over the nine or so important developments that I have planned before they capture Peridot.

**** No worries dude! I'm still totally enjoying myself when I'm reading it. I've enjoyed the slice of life bits so far.

*** This is one of the very few stories I've read where I feel like, even though it seems to have stalled, plot-wise, I don't care because it's just /that interesting!!!/
