Yeah? But didn't Dumbles use his earlier when they brought Hermione the stuff?

Amelia Bones really dodged a bullet by not triple-Veritaseruming Hermione. That's a disaster-fic I'd like to read.

ETA: Yknow, I think I have a hunch as to what Harry's response will be ...

Given obliviation, even dangerous knowledge isn't an irreversible disaster for an individual. Public dissemination of this knowledge would be a much greater disaster.

As Lugnut1206 said. HPMOR (chapter 56) mentioned that "the wards permitted [phoenix fire] as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though there were no fast ways out."

**** They specifically said the only dementor they have left in Britain is the one at the ministry, chances of someone lending dementors is zilch for two reasons: one, no one wants to write controversial stuff about other magical governments, and two, no one wants to spend dementors to somewhere they will just die.

Also considering the only reasonable way to keep dementors under control is to feed them then I can only imagine taht Harry would have researched dementors and be planning on wiping out non-British dementor prisons too.

** This story continues to be just awesome. I really feel as if it's at least the equal in characterization, plot and general application of rationality to HPMOR itself -- if Eliezer had posted these chapters rather than the ones he did post, I don't think I would have been able to notice any drop in quality or even realized that a different author was writing these ones...

*** I can really tell the difference. The first like 10 chapters of this were pretty bad, in my opinion. Since Quirrell left it's gotten /interesting/, but the writing is still far less engaging than Eliezer's.

**** I think the biggest difference is the author's failure to emulate distinct character voices and word choice from HPMOR. The most outstanding failures so far have been Dumbledore and Quirrell, but there have been a lot of instances throughout. Dumbledore and Quirrell have previously spoken with a certain sophistication and formality throughout that the author does not really manage to credibly imitate when not lifting dialogue whole from HPMOR.

I mean, look at all of 10 (90), Updating Beliefs Part 2. Examples of phrases I would not expect to see from Quirrell (not nearly complete, just a few 'highlights')

"And worse than that, you showed to the world that you're just a pathetic little kid, and Malfoy lost his fear of you."

"Merlin damn it, boy!"

"Are you suspecting me?"

Examples I wouldn't expect from Dumbledore from Ch. 11:

"You made a big mistake there, Harry,"

"And while we have exceedingly little data as to what a botched Killing Curse might do,"

etc.

It really felt like HPMOR had a number of different speakers in it's dialogue - I suppose Yudkowsky focused on their different ways of speaking and word choice and levels of formality and sentence structure a lot and made each major character a distinct individual. Following the Phoenix, though it tries, doesn't really capture the voices nearly as well.

***** Hmmm, that's a very good point. You're right, I never noticed the different speaking styles in HPMoR, but once you spot it, it's important.
