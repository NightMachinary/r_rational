I'm sick of no one getting any of my references. I'm sick of almost all of my favorite literary masterpieces not being respected or even known about by anyone that I have met or will ever meet in real life. Fanfiction seems to be so frowned upon that it is almost taboo. But of course, fanfics can't get published where more people will actually see it and learn to appreciate it because publishers are only interested in books they can profit from and they are not allowed to profit from fanfiction. So fanfiction gets stuck in more obscure places online never to see the light of day or the shelf of a library anywhere.

Here is my proposed solution: have good, already established authors write some fanfiction novels. Then have them make an agreement with some company so that each author includes an advertisement or product recommendation for that company in an authors note. Then that company profits from the advertisement included in the authors' note and not from the actual work of fanfic itself. The author does not profit from the fanfic itself, but benefits from getting to write a novel just for fun that no one will expect that much of, at least at first.

Since neither the author nor the company in such an agreement would be profiting from the original IP, it would hopefully still be legal.

I have no idea whether this idea has any chance of working. Thoughts?


** This already exists, it's called licensed works. Star Wars is perhaps the most well-known example, but there are tons of these, mostly based on TV franchises, role playing games, or video games. Lately I've been some panels at SF lit cons I go to pushing the line "These works are just as worthy of respect as original universes." I've even seen a book critic reading and reviewing some. And they've always been fairly successful, commercially.

There's two big hurdles with these though. The first is that the author doesn't have the dream of a big payday. On the average, you'll probably make a better living writing in licensed work than trying to get noticed writing your own stuff. But you will never make /serious/ money, because the parent company owns all the rights. You may not be asked to write the sequel if it's really successful. The characters and world aren't yours. You'll never get a licensing deal for the TV show, or movies, or toys. Now, 99.99+% of authors will never see that sort of thing anyway, and so it'd be smarter to take the deal and get a decent paycheck, but no one wants to give up the fantasy that their work is THE work that'll change the world.

And that's the other problem. When you write licensed works, you aren't looked at as a creative artist as much. You are now a line-worker, a cog in the entertainment machine. It loses the glamour.

So while I agree that would be nice, I don't think it'll happen. The only way to truly fix this is to overhaul our broken-as-fuck copy-write laws.

That being said, fanfiction has a fair bit of appeal. Sure, you won't hear it talked about in lit circles, but it is widely read. Most traditionally published novels do not sell out their first print run of several thousand. I think of fanfic like romance novels. Extremely popular - the most-read genre by a WIDE margin, romance novels are where the money is. But no one ever talks about them, for various reasons.

Lit in general is a niche interest tho. Even books that do very well don't necessarily mean anyone will get your references. Game of Thrones is, what, 20+ years old now? And until the HBO series started, almost no one would get a GoT reference, despite it being a successful book/series. In today's world, you need TV or Movie presence to be well-known. And that just can't happen with unlicensed fanfic.

*** First, it is not the same thing. I'm not talking about a fan work being licensed by the original author/publisher. I'm talking about having a fan author agree with ANOTHER company to have at least one product recommendation or advertisement in an author's note in their work, so that the company is willing to help them promote it, while at the same time they would be only profiting from their ad and not from the intellectual property. Also, "fan fiction" is not a genre any more than "original fiction" is. There are probably a wider variety of well-written fan fic masterpieces than original romance novels of the same caliber, simply because fan fiction is not a single genre. It would be like if someone quasi-banned "original" fiction in the same way. "Original fiction" is not a genre like romance is, and if they did to "original" fiction what they were doing to derivative works there would be mass protest. What I'm proposing is a way to get rational fiction to be more widely available and known to the general public. The majority of rational fictions are fan fictions and therefore doomed to linger in obscurity forever. What I'm proposing is a way to potentially fix that problem without actually breaking any laws.

**** Ah! I misunderstood you at first, I didn't realize the advertising would be for an unrelated third-party product.

Legally speaking, I'm pretty sure this would not fly. Someone is making a profit from work produced in the original IP, even if it's via advertising an unrelated third-party. Sometimes people ask me why I haven't set up a Patreon or something for the HPMOR podcast, and my answer is partly legality. While I realize people do this sort of thing a lot, they only get away with it because the IP-holder doesn't consider them worth the money to sue.

But I also don't think it would achieve your goals. The stigma against fanfic isn't because the authors aren't paid, and that's not why author's shy away from it. Licensed-works authors get paid fairly well, and yet there's still stigma against writing it.

Fortunately, this is changing. There are a lot of established authors who write fanfic, and some of them are even beginning to admit it in public. :) Naomi Novik, who is a best-selling author, and just won the Nebula award for [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/sff-review-uprooted/][Uprooted]], is a strong proponent of fanfic, is on the board of the [[http://www.transformativeworks.org/][Organization of Transformational Works]], and is a co-founder of AO3. I just saw Alyssa Wong at a WorldCon panel speaking about how great fanfic is, and her own experiences writing it. There's no shortage of established authors who write or enjoy fanfic, you just have to get them to come out about it. That's slowly happening. :)

** I don't know enough about the legalities to guess at whether the red tape will favour you or not, but I have a suggestion or two that might streamline things.

A good first step of this process would, I think, be to have two authors who have expressed fondness of each others' work write their fanfiction novel based on the other author's work. This accentuates the way each author supports the others' work and it would be easier to present it under a banner of the concept of published fanfiction.

Another thing to consider is whether you could include a plan to have the company responsible for the source material approve the fanfics, to avoid grey areas like fanfics 99.9% identical to the source material to avoid copyright or subjects the company doesn't want people to associate with their story, since we know that for every HPMOR there's a Cupcakes. It would be a compromise, sure, but it's a foot in the door that would otherwise be slammed and locked.

If you really want to see this done, I'd think about contacting relatively new and less widespread authors for this, since it would be easier to get your message heard than if you were to try and get J.K.Rowling on board and newcomers to the field might be more amenable to such a novel idea.

You're not alone in your frustrations, so if you end up deciding to take this somewhere I wish you good luck.

This seems both unethical and counterproductive. It should not be necessary to get the original author's approval for a work of derivative literature to be promoted when no one is profiting from the intellectual property of the original author. That would be effectively saying that they have the right to decide what works I can and can't recommend to people or talk about in public. It would be like if I wrote a fanfiction and wanted to pay someone else to let me use their venue to do a dramatic stage reading of it, and was told by the original author that I couldn't do that.

If they do take that line then my first amendment rights would be severely violated for the rest of my life since most of my favorite novels are fan fictions.

The problem of course then becomes finding a company that's willing to stick it's neck out for the sake of first amendment rights. Even though no one would actually be profiting from the original author's IP, it's a complex enough scenario that it's possible the original author might think they can get away with pretending that their copyright is being violated.

Does anyone have any idea where I can find such companies willing to stick their necks out for first amendment rights?

**** The idea here is to get official, mainstream recognition of the better works of fanfiction, right? And you want that to be achieved by setting up an official framework for fanfictions to be written and spread in, right? If so, the framework you want to make has to not tick off the people we're trying to get to support us. If an author sees this plan and hears that they have no oversight, they might worry that people will use the platform to write incredibly disgusting stories in his world and spread them with a note advertising the original works that brings him the entirely /wrong/ kind of reputation. An author with no control over what stories are accepted in this framework might decide they don't want any part of it.

Would this be a problem with every author? Of course not, but even a handful of vocal detractors could stall or even kill your project, and I'd be willing to bet that from all of the authors who might hear about this plan you'd get a few who hate the idea of a gore-fic being used to advertise their children's story.

This isn't a matter of first amendment rights, also, because we can already write and spread our fanfics as much as we want. We have our platforms for spreading these stories and letting them gain attention by their own merit. Just like not every book has a right to be accepted by publishers, not every fanfic would have a right to be accepted by this framework.

I've already said that this would be a compromise. Ideally, we could just take sites like Fanfiction.net and spread them far and wide, with robust systems for sorting the good fics from the bad, and watch people change public consensus, but we can't afford to have authors deciding to kill the entire platform if someone wants to write gore-fics of their books.

That said, for expediency's sake we wouldn't want active approval of each fic, but the same level of appeasement could be achieved by letting the author object to fanfics that they have found and disapprove of. Rejected fanfics still have our current systems for people who want to read them and supplementary sites might end up being formed to house fics rejected from the framework.

Most of my favourite novels are scifi/fantasy and written in a weird foreign language nobody understands beyond being able to tell American tourists to go fuck themselves, so this is exactly the case.

****** in that case what do you think is actually going on with the hugos? from what I recall, some conservative political organization or something created those two voting blocs in the Hugo's, Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies, to conduct an experiment to test which of the following criteria the Hugo Awards valued more in nominated literary works:

1. writing quality
2. how well it fit the "social justice" narrative

They recommended a bunch of better-written non-SJW works as the control group and a bunch of less well-written SJW works as the experimental group. What they found was that across the board works in the experimental group consistently beat out the control group for nominations. And in fact when a SJW work didn't get the nomination in a particular category, the Hugo Awards judges were willing to decide not to nominate anything for the category at all. Therefore the Hugo awards favor books more for fitting the social justice narrative than for being well-written.

Of course, the people who actually conducted the experiment were not professional researchers and were working for a conservative poltiical organization, so not only is it possible that I misread their results (it wasn't even formatted as a scientific report), but they might not be totally reliable. Still, the experiment they did does seem pretty clear cut.

The only way I can think of that they could have biased their results is that if they pressured the judges to not nominate anything if a SJW work didn't win in a category, then that says more about the political power of the SJWs then it does about the real criteria that is being used to determine nominations for the Hugo Awards. Nevertheless, the fact that so many less well-written SJW works won out over better-written non-SJW works is fairly strong evidence that the Hugo Awards care more about having their nominations fit the "social justice" narrative than about writing quality.

Of course, I suppose it's also possible that all of those SJW works actually had much better writing quality than the organization that conducted the experiment believed, and that "fitting the "social justice" narrative is actually the /second/ most important criteria for determining nominations, rather than the first.

However, considering some of the titles and book descriptions though, and considering that this /is/ the "social justice" movement we're talking about here, I kinda doubt that.

******* Here's my understanding of how this went down.

In 2013, an author named Larry Correia started the Sad Puppies as a movement to create a Hugo voting bloc to get his own work - more "pulpy" style fiction - nominated for a Hugo. From his [[http://www.webcitation.org/6aRd3TqAI][his own post]], I glean three primary motives:

1. To improve his own resume by getting a Hugo nomination.
2. To point out that Hugos are a popularity contest.
3. To stick "stick it to the man", referring to the traditional crowd of voters that votes on the Hugos.

While he does appear to dislike that Hugo winners, in /his/ opinion, tend to be heavy handed with messages, this does not imply to me that his intent was ever about getting higher quality works to win or running an experiment to test that - it was simply about brute forcing a popularity-based voting system to get himself into the running.

In later years, Correia does appear to have framed the Sad Puppies as being in opposition to an insular group that is not representative of the fandom as a whole, but that appears to be a retroactive justification rather than the initial point behind his movement.

I would also argue that it isn't really an accurate premise; a cursory glance at the winners for the last 10 years on goodreads shows that they all have over 5,000 ratings, indicating a high degree of popularity (or at least visibility) in the fandom as a whole (not just among the "elite" that vote for the Hugos).

(You could make the argument that winning the Hugo is what caused the high # of sales, but that doesn't appear to be the case as far as I can tell; looking at this year's winner and runner up, they both have other books that sold just as well or better than the Hugo nominees.)

This was true even prior to the existence of the Puppies; in fact, some prior winners have even appeared on the puppy slates in the future (such as Neil Gaiman, who won in 2009 for best novel, and was later on the puppy slate for graphic novel in 2016).

The Sad Puppies movement later gave rise to the Rabbid Puppies, a separate movement largely attributed to Vox Day, who appeared to be primarily focused on tearing down the Hugos as an institution. This was, again, not about nominating quality works to beat the existing Hugo candidates - unless you think putting Space Raptor Butt Invasion on the [[https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/03/rabid-puppies-2016-best-novelette.html][puppy slate]] was about quality.

So, the TLDR version: The Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies are separate movements, but neither of them appeared to be founded in order to get better writers to win the Hugos. The Sad Puppies were started by one author who wanted one for himself (by his own admission), and the Rabid Puppies seem much more focused on trolling the voting to irritate people and/or prevent far left writers from winning (regardless of the quality of their works).

The Hugos definitely are a popularity contest, but it doesn't appear to be dominated by any specific politics; the winners, at least in the Best Novel category, do appear to be generally popular with genre fiction readers.

There definitely are people who represent the puppy movements as being about promoting writing quality, but that does not appear to accurately describe the origin of either of the movements or the works that they're actually putting on their slates.

******* Oh man, there's a lot of unpack there.

First, how the Hugo's work: there aren't judges. It's awarded based on a popular vote of the people who attend the World Science Fiction Convention that year (and those people who can't come but still support it financially). I have been a Hugo nominator and voter every year since 2012.

As a popular vote, it does give an edge to writers who are popular (whether for writing or for charismatic personality), at least in the nominating round. And, from what I've seen over the years attending WorldCon, the attendees do lean a bit toward the cosmopolitan/liberal side. On the other hand, they also tend to be a bit older (young people have less money for travel), and that helps balance this out a bit. So while, like any populist choice-making system, it has it's flaws and quirks, it was never a political thing.

To that last point, I don't want to go over all the analysis in a comment, but if you'd like I can point you to many blog posts and articles over the last two years. There has never been a shortage of conservative writers/works nominated for Hugo awards, and the winners of the Hugos don't look to be skewed by politics. The only obvious bias is that the Hugos are rather anti-YA, but that is because most WorldCon members just don't read much/any YA.

The Sad Puppies campaign was started when Larry Correia (conservative guy) was nominated for a Hugo and didn't win it. He had a personality clash with an editor who also attends WorldCon, and became convinced it was because this liberal editor was running a secret cabal to deny Hugos to conservative authors. He spent the next two years riling up his fans to get more Hugo nominations for himself and his friends, but it didn't amount to much.

In their third year they finally hit it big by framing this as another battleground in the Culture Wars. The SJWs taking over the Hugos and denying them to deserving Right Wing authors. This was, of course, a great surprise to everyone who'd been attending WorldCon up to this point, you'd think we'd have noticed something like that!

Second major point: There was no "experiment" and no "control group." That isn't even a comprehensible scenario, whoever passed that on to you is either seriously confused or lying through their teeth. There are no organizations that submit a group of works to judges for consideration. Works are not evaluated in "groups", so it would be impossible to have a control and experimental group as described. Furthermore, there are no judges to submit them to! The nomination process is literally every single member of the con getting five blank slots and writing in ANY five works that were written in the previous year! Then the 5 with the most votes are the finalists. That's all. A lot of people write blog posts about what they loved, and people talk with their friends, but there's no committee to consider recommendations. Furthermore, in this scenario you're describing, how the heck would the Sad Puppies have gotten the honor of being the organization to present the recommended groups of works to these judges anyway? Does the story say it was a lottery system and they got lucky or something?

What actually happened was that Correia, Torgerson, and Beale, put a list of works up on their blogs, told all their fans to buy supporting memberships so they could stick it to the SJWs that are screwing up the Hugos (again, the SJWs that don't exist), and to vote in lockstep for the works on their list, regardless of if they liked them or had even read them.

And it worked.

In multiple categories, the entire list of finalists was exactly those works that were on the Puppies list.

Imagine your favorite fan con, whatever that con happens to be. Ask yourself what you would have done if a group of people who publicly proclaim their hate for your convention, and accuse you of being SJWs, negated all the reading and bickering and conversation you and your fellow attendees had, and forced on a bunch of mostly-awful works with the express intent of Sticking It To You? Would you have gone on to give them an award for doing that?

The WorldCon attendees didn't do that. In any category that had non-Puppy works, they voted only among those works (which meant that yes, the quality wasn't as high, as there was less to choose from, /because of the puppies/). In categories that were completley taken over by the Puppies, we voters decided we'd rather vote for No Award. The overwhelming majority of us voted that way.

Partly, this was self-defense from a hostile attack. But it was also very much deserved. You cite a source that says that this was a contest of "better-written non-SJW works" vs "less well-written SJW works". I contest both of these claims. The non-Puppy works were not SJW works, they were simply SF works that people liked. And the Puppy works were, in nearly every case, subpar. Every single category had at least one work that was so poorly written it made my eyes bleed. [[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/2015-hugo-nominated-short-stories-novelettes/][I strongly urge you to read them for yourself]]. The novels weren't as bad, but they were strongly mediocre.

2016 was an interesting year, because Vox Day decided he'd try to Xanatos the WorldCon-goers, and put at least one work in most categories that he knew the average reader would like, because they were already getting a lot of popular buzz. Neal Gaiman is a legend in the industry, as is Neal Stevenson. Both of them were on the Rabid Puppy slate, and both would have been finalists even if Vox Day didn't exist. This way, Vox thought, we would vote them below No Award because they were Puppy-slated works, and he would crow about how he forced us all to put people we love below No Award because we're such rabid SJWs that automatically vote down anything he slated due to our hatred.

That didn't work out well for him. Basically we read all the works, put the obviously bad trolling works below "No Award" on our ballots, and voted for what we would have voted for anyway. /shrug

Also, I think it's kinda hard to claim a better-written experimental group would contain "Space Raptor Butt Invasion" with a straight face :)

In short - there was never a social justice movement within worldcon, the sort of experiment that's described is flatly impossible, and the puppy-works were by and large subpar and so wouldn't have made for a good experiment anyway.
