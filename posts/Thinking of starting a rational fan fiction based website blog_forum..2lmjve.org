I'm thinking of creating a rational fan fiction website. I want to add in the ability for anyone to post their stories and fans to rate them. There would be no subscription and would be ran simply for ad revnue/donations. Would anyone be interested in something like that?


** Do you think a separate site has advantages over using the existing solutions?

And if you the answer is yes, the question remains whether you could re-use existing code. The excellent [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][archive of our own]] (which also supports [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/aliens_and_time_machines_prompts][contests]]) have their code [[https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive][on github]] where you could fork it. (You could say forking other projects is a rationalist tradition as lesswrong is a fork of reddit ;-)

*** Haha thanks for the idea. I'm not really trying to pull off some amazing feat of creating the best fiction archive ever. I just want a friendly forum/blog for fictional authors to post and rate eachothers works. I know it's been done I was just hoping to cater more to the rational fiction niche.

*** How do you see that working? "Challenge: write a story in <X> genre about <Y>"? Is this a winner-takes-all based on the fan votes or what?

** You're welcome to repost The Two Year Emperor.

Also, there are several things that I dislike about FFN and would love to see in a new site -- if I could find them all, I would move off of FFN.

- Threaded reviews / comments / whatever you call them. I want to be able to reply to my reviewers
- The ability to review a chapter more than once, for when I re-read.
- Daily views & visitors stats
- A posting process that requires fewer actions than the very clunky one on FFN.
- No f'ing link-eater or copy/paste disabler. Jesus H. Christ on a cracker, those things are just bloody annoying and they throw out the baby with the small amount of bathwater.

*** I'll keep all of this in mind while developing rationalfiction.com I'm building the website alone so it make take a while(unless people want to help :D) however I will guarantee at least a little work everyday. I will try to improve on what ffn lacks and i will never use copy+paste disablers. If you want to help out feel free to make an account on my site and submit stories. Any stories submitted i while later convert into an archive containing all the chapters.

*** Thanks again for your help and info eaglejarl. The dislikes of FFN gave me more of an idea of how I want to set the site up.(Once I get the basics down, I'm new to web development and wordpress)

**** You're welcome. Other good features might include:

- A 'fave' and 'follow' ability (this is something that FFN does have, and is good)
- The ability for readers to up- and down-vote a story for quality. Faves kinda covers this, but not really.
- An ability for readers to add a link to a "similar story" and up- and down-vote those links. If you saw a 'similar story' link with -5 votes you could assume that it was someone trolling for views and wasn't actually that similar. Link with votes below -1 or so should probably be hidden.

What platform are you writing it in? Wordpress, you said?

***** Thanks for the awesome ideas! Yeah I'm building it on Wordpress. I'm very new to all web development, but I'm willing to give it everything I can even if it takes a couple months to get going.

*** Sure, you can use anything I've posted to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales][my fanfic page.]] Though fanfic.net doesn't allow copy+paste, so you'd have to use an intermediary scraper, or dev tools to turn that off. And then there are the formatting concerns, like italics, bold, line breaks, etc. But so long as I don't have to do anything much with it, go ahead.

** UPDATE: I am currently working on archiving some stories and making the website a little more functional. I've still got to add in a comment/rating/review system however. So far i've got the first 5 chapters of The Metropolitan Man archived (thank you AlexanderWales) and The first 2 Chapters of Decagon (thank you theyellowwombat) . I unfortunately haven't had much free time and probably won't have much more in the coming week, however I still want to add at least something everyday. Thanks again for you support guys! Please feel free to check things out at Rationalfiction.com to see how things are going.
