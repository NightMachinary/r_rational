** I try to keep in mind when reading that just because something doesn't grab my attention it doesn't mean there is any fault in the writing, it can often just be personal taste. I'm not a big fan of Crime novels but I am a big fan of High Fantasy and irrespective of writing quality I'm going to enjoy one more than the other. On a smaller scale, in media some issues engage me more than others, and while sexual assault is just awful and a relevant topic to current society and there's a lot of important things to say on it...it's just not a topic that really piques my interest when it comes to fiction.

So as I was reading the second chapter of this batch I was thinking all of this and I was also thinking “well, it's not like the issue could take up any less screen time because it's nuanced and needs plenty of work to do the issue justice, so if the issues is going to be tackled then unfortunately for me it needs to be explored at length”, and then I started to get more drawn in. I started getting a sinking feeling in my gut, I started mirroring (on a much much smaller scale) what Joon and Amaryllis were respectively feeling and I had that kind of character immersion that only the best writing gives you, the sort I experienced earlier in the series when Amaryllis was writing from the doomed timeline or when Fenn and Joon had their therapy session.

You took a topic I am usually not engaged by in media and /really/ made me enjoy it's exploration and connect with a characters experience on the subject in a new way. I went from a kind of detached, almost “intellectual empathy” regarding Joon's situation to a more visceral simulation of his turmoil. Thanks for the insight and for the vicariousness awfulness i'm feeling which feels good in it's own weird way.

*** I think because it happens in a logical chain of thought, it's easier to follow and connect with. Often authors will write scenes like this in which the characters act in ways that don't make sense, whether due to lack of skill, laziness, or attempts at drama/comedy. It's hard to empathize with characters that do things you would never do, let alone things that no one would ever do.

** The thing I really like about this story is how well thought out the plot threads are. When Bethel was first introduced, she was antagonistic for all kinds of reasons and that was continuously demonstrated in her behavior. I kinda wondered what the point was, why was cthulhuraejepsen drawing this out rather than just fixing it. Make Bethel like everyone and play nice, use her unique powers to their fullest so the story could go on.

But nope, the plan the entire time, all those chapters of uncomfortable interactions, was to resolve it in this really complex way that helped everyone grow as characters. It helped Valencia grow since Juniper was trusting her again to use her powers, and gives her a new plot thread of living in the relocated Bethel. It helped Amaryllis grow in her relationship with Juniper, both romantically as well as trusting each other to rely on to solve problems. It gave Bethel a whole new dimension, she does truly care about the people living in her and is willing to recognize that she's wrong and change. And obviously it adds a huge amount of depth to Juniper with a very nuanced subject.

Not to mention that it's going to make the actual story more interesting since they don't have a super house at their immediate beck and call for the foreseeable future. I'm really interested to he ends up resolving the Locus question. I hope it's not just as getting the level 20 virtue and clicking whatever that button is.

*** With regards to the locus, I think between Star Magic 100 (Edit: Assuming that's what allows portals), Horticulture 100, the Doe virtures, and maybe working with/killing Pai Shep and/or Manifest (who I think it's implied is Caldwell Gatesmith as well), there should be something to open up a portal to the bottle and establish a connection to the outside.

Of course, the exclusion zones are pretty high level quests, killing the excluded seemed a lot more doable with Prince's, and working with them will probably take Valencia, but Valencia will (hopefully?) come back, and if Juniper matches the excluded in skill, maybe it's possible. Although it sure would be helpful to have the manual to know what benefits would apply, and if it was even worth it^^

Then again, all these seem to miss the personal touch, so maybe additionally Juniper has to learn to accept the locus' way of thinking on some level and become a druid, which would make Amarillys (and probably Grak by then) into druids and get around the problem of there not being enough druids for the locus to expand...

***** I don't think it is entirely futile... After Chapter 162 I'm pretty sure Woodworking 100 would be excluded. On the other hand, Star Magic seems to deal with (extra-)dimensional spaces, which I'm guessing also includes portals, while Horticulture deals in some way with connections, plants and land, both of which are important for the locus.

Also, the most powerful aspects of Star Magic, Soul Magic and Horticulture probably ARE already excluded, at least that's my best guess for the City Made Manifest (aka, I think, the domain of Caldwell Gatesmith) and the lands of Pai Shep, so there exists

- some information on what they do, namely, portals into the soul and "fields impeccable, power absolute".
- a quest, and presumably a reward for ending the exclusion zones - if Juniper can break the exclusion on emporsened exclusion zones, he may be able to use the excluded aspects. Of course, there I agree, that's guesswork and a pretty big if^^ Much depends on how the game layer interacts with the exclusionary principle on emporsened exclusion zones... Maybe kill Captain Blue-in-the-bottle to see what the quest text says (also, killing him might help with getting Fenn back)?

***** Not verified, no, but I think there are hints... "Caldwell Gatesmith has the dubious distinction of being responsible for two exclusions. ", his quest name " */A Door Into the Soul/* ", and in the description for the "Manifest Destiny" quest, " The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, ...", which sounds to me like Manifest uses portals to control his subjects.

Of course these aren't strong hints, and if Juniper got these quests from the description of two different exclusion zones, then this is all null and void, but it's never spelled out in the text how he got these particular quests. They are listed right after one another, too, which would be consistent with him getting two at once for one description of an exclusion zone. Either that, or me reading too much into things, or just a red herring^^

**** Why is that necessarily a banal solution, mistake, or major literary fuckup? Solutions don't have to be proportionate to the complexity of the approach there or the effort expended. In this case, I think the lv. 20 virtue is a rather laterally elegant solution that aligns with how druids operate. I know the most recent chapters say that not everything has a moral or is commentary, but in the spirit of the "spiritual rule" of narrative, it wouldn't surprise me if Joon's effort to engage the locus is one of the oblique solutions expected from a druidic quest.

On a side note, I've noticed a trend of /r/ comments either directly praising AW for good writing/handling of topics or "trusting" him not to make a mistake. Both give me some secondhand awkwardness, with the former making me feel like a voyeur of wholesome thoughts and the latter triggering sympathy for the veiled pressure on AW. Kinda curious why the upsurge in the former; I like to think of it as the euphoric gushing of a finicky community finally satisfied by a r!treatment of uncomfortable topics.

**** Eh, as much as I compliment him, he has taken the short path at times. Most recently the Harold thing. I get that there were some important moral decisions in the way that ended, and the prince's invulnerability plot line was important, but I still think that a mental battle of some kind would have been a better payoff.

And the way the Fallatehr plot line ended, that felt like a cop out too. I would have liked to have some sort of soul battle with Juniper winning and Fallatehr committing suicide somehow when he knew he was beaten. Just straight up killing him in a fight seems like it's leaving a lot of potential on the table.

Like say in a confrontation between soul mages you can use blood magic to increase the pressure in your brain and gain an advantage. Or something. I just don't think taking out his sword and stabbing him was a good ending. Especially considering how lengthy and convoluted the plot thread was.

I do think the Locus plot will have a better ending. It's far and away the longest plot thread we have going right now.

WRT content warnings: My standard policy is not to use them for this story. On AO3, this fiction is marked "Creator Chose Not to Use Archive Warnings" and on RoyalRoad it's marked "Profanity, Gore, Sexual Content, Traumatizing Content", which was as many warning tags as they had. There was no warning for extended discussion of suicide in previous chapters, nor for discussion of sexual violence in ch 98, nor for statutory rape in 121, nor for the rather persistent and extreme levels of gore, violence, and existential horror elsewhere in the story. I've been hoping that "there are no trigger warnings" is enough, but I might put that in bigger letters in the summary, or lay out my policy there. I generally think that trigger warnings are helpful, but that they also act as spoilers, and I would rather turn away people who need trigger warnings without giving a reason than provide trigger warnings on specific chapters and/or for the work in general. (There's also the problem of providing a frame to chapters that doesn't exist within the text of the chapter itself.)

I'll /probably/ be adding a text doc that links to an exhaustive, spoilery list of stuff that happens and in which chapters, but it's low priority, and will probably be crowd-sourced, since there's a lot of story and I don't know exactly where people draw their lines.

  Readers should be cautioned that Worm is fairly dark as fiction goes, and it gets far darker as the story progresses. Morality isn't black and white, Taylor and her acquaintances aren't invincible, the heroes aren't winning the war between right and wrong, and superpowers haven't necessarily affected society for the better. Just the opposite on every count, really. Even on a more fundamental level, Taylor's day to day life is unhappy, with her clinging to the end of her rope from the story's outset. The denizens of the Wormverse (as readers have termed it) don't pull punches, and I try to avoid doing so myself, as a writer. There's graphic language, descriptions of violence and sex does happen (albeit offscreen). It would be easier to note the trigger warnings that don't apply than all the ones that do.

  All in all, this probably isn't a story for the sensitive or the young. I'd peg it with a PG-18 rating, but I think we all know that there's kids who can handle that sort of thing and there's adults who can't. Use your best judgement and ask in the comments below if you're still unsure.

  All that said, be warned -- from the beginning of the story, Taylor is dealing with bullying, and it affects her more than in the thirty seconds of movie or two panels of comic that Peter Parker deals with being shoved against a locker by Flash. Taylor finds escape in her costume and superpowers, but that world isn't without it's problems either. Supervillains (and superheroes!) don't always pull their punches and people can die, or worse. All of this in mind, it probably isn't a story for the sensitive or the young. I'd tentatively peg it with a PG-13 warning. That said, given that the story isn't entirely written (It's my hope, as mentioned earlier, that you, the audience, will help shape it with your feedback), I can't definitively say how things will go or what rating the story would wind up with.

  “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I'm worried she'll ... I don't know.”

  Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I'm finished with her there won't be a piece bigger than a splinter.”
#+end_quote

Amaryllis is the best fucking friend in the whole world. Valencia's right up there with her too, especially if she really is planning to live alone inside Bethel for an indeterminate length of time. The fact that she thinks of it as her being the best Gryffindor she can be is adorable, but also... something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Sad, maybe? I don't really know, something about it just strikes me as being more emotionally impactful than just "adorable."

Regarding the conversation itself... oof, Bethel. My knee-jerk reaction is to say fuck Bethel, because what she did was obviously awful and the closest she gets to recognizing that is a lovely little spot of victim blaming towards the end. However, while all of that is still true, thinking about it a bit more I do find a bit of a hope spot.

Most of her difficulty in recognizing the error of her actions hasn't been (from what we've seen) in recognizing that it was wrong to rape June, it was in recognizing that she DID rape June. She had a genuinely difficult time understanding that she hurt him and seemed offended by the fact that he felt threatened by her. There wasn't any malice, really. It's not that she didn't /care/ about June's feelings, it's that she didn't /understand/ them, while at the same time she was arrogant enough to think that she understood him better than he understood himself. She loudly declared that she would /never/ hurt him, and I think she really does sincerely believe that. She doesn't /want/ to hurt him and would not intentionally do so. The problem is, I think in her head that's become "I would never hurt Juniper, therefore nothing I do will ever harm Juniper." She's too arrogant to consider that her actions may not have the consequences she intends.

Thankfully, ignorance is much easier to correct than malice. This /is/ something that I think they could recover from. June and Bethel might even become friends again, and if they do they'll be much better friends than they were before. If that's going to happen, though, Bethel has a /lot/ of work ahead of her. She isn't a complete sociopath, but her empathy is /seriously/ underdeveloped/atrophied, and for her to fix things with Juniper that has to change.

Bethel isn't a dog, she made a conscious decision to ignore Joon saying no. They talk quite a bit about exactly why she did this, and it's not malicious on her part. She thought she knew best, that Joon would come to appreciate her being so forward, that if he was really so opposed he would do more. Bethel was wrong, and while she didn't and still doesn't see it as rape, she absolutely did rape Joon.

As far as Mary goes, in my opinion she saw Bethel as someone who was dangerous but useful. Bethel is the strongest one in the party and ridiculously useful, but a sociopath. Mary seemed to be of the opinion that Bethel's violent tendencies were worth it and that Bethel's personality would improve as she spent time living a better life. Bethel's sexual assault is both something that Mary has a strong emotional response to, but it could also be a sign that Bethel is not getting better and is a clear and present danger to all of them

Because they had agreed beforehand that if Bethel could feel, he would do it. Because she had a body and she really wanted to try it out and no was more inconvenient than yes. Because he enjoyed it.

That's the thing about rape though. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean you might not enjoy it. Arousal is an automatic response much like closing your eyes when sneezing.

And he didn't say no again because, /as mentioned in the chapter,/ Bethel is prone to escalation. A harder no might mean a harder yes. And she go a lot harder than anyone else. Despite the fact that she had no intention to hurt him and has not given any indication she would, she is extremely casual about murder and has thrown out a number of casual displays of absolute power. So in the moment it was best to go with the flow. Once he was far enough away to feel safe, he finally realized how terrifying and sickening it was.

I don't know why this went so long. The chapters do a good job of analyzing this from both sides.

Being capable doesn't mean doing the thing. For all we know, Joon+grpup could be /capable/ of doing it /right now/ without realizing it (i.e. Bethel eating the bottle). Zorisad Yosivun is a genie, so all the warnings about wording requests and interpreting the answers fully apply.

The very simple truth for why a lot of horrible things happen despite there not being any/much malice behind it is that people sometimes plan out an idea of what's going to happen and stick to it. Bethel thought she knew what was going to happen and how it was going to turn out, she thought she could get what she wanted and Joon would be happy once it was done. Then there was an obstacle and Bethel rationalized it. She could even tell that he was receiving pleasure so her rationalization made sense. While it was a much lesser degree, I have personally experienced this many times before and I think almost everyone has, if not personally then on a macro level.

Second Bethel can see Joon more deeply than anyone so she can see the heightened fear drug flowing through him and other internal signs of rape which other people couldn't.

Third Bethel is a detached entity she is not that physical body and so unlike mortals she is not bound to the random swings of hormones that can influence humans strongly.

Fourthly as Bethel is their house she has an obligation as a house to be like a home. That is provide a safe place and satisfy all the things that you would want from a home, like not worrying about being raped. She like a wife raping husband, or a mother raping her daughter, worse than a stranger raping someone imo because there is a greater violation.

This is the absolute majority of rapes. Being raped by a stranger is much less likely than being raped by someone you know personally. It sucks, but it's true. You can't say she's worse than people if what she does is what usually happens.

#+begin_quote
  if Bethel understood rape then she did it anyway because she's a sadist
#+end_quote

I have said this before but I'll try to explain it as simply as I can. People who understand rape and consent rape anyway without malice or understanding that it's wrong. Yes, that's weird. No it makes no logical sense. It's the same reason why people are anti-abortion but get one themselves because their case is "different" and they continue to judge everyone else. It's the same reason why nazi concentration camp guards could go home every day and be loving parents to their families and not think they did anything wrong. Cognitive dissonance is very powerful and people don't think rationally.

Bethel understands that no means no, but in this case she thought it didn't mean that because this was "different". She understands that you're not supposed to force yourself on someone, but "Joon would be happy" once it was over. Yes, this isn't true. This isn't what happened. This exact thought process goes through peoples heads all the time. It's not because they're overwhelmed by hormones, instincts, or drugs, it's because people, when faced with facts that conflict with their beliefs, are as likely to change the facts as they are to change their beliefs...to be honest they're more likely to change the facts.

**** Again I really don't want to get trapped into defending her, and I wouldn't even try at all if she was a human, even a human who had been though the abuse that she had, because she would still have common ground in that case. But she isn't a human at all she isn't even biological. She has never been biological.

People expect her to be able to understand human behavior like she's a ghost of a human that is possessing the house, but that's not what it's like at all. The only thing she knows about humans is what she has learned from observing them and guessing about why they do things, and also, uh, killing them for like a hundred years. It would be like if crystalline aliens billions of years from now found a digital copy of your brain and used it as an AI program to run a house for some reason and eventually over a long period of time you were able to start to think you understood the crystals a little by observing the ones that lived in your house-body and you noticed that they communicated with each other through different colors and that if two crystals shone a certain wavelength of purple light into each other they bonded and appeared to enjoy each others company more. So eventually you met a crystal who helped you and made your life better, and you wanted that crystal to understand how much you liked them so you shine the correct wavelength of purple light into them, but instead of making them happy it ends up making them afraid of you and now they hate you. Because observation and guesswork isn't enough.

Except in this example you would still have a huge leg up on Bethel because you had memories of your life and even if you couldn't correctly map your motivations and desires and drives 1:1 onto the crystals you at least have as starting point. Bethel never had anything like that. She's never been horny or hungry or sleepy or anything, she started out as a house.

  /So, we had sex, and I pretended that I was fine with it, and I've been stepping on eggshells and edited my spirit, and I've been feeling like shit about it, and that's why I'm not as happy as I should be about you trying to make this themed beach outing a success, and it's why seeing you in a bikini is making me a little bit anxious instead of just horny, not that you would want that, unless for some reason you do./
#+end_quote

Much like Juniper, I was a little concerned what Amaryllis' reaction would be. After this paragraph, I was on the edge of my seat wondering whether the omission of those unsaid words would mean she didn't have a good reaction.

#+begin_quote
  “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I'm worried she'll ... I don't know.”

  Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I'm finished with her there won't be a piece bigger than a splinter.”
#+end_quote

To see her so angry, so supportive, and so willing to prioritise this above all other concerns is deeply satisfying. Amaryllis is the fucking best.

#+begin_quote
  “Those are problems we'll have to deal with,” said Amaryllis. “They're not inconsequential.”
#+end_quote

I really like how she doesn't dismiss Juniper's worry about the big logistical difficulties, but rather notes them as lesser concerns.

#+begin_quote
  “It's going to be hard for me, knowing what I know, to doublethink around Juniper,” said Valencia. “I would rather not have to try. It was already hard not to pick up anything, before. I knew that something was wrong, really wrong, I just ...” she squeezed her fists. “I didn't want to betray trust.”
#+end_quote

Valencia here stands as a beautiful contrast to Bethel, as someone who had access to enormous power (in this case, social power rather than pure might), and who stopped when she was asked.

#+begin_quote
  “You would call it that, if it were someone else,” said Valencia.
#+end_quote

Damn right, and exactly what he needed to hear (obviously, because devil).

#+begin_quote
  “I don't have to risk my life for you,” said Valencia. “I choose to risk my life because it's my life to do with as I please. If it could be me or someone else, I would still volunteer. That there's no other option only simplifies things.”

I did not particularly want to read an entire update more or less dedicated to managing the fallout of a rape. Of course, setting that bias aside, the execution was high quality as usual. I read the chapters and would even say I enjoyed them. But I would have vastly, /vastly/ preferred to read an entire update about pretty much any other possible plot thread. Even another thread dedicated to Bethel being an inhuman monster fumbling her way through human interaction, as long as it wasn't about rape.

I've just read enough rape story arcs for a lifetime. I dunno whether that means "I read too much fiction that relies on the rape card" or "I have unusually low tolerance for the rape card" but the difference is minimal in practice. I'm tired of seeing the formula play out. The victim getting all fucked up, the support network helping them out, the perpetrator either being brought to justice or redeemed. I've seen these steps too many times for them to have any novelty, and I just don't find them interesting at all without that novelty to distract me.

At the end of a chapter, she says:

#+begin_quote
  “And you think that I'm culpable,” said Bethel. Something in the illusion had changed, subtle little differences that together *created an impression of malice*. Bethel's eyes were more sunken, the shadows around her darker and deeper, and the incidental folds of her clothing created points, almost spikes, rather than the aesthetic curves they'd been before. Her fists weren't quite clenched, but she was showing strain in the muscles of her hands. [...] For a moment, *Bethel seemed as though she would snap*, but that moment passed, and she relaxed. “You can undo it,” she said. “Repair it, rebuild it.” [...] “Then tell me what needs to be done,” said Bethel.

That's not the attitude of someone feeling remorse, or wondering about what they should change about themselves. That's the attitude of a child who had her favorite toy taken away, and will say whatever she thinks people want her to say to get the toy back.

***** There's many ways to read those things. Ultimately they're what passes for "expressions" for Bethel, and she's just as if not more capable and likely to use those to obfuscate her real feelings as any human. She could also simply not have the tools to process what happened.

​

She's a house trying to understand the emotional dimensions of sex with none of the built-in empathy and a perfect sensor that's telling her Juniper is enjoying it. As discussed in the batch, the bulk of the emotional impact of the event came afterwards from Joon's mind trying to process it, which is realistic, and something Bethel's psychology fundamentally opposes because she cannot see herself as an abuser due to her trauma.

** I really like how you handle this arc.

Amaryllis reaction and dialog sounded slightly OOC for me, but I can't really put the finger on it. Part of it is that I think Amaryllis or Valencia should have brought up the "this is a tragedy" framing in 167. Part of it is that Amaryllis should take more time to digest the situation. Say,

#+begin_quote
  “And if you tell her, so what?” asked Amaryllis. “You think that's going to solve anything? You think that she's going to agree, to understand that she hurt you? You think that this is going to help her grow and change as a person? Even if it did, Christ Juniper, she broke trust, and you've been miserable for the last three days, I can only imagine, are you -- do you think that you can keep living inside of her, knowing how much she can see, knowing that she might break trust again just because she likes to pull our strings?”
#+end_quote

Amaryllis dialog is laser-focused on "validate Joon's feelings". Given the Amaryllis we have seen so far, this should not be her instinctive reaction; it should be "Shit. Hug Joon, don't rush things". Instead, it is Amaryllis who argues against the more reconcillatory approach that is taken in the end.

On the other side, I don't really agree with Valencia not pushing back against the "punishment" and "culpability" lines in 168. We get told that she is afraid of Bethel's immediate reaction; she could have said "This is not about punishment, it is about healing" and deferred the culpability discussion to the coming weeks/months in exile. So I'd like a bit of internal monologue that explains why she chooses to open that can of worms right now.

I do get the narrative need though, and this is a minor nit to pick in an otherwise awesome arc.

** One of the most mature takes I have seen on the subject of male abuse, I had been disgusted by all the scenes before where he gets aroused for whatever really simple reason and Bethel points it out, and this breakdown on the issues of consent has made the uncomfortable read worthwhile. What I thought was most important was reflecting how Juniper would feel shame, embarrassment, denial, then get more worked up and uncomfortable over time, and I liked that the people he was most afraid of being let down by ended up being the ones most determined to help him. It was /precisely because/ Mary and Val had been dealt a shit hand before that they got outraged about it, in contrast to Bethel having fucked up ideas on consent and feeling like a victim without realising how badly she was hurting others.

A lot better than Valencia or Bethel dying too. Bethel most likely spared Val because she was thinking about her conversation with Mary a few chapters ago. She does want to be a better person. Weird how merging with Ropey seems to have made her a bit more manic and unpredictable. But realising she was abusing Joon the same way she had been abused probably struck a chord.

Valencia did nothing wrong in her life, ever, and I hope to see plenty of her in the future, but I suspect her woobie status will bring the wrath of the DM eventually. More on Val - I am proud to see how shes grown from a scared child into someone who is a force to be reckoned with and a steadfast, mature friend, with or without a demon. Its insane to think she manipulated events, almost entirely without supernatural help, for Bethel to not have any hostages and Juniper to be in an environment where he could talk about what was on his mind. Then she overcomes fear to call out the deadliest being to exist outside an exclusion zone. No coincidence her name links to “Valor”.... what a Gryffindor.

I do think removing the final 2 truly interesting Companions from the picture will make these next few chapters blander, unless Wales has intent to expand on the current cast. Solace has been quiet and hostile since she was revived. Amaryllis is... odd, especially with her relationship to Joon. I love Grak but hes banging a 7 year old and it is fucked up. Raven and Pallida need a lot more work. The Locus however is still the OG.

Final note - this is the chapter I caught up on. What a fucking note. It was only yesterday I was reading Juniper's Kaiju-murdering shenanigans, and a few days before it was Fenn's demise.

** As much as I feel for June, I can't help but keep thinking how sorry I feel for Bethel.

The flashback June had about his uncle tickling him must have been intentional for how it fits so well into the situation: Bethel did an action which made June's body react in what seemed to be a positive way, just like the uncle saw him laughing when he was tickled. And both were ignoring the mental side of things, encouraged by the physical. To Bethel sex is the same as tickling, she isn't human, she doesn't know the difference and she doesn't feel it. I don't think she will ever truly understand what she did and why would she? She isn't human.

To her its just like she tickled June, and then suddenly he is conspiring to kill her. No wonder Val was so scared, from that perspective it must feel to her like June is betraying her.

The whole situation is just so tragic, like [[https://www.reddit.com/user/RMcD94/][RMcD94]] mentioned, Bethel is like a dog who shat on the floor and had no idea what she was doing wrong at the time, and even now to her it is just an "arbitrary rule" she broke and is being punnished rediculously harshly for something she didn't know to be wrong at the time, but would do anything to make it right anyway. And there probably isn't anything that can make it right.

Short answer: Bethel had more than enough information to know that what she did was wrong and why. She even had specific knowledge: Uther raped her, she didn't like it.

If she is a sapient moral agent then she had more than enough life experience to have recognized that this was a bad thing to do and it's appropriate to exile her, or even to destroy her if it's judged necessary in order to protect others from her.

If she's not sapient then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.

So it's possible the parallel isn't obvious to her. (She's unaware that Joon was threatened by the implications of her power).

It's moot though - the problem is her overall moral alignment, starting from when she used to torture and kill people (which, lest we forget, was a lot more evil than anything she is doing right now) means that she doesn't care about Joon as himself, but rather what he represents - a person who wants to live in her and care for her and love her. Ropey may have shifted this to an extent. But in general, people can improve, but I don't know if they can't go from cold blooded murderers to self aware and sensitive to others needs and respectful of consent.

Think about it. Amy wouldn't say let's kill them. Any would say oh no that's horrible, something has went wrong here. Is there a memetic agent corrupting her, did we fail to teach her about consent, is an entad that we forced into her manipulating her?

Instead Amy assumes Bethel was malicious and wants to kill her. Imagine reacting to any other part member like that.

Grak raped you? Well somethings gone wrong there.

Val raped her boyfriend? Well I probably didn't explain consent very well when I explained it to her (notably that she explained it to mind raped Val but never bothered to Bethel WHO IS A HOUSE)

Bethel raped you? Clearly she wanted to hurt you let's murder her it's the only choice.

These chapters have made me more sympathetic for Bethel than ever before. She's a savage dog that they chose to take into their home. They chose to attempt to domesticate her. She was force to take in mind altering entads (likely the human body overwhelmed her with sensations like being mind controlled) on a job she didn't want to do (Rath). Then Bethel as a dog takes a shit in the house and Amy's first reaction is to murder the dog not considering how she was the fucking person responsible for training her. Not only that as a savage dog she can't even fucking speak to anyone because Amy wants to kill her the moment she can and everyone is incredibly hostile towards her. Plus because she is a savage dog with nukes instead of thinking of educating her they think of alpha strike.

I really hope to see more introspection from Amy. What they've done with Bethel is incredibly irresponsible.

If she wasn't house trained why did they give her more weapons?

Why do they act like Bethel is morally responsible instead of feeling empathy for the savage dog they have to put down because its untrainable.

Just really this whole thing has made me disappointed in these characters and emphasises how they'll struggle to deal with anything alien. Again a reminder that Bethel is a house.

The best explanation for Amy being so blinkered is because she's infatuated with Joon

If you compare her to a dog, you won't live. Fair enough. So she wants to be treated like a person, therefore she /is/ a person and a moral agent.

She has wronged at least 3 party members. She needs to own these wrongdoings and start fixing them. The good news is that she had displayed a positive dynamic in the past. The bad news, I think, her reaction in the last chapter was caused by selfishness first and genuine remorse second. Simply put she wants to be inhabitated and she realized that she's just scared away her inhabitants. It would be hard for her to reform and even harder to prove that she truly does (if she does it).

Her litmus test, I feel, would be letting Uther go. If Joon & co were letting her live in exile after what she'd done she must let Uther go, on her own.

*** I think your idea that Amaryllis/the group failed to do the 'simple' task of teaching Bethel about consent ignores the reality of the group's relationship with Bethel.

Bethel has been perpetrating (non-sexual) consent violations against everyone from the very beginning. Most recently not leaving Amaryllis alone to sleep when she asked for it. There are countless others but I don't have time to do a thorough re-read. I also can't remember whether anyone ever said something like "this sort of thing isn't OK" - maybe yes maybe no. If no, I can still perfectly predict Bethel's reaction as "trololol I do what I want". She is absolutely not open to point-blank moralising. I would argue that Mary and Joon have been trying pretty hard with the more roundabout moralising that she actually might deign to listen to. But clearly that wasn't enough.

So you might suggest they should never have added her to the party in the first place. And to an extent I agree - I never liked the idea of adding in a murderous sadist with more power than the rest of the group combined who could potentially just kill or torture all of them whenever she liked. Tragic backstory or no, it certainly doesn't justify what she's done, and it doesn't make her any less dangerous or volatile. And very little since then has really changed my view there.

However, there are mitigating factors to that decision:

1. The game interface. It identified Bethel as a companion. The narrative consequences could be dire if they didn't take her in. And the very nature of the loyalty system suggested that she could be reformed/improve/whatever. Not to mention that up to this point, no companion has ever non-consensually harmed another/Joon while not being mind controlled. So they had a strong prior from all this that "it would be ok".
2. The meta-narrative. They are facing stronger and stronger threats, and hope to be able to save the world from them, empty the Hells, and make reality safe, etc. and they pass up the most powerful potential member of their group they've yet encountered? All it takes is a single apocalypse that they couldn't have averted without Bethel (Mome Rath), and any concerns about the dangers of having her in the group are, in the grand scheme of things, made redundant.
3. Actual signs of improvement. Her marriage to Ropey, which did seem to settle her a little. Sometimes actually respecting people's stated boundaries. It genuinely did seem that she was improving.

Now in my mind, this is not an easily-forseen outcome. You have to connect all of the following:

- "Bethel picked up the Oberlin-dummy entad" (did anyone actually know this, or did she just do it at some point in the chaos without telling anyone? My money is on the latter)
- "The Oberlin-dummy entad can give Bethel sexual feeling/desire" - not something at all obvious from what has been seen of it
- "Sexual desire can overwhelm Bethel, a house with about 8000 other senses that she explicitly stated were overwhelming her before she got an entad that stopped senses being overwhelming to her"
- "When sexual desire overwhelms Bethel, she'll want to have sex with Juniper" - okay, Mary and Joon might have been able to see this, but even then it's not totally obvious
- "When a lustful Bethel wants to have sex with Juniper, she won't take no for an answer" - potentially forseeable, given her numerous non-sexual consent violations, but it's clear from Bethel's statements in 168 that she didn't consider his no a 'real' no, implying that she does understand she shouldn't do it if the no was 'real'.

I just don't think it's reasonable that anybody could have forseen this. Even if they had, I don't think targeted moralising works on Bethel, so I dispute they could have "taught her about consent", a thing the ignoring of which seems to be one of her primary pleasures. And lastly I dispute that not accepting Bethel into the group is a "safe" decision in this world and this narrative for this group. The group is not stupid, and there was not an easy answer/preventative to what happened.

**** You make some solid points here. A fair number of angles I didn't consider.

With 2 I agree especially if that's their logic then I think it's absurd to jump to killing her because she raped Joon. She's torturing Mary and no one suggested that they should kill her because of that.

If we're going to treat Bethel as a malicious maximiser then they should have made a clear line and told her about what she does that will make them kill her.

Tell her that if she raped one of them they'd kill her. Or work out a negotiation so she can contribute to the end of the world. Murder is so unMary (in terms of sacrifice for utility)

The problem is if Bethel is meant to be like that they're not treating her like that. In fact none of their approaches are consistent with any sort of concept of Bethel. They're trying to morally convince her now but how does that make any sense?

I previously spoke about Bethel's alien nature and how you couldn't trust any presentation of her many chapters ago.

If point three happened, that is sexual desire overwhelmed Bethel then she is a victim too. Her ability to control herself and make decisions was stripped from her.

The entad she picked up was because they forced her to go on the mome rath mission.

However I will say that it's not at all house like to fuck your owners so I don't get where this is coming from unless it was all the physical body.

At the end of the day we always knew sex with Bethel was on the cards because of the quests. Everyone knows about them and the fact that no one thought of speaking to the often homicidal and alien house about what consent is and how to conduct this stuff seems rather lax of them.

Honestly I hope they tell the doe about consent because I highly expect her to rape Joon next, not like animals understand rape though just like houses don't. Again we know the quest. Clearly if they didn't speak to Bethel I doubt they told the doe.

Bethel has just done something psychologically deleterious to someone who is not only Mary's best friend and the person she may be in love with, but also is under her belief system unambigiously the most important ally in the task of saving the world.

So now Bethel and Joon can't be kept together because it will be too dangerous for Joon's mental health, and when Bethel realises why she may become an active threat.

Mary experiences great anger and hatred in the moment of realisation, and then dials back down to be more in line with the rest of the group's planning, which is more in line with "we can't trust Bethel anymore, we need to find a way to stay separate from her and keep safe". Seems perfectly in character to me.

*** It's always interesting reading your comments, because they will reliably be contrarian.

Bethel in not "just a house". She is a sapient being. She has access to a sensorium so vast as to be effectively region-locked omniscience. She spent decades (centuries?) with heroes and villains and normal people. She has observed countless interactions among humans and other races. She has a wide array of information to draw on when she needs to make moral evaluations and has undoubtedly heard hundreds of people talking about power dynamics, the feeling of love, the experience of sex, and the powerful negative reactions when those things go badly.

Also: Uther raped her.

Uther forced her to create a body-simulation and have sex with him. Afterwards, he threatened her with destruction if she ever told anyone. She didn't like the feeling of being forced to do that. She was afraid when he threatened her. That's the sort of thing that makes a sensible person take care in situations where sex is involved.

In short: She's very smart. She knows that being raped is unpleasant and frightening. She has had more than enough time and data to understand human interactions. She knew, based on her sensorium, that Joon was upset and unhappy about her proposal even if there was some arousal as well. Despite all that, she went ahead anyway.

Now, you can and probably will find excuses for those things. Let me see if I can steelman them and respond:

- Just because she's seen hundreds or thousands of people talking about power and sex and love and rape is no reason that she would have viscerally understood those things. After all, she's a house. She doesn't have the squishy bits that make those things meaningful.

She demonstrably did understand that being raped and threatened was unpleasant. She should not have inflicted that unpleasantness on others.

- She had just received a body for the first time and was overwhelmed by lust. She was out of control and it's not her fault.

I find this wildly unlikely, but let's roll with it. Assume it's correct, what are the implications? Answer: Anytime Bethel gains access to a new feeling or experience, she may go out of control and harm one of her inhabitants. Therefore, it is not safe to live in her or associate with her. Furthermore, it is not safe for other people to live in her either.

When a human rapes someone and then successfully uses the insanity defense, they don't get off scot free. They get locked up in order to protect the rest of future society from them. There is no way to lock Bethel up, meaning that she must be destroyed in order to protect the rest of future society from her.

- She mistakenly thought that Joon was into it. Sexual arousal and fear can look similar.\\

That is only true for humans and their limited senses. Bethel can literally see inside your body. She has a level of body-reading rivaled only by Val's devil abilities.

At the end of the day, either Bethel is a sapient being with a moral compass or she's not. If she is then she shouldn't have done this and punishment is appropriate. If she isn't then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.

I really like how Bethel's personhood is not even questioned, and the entire group is not hung up on the punishment / "justice" thing. That is, the story is about healing and how to move forward from this event.

Punishment is fleetingly mentioned (and should be, narratively speaking, for reader's sake, since so many real life people would consider it). Different reinterpretations are explicitly non-discussed (Pallida mentions it, and is shut down by "discussing this is not productive"). Revenge fantasies are indulged (being angry and fantasizing about how to blow up bethel is not crazy).

And in the end, everyone acts sane so far. The victim's feelings are validated and his support group assembles. A trusted mediator is chosen. The perpetrator is not immediately cast out forever (Val: "you are still my friend"). Instead, Bethel is immediately temporarily separated, to begin the process of figuring out to what extent healing / reintegration is possible (if at all). It is acknowledged that this is a process with open end, on all sides (including the crew, Joon, and Bethel).

This arc is not just about our crew on Aerb, it is also about how close-knit groups of people can deal with that kind of thing. After initial reservations, I am actually happy with how [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] traded off perceived slight OOC-ness (at least from my reading) for more real-world relevance. To me, the last two chapters were super positive in their outlook.

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] : You surely used for inspiration an amalgam of personal experience from people in your extended circle of acquaintances, half-remembered literature and explicitly remembered literature (e.g. other fics/stories/books that prompted you to mentally said "my characters would do this thing differently, but should learn from that thing", or serious blog posts or literature a la hypothetical "How anarchist communities should deal with rape: Ideals and Experiences from xyz").

Could you post some links for the "explicitly remembered literature" category that inspired this arc?

***** Most of the research for this chapter was in reading how these kinds of issues are dealt with by therapists, reading accounts from people who had been sexually assaulted (with a specific eye towards people who think that their sexual assault maybe wasn't, or who didn't initially characterize it as that). I don't have any specific links; most of it was either Google searches for survivor resources, or AskReddit threads. Plus I tried my best to get some perspectives from both non-Western countries and from the United States in other eras where rape and sexual assault were treated differently, just for the sake of perspective. (I love court cases for the window they give into how educated people think; [[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1399209540378549726&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr][People v.

  Also: Uther raped her.
#+end_quote

That's a blatant misrepresentation. She emphatically did not care about, nor was she particularly affected by, providing Uther with holographic force-sex - any more than the typical human would care about, say, their character in an MMORPG being raped. Uther did go on to threaten, coerce and violate her autonomy, as a consequence of how much weight he put on it, and that /was/ terrible and traumatizing in a way that's reasonably analogous. Keeping in mind that the act itself was in fact meaningless to her, the nature of the violations (Uther of her, her of Juniper) were substantially different enough that we can't just say "she knows what it's like" and be done with it. (For the record, she was explicitly unaware that Juniper was feeling fear at the moment - perhaps because several emotions are chemically similar, or because he was using multithreading to suppress outward response.)

Further, you may be overestimating the depth of her experience of humans. While she is five hundred years old, a significant fraction of that was spent in the boundless pit, mutilating various invaders. Of the remainder, she was for a long time a severely limited intelligence, with limited or no ability to grasp the subtleties of human interactions. Then, her residents were often Penndraigs, who could hardly be role models. Hells, considering how socially regressive Aerb is as a whole, compared to the modern West, I'd sooner expect Bethel to have heard talks on "how to grit your teeth through your wedding night" than on the importance of affirmative consent.

  Bethel held out a hand, and Uther appeared above it, a talking head speaking with restrained fury.

  “If you speak about this to anyone, whisper so much as a word, I'll return here and start ripping away every piece of you. I'll smash your windows and tear up your floorboards. Your power? I'll load you with so many entads you won't be able to think, let alone speak.

Don't so much as think my name, do you understand?” I didn't know how close to the truth that actually was, since by her own admission her intellect and memory hadn't been fully formed at that point, but he was nearly snarling. He seemed ready to launch into something else, another threat from the look on his face, but Bethel waved the image away like it was a cloud of smoke.

**** I definitely enjoy taking the unusual stances. Even in this thread I've had dozen different explanations for Bethel with varying degrees of maliciousness.

I agree with your last sentence, however your point and another user has made reminded me just how evil an act this is.

If Bethel did understand it then she was doing much worse than most simple humans who have only signals to go on. Bethel can see all the internal turmoil of Joon and keep raping him regardless.

It means that her utility function isn't what she says at all.

In fact if what you say is true she is so responsible that she's realistically lying to Val. She does want to harm Joon and her owners and everything seems to demonstrate that she is a sadist house which is bizarre but put it down to entad mergers.

Regardless how do you stop someone being a sadist? Val telling Bethel that Joon was hurt is pointless since Bethel knows that she raped him and knows that rape is damaging and did it deliberately.

The only solution is to draw clear lines with Bethel about the extent of her sadism. If she wants to maximise her pleasure you need to tell her what actions will result in being killed so she can properly map her utility.

In particular the response to killing her for raping him only is a reasonable punishment if she knew that. Then it would actually serve as a deterrent. If however they're not doing it for punishment but as preventative then that's fine if a bit over the top.

If no one told Bethel they'd kill her for raping then she probably was pretty confident she could get away with torturing Joon as she tortures Mary and it looks like she was right about that. She predicted they wouldn't instantly kill her and now she got to try out rape.

Weirdly enough though I come down more on the Pallida side of the situation, although AW did leave her actual perspective fairly ambiguous which does a lot to allow her to represent a wide range of possible other viewpoints on the topic. I was very glad that AW did lampshade that it was possible to perceive the situation differently, instead of having the group have a monolithic and uniform perspective.

If Bethel had never interacted with other sapient beings, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel has had possibly tens of thousands of people pass through her over the years and has had thousands of them live inside her for extended periods.

If Bethel had never been exposed to any moral teachings, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel has had kings and heroes inside her. There have undoubtedly been many, many conversations about the morality of various actions.

If Bethel had never encountered the idea that sex can be unpleasant, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel was raped and didn't like it.

If Bethel had no ability to understand human reactions or identify emotional responses then no one would be arguing with you. Bethel may actually be telepathic or empathic and she definitely has a physical sensorium that allows her to monitor literally every internal and external part of a person's body.

They chose to live in her, to uplift her and raise her. They made her take missions she didn't want to do and what happened is a direct consequence.

Then she comes out and rapes the one person who genuinely likes her, the only one she doesn't have a grudge against. Amaryllis doesn't think they are safe anymore. As Val said, Amaryllis always thought Bethel would cross the line and become dangerous and this has just confirmed it for her.

Bethel understands the meaning of consent. She was raped herself, she was used by others without having a say and she knows it's wrong. As they explicitly point out in the chapters, she thought she knew what was going on and thought everyone would be happy, and she rationalized away the things that were in the way. This happens in real life. Remove the fantasy and I guarantee you that this exact situation happens all the time in our world, someone thinks they know better because otherwise the way they've planned things out was wrong.

Bethel not being malicious doesn't matter. Bethel is an incredibly powerful entity with few morals who has now proven that she is a clear and present threat to everyone around her. If she can't be trusted not to hurt people she herself doesn't want to hurt, then she has to be stopped.

** Great chapters! Male perspective in this rape situation is a great adition. I'd like to add my 2 cents to the discusion.

Situation is obviously much more complex than it appears.

A lot of blame for the situation lies on Juniper, since Bethel was a monster from start and he just though she was HIS monster. He was also giving her false signs knowing she has no social skills and could easily misread a situation, and knowing she has no empathy and not caring since he was using her skills.

Problem for Juniper was not sex part of the rape, it was lack of control and feeling powerless.

Juniper himself is obviously powerful and he likes have power in any relationship displayed so far.

Not surprisingly the way to deal with that situation is gaining more power and gaining control in the relationship by exercising power and banishing her from the group.

He played with fire to gain power, in part for his sexual relationships and he got burned by using powerfull socially retarded person.

*** I think that even to a meta-entad like Bethel, having people be cowed into not conveying all relevant useful information out of fear should have been a highly foreseeable negative consequence of regular threats of violence and attempts to manipulate herself into positions of power over others. Bethel knows that she lacks certain capabilities, but we've never really seen her make an effort to try to train herself to develop them except by eating other entads, which is a major personal failing.

If we want to get real hyper-autistic utilitarian here, maybe she should consider herself lucky nothing worse than completely destroying her relationship with Juniper happened as a result of that persistent negligence of proper interpersonal relationships.

Edit: I reread chapter 164 and have a lot more to say.

#+begin_quote
  “I always thought it was fumbling,” said Bethel. “Two creatures who can barely see each other, barely feel each other, who have to guess what certain physiological responses must mean, groping and grappling while they seek their own pleasure. It always seemed so inefficient. But I think I can see it better, how the mutuality of it works.”
#+end_quote

With this line, horrifyingly enough given /after/ the rape, it might be that raping Juniper /was/ Bethel's attempt to try to develop her social skills, in which case it's a lot messier to diagnose her mistake from her own point of view. If she thought that this was a low-risk of backfiring way to develop her understanding of humans further, it is easier to sympathize with her failing. Pursuing training is exactly the sort of action she should have been pursuing, and not having a good index of what one doesn't know is hard to avoid.

I still think the problems are there, but we have to go one step further back to find them, and they're more myriad. Additionally, there is a bit of taking advantage of hindsight bias involved - I wouldn't have predicted ten chapters ago that due to her problems Bethel would rape Juniper or do anything similarly awful, and so condemning her for not anticipating the same is a bit of a cheat (I would argue she had privileged inside information of her own plans that on net counteracts this excuse, though). Regardless, we can say that an alien intelligence like Bethel should know that

1. she should not be aggressive when acting in high-uncertainty domains

2. should not learn by doing when acting in high-uncertainty domains

3. should be more wary of actions that require her to lie to others to proceed, due to an understanding that part of what informs others' actions is a different factual understanding than her own.

4. should be wary of being influenced by sudden changes to herself after incorporation of a new entad

5. should be patient and learn in smaller but more frequent increments when acting in high-uncertainty domains

6. should consult with others to guide her plans - even if only to reject their views out of mistrust later

7. should consult with her resources on human socialization more, even if she didn't trust any of her residents

8. should try to lean as far as she can from her modus operandi, where she is specifically pursuing improvement in areas her instincts are badly calibrated for

When Valencia explained Bethel's mistake to her in the most recent chapter, Bethel was pretty quick to pick up on what she had done wrong. Even chalking some of that up to Valencia's ability as a persuader, I think their conversation was not bizarre or lengthy enough for us to say Bethel wasn't capable of figuring out on her own that no means no due to her alien mindset. Bethel shouldn't get to demand respect as a fellow highly sentient being unless she's willing to be held to the standards of one.

Meta (still a continuation of the edit): I don't think you should have been downvoted for taking the point of view of the alien evildoer, necessarily, but your comment lacked any kind of hedging or acknowledgement of counterarguments which is probably a component of why it's getting such a bad reception, in addition to less justifiable but still sympathetic reasons like people not wanting to think about how rapists might think. This subreddit should be a place for being willing to delve into the mechanisms of thought behind literary tropes, in my opinion, even those involving violence, but if we're going to pursue that then I think we should try to make our analysis strong in proportion to the amount of weirdness of the topic under discussion, and I don't think you did a great job of doing so. To whatever extent people are downvoting you because you dared to bring up Bethel's point of view I disagree with them, but to whatever extent people are downvoting you because you failed to do a good job addressing Bethel's point of view in a way that acknowledged its flaws, or allowed for the legitimacy of sympathizing with Juniper's point of view, I concur with them.

**** This event is one of the things i hate about d&d and fantazy in general.

We have no explanation on Bethel. People are guided by known psychology, and rest of the races have similar behavior granted by them from evolution. But we have no idea what guides Bethel, and neither does Joon or Mary. And yet they adopted her, traveled with her, empowered her and introduced her to civilization. Even after shes shown clear anti social tendencies. Any rational inteligent being should know right away that you do not trust completely alien entity with unknown motivation. Yet Joon trusted her. It could be the author knows whats hes doing and having Joon being ulitmate villian, or he just made MC complete idiot for no apparent reason and just be it a plot device. Its almost always the latter, but i hope its the former so i make analysis based on it.

*** This subreddit deals a lot with alien intelligences, and especially these last few chapters, a lot of people where trying to analyse the alien-ness of Bethel's mind, but to be honest I can't imagine a lot of stuff more alien to my read on Juniper, Bethel, and their relationship than your interpretation of them just now.

**** Well we don't even have a professed reason for why Bethel did it but her reaction seems like a dog who took a shit inside and gets shouted at for it.

The dog will do anything to make it right.

Either she didn't know it was wrong (who's fault is that), or she did. Both have massive implications

**** Whats so alien there? He saw a monster he could use for himself and it backfired. Like taming a tiger who attacks his handler. Juniper likes power in personal life and relationships. He wants to be DM, he dates 15 year old, his choice for dating in his harem is not Mary but Fenn who whom he can be considered superior.

***** It's alien because it flies in the face of Juniper's mental processes, most of which are made clear through the narration. In no way does the fact that Juniper hated being raped imply he has some objective moral call to then gain power and expel Bethel. To think that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how behaving in a society of peers works.

****** Juniper mental proceses are mostly rationalisation of his action. Most inteligent and reasonable actions are atributed to Mary, or given in a backdrop in "we decided to use this.." without explaining mental process.

In this chapter we see Valencia doing what best suited Joon, giving control back to him and taking it away from Bethel. I wouldn't be suprised to see in the end Juniper being main villian of the story, since this saviour of the world complex is not rational or normal behavior. Him date raping Mary, or destroying the world when she finally rejects him wouldn't suprise many at this point.

His behavior is not healthy is my saying, and my ESL trying to say. It was unhealthy long before the rape, and it's what brought him into situtation that got him raped (he intentionally put him self into the position). Bethel was never a complete person so "she" can't have full responsibility for the action.

******* How does leaning on his friends for support push him further down the path of villainhood than shutting up and gathering power to unilaterally get rid of Bethel? You're saying he's doomed to be a villain at the same time you say he should've behaved like a sociopath.

Even your logic about Joon's romantic choices flies in the face of what's there in the text. Joon avoids romancing Mary because he thinks she's purpose-made by the GM for that role. He goes for Fenn specifically because she seems more likely to be his equal. The power imbalance only appears later and is a source of stress for both of them, not just Fenn.

He dates a 15 year old, unhappily, simply because she was there after he broke up with a girl his age who he was genuinely happy with. Your logic is built on special pleading. You even miss the fact that Joon's GMing is hardly a dominance struggle. His style is built around ideals that are incompatible with that view.

******** Sorry for the late reply.

Like i said for Bethel, she is a completely alien intelligence without any obvius motivation behind her pshyology and clear antisocial tendencies. Add to that huge amout of power she has why would the group invite her along and introduce her to civilization and inocent people? That was just stupid. Even before that i always wondered about Joons motivation for saving the world. Mary was litteraly groomed for that, a she has unique pshyhology. Solance doesn't care one bit about the world only about the druids. Garak is leeching dopamine the magic connection with Joon gives him to avoid depresion...etc. Everyone has motivation except Joon. His only motivation is power and control the system is giving him (not a good sign) and his obsession with Mary (also not a good sign). We know he loves control from his stories (DM, dating choices etc...), but we never seen his obsessive past. What we do know is that Arthur was a better man that Juniper and he got corrupted by the system.

So my proposal that Junper will get fed up with this, Mary will deny him at certain point and he will become villian with Bethel's help. He subconsciosly planned it all along, that is why he empowered Bethel and brought her along.

  Problem for Juniper was not sex part of the rape, it was lack of control and feeling powerless.
#+end_quote

I luckily have zero experience with this, but I thought that that's usually the case. Especially when it involves female on male PiV rape, which is very rarely physically painful to the victim.

*** Also they gave Bethel a body without considering the physical urges impact on her mental health.

If we take her word that she didn't want to hurt him then she was overwhelmed by lust? Who's responsible for not checking for that? Imagine being a house and then suddenly you have this new urge you can't control which makes you ignore someone you care about say no. The mental trauma could be severe of course its unclear what the reason was since AW didn't state even her professed reason for ignoring him saying no.

There's the larger implication that no one spoke to Bethel about consent and how it works which is ridiculous since Amy did it for Val and they basically have all raised Bethel from what she was like when they found her.

Considering she was basically mentally insane she's their responsibility and I want to know what they did or more likely didn't do that led her to rape.

I don't understand the conversation with her because she quickly seems to understand its wrong but she doesn't ever ask why. If she knows why then why did she do it to begin with?
