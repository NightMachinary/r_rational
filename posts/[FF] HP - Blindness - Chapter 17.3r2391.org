** One of the rare times where I'm willing to downvote a recommendation. The first section (1981) was so promising, but I think I just ended up more disappointed because of it. What I wanted from this fic was a Harry who was actually blind, and could barely learn magic, but in some sort of exchange had a loving mother and brother, and still somehow had to fulfill the prophecy.

** I really enjoyed this story. My only complaint is the enemies haven't been very challenging so far.
