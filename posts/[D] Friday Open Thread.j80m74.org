Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Couldn't wait for the next Monday thread, so posting it now, but what does everyone think of the newest volume in Cradle, Wintersteel?

I thought it was the best novel so far, expanding on everything that's happened so far and revealing crucial information regarding several loose ends and advancement into the highest levels. Will has truly outdone himself, the character writing, insights, and action are all fantastic. Some of these moments have been building up from the previous volume or even since the first volume, and it is glorious.

I think Cradle truly is one of the peaks of xianxia, and Wintersteel has been one of the most cathartic reads all year. The sequence of fights near the end are just so satisfying. Man, I still can't get over the Yerin and Lindon stomps. Especially with said Lindon stomp proving himself over his inner conflicts and showing that he still has it, especially after what happened in Uncrowned. I had high expectations for Wintersteel, but the actual volume far surpassed them.

*** *Spoilers through Witnersteel, obviously.*

Wintersteel was one of the more enjoyable books I've read this year, and it did a good job picking up where the cliffhanger of Uncrowned left off. It also developed the world and characters a lot; prior to this book, the fandom consistently brought up how Yerin wasn't very developed, but this book finally fleshed her out for me.

And we finally get insight into Cradle's global powers (Monarchs, factions, etc.)! All in all Wintersteel really finished sketching out the world for me; before this I felt as though Lindon/Yerin were being led blind through the world. I'm hopeful they'll have real agency in the next book.

I also really appreciated how most of the enemy competitors and "villains" weren't 2D "evil," and instead were shown to be normal people dealing with the horribly competitive system that is Cradle's world order. I'm hopeful that the report on the Remnant Monarch and her "cooperative" system is foreshadowing this issue being addressed. For example, the scene where the Dreadgod cult members meet with Yerin felt forced, but I appreciated what the scene did to justify the Dreadgod cults.

Not really criticism but I did have a quibble- the Ruby issue was handled very oddly in my opinion. I felt like there was a disconnect between the reader and the characters because from the observer's perspective Ruby is no longer a menacing blood shadow but a new-born sentient being created by infusing Yerin's being into her (exactly what we've been told would happen by following the Blood Sage's technique).

In this book there are countless examples of her in this role- The scene with her petting the rabbit, her free-spirited pursuit of Lindon, etc. And yet Lindon/Yerin and the others don't seem to update to this view and Ruby's treated with horror/suspicion the whole time despite intellectually being aware that she is likely a ~clone of Yerin now.

And then she's quickly gone without ever really exploring her?! It just felt like the topic wasn't given the time it needed to develop the issue and make the scene of her merging with Yerin into the meaningful moment it deserved to be.

Overall it was a solid book, well worth the wait.

*** Agreed it's incredible though I will say it felt like it was missing one thing. The ending felt abrupt like all this stuff just went down, a bunch of threads were tied, a bunch of people died and they basically don't talk about it or reflect on it or anything despite it seeming like the perfect time to do so.

Overall I still rate it 9.9/10 but it felt like it was only a single scene away from a perfect book

*** I thought it tied everything up very nicely.

A critique points that I would have though is that I would have liked to seen more dialogue between Lindon and Yerin to develop the romance even more. Like in the restaurant scene, it literally ended with a single sentence along the lines of “Yerin told Lindon about her doing something with a sword.” It felt, idk, abrupt.

Otherwise, it was a very solid entry in a multi-book series, a type of writing that often sees quality dropping significantly as more books are written.

My thoughts.

** What can/is there any point in even trying about the development of parasocial relationships?

It seems that going by comments that people seem incapable of thinking of people who make content they enjoy as anything other than some perfect superhumans who should be worshipped.

You regularly see comments on youtube especially on music videos ranting about the artist (not the song, nor even their other songs, about the artist personally - not I love their music, not I love this song, I /love/ THEM, the person) when content producers are just like everyone else, they could be Jesus or they could be Hitler the ability to make enjoyable content doesn't make them any less of a person.

There is a strong incentive for all parties to cultivate this persona further as it makes them more money but is it good for the mental health of anyone involved? You can see it most starkly in Japan but it's pretty universal.

This was prompted when I was reading some comments on a discord about a guy who wants J-idols to be both honest (don't lie about not having a boyfriend) and pure (don't have a boyfriend and don't ever have one) and others were trying to explain that they lie because it makes them more money and their pureness is irrelevant and not something you should ever demand of someone anyway.

Thoughts?

It's a very privileged problem but I'm not sure how it'll get better. How many celebrities need to turn out to be "evil" for people to stop worshipping them?

*** I can't remember where I read this because it was definitely over five years ago, and I can't find any sources, so take this with a grain of salt. It might be 100% false. It's probably not, but I'm going by memory here.

So, some researchers were trying to pinpoint the area of the brain that recognizes human faces. I guess that would be difficult in something more accurate like an MRI, so they just used an EEG to read spikes in electrical activity and had subjects sit in a neutral room and have other people enter the room. I don't remember how they controlled for whatever. Maybe they just showed the subjects pictures of faces. They also exposed subjects to the faces of loved ones / friends / family / acquaintances, whether that was in person or just pictures.

They found that an area of the brain recognizes "HEY THAT'S A HUMAN FACE" and a smaller subsection of that area recognizes "HOLY SHIT THAT HUMAN FACE BELONGS TO A MEMBER OF MY SOCIAL CIRCLE."

Somebody had the bright idea to do the experiment again, but with a television. Random television programs that subjects never watched with unfamiliar actors triggered the general "HEY THAT'S A HUMAN FACE" area, and subjects' favorite shows (or popular shows they were familiar with starring well known actors) triggered the more specific "HOLY SHIT THAT HUMAN FACE BELONGS TO A MEMBER OF MY SOCIAL CIRCLE" subset.

It's like the savanna principle. Ancient brains interpreting modern stimuli, and all that jazz. It doesn't matter how rational you are or how high your IQ is, your brain is dumb and easy to trick.

You see Robert Downey Jr. on your screen and you consciously think, "hey, it's RDJ, he seems like a pretty cool guy and I like his movies," but your brain reacts the same way as it reacts when you run into a friend at the grocery store, something like "hey, it's my friend Tony Stark, I've known him for years, he's definitely part of my social circle." People who fanboy/fangirl over musicians in particular are (I'm guessing, but I feel like it's a reasonable guess) generally on the younger side. Lots of self-insert One Direction fanfic on Wattpad. So maybe younger people don't yet have the life experience necessary to separate fantasy from reality and they're just experiencing the feeling of "I know this person" without being able to consciously override that with the rational thought of "I've never met this singer/actor in my life and they have no idea I even exist." Maybe adults with that problem are just lonely. I remember reading an article on Cracked dot com like 7 years ago (yeah yeah I know, /real accurate source you're citing there, buddy, Cracked is definitely peer-reviewed, and you definitely remember the details 7 years later/) about something like a "naked picture test," like, in the '70s they asked people if they had somebody in their life they trusted enough to guard a naked picture of them and they asked the same thing in the '10s, and in the '70s only like 1 in 10 people said they had zero people in their life they trusted that much and in the '10s a full 1 in 2 people said they had zero people they'd trust... There were other statistics, the "naked picture test" was just the most memorable, because it's funny. Anyways...

TL;DR: Brains are stupid. Even your own brain thinks you're personally acquainted with the stars of your favorite movies/shows, and maybe people who get obsessive about it are just lonely or young or whatever.

**** It would be interesting to see the differences in responses to different technology levels such as: writing, radio, tv, and a livestream. I would guess that more live coverage is making these issues worse, "RDJ the person going through the motions on screen" is probably less pleasing to our monkey brains than "RDJ responding in real time, or even better to ME!(the chat/donations)". Celebrities intensified with TV I wonder how intense they will get now, let alone as things progress. "Standing right next to my hero" in VR probably lights up a hell of a lot of brain regions.

***** I've thought a lot about VR.

When I was like 2 and 3 years old, I had a "plan" to "invent" a door in the side of the TV cabinet that would let me get into the world of the movies I saw on the TV. I understood none of it was real - I'd had some nightmares about Cookie Monster chasing me down my house's hallway so my parents bought a Cookie Monster hand puppet and showed me how it worked, even hooked up our video camera to the TV and showed me the puppet on my dad's hand and on the TV at the same time, and I had been shown a flip book as an explanation for how cartoons work, like, I /knew/ the stuff on the TV wasn't real, but I still thought it might be real. I also /knew/ that my toys weren't alive from the ages of 5 to 10, but I still thought my toys might be alive from the ages of 5 to 10.

VR is going to be ubiquitous in just a decade or two, and AR might be even more ubiquitouser even sooner. Some parents let literal babies - like, literal 1-year-olds - use smartphones and tablets. There's no way too-young kids aren't going to be using VR/AR, and there's no way it's not going to confuse the everloving hell out of them. If I'd had access to the type of AR we're going to have in 2027 when I was 3... who knows. The '30s are gonna be interesting.

**** 10s like 1910 or 2010?

I am fascinated by that information that people see celebrities as within their monkey sphere but it makes total sense. If you do find those studies do share

How do you combat something so biologically ingrained?

Unless you have lucky parents no one teaches young people that celebrities are real people and not their friends and no one warns them about the dangers of their best friend being a youtube millionaire who has never heard of them.

As more and more content gets produced will parasocial relationships keep replacing ordinary ones so eventually everyone will have no one they trust because the only friends they have are content producers who respond only when they donate thousand of pounds

*** I've always liked phrasing praise of artists as "I like your work." Doesn't link it to the art-liker's self-identity the way "I'm a fan" does, or focus on generic praise like a "You're amazing." Probably helps to whatever small degree phrasings shape perceptions. And people tend to use phrasings they've heard, so using it yourself lets it spread a little. That's a tiny tiny lever for social change, but it's the best one I have handy.

**** I agree.

I do think that language can influence your brain and your choice of language can be a vessel to make even greater change on yourself than just using the different word at first does but I do wonder how much of an impact it really has at the end of the day. It's not just a reflection but how much more than a reflection is it?

If we tore out pronouns from the English language for example, what would that mean for gender in ten years time that would have been different from how it was before?

*** The halo effect of celebrities and leaders has always existed, although live streaming may be making it more intense and widespread. People developing cult followings certainly isn't new, and I'm not even sure the number of "cult followers" has actually increased, they could just be louder now due to the internet. The #1 thing we need to do is take steps to reduce social isolation, issues with parasocial relationships are a symptom of this larger problem.

Changes in technology and culture have led to people becoming more and more isolated. Every study I've seen has shown that decreasing time around others decreases well being, even for introverts. We are all trending in that direction. Working on reducing physical isolation is the clearest answer: we can take concrete steps to improve it with low risk.

A messier problem is cultural isolation: locally we are more fragmented than ever. People don't share the same world views and interests as much any more. Social media bubbles are part of this but in general we have more and more niche hobbies and communities. The most harmful example is politics: people have wildly different foundations for their politics now more than ever. On the less extreme end this generally reduces the quality of time spent with others and the drive to do so, we just don't have as much in common to talk about compared to the past. Trying to fix this would be a nightmare.

Japan is a painful example: there's a culture of isolation, anti-social cultural trends (no judgement, but treating the opposite sex extremely differently halves your social opportunities), and the largest social force remaining is the workplace, which benefits from the culture. I also don't think blaming the J-idols and telling them to make sacrifices by being more real is the best way. You should blame the industry for building them up like this and not protecting them. The industry should work to reduce the harm they get when they are more real, and you should try to change the fan culture.

My priorities of interventions:

1. Education: it's cheap, effective, and low risk. Post Maslow's hierarchy pyramids everywhere with socialization emphasized, social health experts etc. Teach people that they should schedule X social time a week just like exercise, and hope for better success.
2. Increase availability: Do interventions to increase the availability/acceptability of social events. Right now these would have to be online, but later the options are endless. There's tons of room for easy improvements.
3. Reduce isolation incentives: trickier, hard to balance, and unlikely to happen. I would target specific industries and work to remove the incentives for them to increase the isolation of people. Forcing more transparency is "easy" and good for citizens.

Thanks for reading my rant! I've thought a lot about social isolation issues, after I realized I myself am having problems with it and that they don't improve over time by default. Water is wet, if you do nothing nothing changes. If anyone wants to talk personal plans I'd be happy to share as a young avoidant person.

*** I prefer to maintain an idealized version of an author/content creator in my mind. Doing so enables me to get immersed in enjoying their creation without intrusive negative thoughts spoiling the moment.

That said, I fully understand that human beings are not perfect, and very, very few live up to the ideal. Therefore, 90% of the time I strive to keep my interaction with the artist, and knowledge of their personal views, to a minimum.

The other 10% of the time, I follow the artist's social media presence because of all of the following: a) they are unfailingly honest, down to earth, and courteous in all online interaction, b) they avoid sharing any details of their personal life, and c) they avoid expressing religious or political views.

That's all a content creator needs to do to maintain my distant admiration.

*** The human brain is a neural network. Neural networks work on the basis of pattern recognition.

...it's amazing how much of human thought that explains. Take this example, for instance.

When you meet a good person, who you /know/ is a good person, then you feel betterl there is a good person in the area, who does good thing, therefore the odds are that /good things are going to happen/ and you feel (at least a little) good in anticipation already.

But this is a pattern. You meet a good person, you feel good. Therefore, if someone does something that makes you feel good, they are a good person. (Yes, I know the logic here is flawed. But it's a /pattern/.) Now, here's this guy who makes content that you enjoy. That is to say, he makes you feel good. Therefore, says the pattern-recognising human brain, he /must/ be a good person!

...which is why it's a shock when he turns out to be a rampant bigot (because the human brain does not like to be /wrong/). Suddenly, all that content that you enjoyed is tainted by association (because it made you /wrong/) and you feel personally attacked and betrayed (because he did something that made you /wrong!/ It must have been deliberate!) and you can no longer enjoy that content - or even things that remind you of that content (because it reminds you of a time when you were /wrong/).

** So I posted last week about making a new subreddit, and I got a lot of discussion on it, and it made me realize that my idea of what I wanted for it is somewhat nebulous. Suggestions ranged from "Don't, we don't need to split the sub" to making the new sub '[[/r/ratadj][r/ratadj]]', but I don't think I had a good enough idea of what I wanted at the time.

The reason I spend a lot of time on this sub isn't because I try to read rational works, it's because this is one of the few subs that doesn't care about medium or genre, and the weekly recommendation threads always have excellent content at high volume. I'd say I have a rational slant, but it certainly isn't everything I read, or want to.

I don't want a sub that contains a subset of this subreddit, as this sub is inactive enough already. I think I want a sub that's everything on this sub and more: Less targeted towards 'rational' works entirely, to form a new community that includes all sorts of well-written fiction, from entirely rational webserials, to mainstream published novels, to webcomics that hardly make any logical sense at all. I just want well-written fiction with depth, in whatever form they may take.

So with that, what does everyone think about [[/r/DeepFiction]]? I've gone ahead and created the sub, but I don't want to try and split the sub if we're worried about that (I think most initial posts are going to be crossposts or links, to not steal discussion) and have set it to restricted while I try and build it out correctly with community input.

I, anecdotally, basically never read sidebars unless I'm going to make an actual post. I wouldn't have stayed on this sub for more than a few minutes (especially not long enough to see that it's far more than just 'rational fiction') if not for my general interest in such works.
