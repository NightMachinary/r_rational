Every so often in my fanfic, I leave challenges for my readers(normally in the form of asking them to solve cases). Once, a few chapters back, I made plot developments contingent on how well they thought up plans. This worked spectacularly, and the story progressed with the reader's ideas.

In my most recent chapter, I decided to try that again, with the main character's life at stake. I received zero submissions within my time limit(assuming I get none in the next 48 hours). Should I end the fic with a sad ending?

EDIT: I will be unavailable to respond to suggestions for 26 hours or so due to religious reasons.

EDIT 2: One of my reviewers submitted an excellent solution(FFN name: The Anguished One). Thanks for the advice! I may write two endings anyway, just because.


** No, don't give it a sad ending unless that's what's most appropriate to the work. A piece of serial fiction lives on much longer than its initial run and the first audience that read along with it. I get comments and reviews years after the fact by people finding stuff I've written for the first time.

If you give it a sad ending just as a matter of consequence, you're weakening the work for everyone who will read it in the future.

*** It depends on why the author is writing it. Do they want the fic to stand alone, or if is it more of a sort of DnD game where the purpose is the journey of writing it collaboratively with his audience?

*** Ok, I think I'll use a fake ending style thing and then put out a new chapter the day after. It should work well with the canon.

** I generally just hide all sorts of hints that my characters will figure out /eventually/ but a perceptive audience could figure out far sooner. And then I don't say anything, and if people work it out, good for them.

The whole 'testing your readers' think worked on the final exam, but that was a rather specific case, at the end of a very long fanfiction with an already very dedicated reader base. Its not something to really throw around lightly unless you /know/ you have readers who would be able to figure it out.

*** To be fair, he actually had a very low standard for winning. Partially transfiguring CNTs to decapitate the Death Eaters was not a hard leap, particularly with the excerpt at the beginning of the story. I think there were at least half a thousand comments with the expected answer.

*** Didn't he also do it in Three Worlds Collide? Although he did give both endings, and it might be that the only difference is what's canon.

*** Ok, thanks. See my response to Alexander Wales for my plan about what to do.

** That seems rather harsh, especially on future readers. You're effectively punishing them for the disinterest (or incompetence) of your current readers.

Perhaps you could write two endings?

** Write the ending that happens, with a preface saying that "this is what happens!". At the end, leave a lot of white space, then "Fooled you! Tune in next time for the worst ending that doesn't end in death!"
