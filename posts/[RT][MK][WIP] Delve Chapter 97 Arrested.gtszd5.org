** Kinda a bit of a bait with the title.

Huh, I had honestly thought that either all the Watch had gone in and died or Velika would gone and killed them regardless. Surprising that evidently so many are still alive.

On the "how is Rain totally overpowered" topic, not much new. Evidently he did indeed break his soul somehow, but is that just a side effect of something he did or is he going to gain some unique understanding of how is soul works?

*** Yeah it seems this is introducing rain on the path if studying soul manipulation. Which I'm certain is something that'll take place over multiple books, not a quick path to level raising.

**** Like at this point I would totally be down for Rain realizing that the level limit is a function of his soul he can edit and just bumping it up to 99. At least we would get some action.

****** Just bumping the level limit doesn't remove the challenge. There still would be lots of leveling up to do and plenty of story associated with doing it.

The numbers haven't really been going up at all for like 3 months now. He's maxed on most of his skills. I guess he could randomly encounter a higher level blue somewhere, but that's just about as challenge removing as figuring out how to bump the level limit himself.

******* Not when Rain does most of his levelling up passively.

And, boring slog while trapped in the cave aside, there's been lots of plot with Rain trying to organise the city and associated goings on. I'd rather have interesting plot and no level ups than the reverse.

*** You're maybe getting downvoted because Rain did /eventually/ read the letter, but I agree with your post in spirit. He went "oh it's probably not urgent, I'll go take a bath and read it in a few hours" which felt very off given how important & dangerous Velika is right now.

*** I personally think not wearing his armor was a more poor choice. Mostly because of protection reasons but also branding. The people trust Lord Night Cleaner not Rain the Ragman.

I'll admit he's probably less intimidating without it and that probably contributed to the Watch not being more on edge and that it's a good thing to try and deal with his issues but time and place are freaking key!

I imagine the note was a summons with a date for later so that was why Carten wasn't insistent on Rain reading it ASAP. It still was a suboptimal choice given it's speculation on my part and on Rain's with his reasoning being Carten didn't burst through the door but it's arguably understandable.

**** It was easy to miss because it was a single sentence in the middle of a paragraph, but he read the letter. Carten just said she's in a mood so Rain should wait for her to summon him instead of visiting her.

**** Right, and "if someone steals my armor I'll just search the city" is incredibly dumb. His detection radius isn't that large and an angry person could throw it into the river or a deep hole. He could always just wear it and carry the helmet so people can see his face.

Taking a hot bath to relax? Great. Ditching your armor while in a civil war zone? No.

***** Nobody hates Rain, though. The city's problems are from a lack of policing and opportunism, so given nobody else can even use his armour, who would be both capable and motivated to steal it? The average opportunist, even if they figured out where and how to get it, would at least be trying to sell it for food or somesuch.

****** The nobles will not look kindly at someone giving out water. If I was a noble I'd hide the armor and make it super hard and or inconvent to get to.

Though I wouldn't think to check a frozen pool of water... Rain probably isn't the only one with Detect, the ability to melt and refreeze water so yeah. Though the stealing would be motivated by annoyance and more so than hate.
