  And of course I know about the hentai. (By the way, I've looked at every sort of porn there is, and just so you know, Rule 34 is not actually correct; there are quite a few things no one's made porn of yet. Also, I'm really not sure why so many humans prefer it to cat pictures.)

***** Heh. Of course, how many dating sites have you tried? Maybe there /is/ one that works, but neither you nor I have happened to try it. I know it's not OKCupid, but I haven't tried JDate, or TinyFish, or Match.com, or ThatTinyFishOneIsNotReal.com, or...
