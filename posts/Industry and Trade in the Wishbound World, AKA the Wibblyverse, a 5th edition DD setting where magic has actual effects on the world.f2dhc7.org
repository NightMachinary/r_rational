** Though I have never played any version of DnD, wouldn't irrigation via endless water cause environmental issues in the long term?

Otherwise, everything you've written sounds rational at first glance :)

*** It totally does, and rising sea levels are a concern in the Wishbound World in a way analagous to how global warming is a concern in our world.

**** can't you just portal the runoff out to the elemental plane of fire or something?

in a universe with an arbitrary amount of extradimensional space this seems like it shouldn't be a problem

like just put one end of a portal in the ocean and the other in the planar equivalent of /dev/null

****** The question isn't whether it's permanent, the question is whether the cost to transport water to another plane is less than what you gain from using Endless Water, gallon for gallon. If you get an X gp gain from using 100 million gallons of water, and it costs X-1 gp to get rid of 100 million gallons of water, then it's fine to use temporary portals to get rid of it.

******* Okay, I know of no convenient ways to transport significant quantities of water to another plane.

The only spell that actually makes a portal to another plane is Gate, which is a 9th level spell that lasts for 1 minute.

I guess Demiplane sort of qualifies. Demiplane is an 8th level spell which gives access to an extraplanar 30 foot cubic room for 1 hour. Also not a great option.

I suppose Magnificent Mansion might be usable for the disposal of more convenient waste, but it's a 7th level spell.

******** Why would you need endless water though? Wouldn't it be more useful to, say, recycle sewage outflow via Purify Food & Drink? It's not as if the water mysteriously vanishes after it's absorbed by plants. Also, aren't there Create Water and Destroy Water spells? The former of which can even be applied as rain.

********* Those spells would work, but they require spellcasters to cast them each day, whereas Decanters can be used by anyone.

********** That's true, but they're very low level spells. I guess it depends on how easy it is to make/distribute decanters, versus train farmers to be low level divine spellcasters.

*********** Well, the Wishbound World has a very long history. Most Decanters are quite old. Imagine that the formula for crafting Decanters is public, and all one needs is a vial from a whirlpool from the Elemental Plane of Water (as suggested in Xanathar's.) Now imagine that a major city produces 1 Decanter per year. There are 100 major cities. 100*2000 = a whole lot of decanters that have accumulated over the ages.

This is a gross simplification of course, as the rate of Decanter production is somewhere between linear increasing and slow exponential over time. But you get the idea, and in the modern Wishbound World there exist something like 1-10 Decanters per 1000 people.

************ If you have one Decanter for a village of 100 people, I feel like people might go with the belt-and-suspenders approach-- having a Decanter is handy, but having at least one or two cleric or druid trained in farming-useful spells is even better, because they can do other things, and you're not doomed if some bandits take the village treasures.

Anyway, great thread, I'm enjoying this take on productionizing D&D spells and items.
