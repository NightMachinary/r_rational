  Alice experienced a momentary flood of emotions. First, fear and loss at the idea that her father might be dead, followed by relief that he wasn't accompanied by dismay that he was in fact about to join them and anger that he was once more intruding into her life, followed by guilt at feeling that way after just moments ago facing the idea that he might have been gone.
