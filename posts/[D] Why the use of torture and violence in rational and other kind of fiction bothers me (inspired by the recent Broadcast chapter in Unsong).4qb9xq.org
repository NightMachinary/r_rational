#+begin_quote
  If there's an aesthetic common denominator I can describe from all of these, or at least most of them, it's something like: blunt and cynical (often with humorous intent) in tone, dark or at least not reluctant to get very dark at times, often includes extremely powerful or intelligent characters, sense of scale or “many orders of magnitude.”
#+end_quote

I don't really like "very dark" aspect of it anymore. And I thought Unsong was meant to be lighthearted and humorous, and I'm not sure if it can be that after the Broadcast chapter.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41f2mv/rt_unsong_chapter_3_on_a_cloud_i_saw_a_child/cz1unad?context=3][So here's what Scott Alexander said in the beginning of the book.]]

#+begin_quote
  I am constantly boggled by people who have read my previous stories still being surprised that I like humor in fiction.

  But I am trying to make the book able to stand on its own aside from the humor (sort of like HPMoR or Discworld, which both included humor but weren't about humor), so I hope you'll stick around anyway.
#+end_quote

I thought I had finally found a piece of rational fiction that's mostly just fun and doesn't include that much death and torture so I was a bit disappointed by the Broadcast chapter. And also for other reasons than the tonal shift (It felt like watching a children's TV series in which there's a brutal rape all of sudden.) I've read and watched my share of grimdark fiction like that. The violence grabs your attention and makes the story more intense and seemingly more meaningful with more at stake. But does it really make it better or is it just a cheap trick? Is intense fiction really better fiction?

So here's my feelings on the subject and why the excessive use of torture bothers me in fiction (note, feelings, not the objective truth)

- Torture and violence are things that happen a lot in the real world even now in the year 2016. I just begin to think what the victims would think about if they saw it used in fiction, and whether they'd consider it disrespectful.

- It somehow disturbs me that people are devising imaginative ways to cause misery and torture people, even if it's only fictional. It's especially disturbing when you acknowledge that torture is something that has happened a lot throughout human history. It kind of affirms that even ordinary people are capable of this kind of cruelty and it's part of human nature. It probably is, since dominating and bullying other people is so common.

- It's a kind of superstimuli. "Torture porn" is a word for a reason. Like many other types of superstimuli, consuming it and enjoying it makes me feel dirty somehow. And since it's superstimuli, creators will probably try to make it more and more horrifying to make it have the same effect on consumers of fiction as the previous depictions of violence have had. This seems to be a trend in fiction, seeing how bland some earlier forms of fiction were in this regard. Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones have been the most popular shows in recent years and both are really dark.

- The world itself dark enough in itself. Even if the world is a better place than in the past, the lives of happy people still contain a lot of conflict, suffering and death.

- I wonder if it's a sign of privilege to enjoy fiction with a lot torture and violence. This is after all one of the longest periods without war in the western world in recent history. I don't think people who've gone through war would like to see the same thing in the fiction they consume. For example the Golden Age of Comic Books wasn't nearly as dark as some of the popular fiction nowadays.

- I become afraid if I will see something like this in the future if a war or some other kind of conflict breaks out, or the world becomes a worse place in some other way. It's harder to enjoy it if you fear it might become reality.

Wildbow's stories are probably the worst offenders in this, and I'm not that enthusiastic about them anymore.


** I thought the Broadcast worked.

Watching Thamiel subvert the angels or bully Sohu was kind of bad, but it wasn't evil in the same way. Everything else in the world of Unsong is fun. Magic names, Nixon playing the piano, etc... The story of how Hellish Hell actually is important. Otherwise, Thamiel is just the Robot devil from Futurama.

So I do agree that rational fiction as it stands tends to be a little darker than I would like it to be, but don't feel like I can actually do anything about that, because that goes so contrary to who I am as a person and how I see the world.

*** I doubt I've read everything that you've written, but I've certainly read most of it, and I'm a fan. Your work, even when violence occurs, is not objectionable in the way Xenograteful is talking about for the Broadcast. The Last Christmas heads in that direction, but it still doesn't go so far.

I think part of the issue with the Broadcast in Unsong is the odd leaps in tone. For example, the Azkaban material in HPMOR gets pretty dark, but it's clear that this is integral to the story and serves to provide core motivations and goals of several major characters. In contrast, Unsong presents the Broadcast bookended in between comedic segments.

If it was more explicitly tied to the motivations and actions of Aaron or the Comet King, etc, it would at least be more understandable. But the story isn't written as a continuous plot timeline, so the result is an appearance of gratuitousness. Being shocking and grotesque for the sake of being shocking and grotesque. It's possible that this was the literary intent of the author, to represent how this broadcast shocked the world when released. I don't think so, though.

** Well the obvious response to this is that since rationalist fiction tries to emulate reality in many ways you can expect at least the levels of horror you find in reality (which is quite a lot).\\
However since many fiction shies away from such things rational fiction may have a tendency to slightly overcompensate, though really not by much.\\
I should also point out that plenty of things in history would be considered a bit gratuitously horrific if they took place in fiction.

There's also the fact that if you are trying to get people to truly fathom what's at stake you may need to actually delve into things in depth. People aren't going to be nearly as affected by horrors that they are merely told about but don't see described.

Lastly it bears mention that it seems as though there's a tendency to be more gratuitous in literature than film because people's imaginations may not be quite as good as actually seeing it on screen. Similarly you might see less explicit horror in VR because it would require less to achieve the same result because you don't feel as removed from it.

Some people read slowly and take time to mull every word over and visualize. Some people read quickly enough, and are desensitized enough that things like Worm barely bother them.

** There's value in making a strategic decision to avoid dark themes in a work. I don't think there's value in making that decision if it runs counter to a work's integrity. Likewise if the author decides to use dark themes as meaningless superstimuli that don't inspire reader reflection.

I'm waiting for Unsong to finish before I read it, so I'll comment abstractly on the use of torture as a device in rational fiction.

Torture doesn't strike me as a rational choice. It doesn't work. Artful cajoling and psychological manipulation does. A rational work, with rational characters, would employ the latter device. A rational work with irrational characters might employ the former. I'd have no problem with that, with the major caveat that it's shown to not work - in other words, that it's treated realistically.

I'd be happy if rational fiction avoided fetishization. No fetishizing techniques that don't work by e.g. having a character learn the world's secrets by torturing everyone, or by being really nice (might work to a degree, but not on a global scale). If something works, like manipulation, then I'd like to see it handled intelligently, describing the emotional toll on the manipulator if mentally healthy, or showing how to manipulate in a mutually beneficial fashion /a la/ HPMoR and /Lighting Up the Dark/.

In summary, I agree with you in that it's something to which we as consumers and creators should pay attention, but disagree that we should proscribe it entirely. When handled with thought and grace what you describe may serve as a powerful teaching tool.

I do worry though for the desensitized. Does that make them more likely to consider violence justifiable, more likely to credit rationalizations of why real-life violence was necessary?

He said the best way to extract information is to be reasonable, point out the options available to the prisoner, and sympathetically and approachably cajole them into realizing that divulging information is what they want to do.

I'm really curious how he'd do so if what the person wants most is to not tell their captor anything, and has no other desires. Although I also haven't done much of a research spree and thus rate the evidence as weak, I still think testimony based on a career investigator's expertise stronger than the evidence for torture's effectiveness.

The prisoner is obviously going to say what the interrogator wants to hear, which means you'd need to be quite clever to torture a prisoner while still having their resulting utterances be informative evidence rather than plausible untruths you wanted to hear.

There are much more /effective/ interrogation techniques that rely on firm psychological grounding. Real intelligence agencies don't use those because they're being nice, they use them because getting /true/ information out of a prisoner requires keeping their sanity and emotional balance intact /enough/ to avoid its interfering with their testimony when they finally spill.

That's why I said confirm things.

Prisoners can't make up names or locations or things like that very consistently. If you have two people being tortured in separate rooms and you ask them to spill the secrets then whatever they say that is consistent is what is the truth. If they make up stuff you want to hear they won't do it consistently.

Yeah, torture is basically the crowning example of dark stuff that /shouldn't/ show up in rational fiction because the characters ought to be smart enough not to use it. If you want to inflict raw pain, torture works; if you want information, get trained by the FBI in psychological interrogation.

Worse, when other factions find out your faction tortured, they tend to bring you up on war-crimes charges unless you are just that imperially powerful.

I think you can see from this that there's quite a diversity of views from rape survivors.

I think this says that if you do want to use rape, it should be done tastefully. The negative consequences should be depicted carefully, it shouldn't be overly exaggerated as the worst thing ever or ruining people, it should be a substantive act, not just laser guided rape to show how evil a character is.

I'd agree with the rape survivor's views on rape in tv- that sometimes you want to be triggered, and that it's a lot more palatable if done tastefully.

I'm reminded of a comment by a friend on why she likes The Walking Dead. It's a world where you can't trust anyone, where you're constantly running. Since that was much of her childhood she appreciates watching a show that closer approximates the emotional reality of her childhood.

With these various traumatic experiences it's fairly common to bury a lot of it, to rationalize it away. It's much easier to get a greater emotional range when you can feel those emotions you locked away again and I for one definitely appreciate the chance to see it when done tastefully.

[[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6780587/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/troops-stationed-iraq-turn-gaming/]]

Soldiers who directly experience war make extensive use of violent video games, especially games like Halo, call of duty.

[[http://kotaku.com/how-video-games-are-helping-soldiers-deal-with-the-horr-1411559341]]

And many report how without such video games they'd have a lot more ptsd and trauma.

I've not seen any torture porn that really got close to the graphicness of actual war stories I've seen. They have a long way to go before TV things catch up with reality.

Although of course, I'm happy to see more cheerful rational stories as well.

After all, violence is a universal resource and pretty easy to apply. Unless your characters have some plausible reason to not be violent, it would be unrealistic if they didn't consider it all, especially considering how common its use is in the real world.

Which isn't at all apparent. This could easily be construed three different ways

Chapter 12:

  That worked for about five years. Then there had been another sudden drop in the efficiency of technology, and parts of the route needed costly refitting to use the Motive Name. Then the Comet King had died and the security situation went to hell, in some cases literally. The smoking ruins of the Midwest had been taken over by warlords and barbarian chiefdoms -- Paulus the Lawless, the Witch-King of Wichita, the Oklahoma Ochlocracy -- who wanted tolls to pass their territory. The Other King seized Nevada and demanded another toll plus the promise that the train wouldn't be used to lift the siege of the West children in Colorado. The smouldering conflict that had troubled the East Coast after the election of 2000 had devolved into guerilla warfare that made the whole Appalachian area dangerous.

More generally, I have trouble with this sort of response to criticism.

I have the same response, generally. Here, it's different. No one is claiming that the writing was bad (as in, poorly written). People are claiming that it was too violent. /It was meant to be violent./ It was meant to show the horrors of hell, and what the characters are up against.

I can't speak for [[/u/electrace]], but this is pretty much exactly how I feel. The author isn't blameless, of course, but the evidence has been pretty clear from the start. This is a story where the US has collapsed and the Midwest is ruled by warlords; The universe we understand is slowly and irreversibly falling apart; People are employed at minimum wage to recite potential names of /God Himself/ so they can be copyrighted and sold for profit; Most humans who've ever lived are currently or will soon be suffering in literal hell, and the world's best hope of saving them learned something so terrible that he lost heart and was killed.

I suppose I've some sympathy for those who discovered it through the "stories without major sadness or darkness," but this hasn't been a light story for a long time. The Broadcast didn't change that--it just briefly shined a spotlight into the darkness.

My view is colored by having people beta-read things that I've written. When someone says, "I didn't find that character sympathetic", responding with "no, you're wrong, they were actually sympathetic, here's why" is /a terrible response/ that will never help you improve as a writer. Similarly, if someone says that something was confusing, or dissonant, or boring ... you have to have a lot of hubris to say "the fault lies with you as the reader, not me as an author".

****** Frankly, it doesn't make sense for the bulk of the responsibility to fall on the author, either, because there's only one author, and many readers. Making a story worse to please one reader will decrease the value of the story for other readers. If we assume the author's job is to maximize overall utility, it would be silly to expect that utility for every reader is maximized, because people have such different desires and expectations. But that's an oversimplification, because good authors don't try to maximize overall utility, they try to maximize their own utility. In practice, this is much more effective, because people are much better at maximizing their own utility than they are at maximizing the utility of an abstract average other - trying to do so tends to minimize novelty, which is actually very valuable in art, as well as sincerity.

So, as readers, what can we do? Well, I won't tell you not to engage in criticism, because I find that engaging in criticism often increases my utility. But I will tell you to *try to enjoy things*, for what I think are fairly obvious reasons.

** Dude, just chill out. Most of us are capable of relaxing and enjoying this stuff, and I'm pretty sure we're not all irredeemable monsters. Violence may just not be your thing, and that's cool, but what plot device would replace it? There are very few plot devices as versatile and moving as physical violence.

It's important to understand very intrinsically that there is a /difference/ between fictional violence and real violence, just like there's a difference between fictional sex and real sex, and a difference between driving a car and reading a description of a person driving a car. To play on your anxiety for a second: however bad the stuff in stories is, in real life it's a million times worse. Not only that, but the stuff in stories is far removed in terms of accuracy too - fictional characters tend to have a ridiculously high pain threshold. These differences make it entertaining to read violence - it would be a really shitty story if people died from one bullet, like they do in real life, or gave up the location of the rebel base after being tortured. Wildbow's works are less graphically violent and more emotionally subdued. He uses this to move the plot forward, because the characters are constantly seeking higher ground.

I think your speculation about it being a privilege to enjoy torture is wrong. You point out Golden Age comic books, but who's reading those comics? The hardened war vet, or the kid who bought it for ten cents because it was cool? And there are plenty of instances where people traumatized by war enjoyed dark fiction for the accuracy and lessons it conveyed. Saving Private Ryan triggered quite a bit of actual PTSD, but plenty of people praised it for its realistic depictions of war. The same goes for all of the good novels from the lost generation - All Quiet on the Western Front, A Farewell to Arms.

** <nods...> There are going to be things that some people find emotionally satisfying and others find emotionally unsatisfying, for reasons of personal background as well as personality. All are free to stick to what they prefer, and try to encourage more of its type; when something is popular enough, avoiding it may be difficult. Responses to points five and one below:

Point five: '"There are no atheists in foxholes" is not an argument against atheism, but against foxholes.' If life is peaceful enough that people turn to less peaceful forms of entertainment for contrast, this is a good sign. That is to say--it shouldn't be a bad thing that it's a sign of privilege, because privilege is a good thing. We want each generation to be more privileged than the last, privileged to live in a better world/universe than their ancestors had to. Our ideal future descendents are going to be much more 'soft' in that they don't have to deal with the young-person mortality rates that our generation does, and that's a good thing. If they're not privileged, if we keep the same amount of suffering and death to keep the future as underprivileged as the past, that's a tragedy.

Point one: This can be extended to all negative things. Namely, death (where the victim is someone close to someone who has died) or any sort of crime or tragedy. To echo another comment, if you strip out all the truly meaningfully bad things that can happen, you strip out the meaningfulness of people trying to protect something or prevent something. A detective cannot solve a murder (and a reader cannot try to deduce it before the declaration), because of how people close to murder victims might feel. A poor person cannot strive to improve their situation, because of how those who have been poor might feel. A quick thinking person cannot act to save their country from the predations of an aggressive neighbour, because of how people who have suffered in a war might feel. Take away negative aspects and you take away struggle. Take away struggle and you take away the heart of many forms of escapist fiction.

To combine those two, a little: I'd prefer to be in a world where people think about ugly things and have clear impressions of them rather than one where people have averted their eyes from ugly things and are unprepared when they encounter them. To put it another way (and end this post by invoking Godwin's law): even if there are Holocaust survivors who find books which talk about the Holocaust to be disrespectful, there is merit in those books existing so that people who had not encountered it first-hand can know about it and think about it, rather than let it be hidden in darkness.

Exactly! Rational fiction often aims to model what would happen if X, where X is some premise (people get superpowers, a kid gets sucked into a fantasy world, the universe starts running on kabbalah). If conflict, suffering and death happen to real people, they would probably also happen to fake people. In fact, you'd expect it to happen more, since most of the time X increases the capabilities of individuals to effect change, unethical people included.

** I want to add another major reason not to use torture in stories:

- It does not work in real life. Most real-life intelligence agencies use psychologically-based interrogation techniques rather than torture because they need information that will turn out true when they check it empirically. Sometimes, they also need the evidence they've obtained via interrogation to hold up in a court of law, as when compelling a mobster or a drug-runner to testify by applying incentives regarding their family, for instance.

I actually also agree regarding the common use of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier?from=Main.GrimDark][Darker and Edgier]] flavoring in fiction, period. There's a very real and palpable difference between /fiction that is trying to be dark/ and the actual darkness of real life.

In real life, your adviser can get gout and your stepfather lymphoma while your wife is ground down into an anxious, depressed, tired, increasingly soulless wreck by her awful job -- in a single year. Yes, that's /my/ year I'm talking about. Meanwhile, in the broader world, the environment is severely damaged, social inequality is off the charts, wars in that one damned region have gotten quite bad, and fascism is creeping up on supposedly developed societies. /Entropy is running/, and right now it's running quickly.

But that's not very suitable for fiction, is it? From a fiction-writer's point of view, all those awful things are just /background details/, and we even sort of expect that no one real person /statistically ought/ to be hit with any great number of personal tragedies all at once. Instead of just being constantly bruised and having bones broken until nothing heals right or completely anymore and pain becomes a constant background fact of life, we expect fictional characters to be healthy and strong right until they are /fucking nuked from orbit/.

Maybe it's good writing for ordinary fiction to have the characters be, effectively, strong and strapping young space marines who suddenly get nuked from orbit and have to fight Lex Luthor's army of undead mutants from Mars to save the world from the Weyland-Yutani company's evil manipulations, but I do think it's bad writing for /rational/ fiction.

Rational fiction ought to inflict its dose of pain, on the characters and on the reader, in the same way real life does. Otherwise, people will keep going through their daily lives thinking that evil comes with a goatee and laughs maniacally about taking over the world, while considering drugs or war or cancer as facts of life to be accepted.

** Most fiction is based on superstimuli of various kinds, from robots punching dinosaurs, to super-smart Harry outsmarting his opponents by being smart. So that's not a strong objection to me.

Also most fiction can be accused of insensitivity to real suffering, just because it's fiction. In a world where children starve, etc, etc. So that's not a strong objection either.

That leaves artistic criteria, which depend on what the artist is trying to achieve. Clearly, LOTR works better without torture and GOT works better with torture. Most artistic works fall somewhere in between.

That said, I'm also disappointed by Unsong's use of torture. It doesn't fit with the rest of the work and it feels made up. As a doctor, Scott has tons of experience with actual suffering, and his SSC posts prove that he can describe it vividly and truthfully. So why talk about cartoon stuff like forks in eyeballs?
