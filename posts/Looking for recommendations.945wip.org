Read HPMOR, Shadows of the Limelight, Ra, and The Arithmancer. Also everything by Wildbow who doesn't brag about rational writing but apparently is still associated with it? Well the first two seemed infested with a protagonist who was smug, self-serving, and secretive of their goals. Even though she kept most of the knowledge to herself, Arithmancer/Archimedes at least was refreshing for the fact that she involved others in her planning, taught others, and raised other characters up for their own benefit rather than hers.

Does anyone have recommendations where protagonists are less smug, are part of a team of rationalists, or make more collaborative plans?

Thanks


** As another poster mentioned, you might want to scan through some of the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation][monthly recommendation threads]]. Posters usually post a brief (or sometimes not so brief) description of what they liked or didn't like and why.

Rational/ist/ fiction is far less common than /rational/ or rational-adjacent fiction that often gets posted here. Besides Pokemon: The Origin of Species, I can't think of too many rationalist fics with teams of rationalists. There are plenty of rational or adjacent fictions with teams that work together or collaborate, though. Hero's War, Practical Guide to Evil, Worth the Candle, and to a lesser extent The Gods are Bastards (they have teams, but aren't always rational) and Mother of Learning (protagonist is rational, but usually solitary or working primarily with one other character).

** Are you following Pokemon: The Origin of Species? Updates first of each month. Red, Blue, and +Green+ Leaf are definitely team players.

I also consider TOoS to be rationalist, not just rational. Lots of emphasis on how to think and plan better, including things you /can/ try at home.

**** He might have meant TOotS/TOoS, The Order of the Stick? Not sure that really qualifies though.

EDIT: Duh, no he's referring to The Origin of Species.

** There's /Animorphs: the reckoning/ which features a team of kids trying to be rational. Seems to fit what you're looking for. (Although, it hasn't updated in a while, not sure what's going on with it)

** I really liked Archimedes for that reason too, that and the relentless work ethic (of which I'm rather envious).

I have a question about Origin of Species: I have no familiarity at all with Pokemon, and not a lot of interest in the concept (which seems to be a few degrees of separation from dog fighting). However people have said it's quite educational, and I'm wondering if it's worth reading because of that?

*** I just binged through the series and think a lot of my enjoyment came from reliving my childhood imagination. Don't get me wrong - it's still a highly entertaining story and great concept, but the premise of the story is "how do we make the pokemon game world more feasible to exist"? If the pokemon world of fantastic creatures with powers doesn't interest you, it may be a bit of a drag for you. In my opinion it's still worth reading because the characters are likeable and the story is fun and educational.

** The Waves Arisen is pretty team-oriented. Ever seen Naruto and Sasuke use marriage counseling techniques to work through their personality clashes? Lots of laughs.

** I recommend searching for the monthyl recommendation threads and working through them. Now that I think about it a bit that indexes each story and stores the number of mentions could be useful.
