Hello amazing talented people. As most of you know, I'm sure, I am a professional narrator recording and releasing the Mother of Learning web serial as a free podcast. The podcast is also being released on YouTube and I thought it would be great to create a simple kind of animation to go with it.

Adobe After Effects allows you to create keyframes from audio thereby animating objects based on audio. I used this effect to create this video:

[[https://youtu.be/QKhkU4c5gdk]]

I thought it would be great to have images for each of the characters that can be animated with a basic animation whenever the speak. I was inspired by the triforce podcast videos who use the audio keyframe technique to animate their videos:

Example: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qe-0V-mPrA]]

How they do it: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtdkxw9ZU0]]

I am a voice actor with a small amount of experience with after effects so can do the animation part. What I suck at is actually creating the images to use.

SO, here is my request, are there any talented artists out there who would like to help out the podcast and create images for each character in Mother of Learning that can be animated to look like they are talking or something else basic that could be linked to audio key frames.

I don't currently have the funds to pay for this work(editing is still costing me a reasonable amount each month *cough [[https://www.patreon.com/jackvoraces][Patreon]] *cough) but it is a free audiobook for the community.

Anyway let me know and I hope you are enjoying the audiobook.


** I dont own Adobe after effects, but what characters would you want to see designed?

*** You don't need after effects just software to make the artwork. As many as possible/all of them.

** I sadly don't have the strongest talent in this area (or the time to do it), but I will definitely be watching for the episodes to start coming out. I have several friends who listen instead or read almost exclusively and I'd love to get them onto MoL
