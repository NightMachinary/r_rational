Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Saw [[https://www.facebook.com/quartznews/videos/1493070964059934/][this]] interesting video recently. They had a male and female actor play the part of Hillary and Trump respectively, mimicking their mannerisms and wording from a presidential debate. The (largely liberal) audience had the reaction that female!Trump was much more trustworthy than male!Hillary.

I'm still not sure what conclusion to draw from it.

*** That Hillary might be a good politician, but she's certainly not charismatic? Especially when parodied.

Or, if you wanna stress the gender angle, - which I'm far from confident is relevant -, that male mannerisms in a woman make her look confident, whereas female mannerisms in a man make him look weak.

*** From my comment about it on Facebook:

So I find this fascinating, not just on its own merits, but particularly because of something I did a couple years ago: I took clips of Game of Thrones out of context and showed them to a few friends who never read the books or watched the show. Without access to the bigger narrative, I wanted to see if I could make characters come off differently than the way they were experienced by viewers of the whole story. Obviously it made a difference, but it seemed like a fun exercise in exploring characters and narrative, and some of the reactions were still surprising.

Which is why watching these clips of the gender-swapped politicians who came off very differently than my memory of the debates made me think "Huh. How much of this effect is coming from the divorced context of the characters being played? Is it possible that changing the faces and voices of the characters is enough to disassociate the negative feelings people have of them based on their histories?"

Because as I watched this, I had to constantly remind myself that the female speaker's talking points were factually inaccurate, because yes, charisma matters... but also because I felt like I was watching something disassociated from reality. The debates weren't that long ago, but they were still immersed in the context of their time, where Trump was, from liberal perspectives, blatantly lying day after day, week after week, not to mention all the other... character flaws, let's say, that he exhibited.

So overall, I love that this was done, but I want it taken further. I want to see this reproduced as a full film that mirrors the election. Not just the debates, but rallies, speeches, press releases. Let us get used to these two characters, Jonathan Gordon and Brenda King. Let us really feel what we felt about them again, from the left and the right, but gender flipped, THEN see how we judge them.

Because I think the context is important to just about everything in life, including our reactions of King's attitude and Gordon's affect, as seen in these debate videos. Just like context was important in judging whether Cersei was a benevolent and wise queen or Arya was a bloodthirsty psychopath in my own "experiment."

** How much do you guys think it's 1. useful and 2. fun to know about economics?

Mostly asking because while the topic generally interests me, and is likely important in an abstract way (this is a thing that needs to be understood if we ever are to get a working government, but we're so far away from that it's probably not the bottleneck right now, and also nothing I can ever do will make a difference here), but I'm finding it really hard to interpret what I'm reading.

Main problem being with how politicized this area seems to be, there's a lot of people seeming very confident, and of course they don't agree with each other on almost anything. Below, I rant a bit about [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215151/][Inequality for All]], which I've watched recently, but rather than focus on particular factual assertions, I'm more interested in the meta topic: how do you ingest information about economics, find trusted sources, and most of all evaluate claims? I've read some of [[http://www.themoneyillusion.com/][themoneyillusion]] (though most of his posts assume a thought framework that I don't have, and it's hard to extract value); and some of [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]'s rants. They both seem very confident (EY especially, but then EY seems confident in very many things :P) in a non-mainstream model (granted, it's been becoming more mainstream, so that's something). And while their arguments generally make sense to me, so do the opposing sides', and so it's hard to share that confidence.

Getting back to the example of Inequality for All, the author seems confident that he's making a case for a particular policy, and I just can't follow his argument from the factual assertions he's making, to why his suggested policy helps with those problems.

For example one claim from the movie that I can remember, is this rich trader guy saying he has gained <some large amount of money> from his investment into <hedge funds etc>. And then he says something like "I believe no social good was produced from these investments", which the movie just takes as a fact and doesn't elaborate on. That quote perplexes me - someone gave this man money, and presumably they gave him the money for some perceived benefit. Perhaps the social good was very small, like just providing some extra liquidity to a market so that someone else that's not speculating can buy at a lower price / sell at higher price; but it's really hard to imagine financial investment to have negative externalities on its own.

The movie extends that argument by noticing that rich people don't spend their money; they save/invest it. As opposed to the middle class, which is consumption-oriented. Which consumption, in turn, is what the movie presents as the real driving force behind the economy in what it calls a [[http://inequalityforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PAGE_25.jpg][Virtuous Cycle]] - whereupon as wages increase, workers spend more, driving more demand, which leads to more production, and higher wages. To me, that just looks like a bubble?

*** My main criticism/rant against Capitalism, and all the satellite plolitics, is that afterall it is a paperclip maximizer.

After all things in capitalism get produced with the sole scope of making a (ingent) profit.

Furthermore corporations are more or less china-room AGIs, not able bootstrap themselves to godhood ,yet, but smarter than any individual.

It is also my opinion that they are being also used from the profiteers to distance themselves from where the profit is coming from, to shield their personal morality and empathy from their-not-anymore-theirs actions.

I would unironically suggest to read Capital by Karl Marx, he isn't perfect but he tries to describe economic phenomena in the most scientific way he can, basing himself on historical evidence; which we know isn't perfect but we cannot exactly simulate universes in which to try different economic models.\\
Afterall, it became political later on, while it was being written it was a critique and an offer for an alternative.

****** Every system implementing a government policy is going to have significantly above-human resource applied to maximising output of some quantity only tangentially related to welfare.

So I guess the only interesting question is whether a particular policy has above-human level optimising power (I'd like to taboo 'intelligence' here). And perhaps really ineffective policy does not count - but then you could just call it a really weak paperclip maximiser. For me the core requirement of PM isn't really its optimising power, but just a value system sufficiently different from human. In fact, I think Bostrom's original paper considered paperclip optimisers of different power - from human-level, which would collect and buy paperclips, to god-AGIs that would optimise all atoms to be part of paperclips.

Anyway, I don't think ineffectual policy is worth considering anyway; it just devolves to laissez-faire capitalism.

Then I think it loses its importance. A dumb paperclip optimizer is just a paperclip machine.

Capitalism matters (in context of this analogy) because, like a /dangerous/ paperclip maximizer, it's a runaway process that's self-enforcing, self-preserving and self-strengthening.

**** Yes. I generally agree with this argument, or at least with how I understand the argument (summarized below). My problem is that I also find convincing arguments from the opposing side. Thus rather than a constructive 'this is the right thing to do because of this chain of logic' argument, what I feel I need is a deconstructive analysis of the competing, internally-consistent arguments, with the assumptions behind the arguments made explicit and analysed for conflict.

The way I understand the precommitment/print-more-money argument for inflation targetting is mostly by seeing inflation targetting as a coordination problem. Everyone prefers moderately low, stable inflation [citation needed; bitcoin guys really like deflation, I guess]. But the individual incentives do not support stable inflation; without organised control small chaotic movements can blow into inflationary or deflationary reinforcing cycles. However, the cycle only works when individual actors expect all other actors to follow their individual incentives; i.e. the self-reinforcement in part relies on the expectation of a self-reinforcing cycle. Adding a powerful agent that does not act in its self interest but instead precommits to keeping inflation stable defeats most of the self-reinforcing process, because if individual agents expect this coordinator to intervene if things were getting out of control, they are not incentivised to take advantage of things getting out of control.

I'm not equipped to evaluate whether the assumptions behind inflation/deflation cycles, and the market response to trustworthy commitment to inflation targetting, are reliable. It /seems/ correct, but I would not be very surprised if an economist with an opposing view came in and pointed out complexities or externalities that are ignored by the argument.

I guess what I'm looking for is dialogue, where I don't have to evaluate the factual accuracy of assertions made by either side (which I can't evaluate), and can just look at the logical coherence of arguments made because factual inaccuracies are caught by the opposing debater.

***** It sounds like you're taking an inflation-centric view. I'd suggest taking a trade-and-production-centric view: the question is how much stuff and service is produced; and to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff. Notions like 'inflation' and 'deflation' only matter to us except insofar as they affect how much stuff gets produced, or to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff. The point of NGDPLT is not to stabilize inflation or whatever, it's to produce as much stuff as the economy can produce, with a minimum of distortion on who gets the stuff. It does happen that unstable inflation or deflation or hyperinflation reflect circumstances leading to less stuff being produced, which is the only reason we care.

I don't see how the Fed is acting not in its self-interest under NGDPLT or how other actors would take advantage of that.

Well, the argument beings with "Q. Help! I keep undershooting my 2% inflation target!". I do agree that NGDP targeting probably makes more sense (I especially liked the [[http://www.basilhalperin.com/blog/2016/12/monetary-misperceptions-food-banks-and-ngdp-targeting/][argument by food bank analogy]]), but I view it as an improvement on the idea that you should be targeting /something/, and that you need to be credible when you do it, and I was mostly addressing the first part of the linked post rather than the second, where NGDP is suggested.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Hm, what I meant by that is that the Fed is not an agent that is trying to maximise its return on investment. So perhaps I should have phrased it as a different goal function than everyone else, rather than 'not acting in its self-interest'.

#+begin_quote
  or how other actors would take advantage of that.
#+end_quote

I think you misread that; the actors take advantage of deteriorating situation when the Fed /isn't/ involved, as you describe in the original post:

#+begin_quote
  In fact, there are positive feedback cycles which means that targeting a base money level can produce wild instability. When money is becoming more valuable, people try to hold onto it more, which slows down velocity, which decreases the effective amount of money available per transaction, which decreases prices even more, which makes money even more valuable.
#+end_quote

It's a tragedy of the commons thing, right? Everyone would rather deflation not spiral out of control and the economy not stop into a depression, but your immediate incentive is to hold back more cash if you expect cash to become more valuable. Having an agent out there who is /not/ going to hold cash when cash is expected to be more valuable, in fact they'll do the opposite, means that this incentive to hold is reduced, and everyone is better off.

I.e. the actors are /benefiting/ from there being a Fed, not /exploiting it/. When I said

#+begin_quote
  individual agents expect this coordinator to intervene if things were getting out of control, they are not incentivised to take advantage of things getting out of control.
#+end_quote

The 'taking advantage of things getting out of control' would be holding more cash when monetary policy seems too tight, which causes the policy to be even tighter, which causes more agents to be incentivised to hold cash, etc.

Anyway, as I said earlier I generally agree with the claims you propose both here and in the linked post. While I welcome further elaboration if you think I'm still misunderstanding you (or you just feel like it), but my original problem is that I just don't feel I can be very confident in that belief. I don't think discussing NGDPLT directly can help with that - I couldn't present an argument against NGDPLT even if it was wrong. Sources that either show that is actually a commonly shared approach to monetary policy (i.e. my belief that there's any controversy is soundly disproved), or have economists directly arguing for and against NGDPLT (so that I could compare the quality of arguments made, rather than accuracy of any factual statements) would be much more useful here.

Perhaps I anchored too much on the example. But it still feels to me that the goal of an economy should be to keep the infrastructure running, so that people can /do/ things they want to do, rather than produce transient, consumable things.

What you are thinking about is conspicuous consumption, and it isn't necessary for economy to grow. If people change their spending habits, economy would adapt.

****** Yeah, I do know that; but perhaps I haven't processed it full. I can definitely see how an increase in demand for services drives more jobs, and leads to more people focusing on things they are good at, rather than doing a bit of everything to avoid paying someone. So in a way I can see how the larger pay -> more consumption -> somewhat more specialization -> somewhat higher productivity thing could work.

It does not appear like a thing that could go on forever though, or even very far; you hit the limit of how much can be gained purely by focusing on competitive advantage.

It seems weird to me to focus on that as the main driver behind an improving economy, rather than things that, to me, seem more impactful on the productivity of persons: education (to change the degree of competitive advantage between people), technology, etc.

I guess I'm still confused, but your hint to focus more on services than goods definitely helps me understand what the movie meant in this part. Thanks!
