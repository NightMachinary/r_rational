After binging the story I'm left wondering how it's all going to end. Do you really believe Joon is going to end up a benevolent capital-G God after everything?

Seems a bit cheap or easy to me, just from the number of surprises this story has given us so far.

What are your thoughts?


** Aerb is an /incredible/ shithole as far as worlds go. Tons of hells and so many existential risks that plastic mages - an X-risk in and of itself - still get used after a couple close calls in that one Library glimpse because the X-risk doesn't even register as worth avoiding. -_-

The Aerbian hells alone make Aerb as-is such an incredibly bad place that removal of those is the basic rat!story necessity. Normally that'd require godhood but we have Library glimpes of depopulated hells, probably via Valencia. That leaves us with ALL THE OTHER SHIT that is going down on Aerb.

Basically to satisfy rat!story requirements and Mary+that other guys stated ethical intentions, its either soft godhood like Uther had for thousands of years to even have a chance at the long future, or hard godhood.

Hard godhood is kinda boring, so I'll go with lots of exclusions and soft godhood for a long time.

I disagree, Aerb has infinite opportunities, basically every problem is solvable, given enough time/work invested. On Earth, In comparison, many unfortunate circumstances are hopeless. As someone who's currently stuck in such a situation (severe health problems), I would transfer to Aerb without a second thought given a choice.

**** Not to marginalise your issues, but most sentient life on Aerb, if I understand the ratios right, is under constant torture by unnaturally competent beings. The most likely outcome for their world is that all life other than the tortured souls and those doing the torturing are wiped out. Our planet is in a precarious spot, but we're technologically primitive and have a large opportunity for solving these issues for future lives.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program]] has a final figure of $25 billion. So the variance in the estimates is only a factor of x2-x3 and yet the worst estimate was overshot by 25%.

The Olkiluoto nuclear reactor, first of its new kind of nuclear reactors, was sold at turnkey price of €3 billion, ended up going to €8.7 billion, planned building time: 4 years. Real build time: we don't know, it was supposed to be finished 2009 but is still currently sheduled for 2020.

If your estimates go over a range of 100x, you are pulling numbers out of ass, the variance gets higher and the worst case scenario is that much worse.

I shit you not, second paragraph he likens spending money combatting climate change is the same as spending money on tracking asteroids that could hit earth as equally dangerous and equally dismissed. He then said that if you're concerned about climate change, then you should be concerned about terrorism, because carbon emissions reductions would reduce our ability to fight terrorism. This podcast is garbage. For being on a sub that preports to be about rationality, you don't seem to have much.

    Estimates show that the total cost of avoiding all global warming for the 21st century would be on the order of $10 billion dollars. So, remember: this is probably between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude cheaper. So, typically we talk about $10-$100 trillion dollars of trying to fix global warming. This could fix it for one thousandth or one ten-thousandth of that cost. So, surely we should be looking into it, if for no other reason than because a billionaire at some point in the next couple of decades could just say, 'Hey, I'm just going to do this for the world.' And conceivably actually do it. And then of course we'd like to know if there's a really bad thing that would happen through doing that. But this is what could avoid actually any catastrophic outcomes, not just cutting carbon emissions through more solar panels--which will, in any reasonable estimate have a negligible effect over the next half century.

Accordin to a friend who lives in the artic, his points about polar bears are poor as hunting them are in fact already banned most places. It's allowed on greenland since they need it for food and it's allowed in self defence (you really need to be able to shoot an angry bear running towards you). The change of ice means that they have to go longer for seals and so the diminishing population is in fact due to climate change.

**** In Aerb, every "exploit" they find gets nerfed by the gods.

In our world, the exploits are small and weak. Electricity and magnetism barely do anything without centuries of infrastructure and many people's lifetimes making slight improvements to it. Computing has taken close to 200 years - and many generations of dead scientists - to finally begin to yield the *big* gains from it.

​

But no one, so far, has come along and decided to just take away something. The internet hasn't quit suddenly because an asshole god decided to exclude it to a single city. While we talk about doom and gloom scenarios following a nuclear war, the knowledge that let our civilization reach this point has been copied millions of times, between books and records in compact portable devices. Unlike what the Romans had (some parlor tricks and a few useful ideas that were lost), our advancements are here to stay.

​

And we're /this/ close to unlocking a means to ending all of our problems, one way or another. (yes, super-intelligent AI is an existential risk but it also offers a possible route to banning human death and illness and unfairness)

Did you know that the neural network algorithm Google calls "AutoML" is a neural network that can find superior neural network architectures, and it is itself subject to the same improvements...?

** I feel like the ending has been heavily foreshadowed. The DM revealed to us that Joon agreed to 'enter' Aerb and would be satisfied with the ending. The title of the story is Worth the Candle, which is a reference to an in-story book about the supply chain and production of an actual candle (pig slaughter, not beeswax).

So we, as readers, are being taken through a metaphorical pig's life, slaughter, and greater purpose. The pig is Aerb et al. and the greater purpose is Joon. AKA there's a lot of suffering in Aerb and we as readers are supposed to question whether Joon's closure / character development is worth that moral and/or ethical cost.

Whether Aerb is a simulation or not is unimportant, as Aerb has been demonstrated to be too real to dismiss as "Oh, it was all fake? I guess Fenn and Mary don't matter since they were just fake and can stop existing now."

Joon as a capital G-God may or may not happen, but if it does then I do not believe that would be the end or purposeful to Joon or us as readers beyond wrapping up loose plot lines in Aerb.

The story's about the candle, not the pig. Joon, not Aerb.

That said, I don't expect Joon to remain in Aerb when the story ends, whether he dies or returns to Bumblefuck, Kansas I won't speculate on. So the G-God question becomes a bit irrelevant.

Huh? The DM summoned a book with that title last interaction, but did not share it with Joon. And it was not about literal candle manufacture. Or is it your prediction that this is /going/ to be the case?

  Fallatehr tapped his finger to his lips. “There is a book about a candle, written in 97 FE, which describes it in exacting detail. Each imperfection of the candle is noted, every possible measurement of it is taken, and the composition of the candle is detailed down to the diet of the hog whose fat was rendered to make it. It runs for four hundred pages.”

  “Okay,” I said slowly. “So the soul is like ... a list of things about a person?”

  “Some of the information listed about the candle was procedural,” said Fallatehr. “There are details of how it was created, what processes were used to render the fat, information on the construction of the molds, and all that sort of thing. The soul has nothing like it. There is nothing written upon the soul that will tell you how a person came to be as they are, no history, only marks that you might use to work backwards and infer.”

From chapter 63, titled The Chemical History of a Candle.

I'd speculate that the DM summoned book 'Worth the Candle' is what we're currently reading, written by Joon, titled with a reference to the unnamed candle book written in 97 FE.

***** Wow alright, so the 97 FE book is paralleled by the DM's book. Nice catch.

*** Umm, maybe I'm missing something, but "worth the candle" is a saying that means something is worth the cost of doing it. It originated from needing to use up a relatively expensive candle to have the light to do things in the dark. The book Falatehr is talking about, which I think is based off an IRL book, definitely has some interesting parallels in regards to the story, but it isn't where the title of the story came from. Joon used the phrase "worth the candle" in his prayer to the DM when they were in Weik Handum or however it's spelled, and mentioned this when everyone was discussing the DM's second appearance.

**** I did not know that. Good point.

I'd still argue that these new-to-me facts still fit with the 'Aerb to redeem Joon's soul' theory I'm pushing.

** Personally, I'm still leaning towards the idea of him being dead. Assuming that Uther is actually Arthur in the same way that Joon is actually Joon, I'll bet that he got a similar deal. DM talked to him, he made a choice to go to Aerb but the details are kept from him. Then he gets hit by a car on Earth to explain his absence. This would also work with the simulation idea.

** Joon screws something up so that the status quo is going to be much worse than people being tortured in the hells forever, with no hope of recovery. Through a desperate gambit, someone then successfully ends the universe, which is a good thing in comparison to the alternative. Some tiny piece of Joon's legacy makes its way back to Earth.

A better ending than godhood, at least.
