** It's hard too imagine two characters as different as JoJo and Lulu, though judging from the introduction of Stand it seems like this is Stardust Crusaders Jojo-- I've only watched Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, after I've finished JJBA:SC.

Rational JoJo would be interesting to see. I can't possibly imagine how it would be done, given that JoJo lives in an irrational (or at least, bizarre) universe, but it could be fun.

Somehow, though, I think you'll never be able to beat the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BgqFYrD8UM][canon fights]] no matter what you do. You'll lose the magic of JJBA if you ever try to change it to be reasonable.

**** Somewhat. Joseph's grenade trick is probably one of my favorite moments in JJBA besides the third return of the robo-Nazi. The entire show is about being surprisingly over-the-top in terms of action. It remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it's over the top. It remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it remains surprisingly over the top even to people who know it's over the top. Effectively, there is no level of effort that can actually prepare you for JJBA.

That being said, I'd say it takes some time to grow on you. I have good patience so I watched the anime series, which has some pacing issues but is much more filled out. They remastered the anime into a series of 3 movies which cut out a lot of the less interesting stuff.

Anime series starts here: [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure/episode-1-dio-the-invader-652081][Crunchyroll]]

Movie series (recommended for most viewers) starts here: [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure/episode-1-part-1-phantom-blood-653409][Crunchyroll]]

There are three stories in JJBA. There's Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency, and Stardust Crusaders. The stuff I've linked covers Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, which starts in the 1880s and goes up through the 1930s and the beginnings of WWII. Stardust Crusaders is set in the 1970s and is significantly different than the previous two stories, though I haven't watched it.

In general, JJBA is old and is a trope maker for a lot of stuff in action anime/manga. The art is excellent and reminds me of an era when characters in anime are drawn as adults and not as children. In fact, almost none of the story is about children. Or people being unable to express their emotions. Or angst, except for super manly angst.

In this way, it is great. There are two categories of characters in this story: people who weigh under 200 lbs, and adult men. If you weigh under 200 lbs, and you're a character in JJBA, you don't fight (with one or two exceptions). If you show up to a fight, you will literally wet yourself in fear at the manliness of the battle. This happens.

On the other hand... don't expect a lot in the way of rational explanations for things. Every single decision made in this story was made with the goal of making things as awesome as possible. All was sacrificed on that altar, for better or for worse.

Sounds like Hofstadter's Law, but for badass seinen anime.

I just remembered I still have to watch the rest of Space Brothers.

*** It's rational, in that most of the characters take rational actions, given the 'bizarre' ruleset of their world, that advance their goals.

And for the differences between Jojo and Lulu, Lulu isn't really the Jojo of this story. He's more of a protagonist Dio, in a way. The 'Jojo' of this story is...well, let's just say I didn't see it coming.

You'll be pleased to hear that there's some deliciously over the top moments. Like I said in another comment, I feel like it really captures the feel of Jojo battles and Jojo's overall style, while being pretty original.

*** Yep! I didn't expect it, but the author puts in tons of Jojo, which changes the original Code Grass story in major ways. Also, I feel like the story really nails the feeling of Jojo fights, which is a major positive in my book.

Though you may be lost on some things, admittedly. The story assumes you know a basicaly amount of Code Geass. So maybe just watch the first few episodes of the show?

** Based solely on one chapter of this fic I've managed to read, I can't stand this crossover. Instead of enriching the setting of Code Geass, the elements of Jojo clash with it horribly. With one stroke the deliciously manipulative geas of Lelouch is replaced with boring gimped invisibility and my favourite partnership with CC is tossed right out. I simply lost interest at that point.

*** Well, at the risk of spoiling, you're wrong on both counts!

At first I was also disappointed by Lelouch's power, but the author finds an amazingly surprising amount of creative uses for it that I never would have thought of. Thus the [MK] tag. And he's just as manipulative as the original, he just has to do his manipulating the hard way now. And while CC leaves in the first chapter, she does come back.

**** Yes, I did predict that he would find creative uses for the power. Lelouch would probably find creative uses for a flying brick superpower as well, but that does not make such a power thematically appropriate for him. In my mind Lelouch and his geas go together in a unique way. Unless his stand has a major mental component that he exploits later on, it's just not the same. Fucking with people's minds is simply more interesting and more in line with his character than playing with shadows.

As for CC, I somehow doubt that she will be as interested in Lelouch as she was in canon. The geas played a major role in their relationship. Without it, canon CC would not have much interest at all. If she does in this fic, then, most likely, the author diverged enough from her character that she might as well be an OC.

For all I know, this fic is the most awesome piece of literature on earth. I just don't have any motivation to read it after the author tossed out 50% of what I like in Code Geass.

***** Look, anything I could tell you to counter your points (which are based on a lot assumptions about the story) would just be me telling you future events in the story.

I'll just say that I feel like most of your critiques are adequately answered throughout the story. You can believe me or not.
