** Great story -- a real classic of science fiction! Thanks for sharing, OP! Really makes you wonder how we'll beat that second law of thermodynamics ... But we'll have to deal with death and aging, first. And what is that but biological entropy? Immortality will be a small victory for the human race against the universe, and I hope it won't be the last.

However, I see that it is a story about the potential evolution of technology. Humanity created the Multivac, and then, Multivac improved itself while serving mankind.

It goes beyond that though. In terms of storytelling, I'm trying to remember if I've ever read a work where the entire purpose is to introduce a carefully crafted, meaningful, deus ex machina.

Did I manage to say all that without spoilering too badly?

** Isaac Asimov was /very/ fastidious about renewing the copyright on /all/ of his stories, [[http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#starters3][right up to the time he died]].

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States][According to US law]], the copyright on 'The Last Question' won't expire until 2051, 95 years after the story was first published.

There is only [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_(Asimov_short_story)][/one/ story of Asimov's which is out of copyright]], because Asimov missed renewing its copyright - and it's /not/ 'The Last Question'.

Some people have even had their religious faith shaken by it. To me, knowing Asimov's works and style... it's just another case of Asimov writing for the sake of a punchline. He did like doing that: he wrote many many short stories which are nothing more than extended jokes (have you read his Azazel stories, for instance?). To me, this is just another one of those stories. The content involves some science-fiction-y stuff, and it's not written for humour, but it's still just a punchline to me. I don't see much to discuss here. He wrote much better stories than this one.

Not if you're into rationalist fiction. They're light humour, written in the style of P.G. Wodehouse. Azazel is a small demon/alien (depending on which story you read) who grants wishes using his magical/scientific powers, but in ways that always cause disaster.

***** It's less 'not wanting to pay for copyrighted works' (I own a compilation of his short stories which has this in it) and more 'not seeing the point to a 95 year copyright term which prevents you from even so much as converting the format of a work you have purchased'.

A short term copyright which allows the creator of a work to actually benefit from it is a good idea. There is no logical reason, however, for that copyright to extend almost a century. The original idea has been twisted, mostly by those seeking profit through distribution and not even the original creators of the works.

There are still laws on the books in some areas against riding bicycles in swimming pools. That something is against a law doesn't make it immoral or even logical.

#+end_quote

This OP goes a lot further than merely "converting the format of a work you have purchased" - it's publishing the converted format for others to copy and read. Distributing the work without paying the creator (or his beneficiaries).

I have no moral qualms about copying a work you've purchased into a different format. I've got lots of MP3 files which I've ripped from CDs that I bought. And, if there was an easy way to convert a printed book into an ebook format, I'd readily convert my print books. I bought the work, paid the artist and all the people involved in its production, and I'm entitled to fair use of it. Me. Not hundreds of random people who did /not/ pay the artist in any way.

#+begin_quote
  That something is against a law doesn't make it immoral or even logical.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, just because you personally disagree with a law that doesn't make it immoral, either. Some laws actually do reflect morality. And, in this case, Isaac Asimov deliberately renewed all copyrights on his stories until the day he died, so that his family would continue to benefit from his work (he wrote this in his autobiography). He wanted to provide for his family even after his death. Therefore, to pirate his works and publish them is to go against his stated wishes - and that makes it immoral.

If an artist were to allow free copies of their work to be made, even while the copyright still existed, then it would not be immoral to make those free copies.

I'm not basing my idea of morality simply on legislation, but on the author's stated wishes, and his actions in renewing his copyrights.

******* I understand where you are coming from, but I do not entirely agree with your reasoning. That he wished his work to be profitable for a century does not by itself make it moral. I don't think you really believe this either, at least for the reason you stated.

"Because the author wanted x to happen " is pretty clearly not the real metric you are using to judge the morality of this action. This is clear when you simply think about other things the author might intend about their work. Would you agree with an author who wanted all copies of his work destroyed on his death? Would you then consider preserving a copy of that work immoral? How about if the author does not want to let you convert formats - an act you have already claimed you find no moral issue with?

That is the least egregious example, I could think of several more immoral ones, but it makes my point. You have a different reason for finding this act immoral. I therefore ask you the basic question of rationality : Why do you believe what you believe?

I suppose I'd have to. There are works which are temporary anyway, like ice sculptures or dance performances. I don't have the right to keep something which isn't mine. I would dislike it a lot, but I would have to respect the author's wishes in this.

#+begin_quote

Tough luck. The author sold their work to me. It's mine now, to do with as I please (as long as I don't give or sell it to someone else).

#+begin_quote
  Why do you believe what you believe?
#+end_quote

Because I think it is right and fair and proper that an artist should get paid for their work, just like everyone else who makes something to sell to other people. Pirating and giving away free copies of books or music or movies (or whatever) takes away that right and fair and proper payment.

Some artists happily and freely choose to forgo that entitlement. There are musicians and writers who will give away their works. And, that's their prerogative. Isaac Asimov did not. He requested and required payment for his work. And, not only did he want if for himself, he wanted to keep the payments going for his family after his death - which is his prerogative. So, as well as it being wrong to withhold the rightful payment, this is compounded in this case by going against the writer's wishes.

/EDIT: P.S. Let me turn this back on you. Why do you think it's okay to give away someone else's creative work for free, against their stated wishes? What's the rational moral argument in favour of that?/

********* See, you don't even realize that what you are saying is not internally consistent. You hold one sentence that the right of an author to have all copies of his work destroyed is absolute, and then in the next deny that right if the author has sold that work.

Why can you do whatever you want at that point apart from your oddly specific restrictions? It can't be the law alone, the law also applies other restrictions to a work which you do not mention here, such as moral rights in the case of an artist, but even those do not extend to destruction of the work.

In this case, the author has been payed for his work. I payed for my copy. If I then loan that copy to a friend, by your definition I have committed an immoral act.

In fact, under your definition of copyright, libraries are dens of depravity desperately distributing deplorable dissertations.

As to my moral code, I prefer to have an internally consistent one. That an author or inventor, what I will call a "creator" can maintain profit from his creation for a set amount of time is logical. It encourages creation. 20 year terms or similar are eminently rational.

His heirs on the other hand had no hand in that creation, they merely exist with a portion of his genes. They have no more inherent right to future profits from the work than anyone else. This doesn't change simply because someone has an opinion. They are of course entitled to whatever already existing money he has.

The existence of effectively indefinite period for copyright and trademarks is actually in most cases mitigating creation of new entertainment or inventions, especially in the software and bio science spheres. This runs counter to the whole reason for having a copyright schema in the first place.

My terminal value is not "authorial intent". Creators are to be commended, but they are not Gods. Their creations, especially after their deaths, belong to all of humanity. Another page in our long, long story.

And after they have had their reward for adding to the collective history of humanity, we will thank them, but not blindly obey all of their wishes.

I'm not going to justify all piracy. I'm not going to yell from the rafters about how all information should be free. But this is just a story. An old story, a good story, but just a story.

All we are is stories. We communicate by sharing stories. That's what humans do. We just have much better ways of doing it now, with basically no cost. Few industries have adapted to this so far. I doubt it is going to stop happening any time soon.

********** Thanks for your opinion. We have profoundly different views on this subject ("Their creations, especially after their deaths, belong to all of humanity."). There's no benefit in continuing this discussion.

Carry on.

*********** I'll again take the chance to point out that you could've saved everyone's breath by simply PMing [[/u/eaturbrainz]] with your issue. It would've kept the convo between people who matter, and he could've dealt with it by deleting the thread and PMing OP. But by posting in the comments, you sparked a debate, distracted from the flow of the subreddit, and now nobody will be happy with any result. Please don't take this personally -- just consider this as advice for future copyright campaigns.

I did use the report function to bring this post to the moderators' attention. I also posted a comment here for the OP's benefit - and for the benefit of any moderator(s) who might come to look at this reported thread. One stone, two birds.

The moderator was and is quite capable of removing any comments they feel detract from the flow of the subreddit.

************* Well, see that's the thing -- part of the subreddit flow is /letting it flow/, and deleting comments goes against that. But you obviously missed that part of How-to-Build-a-Community 101, seeing your copyright Nazism and subsequent dead sub ... so I'll cut you some slack. Just consider my advice in the future: Bring up your issue with the mods, and let them discipline OP.

  ETA: Am I seriously being this fucking petty? In lieu of deleting my post and trying to hide my shame, I removed my own upvote. As if that means anything. Ugh

  ETA2: Incorrect, as well. I apologize for slandering [[/u/Algernon_Asimov]][2] [-5]'s good name. He is truly a kickass mod, and can build any community he wants to. Actually not even kidding right now. He's literally pro. I cannot touch.

Yeah, that was really bad behavior from you.
