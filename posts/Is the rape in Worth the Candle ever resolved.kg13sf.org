*** Yeah, that's fair, I was just pissed when I wrote the title. You can't edit titles through. I read the chapters ahead of myself and it seems like the author handles it well and it isn't brushed under the rug. I just saw Bethel listed as a party member in the wiki and the idea that she might stay a member drove me insane.

** Since you're asking for specific spoilers: Bethel is immediately and decisively removed from the party and measures are taken to ensure that Juniper does not have to interact with her or be anywhere near her. Nobody in-story accepts her or accepts what she did as okay.

*** That's a relief. But what about the power that she offers? Did they just throw her and everything she brought to the table out the door? And what specifically happens to her as a consequence to all this?

**** They seriously considered killing her. Rather than do so, they... exiled her, basically, with Valencia as her parole officer / therapist (since Valencia wants to show/teach her how to not be such an awful sophont).

It makes more sense in context, and it is treated as a given that Valencia's power and capabilities are nothing, /nothing/ compared to making sure Juniper doesn't have to deal with having his rapist as part of the party.
