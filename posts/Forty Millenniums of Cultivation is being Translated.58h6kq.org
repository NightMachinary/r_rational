** Some of you may remember the recommendation of the novel, /Forty Millenniums of Cultivation/, posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][here]] which did a great job of hyping up the novel but with no English translations available (/grumble, grumble/ people should go to jail for tormenting me like that!) it was a teaser like only seeing the trailer of an amazing movie coming out in 50 years from now.

However, I just happened to check on [[/r/noveltranslations]] today out of random curiosity and found announcement posts of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5689mw/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_1/][Chapter 1,2]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/57dfvs/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_3/][Chapter 3]].

It appears to be updating at a slow rate of roughly a chapter every week, so it's slow compared to other wuxia novels online which update daily. Therefore, I would recommend bookmarking it and waiting until there are more chapters. But at the very least leave a comment on the website to encourage the noble and valiant translator, Strivon! S/he doesn't seem to be an alternate account of [[/u/Drazelic]] according to this [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/][page]].

*** ahahahaahhaaaaa oh my god I was /just/ about to start the translation of it myself /today/ actually!

I'm betting that this was elicited by the fact that someone in the FMoC reviews section said something along the lines of 'man all the other big novels have english fandoms, when are WE going to get an english translation?'

I mean, /that/ was my impetus for deciding to finally start the translation today. But Cakefleet is doing a damn good job of it so far!

** One thing that I feel like I really actually have to mention, right now:

One of my friends suggested that I start a wiki to sort of crowdsource the translation; this is probably going to be necessary to get this translation finished on any sort of timely basis. Let me explain why.

Cultivation40k currently has 1500 chapters, and the author has said they plan on another year or so of writing before the story's wrapped up. They update with anywhere from two to four updates, every day. Best case scenario, this means another thousand or so chapters, making the book's total length somewhere around 2500 chapters- and I fully expect it to stretch on to 3000 chapters, because you never know when the author's creative genius is going to act up and he's going to toss in ANOTHER planetary-scale plot-arc just because he can.

Now, to do the math:

The current translator's schedule is, I've been told, to update with one chapter per week. /One chapter per week./ Do the math, and it turns out that, working alone, Strivon will be finished with Cultivation40k in, oh... /fifty years or so!/

(1 update per week = 50-ish updates per year. 2500 chapters divided by 50 chapters per year equals 50 years.)

/Fifty./

/Years./

(And that's the optimistic guess for if the author writes the /least amount possible/. I have too much faith in the author to believe that something like this would actually happen.)

It would be easier for most non-Chinese speakers to /just learn Chinese/ over the next fifty years rather than wait for this translation to be finished.

I tried doing some translation tonight. Over the course of six hours or so, I translated three chapters to my own satisfaction and got most of the way through a fourth. Let's just round that up to four chapters in a single day for the purposes of our calculations.

I cannot be this productive and translate this much every day, obviously. I have other things in my life, after all, so let's make the (slightly optimistic) assumption that I can do four chapters per /week/ on a regular basis indefinitely.

Even if you add my translation rate in, assuming I can match the productivity I had tonight, and round it up to 4 chapters, five chapters a week would still mean /twelve years/ before the translation is fully finished.

/This is not a task doable by any single human being./ If Cultivation40k is to be fully translated into english on any sort of sane timeframe, it's gonna have to be a really, really, really big team effort. Six or seven people working simultaneously at the very least (and honestly more than that would probably be a good idea) with a shared vocabulary base defined on a wiki page beforehand so people don't make up different translations for the same term without each other's knowledge.

So- yeah, um. I'm not really sure what to do about this either. This is kind of above my pay grade. (Which, since none of us are getting paid here, is really essentially /nothing/, after all.) I just figured I'd let you guys know about the numbers and statistics, here.

Plus, don't forget- the story's 1500+ chapters long right now, right? The /really good stuff/, the [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-relevant stuff about piercing the heavens, doing the impossible, and the themes about trust and betrayal and geopolitics and clever slytherin plotting and the question of whether human society can escape from the molochian deathtrap and the struggle for muggle rights in a world run by immortal wizards and the relative merits of darwinism and egalitarianism- all that only gradually starts to appear around chapter 100 or so.

I dunno about you guys, but chapter 100 feels very, /very/ far away to me right now.

:(

--------------

Other fun facts: My translation of 3.75 chapters had about 8,000 words in it. Using that as a benchmark, assuming chapter lengths remain constant, we can extrapolate the whole length of Cultivation40k at this time of posting as around 3,300,000 words, and its projected length upon completion to be anywhere from 6,000,000 words to 7,000,000 words.

That's a lot of words.

The original Harry Potter series altogether was somewhere around 1,000,000 words, if I remember correctly. HPMOR was somewhere in the vicinity of 600,000 to 700,000. Worm was 1,680,000 words, according to a cursory google search I just did.

This story is /already/ five times as long as HPMOR.

/This story will be ten times as long as HPMOR./

/This story will be four to five times as long as Worm./

Think about that for a moment.

I really wanted to take the task of translating this whole thing onto my own shoulders- I really did. Then I did the math, and... I don't think I can do it alone, and Strivon- well, brave, poor soul that they are, I don't think anybody can buckle down and keep translating something for fifty years. At that sort of timescale we're talking a crapshoot whether they're even going to /live long enough to finish./

It would be faster to improve current machine translation programs to decent quality!

The only solution I can think of is to recommend it to wuxiaworld.com and hope they pick it up. For example, one of the longer stories is /I Shall Seal the Heavens/ which clocks in at ~1,650 chapters total. Deathblade has been translating it at roughly a year and is up ~1,050 chapters. I also think the chapter lengths are roughly equivalent between it and /Forty Millenniums of Cultivation/ so they are capable of translating it in a short time span which is reasonable since for many of them, translating is literally a full-time job.

*** I'm psyched to read this story even though I've never read a Chinese novel, but the sheer length of it has me worried about pacing. How can a story go on without padding itself out? This has got to be a record for longest continuous narrative written by a single author, but can he really maintain a consistent level of quality throughout? I don't want Sturgeon's Law to apply to a single work.

I probably shouldn't be worried considering that I've enjoyed webcomics like Sluggy Freelance, Freefall, and El Goonish Shive with extremely long and slow story arcs, but those had the advantage of all being comedies first and foremost. The story is good, even great at times, but because every page has a punchline it remains consistently entertaining even when it plods.

**** Well, I mean, it's subjective, your mileage may vary, this is just my opinion, etc. etc.

After 1500+ chapters, I haven't even /remotely/ begun to get sick of the story. Quite the opposite- I'm more excited /now/ than ever! It's just gotten better and better and more and more engaging, and the author's never let me down yet. The sheer volume is mostly generated by the crazy amount of worldbuilding and character-building introspection. It's long, but it's long because it's detailed and rich. There are no 'filler' arcs, as far as I can tell; every arc deals with a meaningful social, political, or economic commentary, throwing revelation after revelation at you in chains of intelligent analysis that just keeps building on each other.

/(In case you cant tell, I think this story is basically perfect in every single way- so take my reviews with a grain of salt! Not going to try and sugarcoat it- I am a diehard fan of this serial in every single way. I haven't enjoyed a story this much in a very, very long time./

******* [[http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim][Here is the most obscure]], a webcomic I've recommended here before but few were able to get past the artwork. It's...bad, but I love literally everything else about it so I don't care. It's imaginative, intelligent, and inspiring on all fronts with wonderful characters, clever stories, and creative worldbuilding. In all seriousness, it's up there with Doctor Who. The link is to Ch. 7, my personal favorite and a prequel to Ch. 1, the worst chapter.

[[http://www.readcomics.tv/astro-city/chapter-7/full][This story arc from the comic book Astro City]] is about a Wonder Woman-esque superheroine who runs a franchise of women's shelters dealing with an attack on her image as she questions herself and her role as an icon. It does an excellent job at exploring themes of feminism, power, abuse, adversity, and the questions we ask ourselves about the choices we make in response to them.

Last comic, I swear. [[http://gingerhaze.com/nimona/comic/page-1][Nimona]] is kind of like Dr. Horrible in a magitech fantasy setting with better developed characters, a more interesting plot, and a sociopathic girl who wants to be a henchman even if the supervillain isn't hiring. I can't give any more away without spoiling it, but it's a great drama and adventure with everything I could ask for, except that it isn't free. The first few chapters are, which the link will take you to, but if you want to full story you'll have to buy it.

Yudkowsky already recommend the Haruhu Suzimya fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7218037/1/The-Coin][The Coin]], but I'll put it here in case you missed it because it's just that good. I always had mixed feelings toward the anime, it had some really interesting ideas that I felt never reached their full potential and Haruhi's more abusive moments really bothered me. This fic addressed literally every problem I had with the show, gave me exactly what I had always wanted from it, and stayed completely true to the themes of the source material while also reexamining them in a more intelligent light.

This one is a little subjective, since I personally identify with the protagonist's situation, but it's still one of my favorite sci-fi stories ever. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/][It's the highest voted entry on r/WritingPrompts]] and the premise pretty much speaks for itself. The closest thing I can compare it to is The Martian, but it's still a very different story. I see it as about a man trapped inside his own mind, alive but isolated, and having to solve an intellectual problem with no known answer in order to escape. As someone with autism, that hit home hard.

[[http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/Superman-vs-The-Elite/Movie?id=22004][Superman vs The Elite]] ties with Avengers for my favorite superhero film. It single-handedly turned me into a Superman fan by showing just how mature, intelligent, and subtle that his stories can really be. Half the film is just Supes talking to people about the moral quandaries he faces in a post-9/11 world where many think problems aren't so straightforward. It's a fantastic examination of idealism in the face of harsh reality and cynicism, and the action looks amazing too. It flew under the radar since it was a direct to DVD film, but literally my only complaint is that they didn't use the title of the comic they adapted it from, What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and The American Way?

[[http://kissanime.to/Anime/Suisei-no-Gargantia-Dub/Episode-001?id=82616][Gargania on the Verderous Planet]] isn't exactly obscure since it comes from the same creator as Madoka Magika and Psycho-Pass, but it's still awesome. I like to think of it as a mecha anime as made by Miyazaki, and it certainly has the visuals and heart for it. It's about a solider from an unending conflict with aliens crashing on Earth, a mere myth in his society, and having to survive in a world of peace when he has known only war. There's a ton of attention of detail bordering on hard sci-fi, but the best part is the drama and character development.

And finally, go watch Young Justice on Netflix so we can get a third season. It is everything a superhero show should be and more, even if the second season has some problems that seem to bother me more than other people. It's the most episodic story on this list, but it still has a complex ongoing plot with some awesome character development. It's from the same creator who gave us Gargoyles, which I haven't seen yet but have heard is also an obscure gem, and is just as entertaining for adults as it is for children.

*** Oh its totally fine if you want to take over. I took a read at your translation and I really like some of your choices for the terminology, such as "sigils" and "glyphs". As I'm not a native speaker of Chinese and most writing I do involve white papers and tech documents, I feel that you are a much better person for the job for conveying the story's atmosphere and mysticism properly.

I pretty much started translating this because the story seemed awesome and I wanted some motivation to improve my Chinese. My thought was, "hey no one else is doing this, might as well give it a shot."

As for a wiki, I feel that there would be conflicts between different writing styles and things would be pretty chaotic unless managed properly. Everyone's writing style is unique, though the difference may be minuscule between some people. So ideally you would find people with similar writing styles or someone could be the master editor who edits everything to fit one style. But yea, there's pros and cons for each.

If you do take over, do you have any recommendations for other Chinese novels that I could translate? Preferably sci-fi.

I'm not sure if I want to take over the translation entirely, is the thing- I don't have enough time to do a /full translation/, is the thing. Six hours per four chapters is a lot of hours when scaled up, and I already did all the math and stuff in a previous post, and it's just absolutely beyond my ability. I'm a full-time student and there's already a lotta other stuff on my plate, right now.

Actually, one thing I've been thinking of doing is making sort of a 'style guide' which would include a glossary of terms, a list of names and a breakdown of what those names /mean/ in chinese, how to pronounce them, if there are any puns built into those names, and then a list of terms and a guide to any puns that those terms end up used for. Just getting proper-sounding vocabulary would do a lot to make any potential translator's life easier, and I've already been working on this thing for a while.

If you want to keep working on the translation, I could finish up the glossary, polish it up, and then you could put it up on the blog as a resource for both you and the readers?

I just realized something. You are a die-hard fan of this series, so you have sufficient motivation to translate it. Your translation of the 3.75 chapters was excellent, so you are defiantly capable of the task. All you lack is the time and the funding to support yourself while translating it. Why not join wuxiaworld.com as a new translator? You'll be able to reach a sufficiently large audience who are very likely to pay you (through Patreon) enough money for you to support yourself. I know that Deathblade makes enough money translating /I Shall Seal the Heavens/ to support himself, wife, and baby son.

*** Paging [[/u/Drazelic]], since s/he was the one to originally translate the title this way, then maybe Drazelic can explain?

When I looked on [[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118508?redirectedFrom=millennium#eid][OED]] to see the proper pluralization of millennium, they are both valid spellings with millennia being the more common variant. I would guess the reason for the two different spellings to be valid is because the millennia version is due to millennium's heritage as a borrowed Latin word (and the -a stem in Latin indicates pluralization), but millenniums is also valid since millennium is (now) an English word.

The chinese format of the title is literally 'Cultivation 40k' in an isomorphic format to 'Warhammer 40k'. If you like Millennia better, that's your prerogative, whatevs!

I might go with 'Cultivation in the 40th Millennium' for my own version, actually- I have several significant points of dis-satisfaction with the existing translation, which are systematic issues that I feel like would be easier to address with a flat-out rewrite rather than with suggestions and edits.

My philosophy of translation tries to emphasize the spirit of the reading experience over the literal wording, which is an issue that honestly bothers me a lot about the whole literalist translation paradigm over at noveltranslations. Like, look, I don't care how /literally accurate/ the definition is, if one is translating the mystic elixirs, tinctures, and medicines concocted by Cultivator alchemists with ancient magic as mere /pills/, then something has gone very very wrong with that translation's ability to /actually deliver an immersive experience with proper awe and grandeur./ When I read Xianxia, I want a sense of mysticism and grandeur. I do not want my goddamn kung fu wizards popping /pills/ every time they get hurt.

(Luckily, nothing like that has happened in this translation, yet. But that's pretty much the first thing that comes to mind when I think about the 'average' level of translation most xianxia novels get, and it's a fate I'd much love to avoid for Cultivation40k.)

I'm not sure myself on whether this is a significant enough improvement on the experience- if it's an improvement at all- to warrant me, well, basically doing the dick thing of pushing my way in and being all like 'outta the way, i've got this'. Because that /would/ be a dick move, but the alternative is to just sit there and stew in my own personal dissatisfaction that the translation doesn't deliver the experience I feel it ought to, right? Be the change you want to see and all that. I'd like to avoid being presumptuous here, if I could.

You're definitely good enough to have made it a more immerse reading experience, yeah.

******* Personally I found this to be a significant improvement upon the other translation. No offence intended to the other translator, who is significantly better at translation than I'll ever be, but they used a few phrases which I found jarring and threw me out of the narrative. while you found more natural ways of phrasing them which flowed better. eg. "broken nose" vs "embedded inside his flesh"

********** I don't really watch much of anything, english or chinese. I don't even have a TV!

I am not, like, a /huge/ xianxia fan. I'm just a casual reader; I certainly have't consumed everything in the genre, and since I don't watch TV I'm not really all that surprised that I'd miss out on these tv dramas.

****** Overal literalism, for the most part, and that's a systematic issue that's just not something that can be edited out, because it comes directly from the stylistic preferences and technical limitations of the translator themselves. There's also some grammatical issues and at least one case of total mistranslation, but those can be corrected without total rewrites.

Literalism is an easy issue to fall into with translation, because the original text is /right there/ and the natural urge is to trace the original text as closely as possible, but a lot of the things from the translation seem to be trying too hard to retain perfect fidelity down to the sentence structure. This doesn't work very well when translating between languages with different grammatical rules. A lot of sentence structures that sound totally fine in Chinese sound awfully janky and riddles with passive voice in English, and the translator either didn't take the liberty of editing their translation for flow, or they just didn't realize they'd slipped into passive voice.

Also, there are some literal translations of idioms that seem really out of place, but that might be subjective. I'm mostly thinking of 'jade tree in the wind' right now. There's such a concept as a weirdness tolerance, where one wants to translate terms with approximately the same level of exoticness in both the original and translated texts, because people pay attention to things that stand out and this can be used to tell readers 'hey this concept is important'. When one translates foreign idioms literally without any forewarning it stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the translation, like a painting where somebody's face is purple for no reason at all; the divergence from the norm demands attention even if the object being depicted is totally reasonable.

I know that all these issues sound dumb and nitpicky individually, but translation is really about the small things. It's like paving a road- people expect a smooth experience from their ride and notice any bump that shows up, even if it's not all that significant in the long run, because roads are supposed to be smooth, right? I feel like reading experiences are much the same. You expect the translation to run smoothly, and inelegant translation creates frictional costs that reduces the potential readerbase's size down to people who can tolerate the bumpy road.

I guess I'm a bit harsh on it because I really love the source material and want to see it presented in nothing but the bestest light possible!

(And, no, I haven't contacted Strivon yet. No real reason, just, I got distracted for a few hours and forgot to do it.)

** Have you guys tried [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/?]] It's not as good as how you're describing FMoC to be, but it has its interesting moments too (though some plot devices eventually get repetitive).

On this story itself, I think I'll at least wait until it's finished arc-by-arc and read it like that. Because otherwise keeping up with these updates is more frustrating than fun.

Also, I don't know what's the procedure, but maybe it can be arranged for this story to be included in the list of parsed stories on [[http://lnmtl.com/novel][lnmtl?]] It may work, depending on the difficulty of Chinese used in this story.

*** Reincarnator is pretty fun. I'm not quite sure where the story has to go after this "layer" though.

According to the lnmtl site:

#+begin_quote
  When the threshold of 100$ is reached, one new novel that is not counted as regular novel will be added.

  It will be added under 2 days, counting from the day it reaches the threshold. In case of delay, more than one novel will be added.

  If it will be many users that gather total of 100$, then leader of current survey will have been added.

  If it will be single person that donates 100$, then that person can select novel to be added out of the current survey options.

  It is also possible to select novel outside the survey, but only if you have contacted me and I have agreed to it, prior to the donation.

A turf war with the owner of the second Nurmaha's Ring, likely. Clementine and her commanders will get shocked at how powerful Hansoo is and at the existence of a second ring, Hansoo will start destroying armies of thousands just by himself, etc. By the end of the arc some stupid people will think of brand new ways to betray Hansoo and his allies only to get foiled again, some huge monster will appear out of nowhere and threaten all the work that has been done so far, Hansoo will destroy it by himself while almost getting killed, the fairy will appear to announce how cool he is, etc, etc.
