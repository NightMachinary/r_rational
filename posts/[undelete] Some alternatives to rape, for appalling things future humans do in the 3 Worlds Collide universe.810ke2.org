** If you can make a backup copy of someone and restore it into a new body, which is something that's probably not too far from their capabilities (easy for any civilization that has duplicative teleportation) you can do anything you want to them as often as you want and nobody will ever ever know about it.

It's a nasty twist on "identity theft".

*** Oh damn...

If I had that technology I'd be cloning myself. Just doing it would be fascinating to me: As I press the switch that creates a clone of me, I would wonder, which would I come out? Would I continue being me, and meet my clone? Or would I wake up as my clone? Of course, both would happen.

** [[/r/rational]] is slow moving; everyone saw it, despite your low karma count. It's not polite to repost unsuccessful or deleted threads.

**** Well I only saw it in the timeframe between 45 minutes ago and now. What's wrong with leaving it there? And I don't think making /another/ un-delete-un-delete thread is a solution.

***** You said it's impolite to repost unsuccessful or deleted threads. So that's what's wrong with leaving it, it's impolite. Also on second thought, that last bit I wrote about what type of rape wasn't okay.
