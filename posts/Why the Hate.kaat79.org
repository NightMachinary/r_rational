I don't want to encourage any brigading so I won't say where I saw this, but I came across a thread where someone asked for an explanation of what rationalist fiction was. A couple of people provided this explanation, but the vast majority of the thread was just people complaining about how rational fiction is a blight on the medium and that in general the rational community is just the worst. It caught me off guard. I knew this community was relatively niche, but in general based on the recs thread we tend to like good fiction. Mother of Learning is beloved by this community and its also the most popular story on Royalroad after all.

With that said I'd like to hear if there is any good reason for this vitriol. Is it just because people are upset about HPMOR's existence, or is there something I'm missing?

**** I think there are aspects of rational (not rationalist) fiction that /would/ be a benefit to nearly all fiction. I don't think that a story ever really benefits from characters carrying the idiot ball or acting in ways that contradict their personalities and self interest (note that this /does not mean/ that characters should never make bad decisions, those bad decisions should just make sense with the rest of the character traits etc). Of course, some people would argue that those more general aspects of "rational" fiction aren't all that different from "good writing" and don't warrant a specific tag, and I don't necessarily disagree.

Game of Throne perhaps being an example of the latter. You might argue that it would benefit from a better exploration of the magic and it's strategic uses however the books are already slow in coming out and I would rather have them as they are than adding another say 20% creation time to each book.

****** That's not at all what the idiot ball means. Dumb characters /should/ make dumb decisions (although just because a character isn't very smart doesn't mean that any kind of dumb action makes sense. Even dumb characters should have personalities that lead to specific kinds of actions). And obviously not every character should be a super competent genius (I'd argue that very few should be. It's hard to do in a way that isn't boring).

Carrying the idiot ball specifically refers to characters who make a dumb decision /that does not match their demonstrated characterization/ for no other reason than that the plot requires that they make that decision. One that doesn't make sense, given what we know about the character.

For example, a character who is demonstrated to be a coward, but he goes into the super spooky cabin anyways, in the absence of any other, over riding reason to do so, because if he didn't, then the story would end,

**** I think it's less that most fiction should be more like this and that more fiction /of certain specific genres/ should. Namely, the ones that depend heavily on world building and are very plot driven. Then of course it all falls down to how the work itself is presented. I do not resent the lack of consistency or logic in, say, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, because the entire thing is blatantly aiming to be stylish, over the top campy nonsense. But when something poses itself as serious and tries to get me involved in a complex narrative, that narrative better make sense (this is also, much less controversially, referred to as "good writing").

***** Jojo's is exactly the type of niche genre that I agree doesn't need to be rational. But even average tv shows or normal fantasy books would benefit from having the characters behave in ways that are more beneficial to themselves and their own goals.

For example, I recently watched a show where an FBI agent uncovered a plot to assassinate the President. The agent told no one because she was afraid she wouldn't have enough evidence. So instead she tried to kill the assassin herself and got in trouble for firing a gun near the President. Makes no sense. Even if she had no evidence, the secret service takes threats seriously. She even knew the exact room number the assassin was using to snipe the president and when it would happen and being an FBI agent she knew exactly who to report to and would know that they would take it seriously and check out the room.

But luckily she was a better shot with her pistol shooting at a hotel room across a field than the sniper was with his sniper rifle firing at someone standing in the open with no cover so everything worked out....

****** Oh, sure, that actually covers a large bunch of shows and books. There's also an argument to be made for how certain such stupid tropes are so common and consistent that they actively become diseducative. I recently watched a couple episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder", and if people get their notion of what the legal profession is like from stuff like that, well... let's just say they'll likely start looking at summary lynchings in a much better light.

In a lot of cases, irrationality is just a writer's lazy shortcut to creating engaging narratives without actually making the effort of working within a bare minimum of constraints. In that sense, I think it's worth criticising, because it actually does harm.

Bringing up a hot topic, but... this is something that really irked me in The Last Jedi. The movie is supposed to be about rebels fighting against a fascist Empire. Yet lots of people were entirely willing to defend the notion of a superior demanding unthinking obedience, even in the face of apparent certain death, from one of her own commanding officers, and blame the latter for not being satisfied with that, and even turning to mutiny when he thought the life of his crew was in danger. Now to me, that seems absurd. Even the real military doesn't work like that - orders can and should be explained unless there's a good reason not to. And these are supposedly resistance fighters, likely with a less rigid hierarchy. But most importantly, I would say that if you in good faith think your commander is leading you to death with manifest incompetence, you absolutely DO have a moral duty to protect the lives of your fellow crewmates. Even if that means breaking the code of whatever military you're enlisted into! And that somehow people who supposedly cheered for free thinking and resistance to power were perfectly okay with the notion of an absolute military hierarchy in which nothing but unthinking obedience is owed - a notion that in real military theory has been probably abandoned since, like, WW1 or so - is a special kind of absurd. But it speaks a lot to how the movie imagine of any military organisation is mostly that, so yeah, everyone just reads it in that light.

******* Ya, it's super lazy. In my example the agent could have called it in, but the bad guys were monitoring communications and move their location or abandon the plan for another attempt later. They already showed in the show that the bad guys had an inside agent and had hacked the white house security systems. Or if Agent was shown to know about those things, she could have tried to confront the bad guys in the room she knew about without talking to other sources. Maybe bring some FBI friends she talks to in person. The bad guys could have had security though and ambushed them causing some deaths on the FBI side that get blamed on the main character and we are back to her foiling the assassination attempt but getting in trouble like the writers wanted.

** I've never heard anything about this sneerclub or nazi issue before (in fact, this subreddit seems solidly left to me), but I do follow some literature groups. From the conversations I've had and threads I've read on here, I'm fairly sure that many rational readers (myself included) are massive STEM nerds who judge literature by unusual standards.

This subreddit is basically a 'safe space' for disregarding normal conversational and literary conventions. People tend to be more honest and rambling, and no-one really mocks others for that. I would bet that many people in these circles are either somewhat autistic or socially inept, if for no other reason than that sort of behaviour is more accepted here.

Also, everyone here seems to be having great fun using pretentious words and phrases, and earnestly sharing what they know without fear of being thought arrogant. I really enjoy that about this community, since there aren't many places you can do that, but it looks really weird from the outside.

Essentially, I've always felt [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is like a group of weird science kids who started their own book club where they can be themselves (maybe because I was in such a book club when I was younger). This on its own is enough to draw hate, I think.

************* IDK, maybe this line of discussion is kind of pointless, I'm arguing for not banning individuals on political opinions (Which pretty much means ANY opinion, The only thing I think justifies banning is actual incites to violence or other illegal actions), and the argument against that is "this political opinion is too harmful to allow" so my argument against that is "there are other political opinions which are MORE harmful and are generally accepted by (you)/society and you wouldn't think banning them is a good idea so why this one?" which descends into a "which is worse" argument which is kinda pointless because the point is that both are bad but that is irrelevant to whether they should be banned or not (IMO).

I kinda want to continue the "which is worse" discussion though since I find it interesting and you are an enjoyable person to discuss this with, but if you are sick of it just skip to the last paragraph;

I guess your comment explains exactly why everyone hates nazi's although the ideology is responsible for less deaths than Communism. From a completely surface perspective of both ideologies one looks like "racism" and the other like "equality". The problem is that isn't reality, and in practice what you are doing here is steal-manning Communism and Straw-manning Race-realism. Race-realism != racist (although I agree that most Race-realists are likely racists, the Ideology is not inherently racist) Race-realism is just the opinion that; "Communities with a single race will on average be more functional/happy/productive w/e than ones which are not", and therefor it would be a good idea to segregate (Obviously I disagree with this, and think diversity is a massive strength, but I try not to let this opinion bias me, and don't think it is harmful to discuss this seriously, in fact think it is more harmful to straw-man and censor any discussion on this topic). A moderate race-realist doesn't necessarily discriminate, just "tries to persuade others that this is a good idea". If they put this into practice by attempting do act on this belief in situations such as the workplace, government, etc, then I completely agree that is is BAD bad. The thing is, this has to be compared to a communist which is ALSO trying to implement his/her opinion in professional/political situation (such as undermining democracy, removing liberties to maximize equality etc) which is ALSO BAD bad.

That is the same thing; straw-man vs steal-man. Steal-man of communism is "Reduce poverty by making everyone equal" and straw man is "I don't like people who are harder workers than me so give me their money." While a Steal-man of race-realism is "Reduce poverty by making everyone better off (by segregation)" while the straw man is "I'm racist so I want an excuse to allow me to discriminate against other races".

My argument for free speech is simple: Censorship ALWAYS increases power inequality by definition. Any sort of censorship can only ever be successful by someone with more power than the individual they are censoring, where power here is defined by "who's influence is larger". To me there is nothing more to be said, as a left-liberal power (and resources, happiness, etc) should be spread as much as possible, censorship is putting the cart before the horse and should be minimized as much as possible.

************** But race realism isn't about reducing poverty at all. It postulates that people are more unhappy when they live in mixed communities. Why are they unhappy? Because they think race is a fundamental difference that means they can't trust people from a different race. Why couldn't they trust them? Because they're racist.

It's circular reasoning, is what I'm saying. It creates a problem, then sells itself as the only solution to that problem. If people didn't even /think/ in terms of race, the problem wouldn't exist. And if you did segregate them on the basis of race, they'd just end up splitting along new lines. Factionalism is hardly an exclusive of race divides. Superficial differences are what we use to /rationalize/ factionalism; factionalism in the end is just about bandying together to split the maximum possible amount of resources among the smallest possible amount of people. Identifying race as the one root cause of factionalism means either you're a grifter thinking the divide will benefit YOUR side, or you're an idiot. And a racist either way.

That said, my point was arguing about the differences with communism. I do tend to agree on censorship not being very good or useful. As a general rule, if certain awful ideas are uncommon enough that you can establish a solid, uncontroversial majority that's ok with censoring them, you don't /need/ to censor them - they'll only be laughed off anyway. And if they're actually getting common enough that censorship is controversial, then you already have a problem anyway that censorship won't fix. Censorship reeks of a majority losing its grasp on discourse that desperately tries to clutch to its dominance. It doesn't really work and it makes you look weak and fearful.

That's not race realism, that's just nationalism. In the US, both whites and blacks have been living in the same country for centuries. But a race realist /still/ would demand segregation, even though neither group can be considered to be immigrants. The immigrant thing is much simpler: it suggests the game is zero sum, and so if someone else gets something, they must be taking it from you. It doesn't matter WHO the someone is.

No, the point is that race realists argue about how race mixing lowers happiness and propose to solve race mixing. Communists argue that poverty lowers happiness, and propose to solve poverty. Neither actually really solves the problem. But in the case of communists, the problem is real. In the case of race realists, it's not, or it's created by them. Race realists are at the same level of demon exorcists, as far as contributions to society go.

I just wanted to point out that I don't think the two things are really at the same level. So if you wanted to make a distinction, you could. I'm not saying that's where the line for censorship ought to be traced, but if you did trace it there, the distinction would not be entirely arbitrary. That said, sure, Communism gets a pass for various reasons (one of which may be historical: Nazism had to be fought and defeated, Communism was a begrudging ally and then long term rival with whom however some sort of balance had to be found for the sake of not burning the planet in nuclear fire, so obviously our relationship to them is very different) that if you only went by amount of damage caused it probably wouldn't deserve. Though moderate socialism can be argued to be beneficial, moderate nazism is just less terrible than all-out nazism, but still pretty bad with no upsides.

Oh well actually, I would completely agree there, so with respect to the original point of this discussion I guess we were arguing if race-realsim is 98% or 99% bad XD.

But to expand on this and explain why I wouldn't draw a line at race-realism; to use an aircraft engineering metaphor;

to me race realism is like cutting a hole in the wing to reduce weight; It immediately damages performance, looks ugly, and if not repaired can expand and keep tearing until the whole wing falls off.

While Communism is like loosening a bolt in the engine to make it quieter; It seems to make the flight nicer, is completely undetectable without an inspection, and will eventually lead to catastrophe when the engine explodes with no-one the wiser.

**** Lesswrong (which I'd consider a predecessor to [[/r/rational]]) had a few disproportionately loud neoreactionaries (who are adjacent to neo-nazis, are the intellectual predecessors of the modern alt right, and which incubated people like Steve Bannon and by extension influenced Trump). Some of these neoreactionaries were participating as community members and others of whom were brigading and engaging in mass downvote spamming of anyone with leftist views. Many in the community tolerated them and embraced it in the name of "free speech". Yudkowsky himself firmly repudiated them and generally advocated downvoting and banning them, so it's a bit unfair to say that rational fiction (which was born largely from Yudkowsky) is tainted by assocation. Prior to that, intellectual predecessor OvercomingBias has also had a notable neoreactionary presence, probably in part to some of founder Robin Hanson's opinions. It's not super visible on this subreddit but if you know the history of things, it does make sense that people would associate that with us, even if most of us repudiate that.

I think the problem there tends to be that a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged. I tend to think that's not really a solid way of doing politics - after all, the racist likely /feels/ deeply scared and worried about those violent thugs who want nothing but to rape his daughters, and yet somehow I doubt we should pay that feeling too much heed - and that since all politics involves compromise and agreement between multiple parties, it can only be built on things on which entire groups can agree on, namely, shared, measurable elements of reality. I think a lot of people around here would probably inclined to think the same way (given the nature of the community itself), and so that probably creates a significant ideological rift.

****** Here's an example of a discussion I saw some days ago. This was mainly among researchers from social/political sciences. Apparently, the common trend right now is to believe that if you're researching a sociopolitical issue, to take an activist role in those topics is encouraged as something that /enhances/ your research. The logic, rooted in critical theory, is that since every narrative and framing is expression of a power relationship anyway, you might as well embrace one openly. The opposing view, that you should strive to distance yourself from the topic and assess it in an objective manner in order to produce useful research, exists, but is in minority, and often draws accusations of right-wing bias. Because, after all, inaction is the same as standing with the oppressor.

Now note that I'm not saying that when people study these issues, "both sides" have a point. If you study genocide or discrimination, one side definitely ought to have every decent person behind them. Nor am I saying that it is possible to achieve perfect objectivity: it is always only a goal to aspire to. Nor am I saying that your research's results will always be perfectly apolitical: if one side blatantly lies or believes falsities, the truth will be political. And finally, I perfectly understand that if your subject of study isn't elementary particles but people, people who you often interview, befriend, live among, then it's not going to be exactly easy to keep a distance. There will be times in which you might feel a tension between your professional duty and your duty as a human being, as they might be at odds. You might feel like you just /can't/ stand on the sidelines and document as other people are involved in the fight.

The problem is saying that activism actually makes your work /better/. It really, really can't. Being personally involved will raise your emotional stakes in what you find out. If what you find out happens to support your cause, you'll be all too happy to publish it. But if it doesn't, you'll have all sorts of peer pressure and emotional investment in NOT releasing it, or twisting it; a lot more than you would otherwise (not that you usually wouldn't: but that will still be there, and be compounded). And this in the end hurts the cause too. If all the research - the job whose task should be to provide facts to the public so they may make their own mind on an issue - feels like it's somehow affected by partisan politics either way, then it loses more and more credibility. People stop wondering about what the facts even are and feel absolved in simply going with their gut; after all, it's what even those researchers do!

And obviously that instinct is always present, to a point. The problem is how we're completely losing any desire of fighting it off. Historically, the political left has generally stood /more/ for reason and objectivity. Pointing out how many social, historical, cultural or religious constructs are /not/ absolutes or laws of nature is rational. Asking for equality among humans where there is no evidence that justifies discrimination is rational. If the left abandons that stance in frustration too, what we actually end up having is a political spectrum in which no one agrees on anything but one thing: truth does not exist, reason is of no consequence, personal feeling is all that matters. But in that way it also becomes impossible to achieve any kind of compromise, because no one can just convince someone else to /feel/ differently without that change having some roots in a shared reality.

That there is a movement in 'left academia' towards embracing this bias, which furthers tribal thinking and makes compromise difficult, as there is no neutral academic basis that can be used to observe political ideas.

You're then saying that this lack of neutrality/objectivity makes it difficult for left to compromise with right, and distinguish nuance in right. That this means it's hard for left to tell if a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] comment is Nazi or just right.

Rather than talking about what tendencies and bias 'a left-leaning person' might have, you're describing people as being a faceless limb of 'the left' (though your phrasing varies).

Obviously it's really hard to pin down "purely left" or "purely right" people - though some who build their whole identity around that might fit the bill - it's more that people adopt ideas and often certain social contexts will reinforce them (so if I'm, roughly speaking, 90% left and 10% right, I'll still be loathe to voice that 10% while in a context of other majority-left people coded to be left like a political party or a movement, which then creates a feedback loop with others. This effect becomes stronger if those people are inclined to shaming or other forms of social pressure, which /absolutely are/ very common in political discourse these days).

My point isn't that everyone does this, though the discussion I mentioned involved academics who do /not/ like this approach complaining about peer pressure from the majority. There is such a thing as "mainstream" ideas in a certain environment, I don't see what's problematic with that, without a need to label individual people at all, which I don't think I did. My problem isn't with the people, it's with the specific shape the ideology is taking, the "meme" so to speak (in the sense Dawkins originally coined the term for).

You asked for an example, I made an example. There's more. My point is, there is a general trend towards this sort of extremely relativistic interpretation. If epistemology exists on a scale, from "Truth exists and I know it because it's all written in this Holy Book or whatever" to "Truth does not exist, everything is subjective to the point of solipsism", then the dominant epistemology associated with left wing ideologies would be slowly shifting towards the latter extreme in the last years, too close for my comfort, at least. And I'm still pretty relativist, of course! I just don't think it's useful any more when you get to the point of completely abandoning any hope of even /pursuing/ objectivity. Even with all its trappings and fake goals. It just feels like a lot of people have stopped trying altogether and have called the objective itself worthless, with actual philosophers and theorists (from whom these ideas originate) basically providing smart-sounding rationalisations for why this sour grape mindset is actually a good thing.

I'm thinking more of how discourse ends up looking like online, in journalism, and so on. Even though you may argue people act in /more/ extreme ways than they would in person in those settings, that doesn't make them less real. Plenty of movements and political change are driven by this sort of stuff (up to and including Trumpism, in fact). I'm not saying that people in general are predicted specifically by ideologies on an individual level, but ideologies matter as reference points. And ideologies change with time. Surely you wouldn't say that the left and the right today carry the same exact core ideas and policy objectives as thirty, sixty, one hundred years ago? The general sense of the two sides remains the same, but the specifics evolve all the time.

What would be your approach to do so then? It seems to me like you're deconstructing the concept itself of there even /being/ an ideology too much. I'm not saying you can use it to slot people in neatly, of course, but it doesn't matter. For example the phenomenon OP notices - lots of left-leaning people considering rationalists with suspicion or outright spiting them - is certainly real, even though there are obviously exceptions (I can think of one person I personally know myself who would count as one).

Both things can be true, but in politics, words matter. Even if the activists and zealots are a minority, they set the line. If they win, that is interpreted as a mandate from the masses for /all/ their platform. For another example look at Brexit. Did everyone in that 52% who voted for it want No Deal?

Sanders has actually had his fair share of critics exactly because he's more old-school in these respects. But it might be here the problem is that perhaps I'm saying "left wing" more in general and incorporating more groups that perhaps you'd class as "liberals".

The latter got IMO unfairly shafted by the whole supposed antisemitism scandal, though I also think he's not that great at communication - certainly worse than Sanders.

That way, by the usual mechanisms of polarisation, the concept of acting rationally instead becomes purvey of the right - who gets to scream "FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS!" in between ranting how climate change is a hoax, COVID is just a flu that's being exploited by Bill Gates to inject us all with microchips, Trump didn't lose but was a victim of a strange, elaborate and ineffable conspiracy and democrats have satanic pedophiliac orgies in the basement of a pizza parlor.

I mean, there is absolutely no question that the right is in practice the most detached from actual reality and rationality. And lo and behold, on lots of topics the left absolutely /does/ appeal to it, because well, it makes sense. But the general discourse is very emotion-focused on a lot of things, even when you could actually make excellent rational cases for the same things.

If all you tell me is “I feel this way!” I don't even know if you're telling the truth, and can't possibly check. Also even if you are, your feelings might be rooted in a faulty understanding of the world. Right now lots of Trump voters seem to feel that they won the election, should we give it to them because they're crying louder than anyone else?

  I think the problem there tends to be that a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged
#+end_quote

I would arguee it is more complex then that.

I would say fascism and communism both use simplified overly reductionist logic as well as highly emotive reasoning but I have yet to find a political ideology which does not use highly emotive reasoning.

​

with fascism, it simplifies the world by defining the nation-state and often race as fundamental things not as the human instotuces as well as that it ignors the indivule. in this way when a black man attacks a white man it is seen as as black attacks white not human attacks human and the success of the nation or race is proff of the suproty of the race not of luck or the actions of inducules and groups.

as well as that they ignore the idea of cooperation and focuses only on competition there for meaning that if another group exists it must be trying to attack you so it must be destroyed and that violence is the only real type of force.

​

with communism, it simplifies the world by defining government and business as fundamentally different with them believing that the people running the government would always think of the people first and never take actions to enrich them selfs.

as well as that they asume the world is a 0 sum system so takeing the money off the bissneman will not affect the the bissnamans production capspltiy.

​

all idolgeys have there simplifications and there are many more for both of these exmples.

​

I have yet to find a political ideology which does not use highly emotive reasoning.

what I mean by this is that even egalitarianisms base that all people have value and should be treated equally is a highly emotional statement.

What you're talking about is values and goals. But it's fine that values are not inherently rational, because you can't scientifically derive ethics. There's no absolute good or evil, so axioms such as “everyone is equal” still come from individual preference.

The problem I'm talking about is more in how matters are discussed and approached even beyond core values. All politics can use some emotional arguments, but what I find insidious is also rationalising their use by making up theories to justify it. When Ben Shapiro says “facts, not feelings” it's ironic because mostly he does /not/ follow that with actual facts, but it also shows that his public is very sensitive to the notion that they should give priority to reality over their emotions (they often are unable to do so, and that's their problem). While the left often plays with the notion that since facts are so filtered through subjective lenses, we might as well act like feelings are all we have.

****** The Rationalist community was born during the 2 years in which Eliezer Yudkowsky, author of [[http://www.hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], blogged daily, first on Robin Hanson's blog, [[https://www.overcomingbias.com/][Overcoming Bias]], then later on his own blog called LessWrong. These blog posts are known as /[[http://web.archive.org/web/20161111231754/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/index.php?title=Sequences&oldid=5863][The]] [[http://web.archive.org/web/20170327154113/http://lesswrong.com/lw/72m/an_epub_of_eliezers_blog_posts/][Sequences]]/, and form the foundation of modern rationality discourse. For more on Eliezer's backstory, please see [[https://old.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/iwu6wt/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/?limit=500#g6mns8z][my earlier comment]] on [[/r/CultureWarRoundup]].

A few years after Eliezer stopped blogging, LessWrong declined to the point of irrelevance and the community moved on to various other websites, an event known as the Rationalist diaspora. Scott Alexander (author of [[http://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]]), who had made a name for himself on LessWrong under the pseudonym Yvain, started a blog called [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200622131343/https://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]], which became /the/ major website of the diaspora. So popular was this website that it spawned it's own subreddit, [[/r/slatestarcodex]].

Like in a lot of other forums, political discussion started taking over the sub; the solution was to corral all political talk to a single recurring thread called the Culture War Thread, which quickly became the single most popular thread on the subreddit, accruing thousands of comments each week. Eventually, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20190222094427/https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/][under pressure from critics]] (most notably [[/r/SneerClub]]), Scott decided to evict the thread from the sub. Those who wanted to continue the thread created a new subreddit, [[/r/TheMotte]], where the thread continues to this day. You can think of it as the rationalist politics subreddit, much like this is the rationalist fiction subreddit.

And you didn't ask about this one, but since it will probably come up, [[/r/CultureWarRoundup]] is a competing alternative to [[/r/TheMotte]] created by users who were dissatisfied with the latter's moderation policies.

  Those who fetishize 'rationality' often end up holding a reductionist view of humanity, human relationships, and meaning. Human beings are more than the sum of their parts. We are more than just pain and pleasure receptors glued to a processing unit.

  But in believing that we are just that, many 'rationalists' end up with strange conclusions about what is possible and desirable for humanity as we are. And that sometimes results in a belief in progress regardless of the human cost. Because, if we'll all be better off in a hedonium, isn't Thiel's techno-libertarianism the best way forward? Of course, when confronted with a political reality where those ideas are alien, there is tendency to support the subversion of the established order towards the interests of great men (tech entrepreneurs) who share those ideals. And that (revolution + hierarchy) is the foundation of fascism.

Materialism, maybe, arguable. But polyamory ? If the people involved are happy there's no issue as far as I can see. This view that there's a right way to do things and anyone that doesn't follow that way is doing it wrong, regardless of how they feel or think is disturbing.

​

It reminds me of anti lgbt propaganda. "There's a right way to do things, if anybody disagrees they are wrong regardless of how they feel or think" and "their happiness has a cost, think of their parents, how they feel".

​

It's a shit argument. If your argument is that being happy is only right and proper when there are no costs associated with it, you are automatically a bigot, because it applies to everything. To racism (x race being happier makes some people less happy), to communism (less wealth inequality makes some people less happy)..

​

I might be interpreting it wrong but if that's your argument, I'm sorry but it's a terrible one.

** For transparency I used to be a regular visitor of r/ rational a few years ago, before I became a far more occasional visitor the last couple years.

A lot of the points made by others are likely true, although I can't speak to the alt-right infiltration personally.

One thing that kind of put me off the community is that there is a common culture of believing that rationality is the utmost standard to which all fiction should be held to, and some seemed to believe that the world as a whole should try and be understood through a mechanistic framework of pure logic. This used to appeal to me but as I changed I realized that this perspective was kinda irrational ironically.

The value of a story can come in a lot of different ways, and a lot of rational fiction can be bad from a storytelling perspective and a lot of irrational fiction can be great as they can create circumstances which have great emotional resonance. I think in part this dislike of this community comes from the exclusionary culture.

As a general paradigm this overall cult of rationality leads to this weird notion that other paradigms are inherently inferior. For science and an understanding of probability the rational paradigm is very useful, an openness to critique and the actual essays on cognition that Yudowsky writes are interesting to think. But swathes of the community I found had a preoccupation with rationality to the exclusion of the kind of common sense conclusion that you have to understand people as emotional, and that sometimes speaking with facts and logic without a consideration for the personal aspect of it comes across as callous, and occasionally ridiculous. Like critiquing someone in a story or in real life for making an emotional mistake as irrational and they should never make such mistakes shows a lack of emotional self reflection imo because we are all susceptible to such mistakes, and if you think you aren't, you are likely making more of them. A lot of people, unfortunately the loud vocal ones which might go to other communities, didn't think of rationality as a way of trying to overcome human's naturally irrational heuristics through careful consideration, but like spacebattles logic, the application of being smarter than everyone else to in order to become more correct, speedrun god-hood in stories and be better than others.

This problem is kinda exacerbated as a lot of the community seemed to use the mark of being a 'rationalist' as an in group, affirming these 'smart' qualities with the community and gaining a sense of identity in it. It makes sense how others outside the community would identify this sort of personal callousness and derision for anything which isn't 'rational' (often meaning 'optimally smart') and associate it with the community.

I don't think this is a fair characterization of the points which Yudowsky himself often makes on less wrong, or everyone in this community, but I do think that it is understandable how such an impression comes about.

Sadly, that's what most outsiders seem to think when they hear about the rational crowd.

At it's best, rational is a system of tools and characteristics to write and analyze the logical consistency of a world and character's actions given the details of a specific scenario. Usually though, that kind of story has a lot of other things going for it as well, and readers outside the rational crowd rarely credit our tools and techniques. So we're judged by our worst.

In fact, the whole shtick of rational fiction is to go up a level and view the fictional world in a meta way, and analyze how consistent this world is and how much the "narrative god" interferes (or needs to interfere) to make a good story. We then value this consistency and lack of "narrative force", alongside traditional literary virtues. Of course, if someone doesn't share our values, they would not benefit from our community.

I don't think that's really what the spirit of rational writing should be (this was heavily discussed some time ago when the definition of rational fiction was debated and updated). I know I have no problem having my characters make plenty of mistakes if it fits their personality and the situation. I think what really happens a lot of the time is that people find it hard to believe someone would make THAT specific mistake which also happens to be tremendously plot convenient. It's in the end all to do with suspension of disbelief. To make a recent example - in Queen's Gambit, Beth Harmon losing a match because she got hung over the night before due to her poor self control and being easy to sway and so played less than optimally is not unbelievable. Beth Harmon losing a match because she forgets that rooks move in straight lines would be, no matter how many emotions are involved - that seems something that should be so deeply baked into her brain, it's second nature.

Beyond that, one of those people is an up and coming engineer/project director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and he could barely stop laughing long enough to mock Yudkowsky's ai theory institute.

I'm not sure whether my small sample size means more than lots of people on reddit, but that's my experience of people hating on the rationalist community.

As far as the actual writing goes, I think that when a story gets really pretentious and purports to do something like demonstrate methods of rationality then it has to pass a higher bar, or it is judged more harshly. Scenes like the one where quirrel reaches harry to lose, or Yudkowsky's rape play in three worlds collide, become serious black marks in those stories not because other things we read don't have those elements, but because the person writing them says they're supposed to be edifying.

  Scenes like the one where quirrel reaches harry to lose, or Yudkowsky's rape play in three worlds collide, become serious black marks in those stories not because other things we read don't have those elements, but because the person writing them says they're supposed to be edifying.
#+end_quote

I mean, to me everything involving Quirrell in HPMOR sounds like it has to be taken always with a pinch of salt. It's not that the lesson Quirrell teaches - knowing when to fold 'em, so to speak - isn't valuable. It's that he teaches it in an exceedingly violent way, and there's always evil undertones to all he says and does. And the "evil" element here isn't nullified by the fact that Harry benefits from it.

Personal experience: I've gone through a hazing process once. Nothing quite that humiliating, but still would count as bullying by common metrics. I think personally I actually have benefited from it in that specific circumstance, as in, it did force me to come out of my shell and it did help me integrate better with the ones who were undergoing it with me and so on. However some other people also broke under it, and quit altogether. Basically the point isn't "hazing is bad because it hurts everyone", nor "hazing never works". Hazing /does/ work with a certain percentage of people, that's why initiation rituals have been a thing for millennia. The point is what happens to those with whom it doesn't. For the most violent, extreme forms of hazing, this can mean even physical harm, not to mention the psychological one. That's what makes Quirrell's methods questionable - not the lesson, nor the fact that they can't possibly work. He does what he does because if it succeeds he's happy, and if it fails he doesn't give a fuck if Harry is hurt by it.

***** The points you've made aren't the problematic ones. I like a lot of the ideas and methods bandied about between harry and quirrel, and remembering to lose or to appear to lose is a genuinely useful technique I've used in my own life.

But the scene itself is constructed out of painfully juvenile delusions, much like a lot of hpmor. I would relate it to an anime like Baki or a show like The Boys, where the driving force of the narrative is masculine inferiority complexes. To me, when I tried to explain that scene out of context, it quickly became apparent that the power of that scene came from exploring different facets of what it meant to feel weak as a child, and not in a healthy or constructive way. It was a weird power fantasy.

And again, it's not that there aren't other things I digest with similar constructions, but when you're as pretentious as Yudkowsky gets with HPMOR, then building your story out of weird juvenile power fantasies becomes a more glaring flaw than I view it in Supernatural or Batman.

edit: also, what you're talking about with gazing isnt what harry goes through. He's not a pledge in a frat or a new recruit with a squad, it's focused on just him. It doesn't help him integrate better with anyone, within the story it's part of quirrells plan to build him up and build him apart. The way quirrells keeps on calling him dangerous and telling everyone hjpev is the next dark lord. So there may be some value in hazing, but that is the exact opposite of what the story was doing in that scene.

I'm not sure how that appears in that specific scene? I mean, I get the general criticism - HPMOR owes a lot to Ender's Game, after all, which has a lot of the same traits - but not in that one, unless you mean the power fantasy is the ability to just stand there and take all that abuse without breaking down.

Then again, Harry Potter itself is a power fantasy. HPMOR still has that DNA.

#+begin_quote
  what you're talking about with hazing isnt what harry goes through
#+end_quote

I know, but of course I haven't gone through anything quite like that, so I just used a comparison. Hazing is usually humiliation for the sake of creating bonds - those who go through it are connected by the solidarity of fellow victims sharing a common experience. What happens to Harry is more humiliation for the sake of breaking his pride, forcing him to swallow his instinct to react. The scene itself could be constructed differently or written better here and there, but as a concept I think is one of the strongest of the story, exactly because of how it pits Quirrell and Harry's philosophies one against each other, and because of the cognitive dissonance between the lesson and the way it's taught. Another one would be Quirrell's speech, in which he genuinely makes good points about unity and willingness to fight while also scarily sounding like a fascist. The only synthesis I can find for that is that the good kind of unity is the one that emerges spontaneously out of personal responsibility and willing cooperation: those who lack that ability are either condemned to be broken up and defeated, or be united against their will by a tyrant. But it's certainly an interesting moment and it does force one to engage with the reason why some "dark side" ideas are actually so fascinating and ever returning. It's not enough to say "these ideas are evil and shouldn't be spoken of!" to exorcise them: in fact, sometimes that simply means you let them creep on you until it's too late while you willingly pretend they aren't there or are just irrational ramblings of a few fanatics.

******* I wrote up more than I probably should've and then tried to post with reddit down =[

So in brief, the primary juvenile power fantasy in play here is 'im so dangerous that I can't fight back without killing them' which helps small children being victimized, turning their weakness and fear into power and resolve, but it is an egregious example of a theme that runs throughout HPMOR. I have no issue with the lesson about losing, and if I encountered this scene in a YA novel about, say, a farm boy who's sent to the royal academy before he kills the evil court magician to save the king's life, I wouldnt blink. But HPMOR and it's author embrace some really pretentious, lecturing BS about teaching people the true power of rationality, and this theme of juvenile power fantasies hits below the mark they set themselves, or maybe communicates too much about who is writing this and who it's for.

I actually like most of quirrells input, if you removed his desire to murder people he thinks are dumb I don't think he'd count a villain, even voldemort would be preferable to most real world hierarchies if he were a shade less irredeemably evil. I have no issue with the examination of uncomfortable moral landscapes.

I also don't see what ideological clash you're referring to in this scene, harry and quirrells are on the same page that harry has a problem and quirrells has a solution.

This is, surprisingly, less than I wrote the first time. Also, you might be interested in the novel Inda by Sherwood Smith. It's a really good 'children learn to fight' novel that I think is probably palatable to the /rational/ crowd, and it has a lot of the sort of hazing scenes you were describing.

True, though Harry being a wizard, and Hogwarts a school where young children get given a deadly weapon and taught to use it... realistically, the body count in those books is much lower than it ought to be. Bullied children COULD totally kill because all it takes is the right spell hitting by surprise. And Harry does have some creativity. I feel like the issue there is that part of the conceit of the story is /also/ to explore the "what if we actually take magic to its logical consequences" idea and that inevitably makes it ridiculously deadly.

Rationalist is really a very small genre, with only a handful of entries: HPMOR, Worth the Candle, Pokemon OotS are the most prominent. Looking at the SB thread which I believe you are referring to, looks like a lot of the issues are just generally with the "rational" tag or its use in titles, and only a small handful of people who are actually talking about rationalist fiction.

Scott Alexander of Slatestarcodex identifies as left-of-center... but seems unfamiliar with and/or incapable of actually properly steel-manning basic leftist thought and literature (to be fair, the left-right divide in the US skews so heavily right that Scott identifying as center left isn't dishonest). This in turn skewed the Overton Window of the SSC discussion in a weird way, which combined with the ideals of discourse of SSC (charity, taking weird ideas seriously) led to the Nazi/alt-right infestation before several steps were eventually taken that caused the alt-righter to spin off into themotte.

As for other examples of stuff they make fun of... lot of lesswrong-adjacent Silicon Valley tech bros. Common reasons to make fun of them include: anti-academia viewpoints (startup founders are the real innovators and the background research done in academia is meaningless), idiotic libertarian views (failing at basic economics and empathy), and in general stupid ideas which they view as genius (thinking that being an entrepreneur makes them an all around expert in humanities and unrelated fields of science).

The stereotype of a basement dwelling nerd without any real world experience inventing wish fulfillment to salve a easily bruised ego is what you come up with when you want to make fun of this place not where the grievance came from. Especially since the primary antagonist of this story is a psychiatrist with a philosophy major. The actual reason is much stupider.

Back in the heyday when big Yud wrote HPMOR fanfiction was in a very different place. There are reams of text demonizing the guy for accepting donations (it was going to cause all fanfiction to get shut down and deleted from the internet by the copyright holders) before Patreon made that a thing normal people are allowed to do and most of the rumors about him running a doomsday cult start thereabouts.

Also I don't know if you've noticed HPMOR is very snide calling people who liked the original out for the various moral hypocrisies of the at the time considered totally wholesome novel by progressive icon JK Rowling. The idea that only smart people are moral -> Yudkowsky running a nazi eugenics program is probably down to that more than anything that happened later.

People periodically make serious posts and are reminded by the mods that sneerclub is primarily about what is funny and not for serious discussion. The serious discussion goes on, because there isn't really a place for counter-rationalist thought elsewhere, but it isn't the goal of sneerclub.

As to the stereotype... I see lots of posts on sneerclub linking Twitter threads by Silicon valley entrepreneur types with completely stupid takes on things outside their expertise, so this view doesn't rely on stereotypes alone. And yes occasionally EY has a bad or weird take that gets linked. His posts on GPT-3 seem to misunderstand how it actually works so much so to make one question his knowledge of AI as a field or to speculate that he was being intentionally alarmist.

As for the view on HPMOR, I recall several sneerclub threads with highly upvoted posts pointing out that HPMOR ends with Harry slaughtering a bunch of Fascists, so the people that care are aware that EY didn't intend to promote Neo-Nazis initially and that it's a more organic unintended outcome.

Some of the hate for HPMOR does focus on the way it seems to sneer at the whimsical world building of Harry Potter, but I think that form of hate is primarily found in spacebattles and HPfanfiction and not in sneerclub.

Taking SSC as a particular example: you have a broad readership whose "center" is roughly around where Scott is. (Scott's position is reasonably close to the median user of reddit/blog platforms, so difficult to determine causality here.) But his most popular work is long-form critiques of certain culture war SJ issues - valuable to the center-left in an academic sense, but viscerally appealing to folks quite a bit further to the right. The skew propagates into deeper levels of engagement, so you get an interesting asymmetric decoupling between "likelihood of agreeing with Scott" and "likelihood of sticking around Scott's blog".

Or to piggyback on jtolmar's comment and phrase it a different way: audience size tracks total revenue, and it turns out that AAA games make more money /per developer/ than indies. The audience is weighted towards and reflective of an Author's most high-profile work, which is under no obligation to be most reflective of the Author's position.

No such thing happened. Self-identified gamers at that time had a high rate of being past bullying victims (by now the label has been mainstreamed enough that it's less true, but the rates are probably still elevated), and reacted to Gamergate as another instance of the popular mainstream bullying them. (This may not have been true at the very beginning, I'm unsure, but it was correct within a week.) Gamergate was a defensive reaction to a gaming /press/ which was (and still is) dismissive of its audience and what they care about.

To the extent there is any 'reactionary' undercurrent in gamer culture, it was not revealed by GG, but /created/ by it. Snooty leftists insisted that they couldn't have any reason for disliking the status quo except being bigots. It is unsurprising that people who were bullied and tarred as bigots for daring to express contrary opinions had a meaningful number of people decide that if this is all it takes to be declared a bigot, maybe bigots aren't nearly as bad as their reputation. And if they're welcoming and the only people willing to say "Fuck, you didn't deserve that", it is unsurprising if some of them stay in those circles and drift closer to them in beliefs over time.

Um, no they don't? And even if they did, the behavior of people in general is a terrible predictor of the behavior of people with Dark Triad traits. Manipulators lie about their motivations as easily as they breathe. When a manipulative narcissistic abuser either wants to be rid of their victim or they can feel their victim beginning to escape, they'll make up all sorts of lies about how they're the real victim and how their victim is the real abuser.

It's plainly evident that Gamergate began as a classic smear campaign, with Gijoni's attempt to recruit flying monkeys ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_monkeys_(popular_psychology)]]) to attack his victim quickly spiraling out of control into a movement.

******** This is 100% nonsense. Gamergate literally began as a harassment campaign targeting women involved in gaming that evolved out of another harassment campaign targeting one specific woman involved in gaming, and it remained (and to the extent it still exists, continues to remain) nothing but a harassment campaign orchestrated by channers.

Literally everything in your post is just the usual justifications for the vicious hate campaign masquerading as concerns about ethics in gaming journalism that were unleashed on every woman in sight. Fuck that shit, and let nobody here be misled, it is rank nonsense to the point where even Wikipedia doesn't give it any thrift.

Zoe Quinn was not a victim, but a sociopathic abuser.

********** TL;DR to any readers out there, this is vile bullshit and you should read this instead: [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gamergate]]

.

Gamergate began with Gjoni literally inciting and helping coordinate a harassment campaign under the meme-guise of BurgersAndFries targeting not only Zoe Quinn and anyone who defended her but the completely unrelated Anita Sarkeesian. When this turned out to not be a wildly successful movement in the eye of gaming culture (though it was successful in ruining several peoples' lives) he and a bunch of TiA/KiA/4chan /pol/ shitbags managed to broaden and rebrand it.

You're not wrong that to a lot of people it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with the targets of the vicious ire of the "movement", nor that it was "fringe media" (in the form of /pol/ and some of the vilest subreddits of Reddit) who primarily signal-boosted him (though, like, TotalBiscuit wasn't exactly fucking fringe media), but that's not because he was righteous nor is it because he didn't have "voice to complain".

The "real problems" and "real offenses" boil down to "some people, almost all women, who exist in the games and games-adjacent space exist and are outspoken".

It "got out of hand on both sides" in much the same way that a bunch of Nazis starting shit at a punk bar gets out of hand on both sides; there was on one side vile, reprehensible, coordinated behavior, and on the other side there was angry opposition by people who didn't want the vicious, toxic assholes to win. Hint: GamerGate is the Nazis in this allegory, and Anita Sarkeesian is the person who they first targeted, and I'm the cranky guy drinking whiskey and yelling at the neo-Nazi sympathizer, who is you.

  the completely unrelated Anita Sarkeesian
#+end_quote

Sarkeesian wasn't involved until she specifically involved herself. Because she's a opportunist who follows the adage "all publicity is good publicity". Which is usually true, and /was/ true in this case; she raised her profile significantly and ultimately profited substantially. From an effectiveness standpoint, it's impressive, and she only took mildly morally distasteful actions to do it, not anything morally repugnant, so she earns some degree of plaudits. (That's counterbalanced by her failure to deliver on her promises for /Tropes vs. Women/, which is more severely morally distasteful. She did not put a good faith effort toward producing them at the promised rate and depth, and regardless of how valuable you think they are, that's scorn-worthy.)

The same cannot be said of Quinn, who is an out and out sociopath, as is pretty clear if you read Gjioni's original file of the messages where she abused the shit out of him. If you didn't, when she then for her next trick fabricated a mentally disabled elderly man persona and used it as a pen name to write [[https://www.chucktingle.com/][wildly popular absurdist gay erotica]]? That really should have been a hint.

Eron tried to publish those messages and other evidence of the abuse with gaming news sites. When that didn't work he tried gossip rags. When /that/ didn't work he resorted to channers. Was this probably a bad call that would predictably lead to nastiness? Yeah, in retrospect it was. Most likely it was predictable beforehand that it would lead to more people harassing Quinn for unrelated things than to his actual cause getting advanced. But if /you're/ abused and the people giving your abuser a platform refuse to help /you/, I doubt you'd do any better. If you're lucky, it won't blow up into a household name (/that/ part definitely wasn't predictable).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The real offenses were that Zoe Quinn *abused the shit out of Eron Gijoni*. The real problems were, and are, that the gaming press derides things that the historical core gamer culture likes and praises experimental games-in-name-only like DepressionQuest, and that the historical nerd subcultures have been increasingly under entryist attack (rarely malicious, usually well-intentioned, but attack nonetheless) from mainstream cultures, which threaten to take away the safe spaces for spergy people (/mostly/ men) and make those spaces follow the mainstream social norms which those people joined the subculture to get away from. These problems are related via the gaming press mostly being composed of that category of entryist.

[[/r/rational]] is overwhelmingly centered around fanfic and web serials (mostly LitRPGs). There's very little in the way of mainstream (in the sense of "published by a major publishing house") fiction discussed on this sub.

The difference in polish levels and quality is massive, and most of the sub comes off as thinking that the mediocre-but-entertaining stuff that's our usual fare (which I enjoy, don't get me wrong!) possesses a degree of excellence past what it really does. I don't mean that the [[/r/rational]] folks should go read through the NYT Most Important Books of Whatever Year, that shit is absolutely awful, but any given year's Hugo Best Novel nominees are overwhelmingly likely to be better than any of the stuff we rave about.

So we've got a community that grew out of a mediocre (and extremely condescending, in the "I don't need to know the canon to know it sucks" way that is so widely despised) fanfic, and leaving aside all of the other, shitty/asinine communities we may or may not be associated with, we overwhelmingly discuss works of fiction that not only belong in genres which are treated with enormous disdain, these works of fiction aren't all that well executed, particularly in terms of editing/polish.

Combined with the fact that anyone at the end of a bell-curve is a minority, and that the favored target of "SneerClubs" mentioned in previous comments like to target things which exhibit an emotional reaction from them (such as what is mentioned above) and this community receiving hate seems kinda obvious to me.

But the comments sections of LOTS of websites are completely toxic. To a far far far greater extent than I'm willing to believe goes on in the SSC comments (if for no other reason than that SA /will/ ban people occasionally, which many websites don't do), and yet those sites don't get called out for "having a nazi problem" (probably because most people know better than to pay attention to the comments).

If the problem in the comments is as you describe, then a much more standard "hey if you go there, be wary of the comments section" would be a more fair warning than claiming that SSC as a whole "has a nazi problem".

I think it's also important to realize the connection the name has to the alt-right. Especially the "rational thinkers" on youtube who are all alt-righters and often a gateway for young men to those ideas. The idea of rationalist fiction as a gateway to radicalize young men is something someone puts forward in the SneerClub link (re: Yudowsky's writing specifically). I think in part because of this.

On the one hand I can see it. Authors don't often respect the ideas put forward by feminist critique, this is especially obvious when the author appears to barely have a surface level understanding of the literature. And a more blatant omission when the modern understanding of culture is completely lacking from the work. Which is an obvious failure of attempting to be rational (at both a surface level, and a deeper level, that it's probably hard to deconstruct tropes without proper cultural context). Which leads into the "I am very smart" trope, and blatantly missing ideas of soft power and bias in society.

On the other, the critique feels like a failing of "don't ascribe to malice, that which can be ascribed to stupidity". A lot of authors in this space are not professionals (the fact it's a lot of fanfiction proving the point), and in fact a lot of amateur media has these problems, and often a lot more implicit. I'd point to the overall shittiness that is most romantic fan fiction, and the professional works of the genre like Twilight and 50 Shades (a comparison I make in part because progression fantasies / litRPGs are the trashy literature genre aimed at masculinty (of which rational is often a sub-genre); in much the same way people view romance literature as that for femininity). Both genre's most popular authors are not great on these issues, and both have popular novels which are. Which returns to my point about most people just not being educated on the topic.

It's hard to talk about because it is part of the "culture war". So to me critiques like this ring hollow, especially when they attack how characters' internal thoughts are presented. I feel like the better parts of the genre are closer to hbomberguy's critique of the youtube rational thinkers: maintaining the persona, while changing the content. Which is to say hbomberguy comes off as a sort of cringe gamer pseudo-intellectual (this is his character) but uses it to counter people who often take that personality to talk about alt-right issues (in a way, a positive role model for that character). And I think part of what feels frustrating about these critiques is they draw a line between how authors in this genre present characters and the ideas it is often used to present. Which can be frustrating when, as a reader of the genre, I often identify with the way the characters are being presented (and I recognize the inherent bias that comes with that identification; the lack of emotionality relating back to toxic masculinity's suppression of displaying emotion; but some works use this to their advantage to display the bias). To say nothing of the inter-sectional problems such critiques often fail to be cognizant of (neuro-atypicalness; nerds/populars; etc.).

I don't know the answer, but I avoid the topic in general because it appears to be a culture war problem, where neither side seems to have taken a women's studies nor an anthropology class (nor the honest self-directed educational equivalent). It's basically just people shouting at each other. Hence why my personal view is to ignore the vague aspersions of hate, enjoy what I enjoy, and engage with people one on one if the topic comes up.

**** One thing I've found is that the concept of "hard men making hard choices" tends to be quite appealing to both the right wing and certain parts of the rational community; the line of thought that led to the Mỹ Lai massacre is the same sort of thing that led to The Cold Equations or that part in HPMOR where Harry talks about using the bones of Hufflepuffs to kill people.

Often it feels like people get addicted to the concept of making hard choices, to the point where they don't realize that failure may be the best path forward.

******* The same thing happens every few years with a different movie. The 70s had Taxi Driver. The 80s had Gordon Gecko. The 90s had Goodfellas. The early 2000s had American History X and The Wolf of Wall Street. (Lotta Scorsese here) Recently there was Joker. All these movies regularly get accused of supporting viewpoints that even a cursory viewing of the film would make obvious they don't.

Despite what so many people on the internet believe, audiences are usually savvy enough to understand satire. The people who support nazi shit with Tyler Durden or Travis Bickle quotes are generally doing so based on out-of-context quotes, sound bites, or YouTube videos.

The problem is that no matter how small the percentage of people who misinterpret the movie are, they will post their shit everywhere, and people will respond by accusing the creators of misleading the audience or "glorifying" the villain.

Of course there are people who put these villains on pedestals, but that's true of /all/ halfway-decent villains. After all, they did the same thing with the Heath Ledger's Joker and Hannibal Lecter who are much more obviously evil villains.

The truth is that if evil were never likeable or relateable, almost no one would be evil. In reality, people don't generally do evil for no reason. They do evil because they think it's right or cool or it will give them purpose or take away their pain.

My problem with that kind of criticism is that it discourages writers from writing 3-dimensional villains for fear of too many people agreeing with them. It's Poe's Law taken to the logical extreme.

**** I don't think [[/r/rational]] was especially bad, but the Slatestarcodex culture war thread got really bad. As in people posting the 14 words paraphrased or even rarely not-so-paraphrased and getting upvoted and serious discussion. They stopped having culture wars thread so the people that liked them started themotte which is even worse.

As to why this happened... several factors

- discussion norms focused on principle of charity and steel-mannning even heinous ideas let alt-righter and crypto fascists get a foot hold. See argentstonecutters linked Twitter thread why this is a bad idea.

- Scott Alexander presents himself as left-of-center but fails at understanding and/or steel manning leftist ideas, while simultaneously doing a really strong steel-manning of far right ideas like Neoreactionary ideals and libertarian ideals even if he nominally disagrees with them. For another example his infamous “You are still crying wolf” post about Trump which explained how Trump was basically a standard Republican, not as a take down of Republicans but as a defense of Trump (even though Scott acknowledged Trump was a bad president). Because of course to Scott the real problem was that negative media about Trump made his patients feel worried as opposed to the actual bad stuff Trump was doing. Overall Scott's pattern of hot takes like this skewed the Overton Window of SSC to the right in a way that made alt-righters feel like Scott was secretly on their side.

As for spacebattles... things which are popular often develop a backlash fueled hatedom on spacebattles. For instance they had a Let's Read of Worm in which discussion of it mixed up details and mistook fanon for WoG and vice-versa and used this to justify hating on Worm more. HPMOR was immensely popular so it also got a lot of backlash hatred that failed at reading comprehension (or didn't even try the source material they hated).

My problem with this is, it's not like the alternatives work especially better. The approach "we don't talk about this; and if you say anything that sounds remotely like this we'll shun you on principle without even deigning you of an explanation as to WHY we think your ideas are wrong" also produces pretty bad effects. It's how right wing ideas got to pose as "counterculture" and as "this is the stuff the liberal élite doesn't want you to know" and so on. Frankly I have a general feeling that looking for this or that cause of the rise of the alt-right in the way we conduct discourse is a bit of a moot point. The real causes are probably rooted in much deeper issues - economic and social transformations, as well as the memory of WW2 just getting further and further away - and everything else is simply accidental.

#+begin_quote
  I had always assumed most leftist groups sucked because they were primarily made of stoner college kids and homeless people, two demographics not known for their vast resources, military discipline, or top-notch management skills.
#+end_quote

And his book reading has led him to the equally uncharitable alternative conclusion

#+begin_quote
  But S&W believe they suck because they choose to suck, for principled reasons.
#+end_quote

Scott then goes on to acknowledge that the book fails to justify basic leftist thought since it is actually aimed at leftists, but then fails to steel man the book by considering it in the context of leftists thought.

Scott concludes with a handwavey dismissal

#+begin_quote
  I know the arguments in this space. I know people wonder “what if the benefits of utopia only go to the rich?”. Or “what if letting people have their own private visions of utopia means elites can shape the future?”. Or “when some people don't have health care, doesn't spending money on utopian visions seem irresponsible?”. Or a thousand other different things.
#+end_quote

In which he fails to actually steel man these arguments for the purpose of reviewing the book.

From someone that is willing to steelman extremes like Neo-reactionary thought, this lack of steelmanning is a serious over sight.

You have assumed the consequent. You presume that Alvarez is a representation of leftism because you believe Scott cannot interpret leftism charitably enough to understand it. If you don't have that assumption, you would have no reason to associate Alvarez and leftism at all.

Alvarez is quite literally a rebel without a cause, or better [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause][Rebel Without A Cause]] since he is deliberately, specifically acting as the heroic rebel protagonist of a movie. He is leftist only insofar as American pop culture identifies the rebellious underdog as stereotypically anti-rightist. If there is any lesson to be drawn from him, it's that the prospect of radical change without a clear goal ought to terrify everyone, which is a centrist point of view, not an anti-leftist one.

It is no surprise that Scott does not like leftists very much, so quoting places where he expresses his negative feelings (the former) or the /authors of the reviewed book/'s feelings (the latter) are not actually demonstrating uncharitable behavior. He gives them an even-handed discussion and charitable reading /despite/ personal dislike. It wouldn't even be particularly laudable if he didn't; being charitable to things you agree with is easy.

I could probably find one or two examples were the 14 words are stated out right. I could find lots of examples of the 14 words and other White Supremacist talking points heavily paraphrased and buried in thousands of words... for instance you typically you find phrases like “Western Culture” used as code for “white”.

On the old culture war threads they often hid their power level (using enough code phrases and euphemisms that you needed to already know the lingo to realize what they were actually saying), but in themotte it is more blatant.

How about a good one? Your first example that you're implying is a white supremacist is someone who is rejecting the validity of racial categories altogether, but criticizing someone else for being inconsistent in rejecting racial tribalism.

The second example is a Sneerclub link to a comment that was deleted by the moderators. I don't see the claimed line quoted in the Sneerclub thread.

The third one is a hypothetical from someone who explicitly rejects that position, which prompts discussion and counter-argument.

Honestly, if those are the best examples from the last 4 years, in a community that averages 4k comments per week, that would seem like strong evidence that the "Nazi problem" is somewhere between "wildly overblown" and "imaginary". As the saying goes, if you can hear the dog whistle, you're the dog.

Just in case you are willing to change your mind

Here another comment with some moderate racism in the initial comment and some really racists responses. Instead of concluding that IQ is a crappy, culturally biased measure of intelligence, commenters came up with some hard mask-off racists responses:

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/f53qhm/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_february_17/fi1oa0h/]]

Among the highlights in the comments...

someone that doesn't understand IQ or the effects of colonialism (36 upvotes):

#+begin_quote
  The countries with average IQs below 80 on that map are exclusively in Africa and not part of the Arab League, minus Mauritania and Sudan. None of them have accomplished anything in modern history, save for the infrastructure built by colonial powers. They're mostly concentrated at the bottom of the current HDI rankings.

  Having an IQ of 80 makes it hard to function in Western society because there are elevated minimums for economic/marriage viability. It doesn't mean that a society of 80 IQs can't feed themselves. How do you think /any/ country's populace survived in an unbroken chain from single-celled organisms? Fitness and IQ in nature are not correlated. What's the IQ of a penguin?
#+end_quote

and another highly upvoted comment:

#+begin_quote
  So 70 IQ children of elite whites tend to have syndromes and are ostracized, while 70 IQ lower class black children can have the same level of abstract thinking but still socialize as mostly normals.

And someone points out the actual answer and only gets 9 upvotes, with a disagreeing response getting more.

No, that's your failure, along with the followup. This really isn't appropriate to argue in detail in this subreddit, so I'll just note that you managed to misunderstand the claims being made, or speculated in both quoted comments. The selective editing speaks of bad faith, too.

The third one, whatever it's correctness, is not actually a good post by the sub's standards; the first half is just reiterating one of the very claims being argued, and the second half is a mod-baiting insult that doesn't even try to make an argument.

I understand that that kind of low-effort swiping is fine at Sneerclub, or most of the rest of the internet, but themotte is at least trying to be better. For example, consider the /very next reply/, which highlights a problematic implication for that "actual answer".

This goes all the way up to the top. This is how Scott Alexander himself moderates as well. I don't think it's ill will. I think it's naive optimism about how humans work. But the results are rather disastrous.

I once got banned from the old Slatestarcodex for calling someone a failure of a human being. The person I responded to, who was saying we should shoot ships of immigrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and then let the survivors drown, faced no consequences.

***** Scott Alexander started out as fairly left-wing, but in recent years has been becoming more and more libertarian. I think this is a case of the fan base influencing the author. As you and others have pointed out, his social media channels got infested by nazis. But they also got invested by libertarians, and while the nazis have been mostly pushed out, the libertarians are still there, and they rule the place.

It's a real shame. His writing is still excellent in most cases, but whenever he talks about politics these days, libertarian bullshit pops up more and more often.

But if infohazard just means "things some people won't want to know / see" then a simple spoiler tag would suffice. There's absolutely nothing wrong with posting Harry Potter spoilers, as long as you mark them as such.

And it still makes absolutely not sense why a piece of Scott Alexander writing would qualify as an infohazard.

Of course, that just means that I have no choice but to speculate as to your motivations die not posting that link.

Not at all! If you try and think of "infohazards" by wracking your brain for things that pattern-match to creepypasta, you're probably going to draw a blank. If you instead look for places where societies take steps to control the dissemination of specific pieces of information, you can find all sorts of examples from banal spoiler warning to deadly-serious classification systems.

You noticed that I linked the republished version, right? The original version used to be hosted on a site Scott directly controlled, which has since been pulled offline. Think for a moment why Scott would do that, but leave the republished version online.

"The internet never forgets" laughably overstates the case, but the blogosphere is interconnected enough that there's a good chance any given notable work is reproduced pretty thoroughly somewhere. I'll go ahead and tell you that if you really care you can still find the original out there. I nonetheless decline to link it directly.

So, this is an enormously complicated subject that depends strongly both on what you're trying to keep contained and what kind of attention it's getting. The first question I'd ask you is: are you trying to roll your own crypto? Is this an idea that you're pulling from the best practices of the most successful entities with skin in the game, or are you trying to generate these strategies by yourself?

Skipping to the conclusion: for anything of real importance, various flavors of stonewalling absolutely /is/ the correct strategy. Standard SCGs go a step further than that, where the principle of collation holds that any collection of unclassified materials sufficient to determine classified information is itself actually classified.

Satisfying curiosity is a high-skill strategy when you're dealing with a particular individual you think you can outmaneuver, but it's unacceptably risky if you're dealing with either a large audience or with something you can't afford to leave to chance.

I wasn't aware of any entities of significant size actually DEALING with infohazard protocols. Normal classified information and secrecy really isn't the same thing at all, IMO; fundamentally different best practices apply when dealing with information that's genuinely harmful in its own right than when dealing with information that you'd just rather someone not have access to because it would hurt your position, especially when in the former case access to the information itself can't be easily controlled. And even if it is the best practice, neither you nor I have the capacity (unless I am very mistaken) to restrict access to information on an internet-wide scale, which inherently limits options with regards to total obfuscation.

That said, if you are aware of such organizations, I would certainly appreciate being informed.

I see where you're coming from, but disagree. The existing infrastructure/incentives are indeed mostly built around individual organizations (small groups all the way up to nation-states) restricting what would be detrimental for /them/ to be public knowledge, but in the case of context-independent infohazards each group will be likely to come to the same conclusion. If you're looking for a "pure" infohazard, look for the kind of info that the US classifies as soon as they can, that Russia desperately seek and then classifies, that China desperately seeks and then classifies, etc. Many such cases can be explained by the powerful seeking to maintain relative advantages, but there are a few instances where it's leaked far enough that relative advantage is no longer a plausible explanation.

One might wish that the response to that would be avoiding the information out of risk of it being an infohazard instead, but that doesn't seem very likely to me.

But in any case, even if we accept as a given that that would be the ideal course of action if possible, that doesn't seem especially relevant from the perspective of a situation in which the information is already available on the open internet, in my opinion, especially given that I (and presumably you) do not have the considerable resources a governmental organization does.

You miss the point of the article, then. /Giving the government power/ is a bad idea, because the government is usually stupid and intermittently evil (or less intermittently, depending on your standards; drone strikes and CIA coups are facts of life so there's a good case).

Also, there is nothing anti-libertarian about wealth redistribution; it's anti-ancap, but libertarianism and anarchocapitalism are not synonyms. Most means of wealth redistribution have side effects which libertarianism objects to, but the core principle is compatible, hence UBI.

This is it isn't it? This is the central error of libertarianism.

Libertarianism is the bastard child of American exceptionalism. It starts with the correct observation that the US government is often incompetent and often evil. It then assumes this must be true everywhere else on earth, since after all America is the greatest nation on earth, so it's impossible for any other place to be better. And of course it can't be changed either, because America is perfect.

I come from a very different place. A place bisected by large rivers, with large swaths of land below sea level. Nearly a thousand years ago my ancestors already realized that yes, I can build a dyke along the river, but that won't be any good unless my neighbor does the same. They realized that we're all in this together and we need each other to survive.

Government can be good or evil, competent or incompetent. But it's always essential.

Libertarians don't think that "Big Business" should be running the world. One of the common hobby-horses of libertarianism is regulatory capture, i.e. big business using government to suppress the free market, control the marketplace, and prevent or neuter competition. This is only possible because libertarian ideals don't have meaningful sway in the legislature or rules-making bureaucracy. If it was an uphill battle to get any new regulations passed, then it would be much harder to lean on regulators to change things to benefit existing firms and discourage new entrants.

But when all is said and done it's still a force of good. Life would be much worse without a strong central government. And when talking about the need for government people always talk making and enforcing laws, or about defending the nation. And those are important. But the real importance of government lies in the day-to-day bureaucracy. The making of policy on countless topics, the countless civil servants doing a thousand different things. Paying for schools, roads, parks, sewage systems, fire brigades and of course dykes.

Libertarians think you can just remove government and all of that will magically remain by the power of wishful thinking. At least that's what they say, that's their Motte. The Bailey is of course "I'm rich, screw everybody else".

************ No, libertarians think a lot of that isn't all that important, or is actively made worse by public management. And they have substantial basis for this. Schools are mostly a cross between prison and daycare - and the US isn't the innovator there, it's called the 'Prussian' model for a reason and remains more restrictive in Europe than here, and at least in Germany you can't even extract your kids from it; homeschooling is illegal and trying it gets you treated as a presumptive bigot. Park 'management' is a joke, and usually completely untethered to what the neighbors actually /want/. And for every useful bureaucrat protecting the public from something actually harmful, there are several more "protecting" them from something innocuous or actively helpful, like occupational licensing or life-saving medicine which hasn't been 'proven' efficacious. (A topical and egregious example: The EU is using the exact same data to decide whether to approve the COVID vaccine as the US did, but refuses to take action until Dec. 27. EU officials have outright stated that regulators are nearly certain to approve on the 27th, but won't take any preparatory steps for deployment before that date despite their confidence. Making the FDA look almost sane by comparison, which is rare.)

Libertarians are also, as I keep reminding you, not ancaps. /Reduce/ the government, not eliminate it. The Iron Law of Bureaucracy means that this is always difficult and never restful. If some portion of the government is removed and that goes very poorly, it will not be difficult to put it back; the history of private turnpikes, failed experiments which ended in the local governments buying them back, demonstrates this quite well.

The kind of people who post at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are far more likely to have been bullied at school than average; we all know how this game is played. Any rhetorical weapon, even if it's literally anti-bullying rules, is immediately weaponized by the powerful and against the powerless.

Speaking less hypothetically, a while back I posted that I didn't think Strong Female Protagonist is rational, and I got a comment back saying that it must be because "my politics" causes me to find it strange to see lesbian characters do good things. I found this to be incredibly baffling, and it was a little disturbing to see that sort of thing get upvoted. I don't think it's paranoid to think that casually slinging the word "Nazi" around is an attempt to move the overton window to a rather unpleasant place.

** It's a political/tribal reaction. Rationalism and by extension rational literature is [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/][grey tribe]]. To put it in short grey tribe is a cluster of personality traits of tech nerds: they're rationalist, highly online, atheist, not into sports, highly affluent, and so on... and these nerds like a particular brand of fiction.

Grey tribe is a subset of the general blue tribe (liberal umbrella group), but has been splitting away from it for some time for various reasons (too many to cover now). This accelerated after 2016. A prime example would be reddit going from from loving everything Elon Musk did to hating anything he does nowadays. Nobody can hate you quite like someone who shares /almost all/ of your views. For a parallel, think of how big and important the early 2000s atheism movement was, and now it's basically an unpopular shell that gets derided from both sides.

Back to rational and rationalist fiction, it's a hallmark of grey tribe so it gets attacked. Rational*ist* fiction is even explicitly evangelical of it's mode of thinking, which makes it more of a target. It was popular and accepted within blue tribe a decade ago because it had science and coherent stories, but times change. However, I should note that, it's not like humans are robots that get updates on marching orders. It takes time for the mobs to disseminate that something is uncool or 'problematic' in this case.

But it's a slow grind and likely won't reverse. Rationalists will keep disappearing, either joining blue tribe orthodoxy, sublimating over to red tribe, or learning to keep quiet about rationality.

That's because politics are downstream of culture and the same goes with literature.

** Having never encountered such a reaction, I am only making guesses. But from what I've seen, rational fiction tends to have a particular style of intelligence-based power fantasy to it which appeals to a different audience than your standard physical-based power fantasies. When done poorly, it is fairly grating to just about everyone; when done well, it is still grating to some.

Saying that rational fiction is a blight on the medium is like saying that any niche genre is a blight on the medium. Some would say fantasy itself is a blight upon literature; though less so nowadays.

The fact is, the smaller the niche, the less chance that it will produce consistent quality works. Most of us are amateurs, even if intelligent amateurs with a particular goal in mind, and 90% of everything is still going to be subpar.

It's just that when something is done loudly it attracts more attention, and like it or not this particular niche made quite a splash. More positive attention, more negative attention.

Perhaps because HPMOR is read by people not all that well versed in HP fanfictions, or perhaps because it is a smarter parody than others ... Of course, HPMOR is naive with its "science can save the blood purists" as they don't care about blood purity as evidenced by Voldemort, they care about subjugating the weaker muggleborns.

Anyhow, people don't like us thinking ourselves smarter than them and dismissing their favorite works as bullshit. They also don't enjoy rational fiction as much as normal fiction, as they don't appreciate the consistency and stuff, while the story tends to be weaker because there is only so much the author can deliver with their limited resources.

"Blaster bolts in Star Wars exhibit x/y/z properties, meaning they are likely laser beams exerting gigawatts every time they so much as nudge a character" ignores a lack of exhibited effects such as "the bolts clearly not being lightspeed" and "the bolts not turning people into fine mist" and is a bad explanation because of that. The average Star Wars user won't know exactly what the issue is, but they'll pick up that someone is waving smart where they aren't.

3. Some people just suck.

It's not 'rational' to blame ourselves for everything, guys. That's just reversed stupidity. The truth is, there's a lot of "those uppity liberal rational types think they're better than us and they need teaching a lesson" going on and I have no desire to steelman that.

(I should clarify that none of my annoyance here is directed at you CouteauBleu, and that your above reply is still true overall)

**** I've met people that don't like logic, history or facts. Like when we are talking about a show, I tell them "oh, did you notice? They have this technology advancement but they don't have this other one so it is very likely the story is taking place between x & y dates" but people usually just get angry at me and start saying that nobody cares, etc...

A lot of people don't like facts or logic (specially in fiction), that happens.

#+begin_quote
  There are reasons not to like rational fiction / the surrounding community that don't boil down to "people don't like logic".

Like what? Honestly having seen the attitude of this people, I can't think of anything else.

***** That sounds like "they don't like nitpicking", not "they don't like facts and logic". Honestly, I could imagine that annoying me, as well. You just need to make friends with people with a similar approach to these things.

That is also fair

But they don't need to be assholes about it, they can just say "Oh really? Ok" and then proceed to completely ignore whatever I had said. I think I would take the hint... Or they could be more polite while expressing it, like "ah cool but I don't really care about that kind of stuff so let's not talk about it", I've met people that say something like this and we just leave the topic alone and keep having a nice conversation instead of leaving me feeling down and with a horrible image of them.

**** Actually, I think these are *both* the problem; if you are smarter than someone, they will have instinctive animosity towards you because of that. If you act in any way which *implies* that you are smarter than them, they will have instinctive animosity at that as well (in this case, whether you actually are or not).

This subreddit existing is literally implying "we are two smart for regular fiction", and [[/r/VioletNaofumi]] 's example is also a perfect example of this; He didn't tell anyone they didn't like logic, he just applied it better (or implied he was doing it better) than those who took issue with that. The only solution to this animosity is not doing anything which someone can imply from that you are better than them at something (pretending to be dumb). And acknowledging that this is the case makes the same people madder and is the attitude that you mention.

My conclusion though, is simply by existing we will get hate, and by acknowledging we will get hate for it we will get more hate; Nether of these two do I think we should not do, "existing" and "not pretending to be dumb" will put people off, but are both the whole point of rationality.

I have a lot of friends and closer-than-friends who have told me they tbink I'm smarter than them but have no animosity. In my experience, claims like this tend to come not from the highly intelligent as a rule but from assholes who might happen to be highly intelligent.

****** I don't dissagree; it is a good character trait to not feel threatened by people who have certain skills which are better than yours. It doesn't change the fact that loosing in a game elisits negative feelings in most cases and perceived inteligence is especially touchy for many people. I guess I should not have used a board statement in this case, many people do not have animosity to someone suggested to be more intelligent than themselves, but many do, especially if there are other factors which they already dislike that person for (such as not sharing the same fiction tastes).

And ironically, I also agree that holding this perspective may be correlated with arseholeness. It doesn't make it any less true though.

Apologies

#+begin_quote
  my point was that a lot of people seem to dislike when we use logic in fiction...
#+end_quote

And I am expanding on the reason for this; many people don't like logic because they aren't *good* at applying it (which is perfectly normal to not like something you aren't skilled at).

There are plenty of people who are good at it but don't like it in fiction either, for whatever reason, but my point is that the former type of person will *also* feel threatened by someone else using it; hence the hate instead of just ignoring which the latter would be more likely do.

Note, I am not assigning negative traits to people not interested in "logic". E.g. I would also probably "not care" about some of the examples you gave such as "the story takes place between x and y dates" most likely because my memory isn't particularly strong and so I don't do well with trivia (and hence dislike/am not interested in it).

I mean, I guess? I have always thought that words should only mean what they say but... It is true, that it doesn't usually work like that... For example, I will sometimes say something like "X is not the best" (I have a problem with that word) to me it means: "X is not the best" but other people understand that I said "X is not good" which no! They are different! But it is just me having trouble with understanding how I should word my thoughts for other people...

** The Rationalist Movement doesn't have the best reputation online (unsurprisingly, most people get a little upset when they see a forum willing to debate Nazi Rhetoric), and that trickles down into how many people see rationalist fiction.

Its not just that a lot of people don't like HPMOR - its also that a lot of people also really, really don't like Yudowsky. The rationalist fiction movement is not something fully separate from the wider modern rationalist philosophy movement (and the politics that inevitably involved), especially because many people first discover the movement through fan-fiction. A surprising amount of SneerClub seems to be people who went pretty deep into the fiction/philosophy side of the movement before getting dissuaded by the politics, and that is reasonable; the entire character of Professor Quirrel in HPMOR does look different after you see some of the stuff that gets posted in TheMotte. The wider Rationalist 'movement' has seemingly decided to honor Free Speech over Moderation, and that's OK; but that does mean that the people who get to 'represent' rationalists online (especially in comment sections) aren't always going to be the 'the best', if you know what I mean, and that is going to affect how the average layperson sees rationalist fiction.

Plus the definition of rationalist fiction does feel, to many people, like a classic case of 'Not Invented Here' syndrome (another thing that is often a general critique of the rationalist movement that trickles down into critiques of rationalist fiction). Many people feel like the rationalist fiction community is just a bunch of STEM nerds who took concepts that already existed in literature (e.g the fair-play-whodunnit, among other things), gave it a new name and pretended like they invented it. I honestly believe the genre would not attract nearly as much vitriol if it was just called 'Fair Play' fiction or something along that lines - anything that gave some merit to the wider literary traditions that preceded it.

And to be absolutely fair, both of these common critiques do have merit, and are something we should think about as a community.
