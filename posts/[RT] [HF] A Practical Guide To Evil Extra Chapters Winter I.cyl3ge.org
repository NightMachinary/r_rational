** I think I understand why I like Hanno, and why he's the leader.

He is /the/ Chosen of Judgement, yet he holds no judgement in others.

**** I mean, he doesn't really NEED to judge, does he? He's got "people" to do that for him...

*** I think this is the first time (other than the flashback to before he was Chosen) that we've seen Hanno actually making decisions for himself. And he seems quite good at it.

**** Hanno always makes decisions. He does not pull the coin out that often and HE seems to decide when to pull it out. So no, he does not judge, but he chooses who is judged in the eyes of the heavens. Choosing what cases you bring in front of the judge is a very real form of power.

***** You may be right. I originally had a dislike of Hanno, as he seemed to have given up his free will, mindlessly flipping his coin and murdering whoever the Heavens said. But he seems to be more nuanced than that, now.

White Knight: *Stares at coin

White Knight: *Flips again

White Knight: *Stares
