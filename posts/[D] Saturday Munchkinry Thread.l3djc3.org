** I rewatched Chronicle, one of my favorite movies last night. It's a film about three high school seniors who gain telekinesis. The powers are pretty OP as far as something that's not in an already established superpower franchise.

By the end of the film they can fairly easily lift tons, fly, create full body force field protections strong enough to crash straight through buildings unharmed. The control over the telekinesis is also granular enough to build Legos. The power works like a muscle where the boys had to train up to get to this level otherwise they'd "tear" the muscle if they went over their limit too fast resulting in a headache and nosebleed.

As I was watching I kept thinking that I would love to have these powers but I couldn't think of a way to make use of them in real life. I'm an accountant but I certainly would not be if I had the power to do what they could.

So, the munchkinry task is this: if you got these powers how would you have a normal life with them living undetected while still using the powers to their full extent in your day to day life? Bonus points for keeping everything you do legal and morally honest.

*** Well, one thing is that having telekinesis that works on as fine a scale as described probably also means that you have an awareness of the area that you could affect. The question then is how far away your telekinesis can reach, then, because presumably you could use it as a sort of long-ranged proprioception that can reach around corners.

Wanting to remain undetected limits things a bit, but there are theoretically come jobs you could do legally and very efficiently without people noticing you have powers. The first thought that came to my mind was actually cleaning, or exterminating - you could detect hidden dirt, kill bugs from range, move objects, sweep dust, clean surfaces, and so much more with much less effort and time expended than normal. The reason I mention these jobs specifically are that you can often find an excuse to complete the jobs outside the vision of the people that hire you. ("Let me handle this sir, wasps are dangerous bastards that might attack you, and I only have the one protective suit."; "You enjoy your day out sir, your mansion will be cleaned by the time you get back." )

Little things, then. Cleaning, as mentioned. Any task that requires you to stand up can now be completed just by sitting down. I wonder if, given sufficient education about your own body and the trust of a medical practitioner, you could exercise yourself without actually doing exercise? Just using your telekinesis on yourself. Don't take my word on that one though, it's just idle musing.

You could make yourself fly, though, and I'm under the impression that doing that would be very fun.

Depending on how fine the telekinesis is, it might make artistic endeavours easier. Simply telekinetically move your ink/paint/drawing implement/digital input, and any limit on artistic ability due to technical aspects will be much lessened. This depends on exactly how it works, of course.

Any aspect of a job that's reliant on random sampling let's you apply your powers, actually. Checking bags, for example, at airport security. Even if you still have to check bags normally to keep your cover, it would be awfully convenient if you were able to telekinetically detect any contraband that actually existed, and managed to check those bags by chance.

Similarly, as a police officer, you could use your telekinetic sense to search for contraband passively as you drive, and exit your car to check with random passers by 'just to be sure'. What do you know, they have illegal substances or firearms on their person, hidden away! Could also sabotage mechanisms that could be plausibly sabotaged anyway. In the line of fire? Oh no, the guns pointed at you were jammed! Someone trying to run away, resist arrest? Seems they tripped and fell, how inconvenient for them! All by chance, of course, though you are somewhat lucky.

Safety inspector or quality control is a good job as well. Detect internal faults in machinery without the need for expensive equipment.

Perhaps being a doctor? On yourself, even if you don't do it for others. You can tell if a bone is bruised, broken, or unharmed. You could even set it, potentially, without having to stick your dirty mits in someone. When I put it like that, field medic might be more appropriate, given that people on the edge of death are less likely to notice that you didn't actually touch the needle you sewed up their wound with.

I'll leave it there - I'm sure others could also contribute

Wait a minute. We already have opposing muscles, constraints, etc. why aren't we doing this IRL??? Basically, you just have to repeatedly tense up and relax while laying in bed? I'd try it but I'm to lazy to exercise in the first place.

***** It works, but it's not very efficient. Forcing a muscle through a range of motion as you exert it tears the muscle fibers faster and more effectively than keeping the muscle static.

Yes, you could tense say your arm and hold it for a while, but the maximum you can tense your arm doesn't compare to the stress inflicted by moving a heavy weight with your arm.

Still, if you're too lazy to exercise traditionally, flexing all the muscles in your body while standing around or while in bed is certainly better than nothing.

From what was displayed in the film, it did look like each of them needed direct line of sight for just about every instance of their powers that they used. But if they did in fact have any sort of awareness of the objects in that range they would jump several magnitudes on how effective the power could be.

*** For one thing, I would use the heck out of it in the kitchen. Imagine how much faster prepping a stir fry would be if I could chop all of the vegetables and aliums all at the same time! Imagine how much faster unloading the dishwasher would be!

It would also make parenting much easier. When the baby goes to slam her head into the floor because she's mad, just gently lift her off the ground. If the baby's bored, flip her upside down for a bit or something. Dresser drawers have been emptied of clothes and the baby is mad because she wants to keep strewing? TK-restock, bam!

If using the TK powers takes as much energy as lifting something manually, it could also be a weight loss regimen that can be done while gaming, which is pretty great.

Having the power would make it much easier to do home improvement / repair kind of stuff, too.

If we dropped the "living undetected" bit you could be the world's best trauma surgeon, but that wouldn't fly under the radar. And anyway, that sounds like way too much stress. Better to keep being a software developer and use the telekinesis for juggling upside-down babies and hearing them giggle while you play video games.

I think you just missed the obvious implication here. You don't want the world to know of your powers or take you too seriously while still making money? Telekinesis means no one will be able to press more keys or move controllers faster and likely more precisely than you. Boom, you're an e-sports world champion, as long as you keep your identity secret and somehow never play in public (but if you ask me, that can be your "shtick" and if anything boost the interest in you as a character).

I mean, arguably, it's kind of cheating, but it's also on something that's not important enough to feel like it's anything but a pretty innocuous scam. And you STILL must be pretty skilled.

- Go to casinos and manipulate dice and roulette wheels so that you can win lots of money

** Say you're a superhero in a world of superheroes. Your power is to regulate the temperature of your skin. You can bring your body down to -253 degrees Celcius, or all the way up to 12,000 degrees celcius (when black body radiation is giving off bluish white glow). You can make your whole body that temperature in 1 millisecond, and bring it down to normal in another millisecond. This does not affect the air around you that was superheated to that temperature though. Or the heat flash that will radiate out.

You can make a 1 cm^{2} patch of your skin that temperature, or your whole body. You can control the shape and size of it. You can also control how long it takes to reach a certain temperature, from 1 ms to as long as you wish. You also get a standard brute package. You are tougher than normal.

I like this, it's a cool twist on typical mnchkinry stuff.

--------------

Special goggles with lenses + superheating eyes -> laser eyes

heating/cooling pneumatics controlling arms in suit -> super strength

cooling down to very low temperatures -> fog/smoke creation

Super cooling feet -> walk on water

Hook up some magnets to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine][Stirling engine]] (or really, any compact heat-powered engine would do), superheat bottom, then generate a lot of electricity -> [[https://youtu.be/_fTC_Ud_k3U?t=399][electricity powers]] (much of the space in the backpack in the video is just cooling, which you could do automatically) also see [[https://youtu.be/UNisqZOAaAs?t=498][this]] for a possible result of using this technique). Similarly a technology-neutralizing effect could be mimicked via an EMP blast. Your gear could be protected via faraday cages.

Since you're in a world of superheros, and presuming there are also tinkers present, then there are certainly many advantages to having a large heat-sink and easy energy generation. Off the top of my head, if you find a way to get a whole lot of CPUs/GPUs packed onto your back in high transistor densities which would fry the components of a normal computer, then you may be able to replicate super-intelligence or contessa-like action sequence path by using a possibly computationally inefficient, but very accurate & fast (due to the transistors on your back) simple AI program (at the very simplest, a basic search algorithm or something, where all you need to do is define the puzzle properties, and let it find the optimal solution). Tinkers may not even be needed to be present for this to work.

By super heating metal balls with high melting points then throwing them at people you could mimic a hadouken.

By controlling several points of superheated skin on your palm, turning them on or off at different frequencies, you could be a rudimentary speaker. It would be very rudimentary though, like only up to 500 Hz.

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%20engine][Stirling engine]]*

A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. Strictly speaking, the inclusion of the regenerator is what differentiates a Stirling engine from other closed cycle hot air engines.Originally conceived in 1816 as an industrial prime mover to rival the steam engine, its practical use was largely confined to low-power domestic applications for over a century.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kykcuq/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/gjh6jwp/][Last thread]] we talked about a supervillain munchkin along the lines of a plant power trope.

I thought about other common villain tropes, albeit my perspective is a bit centered on Worm and to some extent DC since those are my preferred sources of superhero fiction. I thought about the archetype of the, "freezer" in the vein of Mr. Freeze or the wide variety of other characters whose powers and character are centered on coldness, ice, snow, etc.

I thought about a villain!Freezer character, basically a much harder version of Mr. Freeze. Aside from munchkining Freezer himself, how would you even go about your villainous day as Freezer?:

- While going through puberty, Freezer's body underwent unusual changes, turning his skin pale as porcelain, entire body cold to the touch, decreased tolerance for warmth (weather and otherwise), but significantly increased tolerance for coldness. With these changes also came a lingering anhedonia and severe misanthropy. The latter largely caused by the fact that instead of seeking medical attention, his family and others opted to neglect and abuse him.

- Freezer's normal body temperature is 18.6°F (-7.4°C). The various systems of his body function normally at this temp, including his microbiome. His thermoregulation in terms of heat is roughly scaled to a normal person's. He'll suffer discomfort, sweating, heat stroke, and other consequences of overheating, including death. Physical exertion can contribute, but on its own is unlikely to be a problem if he's in a proper environment.

- This limitation doesn't work the same way the other way around. Freezer still has the traits of an endothermic organism, but he wouldn't even shiver at a temperature as low as -148°F (-100°C). Otherwise his body scales to the normal symptoms of hypothermia.

- The bright side is that he doesn't get infected with anything that can't withstand his body's climate. Freezer also doesn't age past 25 years old. At the same time, it's difficult for him to find food and drink that he can tolerate and various other day-to-day issues.

- Unfortunately, Freezer wasn't granted any other inherent superpowers. He's currently a penniless squatter in a meat freezer in Aberdeen, SD. In terms of more mundane talents, he'd consistently test around 140 in terms of IQ and has what many would call an obsessive desire to study STEM with the intent of gaining insight into ways that he can return the Earth to the good old days when it was almost entirely covered in glaciers. Building ice-themed weapons aren't out of the question though.

- The latter part is his ultimate goal, make the Earth one big snowball. He doesn't have any women on ice or any real compassion for his fellow people. In terms of personality he's far from charismatic and downright socially awkward at times. He can manage to put up a semi-friendly face.

Freezer runs into obstacles pretty quickly since his agenda requires him to pursue an education, but there are little to no places willing or even equipped to accommodate his condition. His condition also makes many aspects of interpersonal interaction difficult and discouraging. Plus there's the fact there's no current explanation for it and more than one connected person who'd want to vivisect him for answers.

If you want to start small, what would an environmental suit for Freezer be like without the benefit of comic book technobabble?

*** The obvious problem here is that the only way for Freeze to accomplish his goal would require he direct an asteroid into the planet or block the sun with giant space mirrors. These are goals that would be difficult even for a major government yet for someone with only mediocre genius and everything else stacked against them it doesn't seem terribly plausible. If you want Freeze to pose any meaningful threat here you need him to actually have some resources he can draw upon: Make him better connected/wealthier, much more charismatic, a Von-Neumann level genius or some combination of the three.

The Freeze you've described doesn't really have a better shot at world domination than the average person on this subreddit. In that both Freeze and the median [[/r/rational][r/rational]] redditor are smart and probably not terribly socially skilled, but Mr Freeze also has a debilitating medical condition leaving him even worse off.

*** The thing about insulating materials is that they prevent heat transfer in both directions. A low-cost environmental suit for Freezer would simply be what people wear in really cold weather, in terms of heavy coats and hats and mittens and goggles and scarves and thick socks and boots and long underwear under flannel-lined pants. That should keep out enough heat for him to be somewhat comfortable. When you step outside in winter, every place that you feel cold is where Freezer would feel hot.

Fortunately, South Dakota is a place where heavy winter clothing is commonly available, because of the Bakken oil fields having lots of outdoor workers.

In later iterations, of course, you'd want to replace mundane insulation with stronger stuff, like down-lined pants and insulated boots.

I can see pros and cons - the centaurs have more control over the horse part but offer a bigger target. Or should centaurs just limit themselves to fighting with bow and arrow, Mongol style?
