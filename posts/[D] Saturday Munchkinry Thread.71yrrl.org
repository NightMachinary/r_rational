Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You can instantly switch bodies with anyone upon physical contact, such as a handshake. The switch is accomplished by some mysterious magic that rewrites the other person's brain to be an instance of you, and rewrites your brain to be an instance of them, while fixing up all the obvious problems that this might cause. (You will not have to relearn to walk, talk, or otherwise move in the new body, but you will be yourself and not inherit any special skills the other person may have learned. You are susceptible to genetic brain malfunctions the other person may possess, however). The power follows your consciousness between bodies. There is no limit on how frequently you can switch bodies.

What do you use this power for, if you decide to use it at all? Keep in mind that the person you switch bodies with will inherit the body you just came from, and will probably be rather unhappy with this sudden change (if you did it without consent).

*** Some trans people could potentially get a use out of this, so I could sell body swapping services (if you've got two people who want to switch with each other, it's relatively easy to facilitate a swap by shaking hands with each body one after the other).

I could also sell temporary body tours and permanent swaps for people who aren't trans but would like a different body (and life?) for other reasons.

Come to think of it, there might be a niche market for swaps between (1) people who find it relatively easy to work out, diet, and lose weight and (2) people who would prefer to slim down immediately in another body rather than slim down on their own. Alternately, this might be an extended body tour sort of thing, where your fitness swapper is expected to reduce your weight over a period of time, and then you swap back.

There are romantic/sexual applications to this as well, come to think of it. Imagine a whole new form of swinging, where you're still sleeping with your partner but both of you are in new bodies.

If I could just keep the government from trying to kidnap me, I could stand to make a fair amount of money.

**** There would be an extremely lucrative but potentially unethical market for permanent body-swaps. If you take someone with an old or sick or crippled body and give them a young healthy body, their lifespan will drastically increase, at the expense of whoever they swapped with. I have absolutely no doubt that there are a large group of wealthy people who would spend millions of dollars for the opportunity. If you want to be semi-ethical about it, you could find poor and/or suicidal people who would be willing to literally sell their body to leave something behind for their family. Or perhaps you could do compromise things, maybe a broke 20 year old would be willing to become a 30 year old in exchange for a few million dollars. And the rich guy could repeat the process with a new person every 10 years. Anyone can have eternal youth as long as they can find enough willing hosts and have ridiculous amounts of cash (of which, you can take a cut)

I'd expect the demand for good bodies would vastly outstrip the supply, so there is a 100% chance that a black market for bodies would emerge. Kidnappings for sure. Adoption of a baby only to steal their body and have a chance at a brand new life. Heck, you'd likely have people who would conceive and raise a child (or clone themself) for the express purpose of taking the body. Also, they could probably convince someone who was planning on having an abortion to have the baby instead and give it to them for swapping (although I'd expect young-adult bodies would be the most desirable). Depending on your balance of ethics vs. piles of money, you could either allow this to happen or try to find some way of preventing it, but good luck with that.

***** Alas, I'm too much of a dirty socialist to take part in extending the lives of the superrich. They can fund life extension research that can eventually be used for the benefit of all humans, or they can die with the rest of us. Taking advantage of a single supernatural bodyswapper is not the key to humanity's future (near-)immortality and I will not give them that escape valve, especially at the expense of the poor and desperate whose bodies they would be taking.

Although, I suppose that I might permit such swaps in exchange for more than mere cash payouts - e.g. "My price for swapping you with this person is not only that this person's family is taken care of in a generous fashion, but that you dedicate a sizable proportion of your resources to combating existential risk. I will not extend your life a second time if I am not satisfied with your results."

It would be pretty expensive, but you can't use /any/ of your money if you're dead, so there's that.

You're not extending the lives of the superrich as the endgoal, you'd do it to make yourself superrich, and then achieve your goals with that money, whether that be selfishly making yourself happy, or donating to science and life extension or whatever other donations are most efficient to maximize human well-being. The main question would be how to obtain healthy bodies ethically, and whether extending the lifespans of the superrich would cause more harm than your money is doing good, given that they would maintain and increase their wealth and control over society for longer, and wouldn't die and split their estates among multiple heirs and have estate taxes bite chunks off of it.

Well, this is a munchkin thread, here it would be unethical /not/ to use arbitrary horrible powers :)

First, it is interesting to run several tests:

1. Imagine a thread: at one end it goes into your finger, another end is loose. Thread is soaked in your blood, so it is virtually an extension of your body. Will touching the thread register as physical contact? If true, I guess you can shoot long and extremely thin streams of blood to transfer bodies.
2. Touch two persons at once. Try to focus on both of them and then activate your ability. Can you occupy two bodies at once? In one case, you get your clone, probably with the same power (and mangled mess of two consciousnesses in your previous body). In another case, you can test how your ability chooses its target.
3. Can you switch with people you can't see? If two unseen persons are touching you, can you specify target with your power?

Results of these tests will determine my strategy (and avenues for further tests).

If cloning from (2) didn't work, I see the wielder of this power in guarded facility, at the center of sprawling web of blood transmitting tubes. Pairs of people come there to switch their bodies for a price (switch with Person A, switch with Person B, switch with you original body). It is unlikely the wielder will ever leave the facility or die --- at this point, they made themselves too useful.

If cloning from (2) worked... well, it would be like intelligent and deadly virus. World domination becomes even easier (until your copies begin to rebel, but well, it's still technically the wielder who is in power, so goal achieved).

These body parts must be alive and connected to your brain via unbroken nerve connection with a certain information bandwidth. There is a minimal surface area of contact required, say 3 cm^{2.} If you could somehow grow a brain with lots of nerve fibers extending far out of it, and transfer into that, then I suppose you could get away with something like what you're suggesting.

2. You can only be in one body at once. If you try to do 2, the tie will be broken randomly.

3. You can switch with people you can't see. If someone brushes against you from behind with enough skin contact, you can transfer into them.

*** Can you swap into non-human bodies like this and does this allow you to retain sentience and human level cognition inside the other body? If the answer is yes to both, this could be an ethical variation on the life extension tricks other people have suggested.

If the answers are yes and no, this gets more interesting.

*Step 1*: Become absurdly rich (see other comments or read a bit further for suggestions on this).

*Step 2a*: Fund a shitton of bioengineering research with the purpose of creating an animal that undergoes a dramatic growth in cognitive ability when introduced to some chemical cue. Make sure this animal is non-sentient before getting the cue.

*Step 2b*: Alternatively, fund a shitton of research into mind machine interfaces to increase the cognitive abilities of non-sentient animals to some acceptable level. This is likely easier to do, but I imagine it could mess with the body switching powers in case a second switch is needed later one, what constitutes your natural body if most of you is running on a computer? Also, I still find brain uploading (which is essentially what this is) icky.

*Step 3*: Mass produced immortality.

One option for step 1 is to sell your services as a safer alternative to cryonics by just storing human consciences into long lived but non-sentient animals (iirc certain species of tortoises are essentially biologically immortal already).

** *Description*

To make illusions, you need Replica and Audience. With these two things your creations manifest into reality, gaining independence.

Replica is a 'draft' of your illusion, something that (vaguely) resembles it. Audience is the group of people who believe Replica is a real thing.

For example, to create an illusionary dragon, you must first create its Replica out of wood. You can start a spell then, but illusion will be very weak. It is better to build a large tent, put the replica there, add devices that make really convincing sounds of large beast and emit smoke. Gather large crowd outside and make a convincing speech about how dangerous the dragon is. Suggest that you can show it --- if visitors promise to be very careful. And /then/ you start a spell.

In this example, dragon is fed by fairly powerful beliefs. It will look like a real thing at the start of a spell, its behaviour dictated by Audience expectations. It will /become/ real thing in 8 months, if people still aren't skeptical (although the final result may differ from your initial concept: it is strongly affected by Audience beliefs/expectations).

If Replica is the living being, same rules apply until they start to question their identity. Then, illusion shatters.

For example, if you manage to convince Audience that you are a stone statue, you will stand unaging for centuries, only threatened by pigeons. You won't be surprised that you can think --- obviously, you are made from thinking stone! Only with a powerful mental discipline you can break from this trance.

*Details*

- You can support only one illusion at a time. If illusion became real, you don't need to support it.
- Anything can be Replica, but you have to build it yourself... I mean, you have to /believe/ that you built it yourself.
- Audience of 100 people will make illusion real in 8 months. 1000 people --- 7 months, 10`000 people --- 6 months and so on. It will require at least 30 minutes for illusion to become real.
- Number of people who strongly doubt your illusion will be substracted from the Audience.

So, how would you rule the world, break the world, improve the world? Any interesting uses of this ability?

The final result is shaped by Audience beliefs. So you can get omnipotent and omniscient being, but its morality will also be determined by what your cult members believe, at least in the beginning.

EDIT: Oh my (illusionary) god, that actually works. You just need to define your god as 'omnipotent being that does whatever ShiranaiWakaranai prophesizes'. It still has some genie-like problems but it works.

Normally, the next step would be to get into politics, joining the side of the winning candidate and becoming a shadow ruler. But since your future sight is fuzzy, this has a small chance of failing and blowing up in your face.

You could try to become a mad scientist, using your psychic abilities to guess the actual unknown laws of physics and create powerful tools that rely on these unknown laws... but again, since your ability is fuzzy, there's a chance it will literally blow up in your face and kill you.

**** I'm approaching this from the perspective of what an average street medium would likely have access to if they actually had powers.

So, you can contact the dead but they tend to gush general things about their relatives and not actually help you with your stuff.

You can do minor jinxes on noncelebrity people you don't know but other people do and have some animosity towards -- like, make someone's cousin stub their toe once a month.

I don't think you'd be able to do paradoxes, or remember that you've done paradoxes, that seems too OP.

You can read minds, sort of, enough to make people suspect that you're at least a con artist who's reading microexpressions, though your powers are actually magical so they are a bit more accurate than that and can go into stuff that someone trained to read people won't pick up, like how delicious someone found a burger this morning, when they weren't actually thinking about the burger. I guess this can make you into a pretty good psychotherapist.

I think telekenesis that goes beyond parlor tricks would be too OP as well. Same with teleportation.

You have some remote viewing options but they're of things that tend to be wrong a lot of the time, though on average they tend to be more right than wrong, to give you an edge over other psychics just making things up.

***** I suppose a heuristic for whether I can do a thing is whether a layperson would think it OP. Therefore, a power that might turn out well is conditional precognition - divine information about the future as it would be if something you choose were true. The layperson doesn't think AGIs can get out of boxes like that. Look as far as you can under conditions that are more likely to spawn an FAI - perhaps "What would the far future look like if I had phenomenal cosmic power?".

Wouldn't you get to see yourself swimming in a vault of gold like scrooge mcduck or something? How would that be helpful? I don't think an average person would expect a psychic to get precise instructions to becoming phenominally cosmically powerful or every single one of them would be that already. Or most of them who weren't power-averse, anyways.

******* Of course you wouldn't get instructions for the personal power you have within the divination - they got their power by author fiat. Rather, such a divination could be steered by the version of me within it towards a future that contains a friendly superintelligence, which would know just what to make the world look like to maximize utility outside the divination. If my outside powers are such that if what I see would seem OP to a layperson, my powers are nerfed, the AI would presumably /see that coming/ and show me something that maximizes utility while being cryptic enough not to trigger a nerf. The hypothetical layperson judge may well end up seeing me turned mad by Cthulhu's whispers, as befits such hubris, and run away screaming while I start gathering a cult or whatever.

** Every day, there is a 50% chance that the world's future is simulated, with the state of the stock market after one day returned to the present and revealed to the world. (Within the simulation, there is again a 50% chance that it has access to a future simulation of its stock market, etc.) What happens? How could you exploit this?

*** In order for the simulation to be computable and not get caught in an endless loop, I'm assuming the simulation is run based on a future where it hasn't reported any results this day so that it doesn't have to base it's predictions off its own predictions.

If the stocks are revealed to the whole world, then I don't immediately see any way to profit from it directly it as an individual, since everyone else has the same stock information as you. I'd expect stocks which are predicted to change would immediately change to those same values since the market would know ahead of time what they'll be worth tomorrow.

If you had enough resources, or had society as a whole come together, you could create a bunch of dummy companies with stocks that can be used to send messages in binary. The companies or ordered, and stocks are only available to be bought/sold between select individuals, who sell one stock each day for either 1 cent or 2 cents depending on whether the digit the stock corresponds to should be a 0 or 1.

Now you can send messages back in time, but they only have a (1/2)^{n} chance of being received where n is the number of days to send them back. You could precommit to doing a number of expensive trials or experiments tomorrow if you don't receive a message today, and then signal back which ones worked or didn't. There is a 50% chance you actually have to pay for them, but a 50% chance you'll know the results without having to pay, so it doubles your efficiency. You could also leave open ended message slots to signal back things about natural disasters, accidents that occur to individual people, etc.

**** That's not quite what I meant: Half of the days, at the start of the day, receive stock info from a simulation that ran for one day. Half of all simulations, at the start of their day, themselves receive stock info from a recursive simulation of that same day. This means that information from a 10th of January never gets passed back to a 1st of January. There is, on average, one simulation-day for each real-day.

***** Oh I see. If they receive information at the same time each day then by the time they read it it's too late for them to send anything back because the time has already passed.

So you couldn't send signals back more than 24 hours, everything else I said still works.

*** Well the obvious answer is to hack the definition of a cow (bioengineer whatever useful properties you want into one species of cow, kill all the other cows). But that aside, this ability can be supremely helpful in terraforming other worlds:

- Cows +contain fat that+ can be burned so you can extend a nice big middle finger to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. You'd still need oxidizer, but even if you can't manufactor some from the cow itself, oxidizer is a lot lighter than fuel + oxidizer.
- The use of a near limitless source of food speaks for itself.
- You can use the cow corpses to start a miniature ecosystem on whatever planet you are colonizing, introducing large amounts of biomass and CO2 for bacteria and other lifeforms to thrive in, maybe even eventually creating a stable atmosphere (although that seems unlikely with 1440 cows per day).

Oh that's easy. Just use Gurkenglas's replication technique to break the 1440 cow barrier.
