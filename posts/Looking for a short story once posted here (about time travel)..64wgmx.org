The story was a time travel story where, because there was only one timeline, everyone was basically killed because of the time travel. The time traveler replaced his/her brain with a silicon one and sent it back in time to the 21st century to replace his/her own brain. Thanks.


** [[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/][The Great Filter]], I believe.

He actually replaced someone else's brain with his own. Murder? Yeah, from a certain point of view. Of course, making the jump at all meant effectively murdering every sapient being then in existence. He noted how it's funny that the one feels more meaningful than the many.

*** If time travel can reset to any point in time, no matter how far back, then we wouldn't expect to be living in a universe that's 14 billion years old - most of the seconds across all timelines are far closer to the big bang.

**** Your argument is well-reasoned, but there are three flaws/counter-agruments:

- Time travel only requires life with an advanced civilization, so it should only be resetting, at most, to the earliest point in time when complex life first appeared. Not back to shortly after the big bang where there is no life to take advantage of the time travel. For all we know, life does take 14 billion years to appear (a proposed solution to the Fermi Paradox).

- According to the Anthropic Principle, even if time travel frequently resets to an early point in time before human civilization appears, we can only observe universes that has managed to reach 14 billion years in age without resetting. Hence, we cannot take the age of the universe as evidence for or against any hypotheses, only that it's possible to reach the age of 14 billion and not how likely the age is.

- Another issue is that even if most timelines result in a reset, the resets can only go as far back as when the civilization can conceivably invent time travel. There is no reason for the timeline reset to go back to an earlier species (how can a human mind take over an alien mind?). Hence the timeline should be seen as a series of bursts of frequent resets with long stretches of uninterrupted timelines. This is true even if multiple species with time travel exist at the same time, as long none of them can interact with each other. Slowly over the corpses of numerous failed species, the timeline of the universe will gradually progress.

**** But if you sent a message back to shortly after the Big Bang, then there would be nothing there to receive it. 14 billion years later, the universe would have developed largely unaltered. Sure, from a certain point of view it might be 28 billion years old, but we wouldn't know that.

***** It's more probable that within the first dozen billion years someone invents time travel and goes back to the big bang again. Let's assume that within each billion years there's a 90% chance that within a billion years someone in the universe resets back to the big bang. Consider the number of times time has been reset to the big bang. Skewing how probability works a bit, each time the number goes up by one, the number of digits that change represent the number of billion years that have passed, with the rightmost digits being the closest to the big bang. If each civilization that comes to exist finds itself in some random billion of years, it should expect to be close to the big bang.

****** a) What would be the point of sending a message back to then, with no recipient?

b) Maybe that /does/ happen shortly after 14 billion years?

******* It doesn't need to have a point if only one has to do it. Saying that maybe it does happen shortly after 14 billion years is like solving the ordinary fermi paradox with maybe we are just the first civilization to come around.

******** I am no cosmologist, but it was my understanding that complex life in the first 10 billion or so years was considered very unlikely due to the lack of heavier elements. 1-2 generations of stars had to nova to seed the universe with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. If correct, that would cut the timeframe by two thirds, not counting time for that complex life to actually evolve.

****** Is there really a 90% chance of someone stupidly resetting to the Big Bang? Isn't it more likely that the inventor will instead make a more useful jump and begin the loop-until-Armageddon cycle?

******* There's a lot of potential civilizations across the universe in each billion years. I only need one of them to go back to the big bang, no matter what the others do.

I think there's another important question here: Does resetting time reroll random events beyond the target's light cone? If yes, there should immediately be some civilzation somewhere outside the target's light cone that resets again, shuffling the universe through a lot of instant rerolls.
