** Reviews:

Last week [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/][Delve]] were recommended. It's a litrpg isekai and I think it have a really promising start with the protagonist having to learn the languages and not getting unique treatment. To be fair the protagonist haven't made any painfully wrong decisions, only arguably suboptimal ones. The main focus point from the situation seems to be how good the protagonists choice of build is. What bugs me indescribably is that the rest of the cast seem to be incredibly awed by the build despite that the build is low level and could be done by anyone, and (unless the game balance is rigged) should be inferior on certain points. Granted there are plausible explanations to why a certain build isn't widespread, maybe the search space for possible skill combinations are absolutely massive or maybe there is a stigma against aura mages or something. But it isn't explored and since the protagonist's class is widely known, auras are known, the protagonist only uses low level skills, it really comes off as poorly written powerwanking.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Bright-Lady-WORLD-PRIME/dp/1616149884][World of Prime]] were also recommended. It's similarly an isekai with implied DnD mechanics. Experience are gained from the skulls of dead sentient creatures and that have been to some degree been commercialized(mind you, still in medieval/feudal society so it isn't optimized). It revolves around the introduction of firearms to kill monsters without having levels and the societal conflicts of letting unleveled yield power that is comparable to those with levels. A lot of the NPC's makes suboptimal decisions but they do it from perspectives and motivations that seems plausible. The protagonist isn't super intelligent and mostly just survives on implementing ideas from our world. I have a lot of minor complaints but overall I both enjoyed book 1 and book 2.

I think you and a few others like [[/u/Addictedtobadfanfict]] and [[/u/meterion]] overselling how awed people are. They think it's a good build, but I haven't seen anyone actually fawning.

Lets use an actual example. Chapter 31, it's not particularly spoilery. But Rain has a 1v1 dual with another adventurer, he's level 12 at this point. His opponent is less than level 5 (since he's still trying to unlock a class). The dual is first to half health, and Rain just /barely/ manages it before he runs out of mana - and mana is his speciality.

Rain's build is very very good at three things: leveling, dealing with swarms, and provides great party utility. However it's got /massive/ drawbacks. Almost loosing a bout to someone under half your level drawbacks. He's got nothing up his sleeve to deal with smaller numbers of tougher opponents. He's got fairly low survivability and short range, already a bad combination. It's a highly specialised build that absolutely requires the support of a party to cover it's weaknesses.

The only thing that's really unique about this build is how fast it levels, but levels are capped by the highest level essence monster you've killed and all but really low level essence monsters are rare. There's no point optimising for power-levelling if you're just going to hit your cap and spend ages stuck at your current level; choose the build that does what you want instead. I can see why this build wouldn't be popular.

**** Actually, I'd been arguing the opposite: that everyone thinks his build is trash when it's fairly decent and only going to get better. I don't deny that Rain's choice of skill/class/stats make him extremely lopsided, but when it comes to RPG land no man is an island until you reach epic levels.

We already saw what happened when Val tried to take on an essence mob solo, so it's not a particularly big drawback to rely on being in a party to raise your level cap. I'm pretty sure any build that doesn't include some kind of self-buff or self-heal isn't going to be totally self-sufficient, which fits most of the characters we've seen.

Also, I definitely would not consider Rain short range; he's a solid mid-range fighter what with a 50ft AoE. Plus, now that he's figured out how to use Velocity to trip up opponents, it will let him disengage from fights easier in the future. Plus, you're missing half the point when you mention the fast levelling: it's not just that /he/ levels fast, it's that his /skills/ do to.

Like when Ameliah says that his level of Purify is at, in a month, what it took her over a year to achieve, that's the other power of his build. MP regen is the real bottleneck for levelling skills, since as far as it's been shown monster XP doesn't funnel into skill levels. Even if his actual level plateaus, maximizing skill levels will give him an enormous edge over people who can't dump tens of thousands of points into spells every day.

***** You're right about his power levelling, and I think it's the part that's the most impressive to his party. It is weird that you don't get experience for using skills on monsters, but you could work around it by using the mana transfer aura - or some equivalent skill to let others grind almost as fast as Rain. I'm surprised the adventurer's guild doesn't do it, but that could be cultural. Adventurer's might not consider sitting around a guildhall pumping out mana to be much of an adventure and the people who do might be getting a better deal elsewhere.

For short/range vs mid range. It depends on movement speed skills, but we've seen how fast Ameliah can run. If charge/leap/sprint skills are common among melee DPS I wouldn't rely on 50ft of distance to keep me safe. Even if there's a tank in front of you, you'll be in range of melee classes using skills to jump over your tank, and shorter range than any dedicated ranged fighter.

It's a decent build, but it's a very specialised build that's great in the right circumstances and limited outside them.

****** Going off of people's reactions to Rain's regen, the transfer aura probably isn't used because it practically requires an Mregen build to be useful. At base, it transfers 1mp/sec at 20% efficiency, including to the caster. Apparently 500mp/day is a normal Mana Regen rate. Therefore, unless efficiency improves with level, an average mage can only gift something like 70 total mana per day sustainably.

Point on speed vs range, it's just weird for me to consider anything outside of melee weapon range short.

**** If I'm understanding it correctly you are arguing against the claim that the build is good. None of us is saying that. We are saying that the cast seem awed at most things Rain does and that the world in general seems engineered towards making Rain look powerful despite a build of questionable quality. The cast are consistently awed at his mana regen, at the cleaning thing, and in recent chapters the possibility of getting shear with a build that isn't invested in Focus for damage. In recent chapters the group encountering a swarm and coincidentally NOBODY have any AOE, not even the other high level Mage, except our saviour protagonist.

That is exactly where the novel died for me. I am going to rant a little because I thought this was the next big novel from Royalroad. It was foreshadowed that the MC build was special because everyone was outwardly reacting to it when he was using his aura purify spells. Then like 15 chapters later he used it around a mage girl and she uses the "system ui" to check what that spell was and shrug it off complaining that it was too much mana cost. It was such a letdown because firstly, this is the first time a character other than the MC shows that they got access to the system. Secondly, it shows how the author purposely led us on thinking that the MC was "special" with his system usage but apparently the whole population can use the system? Why did they show the workers freaking out in the sewer when he saw the MC use magic before this happened? What a big tease, let down, and expectation killer.

**** Yes, I had this exact same conversation with Delve being very interesting but also disappointing. It felt like I got baited with a non-power fantasy isekai litRPG only to realize that the power fantasy was just hidden under the surface.

Specifically, the experience system's incentives are completely at odds with what people think of it, which makes society hold a massive idiot ball for the MC to be clever. Spoilers to follow:

There are two broad ways to get XP: killing monsters, or using health/stamina/mana points, the latter of which is significantly easier and safer to do consistently. In addition, skills can only level up through their usage, which means point usage is twice as effective at levelling your character as a whole compared to monster XP.

From this, it should be common sense that regen-focused builds are extremely effective and should be the dominant "meta" for the world, since that is the stat that directly correlates with how often you can spend points. Instead, people look at him like he's insane for dumping points in regen despite being able to level skills more than an order of magnitude faster than a "typical" build. There is no current way to excuse this complete lapse in realism beyond the author wanting to make a thinly-veiled power fantasy.

I have a bit of hope that the author will reveal things in a way to explain things in a way that makes sense, but who knows if that'll happen.

***** Mind you I'm not apologist and the story has its failings, but you've failed to mention one thing. Level Caps. In the story's system you must kill rare and relatively strong beasts to level at all. His build would have fucked him totally if he'd had a level 5 cap. He got lucky with a starting 18 or 19 cap. A build with no damage and little utility for 20 levels, is completely unviable when most people never break past 0, much less get into the 20s. This is rural kingdom and none or the character have a strong supporting organization that will carry them through enough kills to pick up momentum. So they make practical short term decisions.

****** Looking at it from a local/munchkin perspective, you don't actually need to have that high of a cap to start going crazy with a pure aura regen build if you know what you're doing.

You need three points into Intrinsic Focus, Intrinsic Clarity, Magical Synergy to get a workable mana pool and the most efficient mana regen bonuses. If you really had a level 5 cap to work with (which leaves six skills, getting one at level 0) then Purify and Amplify Aura would give you the XP engine needed to skill level everything to max, and round it off with Refrigerate/Immolate for sufficient solo dps.

Everything beyond that is just fine-tuning the build and stacking more bonuses, but those six are really all you'd theoretically need to become a powerhouse in a month or two.

Between all his other skills, MC was putting out enough damage to solo kill an entire pack of feral fire dogs in just a few seconds with a 224% damage modifier. With only AA, that boost just decreases to 190%. With only 6 skills you'd still have a 20 foot sphere of icy death, no sword needed.

As for the mana levels, using the equations in chapter 30 for 10 focus and 70 clarity, a level 5 optimal aura mage would have 757 mana and 6315mana/day regen, or 4.3mana/min. With a fully-amplified refrigerate consuming 84mana/sec, they'd still be able to pull off the kind of move MC did at level 16, if cutting it a bit close.

I'm not trying to say that an aura mage at that level has no weaknesses or is broken, but they're still powerful enough that it shouldn't be unthinkable for someone to spec like that.

*********** Put him up against a level 8 orc with a sword. How you think he'd do? My bad with the radius part. I replied from the app which only showed a clipped part of your comment. I guess what my point is, is that his build and other regen builds level very fast, and Do It at no risk. So the question is how strong do you become as opposed to someone who levels much slower than you but has focus, or might or w/e. As we've seen with Val, even at 5 Val is far more deadly than him. Is that always true? No. Under pack circumstances the aura is better. But all it takes is one slightly tough enemy without a frost weakness and Rain's dead. His build is very very risky. High risk, eventually very high reward.

His build actually get stronger the more pack oriented his opponent. In most games insect swarm type enemies slaughter most builds, as it's impossible to kill a 1000 locusts with a sword, while rain wouldn't be under any risk at all. So I suppose it matter mostly what kind of environment the combat occurs in or the world favors. So far though it seems to be the trend that essence mobs are singular and stronger, so most people probably favor champion style builds where you can be self reliant.

Good point on essence mobs probably being like bosses and influencing builds in that direction though, I can see that being why people either go for singular DPS or support, as we've seen so far.

If monster damage scales reasonably, it wouldn't be surprising to see stronger enemies (e.g. essence monsters) capable of one-shotting him. This is presumably a problem for most mages, however, ironically, a lower level Rain would be much worse in a team than an ordinary mage since his dps is indiscriminate.

I like how fitting Rain's build is for him, exclusively. The skill leveling mechanic rewards quick leveling which would presumably be far less useful for a native having several years to hit their level cap. The over-mana mechanic lets him retain information allowing him to learn the local language and culture far quicker than normal. It's an attempt to make a ‘game system' fit for the character while not breaking the setting.

The build of every adventurer we've met so far is geared towards one thing: being able to defeat an enemy that's higher level than they are, possibly in a party context.

Every adventurer needs to be able to reach that minimum bar, or else /they'll hit their cap and never level again/.

The thing about this system is that there's no real benefit to being able to wipe out hordes of low-level monsters. It gives you XP towards your cap, but that's it. In order to advance, you need to be able to punch up.

It's a self-limiting build. Which is why people don't use it unless they're forced to.

Sure, but it's rare to find a high cap essence mob. They're not something you can farm - at best, "tamed" essence areas generate level ~5 mobs.

Which means that this babysitter party also needs to be highly mobile /and/ have a really good intelligence network, in order to have the right person harvest high-cap essence mobs before someone else can steal them.

I'm not saying these things don't exist - but they're probably restricted to the nobility. And the nobility isn't going to go all-in on a glass cannon build like Rain's for themselves.

It's even mentioned a bit when they say how that one empire uses slaves that level the MP conversion auras to fuel their armies, but it's not applied from the bottom up, that literally every village and town should have at least one resident aura mage who sticks inside the borders, levelling obscene amounts of skill levels just by having purify on 24/7.

** The first book of [[https://www.amazon.com/Street-Cultivation-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B07W9J75R3][Street Cultivation]] is out on Amazon and I enjoyed reading it for free on royalroad so much that I bought a copy to support the author.

You can read the first five chapters on [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][royalroad]] if you are undecided, but for me, it eases some of the Cradle-withdrawal symptoms I'm suffering through.

It's basically taking the trappings of the wuxia genre and putting it in a modern-day setting, without letting the main character have anything special or unique. He has to dig himself out of poverty with nothing but his smarts, hard work, and a little luck.

Another wuxia recommendation is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth][Cultivating Earth]]. There's only 20 short chapters out so far, but it's off to a strong start. It's about a cultivator who reached immortality by consuming all qi on a world for 4,000 years. This world resulted in our modern reality. To pay back the karmic debt, he's cultivating Earth.

It was recommended a few weeks ago and I'm posting it again to show how much I liked it.

*** I really enjoyed Street Cultivation. I read the sample chapters first, purchased it, and then devoured it in one sitting. Definitely don't regret my choice.

For anyone considering it, it's basically a LitRPG except followed through to its logical conclusion, with the main character having very, very little of the typical "luck" that LitRPG MC's tend to.

It's also far better written than the usual fare for the genre. The characters actually each have character, and the writing is solid overall - no awkward sentences that I noticed. The pacing is pretty good too, except maybe the very last bit - but that's debatable.

Overall, highly recommended for people who like LitRPGs but also dislike the mental masturbation aspect of them.

I think the author has more western influences than usual, which may make it more accessible for western readers. The story is enjoyable, and has an interesting world. Think Victorian SCP with some dnd, lovecraft and xianxia mixed in. The power progression is reasonable without being boring, and the main character is actually clever and likeable. It's long and doesn't seem to have a strong overarching plot, but if you are okay with some meandering you will probably enjoy it.

** In Isekai (with or without a game system), %-wise, almost none of them make an effort to use Earth knowledge. Even among stories where the main character tries to exploit the world's mechanics, its usually focused around the new world with the old world mostly forgotten.

For clarification, 'technology' means engineering products from any discipline, from mechanical to materials to cosmetics.

A world with magic or game systems means that people in it can rely on magical technology to solve problems, which means less research would be put into non-magical technologies. An example of this is Shadow of the Conqueror ([[https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Conqueror-Chronicles-Everfall-Book-ebook/dp/B07TB4YSHX][on Amazon]]) which is plain fantasy, where the existence of healers directly results in poor medical competence.

The only stories I'm familiar that really try this

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A hero's war]]

  - Starts down the industrial tech route, then progresses to combined technologies

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced][Displaced]]

  - Uses mainly combined technologies (only the uplift character)

- [[http://www.hpmor.com][HMPOR]]

  - Uses muggle technology in the Games, but most of the time focused on magical technology

Any recommendations for me? I especially want ones with materials/chemical engineering, since there's a lot of untapped potential there.

An analogy I like about him is that he's the SFF writer equivalent of JJ Abrams rather than Spielberg or Nolan; a technically proficient mass appeal writer that hits all the right notes, but who takes zero risks and pushes no boundaries.

As to a launching off point, I'd say Mistborn 1 is as good a place to start as any. It does (or is in the process of doing) something which no other series has done, to my knowledge, which is to start at a low tech setting and progress it gradually towards a high tech setting, while giving due consideration to how magic would affect such a civ's development. He's currently in the industrial revolution part of that timeline (think american wild west frontier) and I've enjoyed the books set there a lot so far.

The point that the quote is making is that sci-fi very rarely includes subtle science like this. It tends to just be more of what we've already seen; /better/ computers, spaceships, weapons, resource acquisition, or energy generation.

*** The Long Earth series could fit this, I guess? Premise is there's a device that anyone can make with supplies from RadioShack and a potato that teleports you to an alternate Earth with no humans and some minor alterations to things like species that exist and geology. Additionally, there's an apparently infinite number of these universes, and they can only be accessed sequentially, ie you have to go to each alternate Earth one after the other with no skipping. The consequences of this are pretty fascinating to me.

I personally liked the entire 5 book series, but some people feel like the quality gets worse over time. The setting isn't especially rational but I think it's pretty self-consistent. Also features a pretty good AI character.

** I'm looking for stories where the protagonist knows of the plot, but isn't necessarily the "main character" that the story revolves around. They then use that knowledge for a specific purpose, usually to get stronger or prevent something from happening, and then make observations about the main characters actions, changes to the setting, and how it all happened (my favorite part).

I'm not sure of what type of trope this counts as, aside from time travel or deconstruction, but Hero's War and Mother of Learning are prime examples along with many reincarnation/do-over/self-insert stories.

Just recommend whatever you think fits.

The protagonist is a prexog whose goal is to set things up and set things in motion for later successes - including future "MC"s - so that they're able to do what must be done. We don't get to see that resolution, though, IIRC. World-building is a little weaker than I'd prefer, but it's a great read overall.

The captain will suddenly make dramatic pronouncements, only to wait 3-5 minutes calmly before resuming where he left off. Leave on an away mission with one of the main characters, and you'll die as theyl make it back safely without you.

The setting itself is a silly one, but the characters slowly figure out how to game the system that they are in.

  I can't think of one non-stupid reason to separate pony fiction out from the rest
#+end_quote

Well, what about this one: /MLP/ fanfiction is literally about sentient ponies as opposed to humans, which may not fit with some people's aesthetic preferences, therefore we should differentiate it from the other fiction the way we do with NSFW fiction.

Or this one: It is factual that some people dislike /MLP/. However stupid their reasons, it is factual that these people will be annoyed if they receive an unmarked /MLP/ recommendation, and will (if they remember) be less inclined to listen to your recommendations in the future. Unless you consider those who would dislike an /MLP/ fanfiction for being an /MLP/ fanfiction literal scum of the Earth whose happiness is actively detrimental to your utility function --- and I don't imagine that you do --- their annoyance should be considered a negative consequence, as well as their being biased against accepting your future recommendations.

Or this one: Consider an r/rational in which all people who can enjoy /MLP/ fanfiction follow your policy. Those who dislike /MLP/ fanfiction would be biased against asking for recommendations there /at all/, expecting to receive an /MLP/ fanfiction in reply, and may well leave the subreddit altogether. Again: unless you consider them so evil their presence is detrimental to your happiness, you would not want this to happen.

Or this one: Consider an r/rational in which /everyone/ follows your policy for /all/ kinds of fiction. Porn, gore, slice-of-life, furry, edgelord fantasies, dubious XIV Inquisition tracts, fanfiction, nonfiction, metafiction, interactive fiction, published literature, movies, anime, manga, comics, plays --- all of this is being actively recommended without any disclaimers, an enormous mess. Would you wish to browse such a subreddit? Would you wish to ask it for recommendations?

Mentioning that the story you're recommending is an /MLP/ fanfiction takes no more than three seconds. Following a link and determining that it's an /MLP/ fanfiction takes at least as much. If you expect more than one person to take note of your recommendation, and if at least two of these people will be such that they dislike /MLP/ fanfiction, and if you wish to minimize wasted time, then marking your /MLP/ recommendations is preferable to the alternative.

******* Minimizing wasted time is a good enough reason for me, thanks. I have changed my mind. Your point about porn or gore isn't relevant here, I think, since an aesthetic preference can't actually harm people unless they have a phobia against ponies as they do against spiders. Which is possible, I think, but a very rare eventuality that I don't feel obligated to prevent.

********* The key word there is ‘typically'. When the fandom is not given, no offense is taken, and no attempt made to ensure the original recommender rectify the matter. Instead, a commenter may take it upon themself to state the fandom in the recommender's place, often with their own personal view on the story mentioned. However, when such a story originates from within the MLP fandom, ire is often directed at the recommended, that they would dare display such a work without warning. It is a double standard that many attempt to dismiss, but it is unarguably there.

** I re-recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22356/dreams-come-true/chapter/324904/01][Dreams come true]] for fun, thoughtless entertainment (~300K words, ongoing, currently 7th place at TopWebFiction).\\
The premise is basically co-existence as isekai and in reality, which makes for a nice contrast in storytelling and a fun non-trivial situation to try to exploit. The writing style is easily tolerable, the plot doesn't stagnate, and worldbuilding/magic system were fun with at least minor depth. There is some aspect of the early reality plot which is ridiculous, but that aspect can be safely ignored, having zero future consequences that are not easily attributed to bad writing (IMO). Overall, for my tastes, it is much better than the known alternatives in the "meaningless fun" category, so if that's what you are looking for right now - try it.\\

** So I had an idea for a story about our world merging with one full of magic. You know the horror stories they present in any fiction that includes teleportation about avoiding teleporting into things? Well the landmasses of the two worlds are essentially the same but completely different societies and levels of technology. So when everything merges some things (pretty much everything) do it literally. And only through the intervention of the gods do most living things not immediately die. What happens after is up to the people as the gods go dark for 5 years to "recharge".

This means electricity and water are gone as pipes and cables are cut off by dirt and plants. Trees, grass and bushes pop up in homes. Old world villages merged with cul-de-sacs. Farms in peoples backyards and popping up in the road. Buildings topple as plants and wood buildings replace important supports. Everything and anyone underground is likely buried. And now magical creatures find themselves in strange new environments and react badly. Some pockets of great holy power devoted to Order might survive unscathed but it's basically the apocalypse.

I was wondering what this subreddits thoughts were on how people would react? How they'd survive? Where would they go?

And also how bad it would be? I mean if this happened what would you expect the mortality rate to be? Would anyone survive if containment on pretty much every nuclear facility failed, missiles were buried, waste exposed to an unshielded environment?

And what would society look like in 5 years once things had settled? Would civilizations from different era's mingle? murder each other?

Maybe the Sahara becomes more livable if desertification was undone, but I doubt that there are many other areas where food production could increase. You'd get the Bikini Atol back I guess.

Mines just got refilled and oil Wells replenished, so I guess that's nice for environmentalists until the world recovers enough to start pumping tons of oil again. The Amazon recovers substantially.
