  /This is a story of an impossible outcome, where AI never worked, molecular nanotechnology never worked, biotechnology only sort-of worked; and yet somehow humanity not only survived, but discovered a way to travel Faster-Than-Light: The past's Future./

*** Also human-level AI that hasn't yet reached superintelligence?

But I know you can't really write stories otherwise, so this one was still quite enjoyable.

**** Actually I think they did a good job with having the AI do things that are genuinely narrow but still impressive.

*** It might just be preference. There exist better stimulants than coffee today, but it's such a cultural mainstay that it sells. A status symbol, for example - the protagonist has her special blend. It might also be that high-stress operations use stronger stimulants, but for a run like this one it's frowned upon.

** Great first chapter! I'm hooked and can't wait to read what comes next.

Loved your seamless explanations of the 'technical' details.

And I give you bonus points for your nod to Excession.

  An honest to Banks OCP.
#+end_quote

OCP = Out of Context Problem which, I think, was originally from Excession.

**** The use of 'Honest to Banks OCP'. Iain Banks' Excession is about an Outside Context Problem.

** This is really interesting. I'm guessing this is at least partially inspired by Tabby's star.
