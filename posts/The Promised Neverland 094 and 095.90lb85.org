** I have to say I'm annoyed by this resolution to the Goldy Pond arc. If they were going to blow the place up anyway, couldn't they have done it /before/ being beaten half to death and back by a band of elite demons that would clearly have died anyway?

It's not that hard to come up with a justification in the practical sense, say, they didn't know of any escape routes until Gray & Co broke in. I don't feel that works dramatically, however, since the story doesn't even mention these considerations. They /could/ have constructed a narrative of "we could have avoided all this if Gray & Co had broken in a few hours sooner" or "the plan failed to the point where we have to sacrifice Goldy Pond, which we really hoped to avoid", but they didn't - the escape route and the destruction of Goldy Pond are both afterthoughts.

** Whoops, I waited too long on posting this and two updates came out. Oh well.
