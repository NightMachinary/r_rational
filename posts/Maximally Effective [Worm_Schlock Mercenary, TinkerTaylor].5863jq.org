** I'm mostly posting this because it has one of the best explanations for tinker-tech I've read.

It seems pretty interesting so far, but I don't think it's gotten the attention it deserves. Hopefully the author will post more frequently.

*** I agree that it is interesting so far, but what has been posted amounts to an introduction. I hope the author posts more.

** You linked to the most recent post, not the first one. I didn't realize I was reading post 6 until afterwards, when I checked the index.

** This is really good, but pitifully short right now. It's just the first arc completed so far.
