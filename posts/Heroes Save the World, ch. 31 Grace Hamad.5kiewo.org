** This is one of my more experimental, or at least weirder, chapters to date.

If you like it, then let me know. If you don't like it, then *definitely* let me know.

Update: It took longer than expected, but HSTW has a header image now. I'd be pleased as punch to know what you think of it (and I advise you to check out the talented [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/artist-commission-registry.31798/#post-6824248][Nemuikougi]] if you're looking for some banners or logos for your own work.)

** The fact that we don't know if this interlude will ever be relevant again and that Grace was neither shown exploring any more but one of her powers nor having any interaction whatsoever with anyone else nor revealing any consequences to her or anyone elses life makes this chapter pretty weak. All of this makes it nigh impossible (for me at least) to become invested in Grace's story and makes me feel dissapointed at this update.

I think is was well written technically though. The issue is not that the substance is bad either, just that there is far too little of it, especially if this is supposed to be a one time only glimpse into the life of a character with no discernable effect on society.

Sorry for the negative feedback. I do enjoy your story in general even though most chapters fail to deliver a wham effect till now.

*** No problem. Negative feedback is at least as important as positive feedback. Luckily, I think I'll be able to avoid "character who may or may not ever appear again, and doesn't interact with anyone" in the future.

I'm glad that you're still enjoying the story.

** I liked the chapter, and not just because I'm an incorrigible fanboy. The change is prose style is neat, and it's got good development on how another superkid has been psychologically affected by their power and makes the most of it. Above all that, I can't remember the last time I was so engaged with a character in so few words. Here's hoping for more Grace in the future if the Indian Justice League doesn't bring about the clusterfuck before then.

New hypothesis: the powers are dualistic, each one comes with an opposite partner. Evidence: Simon sees into the future, Grace hears into the past; the new logo (which looks good btw). Confidence level: 30%.
