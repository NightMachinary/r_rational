** Hey everyone, and welcome to, once again, the new Longest Chapter Yet! I was worried that this would finally be my first chapter to miss its deadline, but thankfully I was able to finish it in time. I'll be catching a flight tomorrow, so I won't be home until the afternoon. Once I am (and possibly after a nap), I'll update my site. Feel free to send all feedback and typos as usual, and I'll give it another pass for editing when I can. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for reading!

It's really just the anime adaptation that makes them famous for their immobility: in the games they can learn Tackle if they had it as a caterpie, so I figured they should be capable of at least some limited movement.

***** I was kind of figuring that it was more the limitations of the game; the designers didn't think it would work to have a mechanic where evolving stripped away learned moves. Especially in such an early stage of the game, where inexperienced trainers might not have any idea how to continue training their nerfed pokemon. And then everyone would be delaying the evolution of their bugs to minimise the time they spend in-cocoon...all in all, it would be a mess in-game.

But it would make more sense in-world.

****** That's true, it can definitely be interpreted as a game conceit. I don't think a pokemon can /ever/ lose a move naturally through evolution, which seems odd considering how much some of them change. But yeah, the idea that metapod can move a bit seems more reasonable to me than the idea that they can't. They're not quite cocoons from our world: just modeled off them.

Others like kakuna are probably not as mobile, but they can still shoot out poison stingers and string and whatnot.

******* Just spit balling and this would only work for the Caterpie line, but since Butterfree have​ some psychic ability, perhaps Metapod have a very mild version of this? Just enough for a small self levitation to putter around? And particularly mobile Metapod tend to have strong psychic abilities as Butterfree, though perhaps they tend to be weaker physically since energy spent moving around is energy not spent strengthening their bodies? Maybe it's stupid, but it's another way to square the circle if nothing else

** As always I am incredibly excited by the continued development of the psychic part of this story. Red not only developing his own powers (which, awesomely, seem to be unique without being overpowered) but also making a commitment to studying psychic phenomenon in general is literally a dream comes true for me when it comes to this fic.

You've even managed to explain why all top trainers aren't psychic: I'm guessing the advantage they gain from telepathy and mental cohabitation is tempered by the fact that they also have to experience the pain of their pokemon as well? Even if I'm wrong, now I really can't wait to meet Sabrina!

Also a quick question; in your story, how does the strength of psychic powers work? Is Sabrina very powerful (for a human) because her powers are just like that, or is it like how some people are born with bodies especially good at building muscle mass, but she still had to put in a lot of work to become the strongest in the world?

Or, more clearly, do psychic powers work like strength in real life, where some people have more potential but everybody can get pretty damn strong and the difference between the best and a very dedicated but limited person isn't too big; or is it like height, where if you're born a dwarf, that's that and there's nothing you can do to even come close to someone born to be normal or above average?

Thanks for the awesome chapter!

To put it basically, raw power comes from genetics, finesse and control comes from practice/individual talents/personal techniques. But the "raw power" difference between human psychics is a very narrow range compared to that of psychic pokemon (or even the strongest psychic humans and the weakest psychic pokemon).

** It always bugged me that you could teleport out of anywhere you want but you could only go to one specific place with them in the games. I rather liked your solution to that; obviously Abras can go wherever the hell they want, it's getting them to go wherever /you/ want that's the hard part.

I also really liked the battle between Red and Blue; there was a lot of good character interactions in what should have just been a fixed battle, and I liked the nods to their fights in the game; Blue's got a fixed list of pokemon, and it's up to Red to work around that.

** The conversation Blue had reminded me of a running theme in the boxing shounen Hajime no Ippo: the concept of "heavy fists." In the context of HnI, it means that boxers who rise to the top carry with them the dreams of all the people they've broken along the way, people who retired for whatever reason after losing to them, whether that be from injury, demoralization, or because their record just wasn't good enough anymore. It is part of the /telos/ of the boxer (though obviously they don't use that word) to seek more and more greatness, because as they become great, the people who have fallen to them are vicariously fulfilled in their accomplishments.

"In order to move higher and shine brighter, you use other men's dreams as stepping stones. For the sake of those stepped on, we must not be a mere pebble, but the greatest mountain they've ever seen..."

This isn't quite the same thing, because Blue is merely demoralizing the people around him with his speed of achievement, as opposed to blocking people entirely from their dreams by crushing them himself, but it seems to be gesturing at the same sort of conceptual space.

Thankfully, on the whole, the pile of features is increasing, but we can never be sure which ones will stick and which ones won't. For example, I'm pretty sure now that Alola included character customization that it's going to stay for all the New games, but the Remakes probably won't have it.

***** Well, based on Mister Daystar's definitions of humans with Typings, I'm guessing that there is a firm division for this.

One set would be the typings based on physical aptitude and or physiology, such as Fire, Electric, Water, and all the typings based upon the physiology of the Pokemon alone. These are typings can be deemed to be impossible typings for humanity limited genetics.

Second would be the typings reliant on the mental capacities and qualities of the of the subject, such as a Psychic's increased brainpower or a Dark's innate shielding. These are traits achievable by the genetic makeup of humanity itself. I'm quite excited to see how Sir Daystar can handle Fighting, Ghost and Fairy type Trainers in the future!

*** The way I understood it to work is that you can train an Abra two different commands:

"Register Teleport": An Abra who knows this command, when given the this command, will remember this specific location as a teleport destination. They can only have one such location remembered at any given time.

"Teleport": An Abra who has registered a location will teleport themselves (and if they're in physical contact, their trainer) to the registered location.

What Red was asking to be taught by Ayane was how to psychically connect with his Abra, so that when he gives it the Teleport command, Red can pick its destination, out of any location /Red/ can visualize well enough.

** What's the range of a ( human ) pyschic? Can they sense people from three feet around them or three blocks?

*** You know, I haven't quite figured out what the maximum would be in meters or feet or anything. 3 blocks for a powerful psychic seems too far, but not by much. But the main problem is that when you go that far the reception/quality of the reading takes a heavy hit.

So even if one psychic can sense minds from 100 feet away while another psychic can sense minds at 300 feet, the effective distance for both would still be something like 80 and 150 in terms of getting a clear enough sense to be more than mostly-meaningless mental/emotional noise.
