I just finished arc 5 of worm, and I very much did not enjoy the way it seems like it is going, so I stopped reading it. I only read worm because it was the only story in the [[/r/HPMOR]] similar stories list that had an audiobook that was up-to-date/complete, and I much prefer audiobook format to text format. Are there any other rational stories like HPMOR that have a complete or up-to-date audiobook? Other things I prefer are that the main characters be kids, and that at least one of them is a girl.


** If you didn't know, the HPMoR podcast is working on an audiobook of the first book of Crystal Society, which is quite good.

** This is a question that's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/873xm5/rational_fiction_podcast_recommendations_like/][been]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6omc2o/any_recomended_audio_books/][asked]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5us4xo/meta_rational_audiobooks/][before]], though not recently. Audiobook projects are slow work, so the linked threads should still cover most of what you're looking for that's actually available.

** I respect your opinion on Worm, though I feel like you should keep going, as someone who was also caught up early (and later) in worm, do not trust your ability to predict the plot, you are almost certainly incorrect. Unless you are like myself and have sought spoilers for some specific plot points that you have knowledge of, I did this and it made me dread some of the twists that I knew were coming, even then, I thing you should keep going, the skill with which the story and characters are written will likely exceed whatever expectations those spoilers have given you, it is a truly great book.

If it is the quality of the audiobook that has driven you off... Then I can't really blame you, some of the voice actors that do the earlier arcs can be pretty bad, the way I dealt with this is using a text to speech reader and a worm EPUB file to read those arcs, as I also do not really enjoy reading manually.

** Hey I know this isn't strictly what you were asking for but I have a suggestion that my assist you. I use the text-to-speech function of my ebook reader i use on my phone (Moon+ Reader). I know this may seem unpalatable at first but i remember acclimating to it over the course of a day or two.

If you listen to audio books for the quality of the narration, then i'm not sure if you would find this arrangement ideal, but if you listen to audio books for the convenience, this may be helpful for you.

*** I do the same... actually one of the mais reasons why I can't see myself with an iPhone is the Moon+ Reader app and it's TTS functionality... I couldn't find anything nearly as good on iOS.. also after finding that functionality I've never got another audiobook, i prefer the flexibility of being able to read and/or listen to the book.

** I'd suggest [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0fV8wR4wu4&list=PLqzaEaXT1reNb_FCxDOk7LZHj00tiouY7][Mother of Learning]], narrated by John Gilmore. It's a pretty good read, and it's time loop fiction which is one of my favourite tropes. I haven't seen it mentioned as rational fiction before, but it definitely fits the bill in my book, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. It's very much a rationalist Bildungsroman.

Well, this sort of fits that. Zorian and Zach are kids, though both are male. Kirielle is Zorian's younger sister, and Taiven is Zorian's older female friend, though I believe she's around 19 or 20? My favorite female character in the story would have to be Ilsa, though, even though she's a teacher and not a protagonist, per se.

*** I was intending to read that one, as it was some of the top posts of all time on the subreddit, but I couldn't find an audiobook. Thank you.

** I would recommend the book Anathem. It is available on audible and is quite good. The story setting and premise are truly unique and quite fun. It is rational-adjacent at the very least

*** For real, though. One thing that Wildbow excels at is that if you think you know where the story is going... you're probably wrong. What direction do you think it's going that you don't like? If you're right and it's a turn off for you, by all means quit. But we'd hate for you to miss out because WB subverted your expectations.

**** I find it is easy to predict what is going to happen in worm. At least, it is easy to rule out what will not happen. Whatever positive outcome you can think of, will be dashed against grimdark rocks and turned to ash.

I have rarely gotten so far into such a depressing story, no matter how well read.

***** That story is very much a "fight for your...happy? ending." story. If you don't like that it's depressing, I don't think that'll change. Not everything goes bad, but lots of bad things happen.

****** Of the many occurrences in Worm, nearly all of them have either a directly negative outcome or significant negative externalities.

The story is very well written, but part of building conflict and tension is the possibility of a positive outcome alongside the negative.

******* I liked Worm, and I liked it because it was dark, but I wasn't convinced it ended with everybody dying - I felt it was between the two extremes where you already know how it ends (everybody lives/dies). When I read Game of Thrones (first book) I got the impression that it was being told by someone standing in the middle of a graveyard, explaining how an entire nation fought against itself until everyone was dead. In Worm, the MC does make a difference, but the price is high. In both cases, you know it isn't the last book in the series, though.

*** Well, Worm may have realistic and intelligent characters behaving in complex ways, but that isn't, by itself, sufficient to make participation enjoyable. The same could be said of a skilled dentist and his assistant performing root canal surgery. If you are merely a neutral observer, or if you sympathise most with the dentist, you might like it, but if you feel for the patient, it might not be much fun.
