Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Also might work well for world building, but I watched a documentary yesterday about Kim Jong-un and it reminded me of a long standing thought. Kim Jong-un for those who don't know is the current leader of North Korea, but unlike some of the others he was educated in the west. In Switzerland, in particular from the age of around 10 to 18. There was some hope when this first came out that perhaps he'd be more understanding to the west as a result. He doesn't seem to have been, but my question is could he have been. Lets say your told tomorrow that you are Kim Jong-il's long lost son or daughter and will be inheriting the country. Assuming that there is no chance of anyone doubting the legitimacy of your inheritance (at least no more than there was for Kim Jong-un). What do you do? Obviously this depends heavily on an almost unknowable balance of power inside the country. One of the first things Kim Jung-un appears to have done is disposed with many of the political and military old guard.

I for one don't know. I don't think modernizing North Korea would be an easy task for anyone.

*** I'm reminded of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_Trade][Merchant Princes]] series by Charles Stross. The story is about a family that can jump back and forth between 2 universes, one of which never advanced beyond the dark ages, and the other being modern earth. Most members of the family are raised and educated in the dark ages world where the family's power base is strongest, but the main character (the long lost heir in this metaphor) was raised in our world with no knowledge of the other side. While she isn't dropped straight on the throne with no preamble, she still has influence simply by being able to swap between worlds, and attempts to affect a reformation of the way the family does business.

- I am going to be worried losing power internally and getting tortured/executed in a military coup first and foremost.

- After that... we need foreign dollars... the current strategy of exporting workers as wage slaves seems to be working okay for that purpose? I would try to use that to build up more modern skills in the population.

- I would cut back on the military posturing bullshit. (I can't think of any negative International Politics side effects to this, but I would be worried about the internal power dynamics with my army generals and such...)

- Cut back on the death camps for my own people bullshit. Seems stupid and wasteful

- Gradually (I'm think over a decade or two) dial back the propaganda from batshit insane with supernatural claims, to only extremely patriotic.

- Gradually scale back the Potemkin villages and stop my underlings from feeding me BS about the state of everything. This is critical for my long term plans...

- I would be divided, long term, between:

  - trying to develop more factories/technologies to produce products for export for a typical modern economy (and then import food/medicine/technology and such to stop the starvation and mass death).
  - Trying to develop purely self-sufficient/"green" technology to support a society with zero environmental impact. If I just ask for this without training my people to stop showing me Potemkin villages and such, I will get BS results. I want to actually succeed at this.
  - When/if I actually get model villages that at least partially succeed (some Potemkinness is to be expected, but I want it to at least develop some real technologies), I will invite Western Celebrities and documentary makers and such to tour it and see how effective it is, then sell parts of the technology to super rich Westerners that can afford it.

- Third, crazy idea... Right now, to do testing on rats or mice there is like a bunch of ethics form to fill out and have reviewed by an oversight board or two. To use electrodes for recording neural data from humans you have to use epilepsy patients that have them implanted already for medical purposes. Genetic modification on rats and mice also has ethical limitations. I will try to create a scientific environment with a much looser set of ethical guidelines, and then attract scientists from across the world who would prefer to work with less ethics. As an added bonus, my foreign scientists get servants and a wealthy style of living, so long as they keep doing their work and publishing papers (in foreign peer-reviewed journals that I know are reputable instead of internal journals that would become echo-chambers designed to satisfy me)

  - A big goal would be developing new medical treatments or important scientific results to showcase Best Korea's scientific community and mock how the Western's ethics hold them back.
  - The major end goal is genetic modification in Primates, then in humans. The techniques are already being invented, not at a level i would want to use on a human, but soon they will be there but no one will be willing to use them. I will sell designer baby services to super rich Western couples and such. Fixing disease, and maybe a few genes strongly correlated with intelligence or good immune systems.
  - I would have the elite Koreans get education and be allowed to work as grad students for these scientists.

That sort of economic web is hard to disrupt without getting a lot of people on board.

- *Become worthy* - Other than his legitimacy as an heir, the key here is to establish yourself in the actual power structure, through getting rid of people opposed to your succession and your policies.

- *Accept power* - Establish your legitimacy in the eyes of the people, through having propaganda place you appropriately in the DPRK's pantheon, and making the appropriate amount of loud noise in external politics.

- *Rule* - This is the most ambiguous, but as far as anyone can tell, life for the average citizen of the DPRK has not changed for the worse since Kim Jong-Un's taking power. In the end, that's the only kind of legitimacy that matters.

** What do you guys think about performance enhancing drugs, physical ([[/r/steroids]] [[/r/PEDs]]) and mental ([[/r/nootropics]] [[/r/afinil]])?

I have been reading about physical PEDs for years now, but I was never willing to take the step into buying illegal material from sketchy sources. From the research it does seem that these drugs being illegal is just a matter of "sport fairness" rather than them being extremely dangerous.

For nootropics I have been reading for a decade or so, and have been using Piracetam for nearly a decade as well. It has really been a lifesaver for me. Have been using Modafinil sporadically for a year as well, but I don't like how "robotic" it makes me in my thought process. Plus it makes it hard to fall asleep on that day, which interferes with my training. Pity because aside from that the complete lack of tiredness was quite useful.

Have you guys used any of these tools?

Definitely. The issue with PEDs being made illegal is not as much medical as much as it is political, since the whole movement to ban it had been born after the steroids scandal in Baseball in the '90s, and it has been simply pushed along until now. Hopefully with the current movement to legalize all drugs and educate people we'll see them being legalized as well.

Speaking of screenshot editing, discovering [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] led to a rather interesting journey of learning how to crop screenshots well. There are many criteria by which the quality of a crop can be measured--no wrapped lines of text; no large expanses of empty space; no interstitial comments that don't contribute to the joke--but they all boil down to how quickly and easily the image can be read on the screen of a phone. The spectrum of "good crop" runs from "minimum effort necessary"--e.g., [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][reducing browser-window width and stitching multiple screenshots together]]--to "above and beyond"--e.g., [[http://i.imgur.com/ysQqZP1.png][editing the code of the source page to make the content easier to read in proper sequence]].

*** On /The Tragedy of Shere Khan/:

Intellect is, from the middle-distance, indistinguishable from villainy. Heroes don't have to think, they have to act. In fact, it's usually better they don't think and we simply forget the heroes that get themselves killed in favor of celebrating the ones that save lives in times of need.

Intelligent sorts, blessed with foresight, tend to do a lot of complaining when nothing is going seriously wrong and (worse!) demanding lots of money and effort for disasters that aren't actually happening right now. When their foretold disaster does, indeed, arrive it turns out that even if we spent money and effort in advance it's STILL awful in ways even intellect couldn't predict... so that money, effort, and complaint is essentially wasted.

Sometimes the disaster doesn't come for decades, but the costs don't seem to decrease and the intellectuals /never shut up/.

Finally, if we /didn't/ spend the money and effort, and the disaster /does/ arrive exactly as they predict... then the complainers stand around telling us "I told you so," and supervising ineffectually, instead of just throwing their lives away like proper would-be heroes.

You'll notice, in most stories, that it's the villains who command armies and plan ahead. The villains set up plots and contingency plans, build cities and fortresses, establish quasi-government organizations. The heroes fight alone or in small groups, dragged through life by the whims of the villains that surround them on all sides...

...the villains preparing for the future, innovating, and generally running the world.

*** Is your goal just to detect presence or absence of this kind of stuff, or something more fine-grained? The issue with something like a VR headset is it obstructs traditional vision, so you would no longer be able to get visible light to your eyes.

Things like thermographic cameras definitely exist, and setting something up where you have a thermographic camera that pipes the output to a video encoder that encodes the video on the fly and hands it off to an android device or a google glass like device or something. This would let you watch the video as an overlay or as a HUD in the corner of your vision in addition to being able to see as normal.

So, this is definitely possible, but would be a big project. I'm sure what I just described has all kinds of problems that we haven't even thought of yet, but "figure out how to hook up a thermographic camera to your preferred display" seems like step 1.

Actually, after a few more hours researching how cameras actually work, I think I know what I need. Sure enough, they aren't nearly as convenient to work with as a pixel by pixel spectrometer. Instead they just use RGB filters... specifically, most of them use a bayer filter, which appears to basically be a grid of several colored filters per pixel.

Which is certainly a simple way of doing things, but it means that I can't just constantly gather full spectrographic data and then shift it to visible in varying ways like I wanted to, not with common cheap camera technology anyway.

Rather I'll have to switch filters to change things up. Which probably means that to start my experimenting with this project I should try to find cheap disposable black/white camera sensors, which would presumably lack the color filters.

**** Really? I swore I saw one stickied a while back. Is this a new policy?

***** [[/u/Automoderator]] posts them and the script hasn't changed in a long time. So far as I know, our only sticky has been the challenge threads.

Edit: A quick check of the script history shows that "sticky: false" has always been there. So unless one of the other moderators was manually stickying these threads, yes, it's always been the case.

Edit 2: I just thought to check the mod log to see whether any of the other mods had been stickying things, and they have not.
