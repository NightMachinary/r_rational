** I was driven to write a fix-fic for the ending of W.R. Gingell's "Spindle", because the ending basically avoided using any of the interesting plot threads and abandoned all of the interesting character development of the previous plot arcs.

I figure this might be relevant to anyone here who's read the book. I hope people will find it sufficiently rational-fiction-y in the way that it tries to deliver the characters acting competently and with thought-through plans, using their powers only in ways that have at least been hinted at previously (but mostly in ways that have been explicitly used, just not in quite that combination).

Constructive criticism always welcome etc but it was a first draft and I don't expect to edit it, since I mostly wrote it to get it the hell out of my head. I don't entirely recommend the book, even though I really enjoyed it; I'm just a sucker for journey-novels and whimsy.
