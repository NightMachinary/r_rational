** *Warning: Acceptance of a divine spark accompanying the portfolio of Death may have the following side effects:*

- Phenomenal cosmic power.
- +Itty bitty living space.+
- Sudden loss of temper.
- Uncontrollable murderous rage.
- Failure to realize the world is now slightly more malleable than cardboard to your hands.
- Shifting down towards the deep end of the alignment pool.
- Severe antipathy from much more powerful Gods who may want to squish you.
- Complete and total loss of morality.
- Eye-color change.
- The contempt and possible annihilation of your permanent essence for failing to follow rules set by overdeities.
- Stomachache.
- Accidentally murdering your father.
- Accidentally murdering a peace officer.
- Accidentally murdering abusive husbands.
- Y'know what? Let's just put 'accidental murder: general' here.
- Summoning dark spirits beyond the ken of man whose unchecked feeding could end all life.
- Chills.
- Hatred of all that is good and pure.
- Headache.
- Gothic aesthetic shifting.
- Depression.
- Ennui.
- Divine vendetta.

Which you probably have.

*** That's pretty much his thing, yeah. "I'm the biggest and baddest and also the only actual god; the rest of you are just spirits, demons, etc."

Unfortunately, he's actually strong enough and smart enough to back a lot of that attitude up.

**** Does he actually believe that he is the One True God, or is he somehow being clever in gaining a little more influence by making his followers unwilling to acknowledge other gods which makes them less likely to convert to other faiths for any reason?

***** The latter. As a bonus, having his people plant the idea that the other gods are not actually gods can plant a seed of doubt in worshippers of other gods, thereby weakening their faith. That makes them easier to convert to his worship or, at the very least, lessens the "oomph" that their worship provides to the god in question.

Of course, his followers don't /know/ that he's running a con on them.

** This story initially had Albrecht as Big Bad Evil.

Then we see that Albrecht is good, and Afi is the problem.

Then we see that Afi is good, and Neklos is the problem.

Now we see, that Neklos had to deal with shit like that.

Indeed, "Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil"."

**** Heh.

I was targeting something more along the lines of "stop the very sweet young girl who is, oh yes, he goddess of death, from going batshit crazy and massively evil", but I suppose yours works too. :>

*** I wouldn't say that Afi was good so much as that he wasn't interested in conquering the world any more. When he WAS doing the conqueror thing, he was quite happy to create living, sentient beings for the sole purpose of having their souls ripped out seconds after they came into existence...and that was just Tuesday. There's a reason that the Lich Kings -- some of the most powerful and Evil beings on the planet -- were terrified of him.

For that matter, I wouldn't even say that Albrecht is good...he slaughtered every living thing in two entire cities, right down to the dogs and cats, in order to accomplish his goals. It just so happens that his interests are aligned with those of the protagonist.

I'm glad you like the faction-not-alignment thing, though. I've put some real effort into that.

** Well, shit's going down. I get the feeling that Suze could just end up as a God of Death similar to Neklos. Seems like all her actions could've been avoided if the Gods had sat her down and said "You can do this, you can't do this, this is how you use your power" etc.
