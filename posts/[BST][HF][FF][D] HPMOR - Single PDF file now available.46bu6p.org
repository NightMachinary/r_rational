[[/u/Pollorcetyks]] created [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/46a070/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality_full/][a PDF of the entirety of HPMOR]], if anyone wants to grab it.

This was originally posted on [[/r/HPMOR]] and [[/r/FanFiction]].


** This is mistagged - it's neither brainstorming, nor hard fantasy, and it's probably not discussion.

*** Sorry about the mistagging. I meant to put "RST" instead of "BST", but what would otherwise be the correct tags? None at all?

** What about the one in the "official" website? Wasn't that in a single file too?

Also, wouldn't it have been better to wait until the epilogue?

*** Apparently they hate the font of the official version, as they find it hard to read. Ironic, considering the official version uses the same fonts as Rowling (and I love it so!).
