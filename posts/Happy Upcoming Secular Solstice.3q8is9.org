** Sorry that this is not rational fiction, but holidays can be considered a form of shared fiction and it's a rational holiday to boot!

I'll be attending. Is anyone else going? You don't have to share any personal information beyond that if you're concerned about Internet strangers. I'll just be thinking positive thoughts at you while I'm there. ;)

*** Are you going to the New York one? I think I'd rather attend that than hang out with moar of my own area's LW folks at MIT. Nothing too much against them, they're just kinda... cultish. I'm just not comfortable around them much of the time.

Lemme ask my IRL "rationalist" friend.

***** My other friend says last year's NYC Solstice sucked, so I might attend a new/custom one with him in DC. Might also attend the one in NYC.

I've never been to any of these before. How do they generally work?

****** Sorry, but I have no idea. I couldn't make the previous two years, but this time my college finishes a bit earlier than before and the Solstice is happening a bit later, so I can finally see what it's like. Even if it sucks, I still want to be able to support the idea of having a non-religious holiday. People might argue that holidays like Halloween should qualify as a non-religious holiday, but even if that's true, it's more of an occasion to eat candy and play scary jokes instead of any real sense of wonder. Here's hoping for the Solstice.

*** Oh is that a thing again this year? Lemme check where it's being held: I might come out of Christmas hiding to attend.
