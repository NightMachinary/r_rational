** I like it, but like the character admitted, what he did was not rational for anything else than crystallizing his own beliefs and values:

  We'd as well be 10 minutes back in time,

  For all the chance you'll change your mind.

You're also attributing solely value to managing to convince Storm to change her views when there are other rewards from his actions there.

  What I thought more important, and valuable to the debate, was his monologue at the end about the size of the universe, our relative insignificance, and how this, as well as advances in modern science, somehow inspire him. This is, I assume, his "vision" for life, his "meaning of life," his great manifesto for how an atheist worldview shapes someone's being.

  Which reveals how utterly empty his philosophy is. The fact that you're going to live twice as long as your ancestors is inspiring? Really? Modern medicine is what gives your (twice as long) life meaning? What hope does that offer the sick? The dying? The victims of failed medicine? Those without access to medicine? Minchin paints a vision of a world enlightened by science--but what good is all that science if your life still sucks? If you're too poor to eat, if you have no family, and no wine to enjoy while tossing around cliches? That dying infant, made up only of carbon, just like you and me, won't be able to do any of the things that Minchin thinks give his life meaning. Is the baby's life meaningless, then? A pointless speck in the universe whose existence is no more important than his nonexistence? And even if you do have a "good" life with a job and a wife--what advice can science offer you about how to treat her, or your children, or even worse, your enemies, or those who impede the march of almighty science?

  Atheist philosophy about the "meaning of life," which I assume Minchin is talking about, is utterly materialistic. It can't be anything else. And because it is, it's cruel, because no matter how bad your material world may seem, as a Christian, you are a child of God, and have a soul. It offers no hope and places no ultimate value on human life...which is comprised merely of carbons anyway. A viewpoint which, in my opinion, is far more ripe for criticism than the positions Minchin ridicules.

I'm an atheist, but I find myself agreeing with this (about this particular form of atheist philosophy). When I'm in great discomfort, thinking about the size of the universe and the advances of the modern science doesn't really comfort me all that much. Of course, once you've rejected religion on a sound basis, it's not really an option anymore, but there's a wide range of worldviews compatible with atheism. Personally I think something like extropianism or other forms of "secular religion" are far preferable to me. Sceptics and typical atheists sneer at this for its resemblance to religion. They think their particular kind of worldview is the baseline, not being aware of their own mental models with which they process the reality. This lack of self-awareness leads them to mistakenly believe they don't have such mental models and they just objectively process the world as it is, which couldn't be further from the truth.

Like fashion that's invisible to people living during that time but looks ridiculous later on, I think time will show that this particular form of secularism will just be a whim of time and future atheists will have radically different worldviews. Of course, so will extropianism, but at least it's more fun imo. Once you realize you will always have mental filters, why not just use those that make the life most fun?

*** 1) Taking solace in "living twice as long" /is/ fundamentally extropian in outlook, as it refers to the ability to improve the human condition.

2) It's not the /size/ of the universe per se that gives comfort. It's more the hindu-buddhist-ish attitude concerning our non-privileged position in the universe. It's easier to detach when you don't see yourself as separate and centered. "Guilding the lily" here is putting up fake dualist stuff like gods and souls, rather than appreciating your unity with the actual, real universe.

*** Appreciating the advances we've already gotten through identifying reality for what it is, is not necessarily exclusive to working or hoping for more advances further on though.

I don't really see Storm as advocating simply accepting the current state of affairs or not hoping or wanting more, but simply focusing our observational efforts on the testable reality instead of non-provable what-ifs.

The rest honestly just seems to me as noise, "I can't see how someone can have hope thinking X, therefore X is an hopeless worldview and cruel and any other objectives which are equivalent to horrible".

I agree with everything except this bit. You should not only /notice/ that the universe just sits there being lawful, you should /give thanks/ for it. From a certain extropian point of view, the fundamental unoptimized lawfulness of the universe is what makes the whole thing a fair game: we're not trapped, we make our own decisions, and our choices have real consequences.

Of course, Minchin's "Isn't all this... enough?" tends to result in my screaming "NO YOU FUCKING APOLOGIST!", but that's just because I went directly from moderate belief-in-belief-in-religion to hotblooded-maniac extropianism with no intermediate stage of "regular" disbelief.
