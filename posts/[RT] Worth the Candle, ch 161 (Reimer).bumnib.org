** Man that first section took me a while to realize which Reimer we were dealing with and whether he was speaking about the context of a campaign or not. I also feel like the 3rd person viewpoint feeds into my perception that Reimer's pretty shallow and I'm not sure that's warranted.

...

Having finished the chapter now, I'm struck by how minimally people in Aerb react to what I would think would be massively traumatic events. Reimer admits he doesn't have the skills or mindset to do this kind of thing regularly, but seems to think the breakpoint is whether or not one enjoys doing it, not whether one can go through it without mind-breaking stress making them non-functional for hours-years afterward.

I mean, Reimer spends quite a bit of time reminiscing in the lessons from a /disaster preparedness class/, and he is from some rural backwater of a village. Such classes and clubs have to pretty common to the functioning nations of Aerb. The practical people probably did practical things before the ignorant even recognized the danger.

This chapter is from Reimer's perspective. He is a supremely practice person, he noticeds the potential danger way before the regular people around him did, he reacted quickly by going to Lisi, then both of them did their best to escape the city...

... and he probably never had a chance to see regular people freaking out. Regular people probably started to freak out when the claws started to come down, but Reimer acted so fast that he was either in the car or fighting for his life during almost the whole period Mom Rathe was actually visable- if he was focused on efficiently avoiding the danger, would he waste time watching other people freak out?

***** I'm glad to hear it.

I would think twice about traditional publishing, though. From reading a lot of author's blogs and podcasts I think the general opinion on traditional publishing nowadays is that it's a pretty bad deal for all but the top 1% of authors, and in the process of getting worse. They give you a pittance of a percentage(+10% is only for the most special of darlings), they barely promote you(or not at all, in many cases) while expecting and demanding that you do it yourself via social media, and on top of all that they've begun to force their authors to relinquish all the more lucrative rights(like audiobook and overseas), which require no work on their part, whether to negotiate or to implement.

Here's a professional author's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/amdgz6/my_best_advice_to_authors_has_completely_changed/][advice to new authors]], with facts and figures provided, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6f1v96/why_del_rey_and_i_will_be_parting_ways/][another one]] where he explains in detail why left Del Rey over audiobook rights.

** And he knocks it out of the park, once again. Kudos, Mr. Wales, I have absolutely no idea how you've managed to make something as consistently high quality as this story for as long as you have, but I hope it continues on, at least for the foreseeable future.

Reimer is a really interesting character. He might be one of the first we've seen to have an explicitly overall-negative view of Juniper (correct me if I'm wrong of course, it's been a while since I've done a re read). For that alone I think he's far more interesting than maybe he's given credit for.

To be honest, my assumption for this arc was that Reimer would find himself lumped with a too-useful-not-to-bring-him-with-us ability, and kind of get forcibly taken along by Joon and Co., perhaps with his condition for consent being that Lisi gets dragged along as well.

This is more true to his character, though, so is probably more satisfying in the long term. On the edge of my seat for whatever follows.

I think that's how you think of long time friends, people who you know very intimately, warts and all, and whom you take for granted are still going to be around in 10 or 20 years. Whereas with a new friend you might make allowances if they become belligerent and get into a fight or whatever, with this kind of friend you know them so well --or think you do-- that you dissect their actions dispassionately in your mind(e.g. "Paul's always a petty little bitch when he's high on top of being drunk").

** I love having the occasional short chapter where we see the protagonist's growth from someone else's viewpoint. You can't do it more than once or twice, because then it becomes gratuitous “look at how amazing the protagonist is; aren't they the best?”, but there's just something so satisfying about blowing someone's expectations out of the water.

I'm probably not explaining this well.

But in any case I enjoyed this chapter a great deal, and I also thought it important to see the fear and devastation inflicted by Mome Rath from the point of view of someone who is basically a normal civilian. Juniper and Co. are so strong by now that it can be hard to remember, as a reader, just how terrifying it would be to have an antimemetic kaiju descend out of the clouds onto your town.

***** I think hating a genre, with the exception of a good example of that genre that is completely divorced from the rest, is kinda dumb.

Xianxia as a genre is an interesting concept, especially when considering its origin and environment. Most Chinese Xianxia are basically the same as our webnovels, posted on a site that is subscription based, and authors are paid per word for their work, and are expected to release new chapters /daily/ in order to stay Relevant aka paid. This formula is what lead to the extraneous and problematic series we see today.

The constant need for immediate updates meaning that authors get very little time for planning and editing and need to write as quickly as possible. Meaning they rely on tropes and cliches to pad their work while they try to insert as much of their own vision into it as they can.

This leads to some really bad stories, but some of them could have been great if divorced from that medium, so ignoring them based on that is a goddamn shame. Their are good Xianxia out their, and the success of western Xianxia like because of those inspiring western authors to try the genre divorced from its common medium, leading to even better stories.

So don't just hate it.

******** Ah, you're right

#+begin_quote
  My germ of a theory was that Uther had been the cause of most of the exclusions. Because the historical record of exclusions lined up with the numbering of exclusions as written on my soul, it was easy enough to make some guesses in that direction. Ice Magic was “Deprecated, Exclusion #16”, and that meant that it must have chronologically happened after the so-called ‘Invasion of the Ice Wizards', which had concluded by 4 FE. I wasn't entirely sure that Uther had been responsible for that, but his historians had written about him climbing the Glacial Minaret to face down the ruling council of wizards, and after he'd defeated them, Ice Magic had become a lost art. Maybe he wasn't responsible, but he was certainly implicated.

Notably, there's a blind spot right in the center of your field of vision, where your optic nerve is, because it ends right in the field of the retina, blocking out ability to see there. Your brain either uses the fact that you have two eyes to figure out what's missing there, or it makes a guess based on the surroundings, if that's not possible. Unlike with the bridge of your nose, you can't choose to notice that this blind spot exists and is being filled in by your brain.

This is very clever, and makes me want to read the story again to catch other bits of reference to later reveals / worldbuilding.

Also, this suggests that:

** Great story

10 cultures per species seems low. How many cultures would you say humanity has?

Is your period an issue for a blood mage? Seems like that would be one of the first things you could solve? She also seems like the type of person to have this worlds equivalent of an implant.

Also not sure that she seems like the person to be bothered by her period anyway. Hard to imagine the cultural norms around not having sex on periods still exist.

*** Ten cultures per species is an intentional lowball on my part, predicated on what "culture" would mean to someone on Aerb, especially someone from the agrarian ass-end of Anglecynn where most of their knowledge comes from radio plays or imported books. So to Juniper, "a culture" probably means distinctly different language, substantially different food, customs with little overlap, etc. A similar rubric applied to Earth would probably see (for example) all the Nordic countries mushes together, all the Pacific Islanders mushed together, etc. On Aerb, that would still leave you with (as a ballpark) 2,000 cultures.

Of course, talking about how many cultures there are is kind of a folly, since two different towns can have their own culture, even if they belong to the same ur-culture, so it all kind of comes down to how you define things.

***** Dwarves are a good case study, since every dwarfhold has its own culture, but they share a lot in common, especially in comparison to the cultures of other species:

- They live underground
- One of the primary professions is farmer/miner
- They consume /kear/ and its related products
- They're (mostly) unigendered
- They're parthenogenetic
- They generally speak something in the Groglir family of languages
- They generally share either ancient ancestral backgrounds, or cross-pollination from other dwarfholds, or both

All that contributes toward certain cultural trends that will be near-universally present in dwarves, and from a distance, it might look like there's just a monolithic "dwarf culture", even if there isn't. If you're looking slightly closer, you might divide up "dwarf culture" into broad categories, like "shadow city dwarf culture" or "agkrioglian dwarf culture" or "metropolitan dwarf culture", or divide them by the type of stone they live in (which informs a lot of their housing, city structure, and what the particular nature of their /kear/ is), or divide them by the common ways for structuring their societies, or even by their different ethnicities.

But for the Aerb version of Juniper, it's maybe ten, unless you want to get granular, and no one at the table objects to that characterization.

The cultural norms around shaming people on their period are stupid. But there are a lot of reasons to not have sex during one's period, none of which are really "eww periods" cultural norms, that practical. From cramps, to being too sensitive during it, to hygiene, to not liking blood (or for example getting it on bed sheets). Especially not for a first time having sex (though Lisi seems unlikely to care) since people like making good first impressions.

These are more likely to just be said up front, though of course as a blood mage you solve a lot of them. Even in our world saying I'm on your period is pretty meaningless when it comes to having sex so you'd think in this world they'd be more efficient and she'd say "I was too sensitive/cramping/etc'. In their world there will be tons of different periods with tons of different consequences.

Blood is pretty unhygienic - on Earth anyway - not just from a disease stand point (which are often sexually transmitted as well, but there are some blood borne only diseases), but from a cleanliness, bacterial, etc. stand point.

I mean they don't have plastics, they may not have cheap condoms...

But I think you are right that it's a weak excuse for a blood mage, and a modern society, that she even has periods like that for example (though I will point out most menstrual suppressing birth controls don't work perfectly for every woman, and many will still have irregular menstruation instead).

My main point was just that not having sex on one's period is a lot more than just a cultural norm.
