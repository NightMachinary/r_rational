** Blood Wings is the completed first book of a planned trilogy; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11830798/1/Team-7-s-Ascension-Lines-in-the-Sand][the sequel]] is updating at a decent pace. Not rationalist but realistic, with partially redone worldbuilding and history from the canon, and more realistic power levels and progression, and an emphasis on good tactics and being smart over the typical shonen punching.

** Read the first chapter and I wonder: why not give the Kage Bunshin to Naruto?

*** I haven't read it yet, but my guess would be "because that's been done to death and I [the author] want to do something different." That's why I changed it in Team Anko, anyway.

**** Huh. I thought it was because "Shadow Clones are fucking OP when you have a huge mana pool", and it's hard to balance around it.

***** The two are part of the same thing. If you want to have "shadow clones give memories" and "Naruto can make O(1000) clones" then you're writing A Drop Of Poison or something like it.

***** That is true as well, but it does make the story much more interesting with the various methods used by rational!Naruto to abuse it.

**** Understandable. I don't particularly enjoy fanfics without it, though, so I guess I'll skip on Team Anko as well.

** This is a really good one. In no other depiction of the Naruto universe, canon or otherwise, has Team Seven ever felt more like True Companions, closer to family than to friends.

*** The writing is good but my instinctive aversion to a more realistic (aka weaker) Naruto universe stops me from really enjoying it. It felt too AU to me.

It is hard to write a story with a consistent Naruto world that incorporates most canon feats-- you end up with (at minimum) the air supersonic reaction times for ninjas, ninja whose durability surpasses all known material's durability, and air getting set on fire by high-level ninja movement. Not to mention the absurd sizes for summoned beasts (amny times larger than tall trees), tailed beasts, Susanoo, etc.

Naruto canon is inconsistent, yes, but that wouldn't be so bad if it was just inconsistent where it needed to be for the sake of tropes like talking during battles. I could explain that away, or at least minimize it. Instead it's stuff like kunai made out of seemingly ordinary metal somehow harming ninja who can survive giant balls of fire, massive limbs of sand, being bashed into trees, etc.

Ninja durability is a mess. You can explain away offensive capabilities as ninja just not going full-out all the time, but it's hard to explain away ninja durability.

**** It doesn't look like a weaker or more realistic universe. Naruto just hasn't been able to use the two most op things in canon. The beast and the OPclone.
