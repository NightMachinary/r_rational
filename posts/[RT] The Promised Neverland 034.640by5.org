** I'm a little disappointed by the "everything was Norman's plan" reveal. I would have liked to see Emma step up and take the reins in his absence, instead of continuing to act as his subordinate.

*** I would have liked that too, but Emma's personality and handling isn't scheming- it's sympathy and people, getting them to work with her and trust her. She's the emotional and moral backbone of the group.

Norman the chessmaster, and Ray the cold and cunning hyper-intelligent individual. It's a good character dynamic in my opinion, although I would have liked to see more original and practical ideas from Emma specifically even if the overarching plan wasn't necessarily hers.

Though bringing the others in on it was her idea, I think.

You're right--I missed that on my first reading. It does look like that was something she thought of on her own and suggested to Norman. I still wish she had been more of an active participant, but I'm glad that she was able to contribute to the planning in a way that aligns with her own unique perspective and skillset.

** "Wtf. They told all these kids and no one cracked and now everyone's going along? How unrealistic."

And then I saw the final page. And felt slightly chastened.

** Honestly, I loved this chapter. Momma's been stumped.

** I wonder if they planned the last reveal too, just to stall Mama more.

*** I think it's very unlikely that Emma, at least, planned for or expected that to happen. Her goal is to get /everyone/ out, and she's consistently emphasized her unwillingness to compromise on that. It would be dramatically out of character for her to leave a sibling behind to facilitate the others' escape. I also don't think it could have been Ray, because he pretty clearly didn't see this chain of events coming--he expected to be dead at this point.

It's not impossible that one of the other siblings arranged it behind Emma's back, though. But I think it's more likely that this kid just didn't fully understand what was happening, or didn't believe Mama could really be an enemy. Out of all those little kids--most of whom aren't exceptional geniuses like the main three--there had to be one who would flub the plan.

**** You're missing the part where Phil is the #1 contender for having an agenda not yet known. He had a lot of screen time for a relatively irrelevant character

***** He's also REALLY young, though, and I don't remember any indication that he's a genius like 6-year-old Ray was. I'd be surprised if he's actively scheming--I'd expect his agenda to boil down to "I love Mama, I'm staying with Mama," if anything.

Not saying it's impossible, but his unusual amount of screentime works just fine as foundation-laying for his becoming Mama's hostage and complicating the escape. It raises the tension more if the kid at risk of being left behind is one we're somewhat familiar with. It doesn't necessarily have to mean he's pursuing his own agenda.
