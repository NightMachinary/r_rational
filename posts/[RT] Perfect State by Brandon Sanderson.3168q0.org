Just finished reading this and I had an absolute blast. Sanderson writes a lot of rationalish fiction in general, but this is probably the best fit for the genre of anything he's written so far. The blurb doesn't do it justice at all - it's much less about a date, and much more [[#s][about]] At least, that was my read on it.

I considered giving this [[#s][another tag]]

I can't recommend this enough, especially for people who already like Sanderson's work.

** Ok, reading the author's Excerpt. I will almost definitely purchase this, and read the whole story. It is engagingly written.

And then I'm going to snark like all hell at it.

Like, seriously, Kai is the /only real person/ in a whole sim? And honestly, man, a high fantasy desktop theme from the bloody ancient Baseline Ages? And you were /born/ into it rather than...

Which psychocidal jackass sanctioned this? Who the hell is the Wode, and why is their management so clearly and flagrantly evil!?

#+begin_quote
  Even thinking about the Wode turned me into a child again; Besk was right on that count. I'd commanded armies of thousands and I'd single-handedly forged an empire that spanned continents. But this . . . this made a spoiled brat out of me. I stopped inside the stairwell.
#+end_quote

No, you dumb bastard. Commanding armies of thousands of simpering roleplaying sim half-AIs and single-handedly (actually, see previous statement on "single") forging an "empire" that spanned entire /sim/-continents made as a /game/ made a spoiled brat out of you.

I DEMAND TO SEE THE MANAGEMENT. If sensible and decent answers are not forthcoming, I will confer with, let us call them, my comrades, and we will return with a sufficient military force to level your planet.

**** Ok, finally managed to buy and download the entire novella.

The author managed to successfully surprise me when it turned out that [[#s][]]

I still find myself with a deep urge to find the Wode and Xin Dey, /rip their guts out/, and go liberate the poor souls they've got in all those sims.

Like, seriously, even if they really are [[#s][]] in a really elaborate scifi version of the Mere Addition Paradox because some bastard took over the world and implemented utilitarianism... well, everything I just said is an elaborate description of why /that was a terrible fucking idea/.

And they don't even let [[#s][]]

And COME ON, no access to the real world whatsoever!? I mean, yes, it's a cliche of the brain-in-a-jar you-should-be-horrified-by-this genre, but other than portraying the villains as subjective-fulfillment utilitarians Gone Horribly Right, what's the fucking point in it!? It's /stupid/, it's something that no halfway intelligent techno-dictator would ever /bother/ with if they weren't /deliberately trying to conform to the tropes of Matrix-y existential dread/. Could someone explain what utility these people get out of imposing existential crises and angst on anyone vaguely brainy?

Fucking weaksauce shit! Fleets deployed! Planet will be disassembled to make a new planet with a healthily balanced ecosystem, and the perpetrators will be trampled to death by animals for the crime of Bloody-Stupid Cliche!

***** First off, I'd strongly encourage you to spoiler a lot of that. You just gave away a huge percentage of the novella, and not everyone coming to the thread is necessarily going to have read it.

I don't experience the same kind of visceral horror that you seem to about being deprived the opportunity to live in the real world. I think the point that Kai was attempting to make was that living in a sufficiently comfortable illusion can actually be preferable to living in a dystopian real world - which is a really interesting message. I don't strictly /agree/ with the message, but basically, this seemed to me to be a more "positive" take on Friendship is Optimal. I thought it was a pretty well-written rebuttal, personally.

****** My problem with this is not actually being horrified -- I don't seem to have the Existential Horror emotion built in properly. Kai's isolation would drive me insane from loneliness, not existential despair. My problem is how cheap, low-grade, and /lame/ it was.

Like, the pony version of this was /better/: the other people are really other people in that one, the upgrades are probably more available, and within the idiot-machine parameters you can keep yourself sane.

******** Uhhhh, regarding your two spoilers, that's not any /different/ from the other story: its "NPCs" were fully conscious, intelligent individuals /as well/, and in fact, the other story's Evil Overlord considered them to be of /equal/ value to the +harvested victims+volunteer uploaders. (Euphemizing because you're spoilering both stories indiscriminately.)

Besides which, I'm realizing that one of the primary reasons I've taken to ranting on this subject is because a frighteningly large amount of people really seem to think the only thing wrong with that other story was the /pony/ part, rather than the Matrix-a-like part. Whereas I always thought the /Matrix-y-ness/ was the problem, and the ponies were the /redeeming/ quality.

********* I admit I probably should be a little more selective with how I'm using the spoiler tags, but I'm trying to be very broad because Perfect State just came out and I'm sure a lot of people haven't read it yet.

I'd argue that the Matrix-a-like part and the pony part are both problems, although in different ways.

*Potential spoilers for Friendship is Optimal below - the section seems to be too long for me to spoiler tag it.*

The primary horror from the Matrix-a-like part is that people are being railroaded into uploading themselves even if they don't want to.

The horror from the pony part is that people are being forced into a state that may not in any way resemble what they're comfortable identifying as.

In Perfect State, the antagonist is essentially the mouthpiece for the viewpoint that the Matrix-like simulation scenario is inherently wrong.

I would argue that the conditions of the scenario are probably intended to be less horrific than the Optimalverse stories in three key ways, however - one in that each player is given a world that is tailored toward their personalities and desires, and two that they are integrated into the system at birth, rather than being forced into it at a later stage in life. The third is that there still appear to be human administrators, rather than an AI ruler, which means that there's a higher potential (imo) for getting out of the scenario eventually. If they have the tech to keep brains alive, it's highly likely they have the tech to give people new bodies.

Any of these points can easily be argued as still being as bad or worse than the Optimalverse, depending on your perspective.

****** Replying twice, no spoiler tags, on mobile, sorry.

Basically, I want the authors of Simulated Reality stories to stop trying to write cosmic/existential horror and do something more interesting. The genre conventions of horror seem to require that these authors pervert their Matrix Lord designs in ways that no sane Matrix Lord would think.

Consider: you're trying to keep people sane and fulfilled. On its own merits, do you surround them with a solipsistic fakery that will drive them to ennui, or do you surround them with conscious equals in a consistent world from the get-go? If you're smart enough to manipulate them, you're smart enough to spot that the solipsism is flagrantly suboptimal.

The only reason for the solipsism, the stupid fake challenges, and the stupid manipulation games is because you're trying to horrify the reader. If you were really an evil utilitarianism robot, you would largely work with people and keep their sense of reality healthily grounded, for cheapet and easier Fulfillment Points with no nasty aftertaste of ennui.

******* I didn't actually read this as being cosmic/existential horror. Kai was already [[#s][aware]]

I agree that someone could set up the scenario in a more optimal way, but I think that would undermine the premise of this particular story. If a perfect utopia had been constructed there would be much less room for conflict, and I think the idea here was to keep it deliberately vague if antagonist's perspective was right.

******** I find it a failure of imagination to suppose that a properly succesful utopia would fail to contain /lagom/ (sorry I can't link the wiki page for that) conflict.

I also still think it's just /lame/ from a storytelling perspective to use the simulation gimmick. Since long years of literary practice have established that what people want is the real world, at least try writing a story in which, if you're going to have sims, the real world is /available/ and /not at all dystopian/, in and of itself.

Maybe living in a personal or collective sim /is/ more fun, and thus The Thing to Do except for a few weirdos. But lying to people for their entire maturation and having two ontological classes of citizens is certainly not how you make the kind of sim-world most people will want to spend most of their time in. It's how you cater to the simulation-horror genre's cliches, and even played for subversion they're still cliches.

So, come on people, you don't have to show my perfect future, but /try/ showing a world where Everything Has Gone Horribly Wrong/Right is /not/ played /at all/, and instead make an interesting conflict out of sub-existential stakes.

Or hey, maybe even out of /personal/ ones. Personal can be important, when you get us invested in your characters!

********* You're certainly entitled to your opinion. Personally, I think the level of depth that they went into was appropriate for the length of the piece - it's just a short story.

The scenario being presented was neither strictly dystopian nor strictly utopian - that's why I'd call it a subversion. I could see people siding with the perspective of the protagonist or the antagonist, which I suspect was largely the author's point.

******** Besides all which, if your proposed future scenario is less fun than Reedspacer's Lower Bound (volcano lair with catgirls and /your own free ability to develop technology based on real science/), then it's not a subversion of the horror formula, it's just an epic fail at Appealing Alternate Realities. Simultaneously failing to beat Celestia's Lower Bound (ie: being /worse/ than that story's attendant negatives) is just shameful.
