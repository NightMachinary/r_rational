First off, if you want a non-fiction account of anterograde amnesia, I'd highly reccomend Oliver Sacks "The Lost Mariner" (collected in /The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat/ or available [[http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/pylyshyn/Consciousness_2014/Memory/05-sacks-1987-Amnesia_OCR.pdf][as a PDF here]]).

I think amnesia gets a little over-used in popular culture and especially speculative fiction, mostly because there are a lot of series out there and amnesia works wonders if you're in need of a reset button, or you need to artificially generate some drama. In many of the examples I gave in the challenge thread, amnesia is used for simple secret-keeping without terribly much thought applied to the wider implications (or the fridge horror of wiping away someone's experiences against their will). So it's at this nexus of "used too much" and "not thought through" that I think makes it fairly ripe for deconstruction.

Anyway, this is the companion thread for the weekly challenge. Found a story that seems like it fits? Have some insight into the challenge topic? Post it here.


** One of the best works in this area is Sam Hughes' Anitmemetics Quartet: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][part 1]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/introductory-antimemetics][part 2]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][part 3]]

**** Take a look at the [[http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/qntm][drafts page]] if you don't mind spoilers.

Personally, I'd just wait until they're released. They're not very good right now.

** When I was in my late teens I was in a bicycle accident that caused a concussion. For a few hours I couldn't remember anything that had happened since I'd woken up that morning. I knew /that/ I'd woken up, and that I'd had breakfast and a number of other incidental facts... but they were in discrete mental clumps rather than tied together into a narrative in my head. I'm not sure now whether I knew them experientially or just via logical deduction.

Over the course of a few hours the links reestablished themselves and I regained the lost time. I've always thought that a character in a similar situation would be interesting fodder for film or short fiction.

** As Oliver sAcks alludes, there are non-fiction examples of memory loss that drive our understanding of how memory works.

Clive Wearing is a good example -- he developed severe HSV encephalitis that hit his temporal lobes hard and only has 10 seconds of short term memory. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwigmktix2Y]]

The experiment that is referenced in Memento likely is about the real case of Henry Molaison, also famously known as patient H.M. [[http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happens-when-you-remove-the-hippocampus-sam-kean]]

** Feel like this is an obvious one, but, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)][Memento's]] a pretty clear example of Amnesia done well in fiction, I feel. I would never call it a rational movie, per se, but I think it does a good job of portraying what the experience may actually feel like, to understand that you're supposed to BE someone, but not having any of the requisite understanding of who that someone is.

*** It's also a short story, [[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a1564/memento-mori-0301/][/Memento Mori/]] written by Christopher Nolan's brother, Nathan Nolan. I believe both are influenced by the non-fictional "Lost Mariner" (linked in the OP), a case study where the name given is "Jimmie G".
