I read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Pokemon Origin of Species, The Two Year Emperor, and I have finished reading a few other works, such as The Last Christmas, Metropolitan Man, and Worm. Recently, however, an excellent bit of fiction caught my eye. It was Mother of Learning. It's obvious that this story isn't exactly new, but I had never heard of it. I want to know what else I have missed. I'm sure there is wealth of fiction out there just waiting to be read, but who knows where to start?

edit: I've also read Blindsight and Echopraxia


** I don't know that you're missing anything that hasn't been recommended on this subreddit or mentioned by [[/u/xamueljones]]. Eventually you reach a point of diminishing returns, where you've read all of the low-hanging fruit, and the next best thing is either worse than what's come before, or much harder to find. (This is true of a lot of things - I occasionally get into periods where I indulge in some new media or genre, but consumption is a lot faster than production, and it's easy to burn through the top tier of nearly anything within a few weeks.)

Anyway, since you're probably covered as far as the top tier of stuff that this subreddit would recommend to you, here are my standard recommendations for non-rational fiction:

#+begin_quote
  */The Name of the Wind/*: main character is super smart, uses his wits to get out of (and into) trouble, and is mostly awesome - there's another book out right now, */The Wise Man's Fear/*, with the third, concluding volume coming at some point in the future (and a few short stories in the meantime).

  */The Lies of Locke Lamora/* is about a bunch of gentleman thieves, has a lot of trickery, deceit, plotting, and meta-plotting that I think readers with my tastes would enjoy. The first book is self-contained; there are four books out right now, and they're likewise clever and enjoyable, with lots of the "solving problems under ridiculous constraints" type stuff that I like. It's also a series with some fantastic worldbuilding.

  */Mistborn/* is a fantasy trilogy that (like most things Brandon Sanderson writes) has a very structured magic system, which hides lots of secrets that a clever reader can figure out. I'd actually recommend most of what Sanderson has written, if only because of the attention he puts towards making his worlds make sense and follow rules. */The Stormlight Archives/* is a currently unfinished series, but some of the best stuff that he's written - only two of a projected ten books are complete though, so don't start on this if you don't like unfinished things.

  Pretty much anything by Charles Stross. */Accelerando/* is what I consider to be the definitive Singularity novel, and is absolutely densely packed with ideas. */The Laundry Files/* is his James Bond meets IT department meets Cthulhu series. */Palimpsest/* is his time travel novella, and what I'd consider one of the single most important entries into that genre. */The Merchant Princes/* is generally considered to be a love-hate thing, but it goes from "standard worldwalking outsider fantasy fiction" to some utterly awesome and mindblowing stuff in the late books - get the British rerelease if you can, which edits things down.

  For deconstruction/reconstruction, I'd recommend */The Magicians/* trilogy by Lev Grossman, which is sort of a take on the Chronicles of Narnia (and a little bit Harry Potter). They're supremely literary, in a very good way. The main character is sometimes a jerk, but try to get past that.

  For deconstruction/reconstruction of the superhero genre, I'd recommend */Soon I Will Be Invincible/* by Austin Grossman (Lev Grossman's twin brother!).

  I also can't go without recommending */It's Superman!/* by Tom De Haven. */The Metropolitan Man/* owes a lot to that book.

  Iain Banks wrote all the Culture books, which I'd recommend, but specifically */The Player of Games/* or */Surface Detail/* for the rational crowd, though I think they're all pretty great.

  */World War Z/* is a reconstruction of the zombie genre, told in the style of an oral history. I've heard the audiobook is also quite good, if you're into that sort of thing. They made a movie out of it (loosely) which wasn't very good.

  Most things by Neal Stephenson, though he's an author that gets mixed reaction. */Anathem/* is quite long and has lots of explanations of philosophical concepts, which I think would make it a good fit for people who really like the kind of things that I like. Stephenson is terrible at endings.

  Finally, */The Wizardry/* by Rick Cook is about a computer programmer who gets summoned through a portal to a world of magic and has to learn all the rules of magic to save the day. I only ever read the first book, but it stood by itself pretty well, and is available for free online. Come to think of it, a similar story that you might like is [[http://www.erfworld.com/book-1-archive/?px=%2F001.jpg][*/Erfworld/*]], a webcomic about a wargamer who gets sucked into a wargaming world and has to learn its rules to survive, and is also pretty good.

  Anything by Vernor Vinge (with only a few exceptions) is good; */A Fire Upon The Deep/* and */A Deepness in the Sky/* are two are very well thought out space opera, and often reccomended as books for people who like "very alien aliens" (meaning not just the rubber forehead aliens of Star Trek). */Rainbow's End/* is a near-future Singularity fiction piece (Vinge is the guy who popularized the concept of the technological singularity) with artificial intelligences, brain-computer interfaces, and lots of cool stuff. */The Peace War/* and its follow up */Marooned in Realtime/* are two books in the vein of "introduce a technology that does something cool, then extrapolate". Overall, Vinge offers a very good blend of intelligence, well thought out world-building, and strong characterization.

  */Jumper/* by Stephen Gould features a single person with a single, well-defined superpower. The implications are given a lot of thought, and there are a large number of exploits that are well-defined. They made a movie out of the book, which wasn't very good. The follow-up, */Reflex/* is also quite good, and expands on the fictional science. The third in the series, */Impulse/*, leaves something to be desired and isn't necessary to read. The fourth, */Exo/*, just came out recently, and I consider it a return to form in most ways.

  */Superman: Red Son/* is a graphic novel premised on Superman's spaceship coming down in Russia instead of Kansas. Superman grows up communist, and lots of things change. It's basically authorized fanfiction (though not quite as smart as some of these other suggestions are).

  */The Time Traveler's Wife/* is a book about time travel, specifically the stable time loop kind. It's sort of odd to me that it's marketed as a love story more often than it's marketed as straight science fiction, but it's a very good book regardless, and a very good story. Mostly when I see people recommend it, they preface it with "Don't judge me but ..." which makes me think that it has some kind of unfair stigma attached to it for some reason (perhaps just because of the marketing). They made a movie of it, which wasn't terribly good.

  */To Say Nothing of the Dog/* is my favorite book by Connie Willis. It's a comedy of manners set in the Victorian era with time traveling historians. It uses stable time loops as well. It's quite funny, and mostly about a missing cat.

  */Altered Carbon/* and the other Takeshi Kovacs novels are great, with interesting concepts, a badass main character, and a lot of clever puzzles for the reader to solve.

  The */Discworld/* series by Sir Terry Pratchett consists mostly of deconstructions and reconstructions of fantasy tropes. It's generally agreed that the first two books were where he was finding his footing, and the series began to go downhill at some point in the past few years (though there's some disagreement about precisely where). I personally think it's best to start with one of the standalone novels like /Small Gods/, which will let you know whether you like his style. He also co-wrote */Good Omens/* with Neil Gaiman, which is one of my favorite books.

  */The Handmaid's Tale/* by Margaret Atwood is in the theme of science fiction as social commentary, like */1984/* or */Brave New World/* (which I'd suggest you read mostly for cultural literacy - I consider /1984/ to be the superior of the two). It's mostly about gender. Similarly, the MadAddam trilogy is mostly about ecology (though I still haven't read past the first in the series, which I felt was fine as a standalone).

  I was really enamored with Kurt Vonnegut when I was younger, but I think he's one of those authors that I sort of outgrew. Nevertheless, I think that */Cat's Cradle/* is a wonderful book, and I still reread it from time to time, which I can't say about many books. I also really liked */Breakfast of Champions/*, which has a lot of pictures drawn by the author, and is written as though for an alien who was unfamiliar with human society.
#+end_quote

As for what I'm reading at this very moment, I just finished up /The Paper Magician/, which ... frustrating in its worldbuilding, weak in its plot, and pretty good in its characterization. I'm currently alternating between /The Runelords/ and /The Blind Assassin/, neither of which I've read enough of to give a firm opinion on.

*** Giving anything by Brandon Sanderson a giant thumbs up here. He's amazing at building magic systems that are colorful and fantastic, yet interact logically with the real world. As alex mentioned, you can figure out bits of the magic system ahead of the story if you pay attention and think carefully. I recommend him to everyone, usually starting with the Mistborn trilogy. He's brilliant at playing on classic fantasy tropes, twisting them without mocking or breaking them- instead he just moves the pieces on the board around a little and says, "huh. Wonder what happens now? Guess we'll find out!"

**** Gonna add to this guy that if you want to give your heart to Brandon Sanderson, as I (We?) have, you'll want to work through his main meta-series (The Cosmere saga, which has many stories taking place on different worlds in the same universe, with some interconnectivity) in the following order: Mistborn, Elantris or Warbreaker, the other of Elantris or Warbreaker, THEN read The Stormlight Archives. Not only is Stormlight Archives a huge investment of time, the series contains many allusions to events that happened in earlier books, as well as some cameos from other series which promise to become important later.

**** The problem is that (at least for me) Brandon sanderson writes one dimensional characters and really stodgy plots. It is like he puts all of his effort into the convoluted magic systems (overly convoluted for my taste, like, yeah, they are consistent, but they still reek of "woah, what if people did magic by constructing block puzzles?") and then gives up on the actual stories.

I actually think he is a good writer, he finished Wheel of Time admirably. Maybe he should do more fanfiction?

*** To any list lauding /The time-traveler's wife/ and /Jumper/ for their incredibly detailed and well-thought-out explorations of all the benefits, drawbacks, and consequences of their premises, I would add H.F. Saint's */Memoirs of an invisible man/*, which does for invisibility what the former two do for time travel and teleportation. The book is hands-down the most intricate, well-developed, sensible treatment of invisibility I've ever come across, while also being a nail-bitingly suspenseful man-on-the-run thriller.

[The one caveat I have is that it begins---within the first 10 pages---with a somewhat lengthily described sex scene, which can give rather the wrong first impression as to what sort a book it's going to be.]

Trying to sell Pact to a rational fiction crowd would be like trying to pitch celery to a carnivore (In any universe but the Honorverse) but his understanding of characters, world building, plot arcs, scenes, sequels, Easter Eggs, foreshadowing, and other parts of writing is extremely solid.

Pact is NOT rational fiction. If you try to look at it from a rational fiction point of view there are so many holes that it can't be enjoyed. Looked at as a non-rational story, I find it to be a fun read, and frequently thought provoking.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1][Saruman of Many Devices]]: In /The Lord of the Rings/, remember how Saruman started an industrial revolution, and how awesome that was? And remember how he threw it all away by siding with the local dictator warlord instead of ushering in the Renaissance and bringing the entire world out of the Middle Ages, and how much of a letdown that was? (I suppose Tolkien did call it /Middle/-Earth for a reason). Well, user Saphroneth decided that it was a letdown too, and wrote this fic. Basically, Saruman sides with the free nations, and designs and mass-produces guns and outfits his army with them. Awesomeness ensues.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6375554/1][Semper Victoria]]: Similar to the above. An Enlightenment-pov interpretation of the aftermath of the movie /Avatar/. Humanity needs unobtainium to survive, so we return to Pandora. Takes a more nuanced look at the ensuing massive culture clash than the movie's "trees good technology bad".

  Pandora's Star (and its five sequels (yup, a new book just got finished!!)), by Peter F Hamilton: long-future space opera science fiction. Everyone's immortal via technology and transhuman civilization is a network of habitable planets spanning intersteller space connected by wormholes. Then we encounter the Prime, truly /alien/ aliens the way [[#s][/Madoka Magica/ spoilers]], aliens with vastly different utility functions. Awesomeness ensues.

That is, it's not set in the MLPFiM-verse, it's just about a GAI created by people on Earth, who is styled after Princess Celestia and whose overall goal is "satisfy values through friendship and ponies". The storyline of MLPFiM doesn't really have anything to do with it.

It is a Twilight fanfic with rational!Bella.

I also enjoy the ongoing but extensive fanfic [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With this ring]]. It is a Self Insert where the main character (the author) wakes up orbiting Earth the DC Young Justice universe and finds himself wearing an Orange Lantern Ring. Lots of rational problem solving and logical consequences, though the main character is a tad powerful.

A Lord of the Rings fanfic, where Aragorn, Gandalf and elves are evil and Mordor is (mostly) good. Tolkien's story is propaganda. The main part of the story is after Mordor falls. It reads more like a fantasy spy thriller.

It is more rational than Lord of the Rings as it tries to make the economics, politics, technology, etc more consistent.

** I'm reading four works on a regular basis at the moment.

Pact. A web serial about a magical boy whose entire world is built to torture and twist him into a malevolent being of evil. Awesome to read, really dramatic, I have recommended it to lots of people and the author [[/u/wildbow]] is a redditor so in touch with the people.

A cloudy path. A worm/ supreme crossover fanfic. Excellently written, everyone seeks to accomplish their goals well, lots of pain and agony. Lackscreativity isn't on reddit as far as I know, but is accessible elsewhere.

With this Ring, another fanfiction involving the orange ring and all sorts of varied shenanigans, shows what you can really do and what you can't with a magical ring of super powers, the value of teamwork.

RWBY the gamer, another fanfiction about a person who gains the power to use the power of video games in his life and seeks to use it to save everyone against an endless run of unstoppable monsters.

Two year emperor, about an emperor taking on DnD and abusing the rules to defeat gods. Sadly less regular, merely once a week.

Mother of Learning too. Once a month.

I do read a lot of non fanfiction stuff, but most of the low hanging fruit, really good stuff, I've read, or tried and not liked. There are the cosmere books by [[/u/mistborn]] for example, but even he can only write two or three books a year. A lot of other authors I like such as GRRMartin or Patrick Rothfuss take a long time to do new books. So I really appreciate regular good stuff.

For Pact, I get a lot of enjoyment out of it so I pay wildbow via patreon. If you do enjoy a web serial author or author like that you should definitely do so too. If you want more of this good stuff on a regular basis paying for it helps a lot. I've bought all of Brandon Sanderson's books.

Plus, paying top tier authors like wildbow means more material for fanfiction. I like having some little pleasure to wake up to in the morning before work. Pact definitely hits the spot, and so do a lot of the derivative works.

Both of them talked about making video games in their universes which would be great if that ever finished too. Rational games are fun too.

** Online fiction:

[[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]]: I'm enjoying Pact. Not as much overall as Worm, but there are some moments that are pretty awesome like [[#s][6.11]]

[[http://unillustrated.wordpress.com/monster/][Citadel]]: It's exactly what would happen if you cross Super Powereds' setting with characters from Worm. Not enough story yet to get a really good feel for how it's going to turn out, and the chapter length leaves something to be desired, although the update rate makes up for it. So far, I'm willing to keep reading it, which is more than I can say for most serials I start.

I second [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], and its sequels. Entertaining time loop shenanigans, and the characterization is pretty good ([[#s][Pinkie Pie]]). It's worth mentioning that I've never watched the show, or had any interest in watching the show, but I still found it fairly entertaining.

While we're on the subject of ponyfic, [[http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html][Fallout Equestria]] is one of my favorite pieces of fiction. Dark MLP!Fallout, not much else to say.

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][The Optimalverse]], as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, is also pretty good. Satisfying values through ponies and friendship has never been more gratifying. Or terrifying, depending on your viewpoint and whether or not CelestAI's actions creep you the hell out.

[[http://leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] is a webcomic that I enjoy almost as much as the author's comments. There were quite a few times while reading it and thought "Huh, you know, that's a good point. I never thought of it that way."

[[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?116836-The-SilverClawShift-Campaign-Archives][The SilverClawShift Campaign Archives]]: What everybody wishes their DnD group was like. Fairly epic campaign.

[[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Old_Man_Henderson][Old Man Henderson]]: what every GM is terrified their group will be like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]]: A DC universe spanning conspiracy. Probably better if you have previous understanding of the universe, but I found it entertaining with just a layman's knowledge base.

Good ol' paperbacks:

Really enjoyed Blood Song, had a few issues with Tower Lord, but overall two very good books.

[[http://www.amazon.ca/Red-Knight-Traitor-Son-Cycle-ebook/dp/B007ZFPUL2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419178346&sr=1-1&keywords=the+red+knight][The Red Knight]] was pretty good as well, although it did have a tendency to get caught up in medieval armor jargon. I have no idea what most of those word were, but understanding is not necessary to enjoy the story.

[[http://www.amazon.ca/Dragons-Path-Dagger-Coin-ebook/dp/B0047Y16LC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419179208&sr=1-1&keywords=the+dragon%27s+path][The Dragon's Path]] is the first novel in the Dagger and the Coin series, and it looks pretty promising. Some entertaining political/economic maneuvering.

For fans of the Dresden Files, Benedict Jacka's [[http://www.amazon.ca/Fated-Alex-Verus-Benedict-Jacka-ebook/dp/B005GSYZAM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419179019&sr=1-1&keywords=fated][Fated]] and it's sequels have much the same vibe. So far, it's only about as good as the early to mid Dresden Files, but the author has been improving steadily.

He's finished two unrelated serials before so it's far more polished than you would expect from a new serial.

Also, *Contact With Chaos* by Michael Z Williamson. It's a first contact scenario where humans are the technologically advanced species and the aliens are technically stone aged, though societally much more mature. A bit of libertarian-esque propaganda thrown it but not so heavy as to distract from the story. However, it is book three in a series. I think it stands alone but it's better in context and the other two are well worth it if you like military SF. The Weapon and Freehold.

** With the Christmas break, I've finally gotten around to reading A Song of Ice and Fire (also called the Game of Thrones). At college I never seem to find time to get a lot of reading done at once, so I mostly just kept up with web serials and fanfiction that I liked. So now that I have the break, I'm binge reading all at once. I finished the first book yesterday and am on the second book now. The characters definitely are not rational, but they do have consistent motivations and are competent at what they do. I've heard enough about the series and the author to expect any character to die at any time, and I think that has enhanced my enjoyment greatly.

For webserials and fanfiction, mostly what you would see recommended on this subreddit. The two I most look forward to updates for:

- Following the Phoenix, I would consider it equal to canon!HPMOR in some ways, perhaps better if you felt the HPMOR focused on Harry too much and you felt HPMOR was anti-feminist. The author switches viewpoint characters enough so that it feels like every character has agency (especially Hermione). There are some complaints that the plot feels railroaded... but I think that is just a side effect of Quirrel going all out with his manipulations.

- Pact. I don't like it quite as much as Worm... but I absolutely loved Worm so I still come out liking Pact a lot. There is arc fatigue in a few places where the story gets drawn out. Some of the fight scenes can be really confusing because of magic altering the viewpoint perspective. Also, there is in-universe reasons for the main character getting constantly screwed and his perspective being off... but it can still be annoying at times.

** Currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]], which falls under the category of romance, mainly. It has only one Level 1 Intelligent Character, specifically Hermione, and she's appreciably overpowered. But it's a bit of fresh air for me, since most of the Harry Potter fanfiction I've encountered has only Harry as a L1IC, often overpowered, and with a harem to boot; and on top of that, Harry's excessive power allows him to smash through his primary conflicts.

I feel like the degree to which people defer to Hermione in this story is greater than typical for people to defer to Harry in Harry-centric stories, but I don't particularly trust my judgment not to be skewed here. I am aware of unconscious bias and know that it generally favors men and hurts women in our society.

This story is not what I would most recommend, but it is what I'm reading at the moment. It's decent but a bit long for what it is.

** (Cross-posted from the "If You Liked Time Braid" topic) Here's a recommendation: [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], a good MLP time-loop, which I enjoyed despite having only watched 4 episodes of the show. It starts off Time Loopy, then shifts its focus to new and interesting magic and plot mechanics. (Read: it doesn't spend 50,000+ words in loops with no permanent threat to the heroine). Twilight's characterization would greatly appeal to HPMOR/LW fans, and I had the impression that the author was already part of the community. I would safely categorize it as a "rational" fic.
