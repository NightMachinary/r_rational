** Now *that* was a fight scene. This feels like a return to form with Naruto starting to utilize his Uzumaki Style of fighting again.

With luck, Naruto will let this result take him down a peg. Naruto had such a big advantage with those clones, combined with henging, and Shikamaru still outplayed him at basically every single point besides his last-minute surrender from Tenten. The absolute best part of that was that Shikamaru had earplugs in the entire time, and never gave it away, which either means he read Naruto's lips when he yelled at him, or predicted how he would react with ridiculous precision. This'll teach Naruto to underestimate his opponent.

*** The earplugs thing is also great because even if he was somehow struck or caught in the range of the auditory genjutsu, he STILL was fine. He actually had an extra degree of failsafe available.

** First reaction: Yeah, I was pretty sure Shikamaru was going to advance. Was about 50/50 on whether Naruto would be outright defeated. I like the fact that while this Naruto might be much more rational, he's /not/ just The Smartest.

Second reaction: THAT'S GREAT AND ALL, BUT OUT OF NEJI AND HINATA, WHICH ONE, IF EITHER, ADVANCED???

**** By the way, something I forgot to ask. Are the Nara avoiding this weird mistake that I feel like they made in canon that is to wear their equipment on "standard" locations?

I mean, in canon, during this fight, after Shikamaru gets Kin with the Shadow Repetition, he moves to grab a shuriken and obviously she ends up grabbing one too since both of their pouches are in the relatively same places. If he had just wore his on the other leg he could've grabbed one of hiks shuriken and she would have nothing.

Similarly, if a Nara ninja ever finds an enemy, and gets the Shadow Repetition on, they can make the enemy grab one of their kunai from somewhere, where, presumably the Nara would have nothing and make a stabbing motion at your own neck which would be completely harmless for the Nara and lethal to the enemy ninja

***** Actually, the chapter covers this.

It says that Shikamaru wears his kunai holster on the left while most ninja wear it on the right. During the battle, Kin also swaps hers to be on the left, thus preventing "the obvious Shadow Imitation trick" (which you've described). However, Shikamaru has a backup plan ready for this exact eventuality (draw a bladeless, "safe" kunai for himself while forcing Kin to draw a real one).

****** I think canon covers this too. One time, Shikamaru caught Gaara with the shadow and when Naruto punched Gaara, it hurt Shikamaru as well. So making an enemy cut himself might not be safe.

However, it can still serve as a bluff to make them surrender.

******* I interpret that as a case of "forced movement works both ways, so if something moves the target, the feedback moves you too, potentially violently". Presumably, if you cut someone's throat, you'd immediately break the link before their death throes affected you (or maybe if you were strong enough you could hold them still even then).

*** Well, so the big guy has a power that effects physical size in fun awesome ways. What if Shikamaru's core "power" is mad boost to mental capabilities, particularly, speed of thought? I can easily imagine a huge power cost difference in speeding up everything that doesn't move versus speeding up anything that does move. I mean, that's a common thing in Mage: The Awakening - stuff that effects just you is easy, but breaks as soon you as interact with anything outside.

If that's the case (or, if I wanna be all egotistical, NOW the case...), however, it means the Shadow technique is either an unusual application of that power (moving things that don't have mass, or something) and/or they're both good at and have branched out to particularly useful abilities given their core strengths (critical application of slight action). The other one I would then expect is a perceptive technique like the byakugan - something that, among other things, lets you perceive in detail outside of not only the focal point of your eyes, but through your head, as the major weakness in "I am now thinking at 100x" is getting new information....

Which kind of in turn leads into "combos are broken" - as seen in Time Braid and/or Drop of Poison? - but really as seen in /the enlightenment/. Which is now making me think about interesting historical relations between "sharing information" and "people not trying to kill you with what you taught them"...

Quickened total perception would be op as fuck.

*** Nope. Humongous scrolls are all well and good when you have time to unroll them to the seal you want to use, or when you're chucking the cutlery drawer at the enemy and it doesn't matter what comes out (Twin Rising Dragons), but in mid-combat something smaller and more specific is better. Think Kakashi's dog scrolls.

****** It is a LITTLE ambiguous, but the size at the end there could apply to either "Naginata" OR "scroll" by english grammar rules. In that sense that I could say:

"I ate a chicken slice with my hand the size of my face" - it would be unclear which thing is the size of my face. Or I could say:

"He drew a sword from his scabbard covered in blue gems" - it's not clear whether the sword or the scabbard has blue gems

Technically this is the kind of thing you could get dinged on by an english teach who is a real stickler. That being said:

"He at a small egg from a basket that was a foot long" while technically grammatically ambiguous, is not actually ambiguous, because the first half of the sentence says the egg is small, so it must be the basket that is long. By the same token, a full-sized Naginata can't be twice the length of her hand, so it must be the scroll that is.

Try to avoid writing sentences like this I guess

******* Well while we are stickly (is that a word?) about the english language: The full-sized qualifier actually added to my confusion because she is about 12/13 in canon when she fought the first time in the exam and I thought Velorien described the size of a full-sized (children) naginata relative to her own size.

******** Ah, I see! Yeah, I also didn't know what a naginata was so I looked it up, which caused me to reread the sentence which probably helped with my comprehension of it. A naginata is like a spear so even a full-sized one for a child would be pretty tall, definitely longer than two hands.
