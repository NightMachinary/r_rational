The characters are too logical, especially Zorian, which makes the dialogue feel very robotic at times. I never get that "oh shit" feeling at pivotal moments because the story is almost written in a businesslike- offhand manner. The invasion at the end of the month should be horrifying, at least for the first couple of restarts. I am not saying Zorian should have PTSD but at least make us feel the horror of being in the midst of a terrorist attack where people are brutally killed left and right.

Things just... happen. There is no impact.


** Well, as soon as it becomes clear that he is in a time loop, he has a lot less to fear. I thought it was an understandable reaction.

It's not like he had no emotional responses whatsoever, but based on what we know about his upbringing and early years, I'd say he's just a bit more subdued in his responses on account of that.

I also have to note that there are several very important events that I felt had a lot of impact both on the protagonist, and on the reader.

*** Yeah, I went into the story knowing that it was a time loop story, so there is some innate comfort in that.

But the innate comfort of knowing that it is a time loop makes the surprise danger moments all the more tense.

The most horrifying of the story for me was when Zorian first learned about the ability of the 3rd time traveler to wipe people from the time stream.

The story led you into a false sense of security, which made it all the more exhilarating when it tore that away from you. I had to put down the book and come back to it a month later because of that.

*** I agree with your disagreement.

I don't understand why people assume that characters have to have a zero-level intelligence (Hollywood Zombie) to be "relatable" or "emotional".

Many characters in the story actually have a decent level emotional intelligence, which is refreshing, and yet clearly have their own biases thst occasionally push them into illogical or inefficient actions (Damien's assumptions about how he treated his siblings, Zorian's attitude towards Damien, Fortev's... Fortevness, Kirielle acting her age, etc).

MoL can certainly occasionally overpontificate and end up being unnecessarily verbose over concepts or events that could better have been communicated in a single sentence or paragraph, but I'd personally rather the characters over-communicate then under-communicate.

** First two arcs were fine from emotional standpoint, I think. However, the third arc started by removing the immediate threat and replacing it with a very vague time constraint. I think this has hurt the story largely. Personally I don't have a strong enough suspension of disbelief to consider a chance Zorian will fail to get out of the loop. So there are no stakes right now. Zorian will get out of the loop, we know that, basically. This kills any tension.

Then the last, real repeat of the month starts. Once outside, he faces active Red Robe, and death for him or any of his friends is real. That's where the fun begins.

*** ** spoilers below **

I agree with this. In the first arc, Zorian was still getting his bearings, trying to figure out exactly what was going on, who the players were, what the rules were, etc. And at that point, the invasion seemed insurmountable, even after multiple restarts (the lich especially just dominated all their defenses).

With the second arc, Red Robe was still in the loops, and demonstrated some ability to permanently destroy souls (at that point, we didn't know that those "souls" were just copies in a simulation). So there was that constant danger element, of not knowing who RR was or when they would pop up next.

Now we know we're just in a simulation, it's clear that Zorian will eventually get out, and even acquiring the artifacts doesn't seem too difficult for him. There are no real obstacles left until he emerges into the real world. I wouldn't mind if the author started picking up the pace a bit and not spending as much time on each of the remaining loops, so we could get back to a point where there's some dramatic tension.

Honestly, my biggest contention with the plot is Red Robe leaving the simulation so early. The combination of the ever-present potential danger to Zorian and Zack's souls, and the mystery-thriller element of trying to deduce RR's true identity, both added a lot to each loop, and their absence is very noticeable.

***** Well, that's the theory. Relative to Zach/Zorian, RR has already exited - but relative to real time, they'll all exit more or less simultaneously (or, if this works like a super-powered version of the training boxes Zach and Zorian have been using, only milliseconds will have passed IRL).

To me, that's what makes RR's "early" departure so frustrating. RR's not getting any sort of advantage by being out, so there's no rush for Zach & Zorian to get out and catch up (other than to get out before the simulation runs out of power). At the same time, because RR's already exited the simulation (relative to our protagonists), we no longer have that mystery/thriller element in the rest of the loops.

****** It's not so much RR trying to gain an advantage by going out, but him trying to avoid a danger by /not staying in/.

He thought that once he left the loop that it would collapse and those inside would be gone, he might have even thought (correctly or not) that he could just start up the loops again and get the rest of 'his' loops without threat. We don't know from his point of view what he is thinking beyond some basics. We know he has gotten decades from his looping and has probably gotten whatever goal he wanted done. anything else is essentially gravy. Balance that with decades of being worry free vs suddenly having an existential threat of an unknown number, some of whom have demonstrated soul magic /and/ mind magic -two of the few things which could harm him in a significant way- with the mind mage being /far/ more accomplished them himself? Imagine if they figure out the soul exclusion spell he was using? they should have it available to themselves as well. that would be death for him.

No, noping the f-out was an obvious and smart move for Red Robe which out weighted any other action by a huge margin.

Well, technically the opposite is true, everyone besides the two loopers dies no matter what again and again, so dying a little earlier in a restart doesn't truly mean anything, besides some emotional discomfort.

The only danger Zorian has is failing to get the keys and to get out, but that's not a possibility because of the narrative rules.

But that's the beauty of immersion, when you're actually reading the fight between the hero and the villain and the hero's on the verge of being overwhelmed, your immersed brain willingly forgets the narrative conventions which dictate the hero's inevitable success. The more immersive the conflict is, the greater this effect.

In contrast, here, even an immersed mind can tell that Zorian will be able to collect all the Keys. There are obstacles, like the hydra or getting the crown off of the lich's head, but Zorian has enough resources and time on his side that devising a plan to reliably steal the crown feels like just a matter of time.

** I somewhat agree with you but for slightly different reasons.

I think the story is emotional when it wants to be. When big events happen that upset the status quo they are uniquely felt.

But I think the majority of the story kind of lacks emotion in general. In that many of the chapters are just extended training montages rather than moving the plot forward. So overall you get a lot of interesting details and world building, and then eventually it's topped off with emotional peaks.

But for me personally the training bits kind of got a bit old after a while, so I took a long break from the story. It's the emotional bits that tend to really hook me into stories. This story definitely has those emotional bits, but it doesn't really dole them out in a consistent manner.

MoL does those things to various degrees and it would probably get pretty old quickly if done too much.

** The first thing that gets me the most about Zorian's (lack of) emotions is his apparent asexuality. He is a teenager. If he had a sex drive of an average teenager, he would lewd basically /every/ female in the loop once he was out of an immediate mortal danger. Yet, he does not. He spends literal /years/ in the time loop and doesn't even think of sex /once/. For a person with a teenager body full of hormones, this is decidedly unusual.

I like his logical approach otherwise, but his asexuality really strains mys suspension of disbelief.

Also, for such a logical individual, Zorian is surprisingly squeamish. He adamantly refuses violating copyright even when the fate of the world literally depends on him succeeding in his endeavors.

Other than these two things, I don't mind Zorian's level of emotions.

*** With regards to his apparent asexuality;

I suspect that, much like before the loop itself, he simply prioritizes other things before pursuing females. After the loop started the moral dubiousness of doing so, the ever increasing difference in mental age and the fact that for much of the loop he was hanging on by the skin of his teeth would be very effective at causing him to prioritize other things in favor of chasing women even more.

I find that it is actually apparent that, like every teenager, he /does/ have these feelings present somewhere inside of him but simply chooses to suppress them most of the time. Heck, his crush for Taiven took almost a decade of time /and/ a time loop for him to do anything more than halfheartedly suggest a date.

** I partially agree with the emotions part but disagree on the drama.

I personally don't think it's the characters being too logical that makes it come short on emotion, just the author not being too strong on writing "live" dialogue most of the time, if I can put it that way. But he can still pull it off at times, for example the thing with Taiven at the end of ch 43 - can you really think that that part doesn't successfully impart each characters' rather strong emotions to the reader?

As for drama, like I said, I disagree. Easy example: end of act one. I feel like one of this story's strongest points is how it engineers situations that are good enough to boggle the mind just by thinking about it, and in those kind of cases I find it really hard for the affect of the dialogue to have much say in how enthralled I am (barring, of course, just stupid amounts of shoddy writing).

I'm almost certainly stepping onto nosy territory here, but from my perspective it looks like you're the type of reader who's more into the quality of the prose in contrast to, I guess, the quality of immersibility.

He may have memories of unpleasant moments, but his brain doesn't have the neurological stress connections.

This is leaving aside the absurdity of memories without neural connections, but if we assume memories are stored in the soul and processed by the brain, then there are no defects in the brain caused by stress to trigger PTSD events.
