I was wondering if the trick described in Chapter 20 of Animorphs: The Reckoning, where a character is feeling disoriented and overwhelmed, and another character ties his shoelaces super tight to relieve the excess mental energy, is a real thing; and if so where I can find some anecdotes and/or data about it?

[I tried searching for this and found nothing.]

Thank you!

** After I read that chapter, I went to the pet store and saw a jacket-like thing for nervous dogs, saying something about how pressure from the jacket helps them calm down.

*** I've seen those before before, under the brand name Thunder Jackets, and I have a 30lb weighted blanket which is /amazing/. [[#s][Incredibly minor spoiler]]'s trick was so simple and effective I was shocked I hadn't heard about it before.
