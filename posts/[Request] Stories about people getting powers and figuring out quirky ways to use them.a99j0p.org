I'd be surprised if this hasn't come up before, but I'm really struggling to figure out which keywords to search to find it.

I've lately taken a liking to stories where the protagonist gets a power and figures out a clever way to use that power to their advantage. Examples: Worm, Battle in 5 seconds after meeting.

I'd love it if anyone could recommend anything, or, even better, tell me if there's a word for this 'genre', so I can do some searching myself.

Thanks in advance!


** Some keywords to look for: Optimization, min/maxing, and munchkin. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to reliably find stories like these, but it's more common in stories that have "hard magic" systems and coherent rules.

Brandon Sanderson does a bit of this here and there, but it's not generally his primary focus.

There's some pretty good munchkinry in *The Tutorial is Too Hard*, mostly in terms of exploiting the progression systems. Some of it gets pretty dark, like deliberately hurting himself in a safe zone that heals people rapidly in order to grind his pain resistance and damage resistance skills.

*Threadbare* has a whole bunch of munckining, especially toward the end. Huge recommendation for this if you like game-like universes.

You might also enjoy my *Arcane Ascension* books. The main character spends a lot of time researching how magic works, and he definitely uses his abilities in some non-standard ways. It's a world building heavy story, though, and you shouldn't expect optimization to be the main focus.

**** There are multiple translations going for *The Tutorial is Too Hard*, so that gets a little confusing. The main one seems to be [[https://lightnovelbastion.com/project.php?p=285][here]].

The first [[https://www.amazon.com/Threadbare-Stuff-Nonsense-Andrew-Seiple-ebook/dp/B078KGS4V4/][*Threadbare*]] novel can be found [[https://www.amazon.com/Threadbare-Stuff-Nonsense-Andrew-Seiple-ebook/dp/B078KGS4V4/][here]].

The first *Arcane Ascension* novel can be found [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/][here]].

** I tried to do that with my ChangeStorms series. You can pick up Induction, the first novel, for free over on [[http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs][my Patreon]]. The summary is that superpowers act like a plague -- getting them will probably kill you or leave you horribly mutilated, but once you have them you are now a source of infection. The normals have banded together to protect themselves against supers. Part of that defense lies in forming the Special Response Division and requiring all supers to join. Our protagonist, a 40-something female psychologist, refuses to join and is therefore drafted with an explosive collar on her neck. Day 1: Fight two miles of animated highway. Her power? The ability to straighten thread.

** The Wandering Inn

It's not always highly rational, and sometimes it is but only if you reread the story with details in mind that weren't revealed until the middle of book 5, but it does have the elements you're looking for, in the parts that follow certain characters.

For example a certain group of goblins tend to always gain subpar classes/levels/skills but they make the most of them in a world that is literally out to hunt them down. (They get trappers instead of hunters, stirrers and fire starters instead of cooks... A recent example of using a weak ability in quirky ways - a goblin gets a spell which sets your own weapon on fire. The fire is non magical other than the part where it keeps a metal weapon burning for a few minutes even without fuel. It can destroy wooden weapons like clubs because they catch on fire, and heats up the metal ones to the point where you have to drop them, but the fire doesn't spread fast enough to do anything significant to a target the weapon hits. The goblins usually just use it to build campfires quickly in the evening until one day they use it to help get away from an army that's been chasing and harrying them (won't spoil how))

** Playing For Keeps [[https://scribl.com/books/PAF06/playing-for-keeps][(available as a free audiobook here)]] is a nice standalone supers novel that definitely fits the bill.

Many stories in the long running [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40686-wild-cards][Wild Cards universe]] fit this to varying degrees.

Similarly, several stories from the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/499216.Temps][Temps anthologies]].

The Paper Magician Trilogy and the classic Anime series Read Or Die are great examples of epic battles with paper-kinesis.

The Alcatraz Smedry series fits, the entire cast has curses that they twist to their advantage, but it is very much not a serious story.

In general though, "quirky way to use a weak power" is generally more of a fun trope to give power-ups to a character when the time is right, rather than enough of a hook to build an entire story around unless it happens right at the start, and even then that still makes the story "random powerup causes life altering changes."

*** I'd second the Alcatraz series.

For examples (very minor spoilers) one character has the 'talent' of always being late to things. He can use this to arrive late to pain or injury.
