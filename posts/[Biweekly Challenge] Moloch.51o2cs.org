[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zfbud/biweekly_challenge_underground/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Underground".

This time we'll be doing *"Moloch"*. If you haven't already, go read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]]. If you're too lazy for that, I think it can be best summed up as "many systems are composed of individual elements with their own optimization functions which work in their own favor but to the detriment of the system as a whole". This is a very abstract topic, and I highly suggest making it concrete by thinking about 'Moloch' in the context of a business, government, colony, species, etc.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, September 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time we'll be doing *Memory Modification*. Your challenge, should you chose to accept it, is to write a story which involves the alteration of memories in some way, whether through memetics, anti-memetics, erasure, neural tinkering, or anything else. It's a good chance to try out some alternative narrative structures or play with presentation to the audience.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 9/21.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/51okid/challenge_companion_moloch/][is available here]].

*** One thing that popped into my head was the specification of medical technology. Of all the technologies that we'd find useful from an alien race, corrective biotechnology optimized for a given species would be one of the hardest to adapt.

Unless, of course, said species had been aware of us for a while and had deliberately adapted technology for us...but it's an interesting point.

Still, with or without specific adaptations for us, there would surely be universally-useful (or at least broadly useful) techniques, like enhanced microscopy/scanning, minimally-invasive surgery techniques, etc.
