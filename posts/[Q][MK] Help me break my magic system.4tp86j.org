Heyyyy guys,

Its been a minute huh? I'm not dead or anything, I just got really busy with work and haven't been able to contribute much to discussions.

Just so anyone who might have been reading it are aware, [[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/post/124191796477/the-fall-of-oso][Fall of Oso]] isn't dead. I'm just not very happy with it. I /will/ continue it, but as I've improved as a writer I'm coming to realise its just...not very good. I didn't hash the plot out enough ahead of times, and writing on the seat of my pants like I had been resulted in a work I can't say I'm particularly proud of. That was mostly my fault, I set myself a waaaay too ambitious goal of updating three times a week, which just was not remotely sustainable. I'm definitely still interested in telling the story of Fall of Oso though, and its currently my only outlet for sharing the Aeria universe. What will probably happen is I'll pull down all the existing chapters, do some /heavy/ editing on them, finish writing at least rough drafts for the rest of the story, and start reposting again from the beginning. I worry a lot that I'm just not a very good writer, and that I won't be able to create something that is actually up to my standards as a reader. But then, you learn by doing, only way to strengthen those neural connections is by doing the thing. If anyone is interested in helping me with behind the scenes plot related stuff for Fall of Oso, hit me with a PM. I don't want like, editing help or anything that meticulous, just feedback on characters, how to improve the plot flow, general things like that. I might also switch from first to third person, I'm not sure about that yet and I'm curious about people's general attitudes towards first vs. third person perspectives.

Okay so anyway, one of the few things I'm pretty pleased with is how the magic system came out in Aeria. /I think/ it's pretty interesting. However, I'm also concerned that it has some...bugs that would give a sufficiently munchkinned characters effective omnipotence. I'm not opposed to leaving some channels for misuing the magic for fun and profit in, but it needs to be non-obvious. I worry there's some obvious things you could do with the magic system that I'm author-blind to catch. This not only limits what I can have the characters do, since if I can't think of some niche use for magic, then they can't either, but it also leads to "Why didn't they just do X" scenarios, which are generally something you try to avoid in rational fiction afaik.

Thus I come to you all, with the question: Given the system of magic I describe in [[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/post/124367572852/magic][this article (magic system)]] and [[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/post/126675028392/aara][this article (magic particle physics)]] How quickly can you break the magic system and achieve effective omnipotence? What are some patches I can introduce to it to make it less prone to potential godmoding while still keeping in a few non-obvious godmode hacks for the main characters to potentially exploit?

  Aara can be given five basic commands, on which the foundations of Amat constructive and destructive magic are built. These five commands are: move along a specified path, accelerate at a specified rate, respond to a specific instruction from another specified aara or set of aara, consume a specified material, and extrude a specified material.
#+end_quote

It'd take me an afternoon to start walking the path to godhood. The first question for breaking a magic system is always "Can you make a computer" or, more generally, "Can you automate the magic?"

In your system, not only is the automation built into the base level, but so is material manipulation, granting nanotechnology.

It'd take anyone with a decent amount of math-related knowledge a week to ruin the local economy, but worse, only a few hours to come up with some recursive world-eating grey goo. You need some hard, hard limits on the capabilities of Amat.

*** Yes, you can make a computer. This is definitely something I wanted to be possible when I first came up with the magic system. However, there is /some/ inbuilt balancing, and it /seems/ like enough, but it might not be. I don't know enough about ground up basic computing and programming to know how exactly you would do that though, which might be a problem.

The short of it is that aara essentially [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia][lacks ontological inertia]], it takes a constant focus from the mage to keep the aara doing stuff. A mage could create a computer out of Aara, but it would take a certain amount of mental concentration to control the computer the aara is made out of. If they for instance, passed out, their computer might evaporate.

I like the idea of it since it opens up the development of magical items that could be used by a non-mage. This wouldn't be done in the story at the start for cultural reasons (that would be like, sinful and stuff), but I want it to be a possibility.

However, it also might let you have self replicating superswarms of aara, which is not good for balancing. Any way to balance so I can have one but not the other?

Its very hard. However going for those 100,000 already present particles would not be a good idea in combat. Aara are very small, they're effecting a cell-width cross section. It would take a while to kill someone with the Aara in their body, and doing so would actually take a good bit of focus on the part of the mage.

Eat a bunch of mass, take it up high, drop it, and collect the energy from its fall? Something like that? This is the sort of thing I hadn't thoroughly considered, however, there are easier, more mechanical ways of creating an over unity engine/thruster in this setting. Those haven't actually been discovered yet either, but that's really a matter of certain other fields of engineering catching up, and there are likely rudimentary designs for non Aaara-based over unity engines floating around, its just that the level of industrialisation required to make the parts for the designs haven't caught up with the tech base.

Aara is a physical object, but things passing through its centre go away and lose all previous properties until later ejected. It can also not do that. In truly massive swarms you could get some powerful stuff out of it, but that would take more aara then most armies could usually control.

#+begin_quote
  What constraints are there on the scope of aara control? Can a mage order them to consume a planet? A star? If not, then what is the limiting factor?
#+end_quote

The limiting factor is the focus of the mage.

For starters, a single mote has an upper limit of material it can ingest of about a gram, so doing anything involving moving large amounts of mass around, you need quite a lot of aara.

But here's the thing. Each aara, and I mean /every single one/ that a mage is exerting influence on require a small quantity of focus. You could tell Aara to make more of themselves, but you couldn't control all of them, so they would sit inert. I haven't done much from the perspective of an Amat character which is part of the problem, but roughly speaking, most amat don't fly, that would take more concentration then they'd be capable of without specialist training.

I imagine the absolute upper limit that a god level mage could control at once would be a sphere of pure aara .25 meters in diameter. This would contain something on the order of 500 quadrillion aara. Even that number is probably too high for story balancing purposes, and it might be better to have it lower, I'm not sure yet. I don't have numbers put to the amount of kinetic energy that an individual aara can exert, which I really need to calculate so I can reverse derive how many it would take to lift a given amount of mass without consuming it.

No, it really wouldn't; you just ingest a cross-section of their spinal cord. Or, with greater medical expertise, you could target smaller and thus faster critical nerves. As a bonus, start extruding random nerve material as you go, to short-circuit things before they're fully severed.

I've often wondered why more villains don't break the limbs or spines of their prisoners.

If you can strike without being seen, you also have lots of ways to surreptitiously poison the target.

Attach weights to a flywheel, use computerised timing to consume at the bottom and extrude at the top. Just off the top of my head. No doubt there are endless better ways.

But that cannot be irreplaceable, because aara are non-sentient, barely alive, suspected to communicate via electromagnetism or similar. Therefore, whatever controls them can be artificially simulated. Therefore, you can design a computer to do it. Bam, self-replicating nanotech.

And if one aara can give orders to multiple others, then you don't even need to solve the mysteries of inter-aara communication to get astronomical force multipliers.

Hypothetically yes. But a lower hanging fruit would first be to figure out how aara communicate at all. Electromagnetism is the prevailing theory, but converting that into even a simpler device then an 'order giving machine' but a 'spelljammer' has yet to be done.

that middle command might just end up being too powerful to fit in the story, not sure yet, but I really like the idea of a turing complete magic system, and the idea of doing things like 'programming' with magic.

For /healing/, yes, you would need quite a bit. If you're going to remove a tumor or set a broken bone, you need a fair bit of manipulation. But to kill someone is much quicker and easier.

This seems pretty similar to the "Twelve Words of Death" in the Inheritance cycle, except that if aara control currently requires concentration, then there doesn't seem to be any real possibility of warding (at least not anything that would stop an ambush).

Absolutely. The Offense/Defense balance heavily /heavily/ skews towards offense, similar to our world. There aren't usually sieges in Aeria, the battles either culminate quickly with shock and awe tactics devastating an enemy quickly, or it bogs down into something approximating WWI style trench warfare.

Point taken regarding the ease of killing someone. It might be best to balance that by giving the aara a very simple sort of log that could be interrogated later by a mage. Still undetectable to a non magic user, but not completely invisible either.

The problem I have regarding wards and persistent effects is the same problem I have with magic items. I want them, but if aara are allowed to 'save instructions for later' then you can make a self replicating swarm of manites.

Not sure how to get around that one yet.

Its a lot more complex then that. The way with which a mage controls aara is not fully understood for one. The theory that it analyses brain signals for the controlling mage and interprets it kind of must be happening at some point, but /how/ that happens is a mystery. This is a victorian era level civilisation without the foundation in neuroscience to really puts a damper on that sort of higher level research.

The problem with healing magic is that the aara is only as useful as the mage's knowledge of biology. With perfect knowledge of the human body, you could do some impressive stuff, but again, victorian era level of science, medical science included. You're moving tiny tiny particles around through layers of bone and muscle and telling them to deposit stuff in specific places or pick stuff up from specific places. If the mage makes a mistake, you could end up...for instance...scooping up all the red blood cells instead of all the bacterial cells if you're trying to treat an infection.
