This month we read The Martian, a gripping science fiction story about Mark Watney, an astronaut trapped on Mars with only his engineering and SPACE BOTANY to rely on. He befalls a lot of disasters but using his wit and knowledge he comes out ahead.

Posting Guidelines: We're trying to figure this out as we go, but here's my thoughts to start: if you just want to give your overall feelings, make a post. If you have "discussion questions" that you want to discuss in more depth (anything from philosophical discussions, writing tip requests, things that bugged you, etc), try making a dedicated subthread? We'll see how we like it!

Feedback: I'll make a [meta thread] in here that is intended for you to give me feedback for how I can do this better, or for what you particularly liked and want to make sure I don't change.

*** I think first and foremost, people are willing to deal with a lot more exposition than they're usually given credit for, even when that exposition is delivered /as/ exposition and without much in the way of framing.

The other big thing I took from it is that if you're writing a "survival" story, the tension has a tendency to get lower over time. In the beginning, you're dealing with the things that can kill you in a few hours, then the things that will kill you in a few days, and eventually the things that will kill you in weeks or even months, or which won't kill you /at all/.

Up until the hab explodes, that's the general trajectory of /The Martian/; things get less and less urgent with every problem that gets solved. I would actually argue that from a Doyalist perspective, that's /why/ the hab explodes, because without that, there's just not enough drama in the story. Something needed to happen to shake things up, and the explosion was that thing.

Generally speaking, I would consider that one of the challenges of this variety of Man vs Nature story, and by extension, a few other types of stories as well, where there's a natural decrease in the tension that needs to be addressed with some counteracting force within the story.

**** I think /The Hatchet/ does that well in a way, because in a sequel, he ends up having to face winter with its own new set of challenges. It raises the tension without feeling like an asspull because we all know that winter is a thing that happens.

The rover capsizing is another example of that, I guess: it all seems hunky dory and we need more tension.

Not that any of the issues that arise in the story feel like asspulls, of course. Just that there's an asspull scale, and "winter happens" is lower than "it turns out HAB canvas isn't perfect".

one way the martian deals with that quite well is by changing the objectives over time to increasingly difficult ones. Day 1 its get air to breathe, then its growing food... then at the end its hijacking a rocket and making a space interception.

*** I asked this question because it's the first time I read The Martian (I think I've read it 5 times now) since I started writing my probably-never-to-see-the-light-of-day same-sex supernatural romance novel. And I can see the nuts and bolts of the story more: like, I always worried about transitioning between different scenes, that it would be jarring or something, but this book and no doubt countless others do the exact same thing and as long as the reader doesn't feel there was anything else to say in the scene then they're good.

Also, the book has some "weird" departures: before the HAB explodes there's a weirdly detached piece of writing from the point of view of part of the HAB canvas as it goes through manufacture and testing. Rather than being "weird" in a bad way, it's weird in a good way. My own story has a weird departure in it that I hope will also be weird in a good way if anyone ever reads it. (My husband actually said he really enjoyed it and said it was similar to something that happened in Homestuck, and gave me pointers on ways to make it feel /more/ different to the rest of the story for emphasis).

Anyway it made me feel better about my writing, is about all I'm trying to say here :)

** On a reread I noticed a seemingly gaping plot hole, and I think it's too big, I must be missing something. I tried googling for it, but in a few places where it's mentioned responses are missing the point or offer handwaves that don't explain anything. I'm hoping [[/r/rational]] can point out what I'm missing.

So you remember when Mark was making water from hydrazine there was the hidden build up of hydrogen. And the story made a big dial how it could have exploded from the smallest spark or even too much static. But during the sols the buildup was happening Mark had an /open flame/ going inside the Hub doing the controlled burn. How come it didn't explode as soon as it reached the critical concentration? What do you think?

**** Where is this afterward that talks about explosions? I have this passage in /An Essay from Andy Weir: How Science Made Me a Writer/ at the end of the book:

#+begin_quote
  Even though my plan was to torture Mark, I knew from the very beginning that I didn't want my hero to suffer one unlikely, disastrous coincidence after the next. I decided that each problem Mark faced had to be a plausible consequence of his situation---or, better yet, an unintended consequence of his solution to a previous problem. He could suffer an equipment failure in machinery stretched beyond its intended use, but he couldn't be struck by lightning and then have a meteor crash on him.

*** Easy answer: the hydrogen was at the top of the environment, not diffused. A flame or spark at the ceiling would set it off, but not at table height. If table height had enough hydrogen to explode, Mark would have been experiencing breathing symptoms.

*** I thought the movie was a great adaptation; it had the same general "feel" to me as the book did, which is my biggest criteria for adaptations. People often look at adaptations and ask "what is different", meaning at the actual objective level, while ignoring the spirit of the work (because that's much harder to judge). The movie keeps the spirit, in my view, and that's what I consider important. Yes, they changed some things, especially right at the end to punch it up, but I consider that fairly minor in the context of the rest of the film.

*** While the movie does alot of things well, there are some inconsistencies (the spaceship (Artemis?) had to be spaceshippy, of course) I can overlook as falling to the wayside in adapting the story to a different medium.

What I truly, sorely missed was the desolation and solitude. Maybe I'm over-interpreting things here, but Whatney's abject aloneness on that rusty planet was something that shone through the cracks in the book, but not so much in the movie. Admittedly, I only saw the movie once and read the book twice, so I may have been imagining things, but the way I see it Whatney kept madness only barely at bay. He keeps watching and rewatching old tv shows, listens to that damn disco, and so on, but the isolation gnaws at him.

That didn't come through in the movie. I wished they'd have added one, two scenes where he's just outside, staring into the empty red plains before him, and struggles to not give in to this.

*** I thought a lot of stuff was really convenient. I didn't feel like it was "cheating" or anything, but having Pathfinder be within roving distance, having usable potatoes (though they hang a lampshade on that), having Mark have a low resolution map of the entire planet, having a huge supply of multivitamins, etc.

Then again there was a lot of stuff that wasn't too convenient: he wasn't given a greenhouse as part of his "science project", Pathfinder dies, the maps aren't perfect, there's the dust storm, the extra oxygen when he's making water, etc.

A few things are gimmes like the evacuation-causing storm that couldn't actually exist on Mars (otherwise there's no story).

What did bug me is that ever since I read about "the science good and bad in the martian", they said that the radioactive heater thing is completely safe as long as he doesn't eat the pellets, so there's no reason for NASA to be so paranoid.

I'm a nutrition student so now I think about it the multivitamins bug me the most. Why would the crew have 3 years' worth of multivitamins? I could see the crew having a large supply of each individual vitamin, but not of multivitamin pills. You could see from a medical point of view the doctor needing to treat someone with big doses of iodine because they get thyroid issues, but you wouldn't want to give them big doses of OTHER vitamins at the same time. They'd definitely be taking Vitamin D tablets the entire time (in space, on mars, etc) due to the lack of UV light to make it in the body, but commercial multivitamins generally don't contain ~2000-4000 IU of D that you'd want if you were not getting supplements.

The potato diet would be deficient in omega 3 and omega 6 fats (which are essential), several amino acids (cystine especially - but he'd survive, so just more "starvation" I guess). He'd need to supplement B2, B12, Biotin, Folate, A(or carotene), D, E, and K; as well as Calcium (he could get away without it on Mars but it would probably do serious bone damage), Chromium, Fluoride, Iodine, Molybdenum, Selenium, Sodium (you need a minimum amount of sodium to live), Zinc.

I could see the HAB having a big thing of oil (though 3 years worth? not sure) and salt. I'm kind of interested to look up the severity of, say, Molybdenum deficiency to see if it's the sort of thing that would kill him or just contribute to his overall feeling of being starved. By the end he is not supplementing with many MREs at all, so I guess all I can really say is he was probably really starving by the end of it, which is not exactly a hot take.

Didnt register to me at all as a non nutritionist fwiw, put it down as conservation of detail?

If you want an in universe handwave, they were only supposed to be on the surface for a short time vs living in the ship. So maybe the multivitamins were just for that part and the rest of the time on the ship they had more complex tailored solutions

***** The thing is, being on the surface for a month would not require any vitamin supplementation at all, realistically. That is, assuming they were planning on eating something vaguely resembling food.

They could even go without vitamin D supplements (which they'd definitely be supplementing on the Hermes) as their stores would be sufficient to last a month on Mars.

At the end of the day, he was on Mars for something like 2 years, which is so far beyond the ~30 day anticipated stay that the nutritional requirements are completely different. Like, as long as you have water, you can pretty much go 30 days without eating (OK, maybe not twice - but it's on the order of that). It's not about vitamins for 30 days, it's calories. So having vitamins on Mars is just.... makes no sense. Multivitamins as a whole aren't recommended by dieticians. Minerals can interfere with each other for absorption so if you do need a supplement they recommend you take each vitamin you need individually.

Like, I said to one of my professors, who is a dietician, "I need to take b12, and I also have started taking iron lately because my periods have been heavier. I always read multivitamins were just giving you expensive pee, but I can get three months' worth of multivitamins for $10, so it'll actually be cheaper for me too take a multi than to take an individual iron and b12 supplement. Should I take a multi in this instance?". She recommended that I take a high dose iron supplement every 2-3 days because iron and calcium (and I think magnesium) compete for the same absorption pathways, so any vitamin with both would mean I wasn't absorbing it fully. She also said that if I wasn't feeling any symptoms of iron deficiency then I probably didn't actually need to supplement it, many people are fine with low iron levels (my serum iron was too low to give blood). But anyway that was a bit of an aside but meant to say that multivitamins really aren't what professionals recommend.

I mean he has to have the vitamins because otherwise he dies and there's no story.

Mass, probably. You are going to need a little bit of everything, especially if the MREs aren't perfectly nutritious. And I think that NASA would be able to make vitamins tailored to the mission. As for the reason they're overstocked, keep in mind that a little extra for six people is a lot extra for one person. Although for the six crewmembers to have 3 years of vitamins on a one-month mission they would need to have 5 months extra each, which is weird.

***** The thing is, making vitamins tailored to the mission would be vitamin D only, since all the rest are obtained from food. I don't think there are any uses for vitamins in terms of treating specific illnesses, but I don't think e.g. Folate is used to treat anything in particular.

Even if they did tailor the vitamins to what wasn't in the MREs, the MREs would have a more balanced nutritional profile than "organic martian-grown potatoes", and even if they didn't, they'd have a /different/ imbalance.

If they were concerned about mass they wouldn't do pills, I'd imagine they'd store the pure vitamins in powder form or something, since so much of a pill's mass is filler. It's confusing either way.

When I have time I should work out the symptoms and severity of chronic deficiency in all the above vitamins and see what happens. I think after 3 years of very little b12 he'd be having permenant nerve damage though. It does take a year or two for deficiency to be felt though as it's one of the few water soluble vitamins we store (in the liver), but by year 3 he'd be in big trouble. (Except B12 is in every multivitamin ever, so). But there'd be no reason for the crew to need b12 as the length of the journey wouldn't be enough for b12 deficiency, and the food would contact it. Then again, b12 malabsorption is very common, so the Hermes would probably be outfitted with a bunch of B12 syringes but they wouldn't need it on Mars itself.

In conclusion, I guess it's one big shrug?
