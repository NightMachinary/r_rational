You are a wizard in a standard urban fantasy universe. Here are the rules:

1.  You start with four million joules of magical energy, which exists on a mysterious magical plane which apparently has no purpose but to store magical energy.
2.  You are able to identify who else has a store of magic around them, and, thus, who else is a wizard, by looking at them. (pictures and video don't count) You will also know if magic causes an effect within a quarter-mile of you, and what the effect is.
3.  You can convert this magical energy to any others kind of energy with 99.99999... percent efficiency, and get it to do useful work for you.
4.  You make the magic work by concentrating on what you want it to do, and then speaking a trigger word to make the magic work. The magic will attempt to carry out your instructions, drawing on your available stores of energy to do so. There is a gap of about an eighth of a second between when you speak the trigger word and the magic begins the task.
5.  Magic has computational power, but no intelligence. It can do math, but cannot create solutions to problems on its own.
6.  Using magic to do a task uses exactly as many joules of energy as doing the task any other way, times a variable for distance between you and the object affected. At distances less than about a quarter mile, the extra energy for distance is negligible; after that it follows something like an inverse square law (magic at half a mile requires twice as much energy, magic at a mile eight times as much, etc).
7.  Information which travels through magic, without passing through any other medium, travels at the speed of light.
8.  Once you have begun a task with magic, the magic will continue to work until it does what you want or it runs out of energy.
9.  Your store of magic refills if less than full at a rate of one million joules every six hours, except while you are actively using magic.
10. You can temporarily increase your store of energy through meditation. After fifteen minutes of meditation (no benefits for more or less time spent), you will gain an additional two million joules, which will be fully available for another fifteen minutes before beginning to drain away at a rate of hundred thousand joules every minute. This can't reduce to zero joules of stored energy. You can only meditate once every twenty-four hours.
11. If your store of magic ever drops to zero, you die.
12. If you eat the brain of another wizard within eight hours of their death, the total energy they had available at the moment of their death is permanently added to your stores.\\

How would you break this universe?


** 1. Gain more power. This means eating the brains of other wizards. There's some aspect of diminishing returns here, because the recharge rate doesn't scale with the size of the the energy store, but that's alright; getting more power is a good first step to breaking the universe.

   If possible, get into friendly cooperation with other wizards. Brain-eating is just "after death", the only reason to kill other wizards is if you want it /immediately/. So we can have a culture of ritual consumption of other wizards brains post-mortem, if other wizards are amenable to that.

   Assuming other wizards /aren't/ amenable to that (for example, if wizardkind has descended into an irrevocable war with each other) then I start killing some wizards. The biggest problem is finding them, and not being found in return. Experiment with other ways of "looking". Figure out why photographs and video don't work. Try to make some sort of outfit that would disguise me.

2. Investigate how magic triggers work. Can I make them conditional? For example, "at 4:00PM do =X="? If they can do computation, I might be able to rig a counter of some kind, even if it won't respond to a strict time. Conditionals are really powerful; they would allow for shields, for example, by saying "expend energy to counteract energy over a certain threshold that passes through this shield". If I can set up conditionals so that I never go over my energy store, causing spells to fail instead of killing me, all the better.

3. Investigate computation. How much energy does computation use? How fast is computation? Can I make a magical interface with a computer somehow in order to make a supercomputer? If possible, I interface my magic with my smartphone. There are lots of potential applications I'd like to run if I'm relatively unbounded by the need for computing power.

4. Start running a bunch of low-energy spells. 4 MJ isn't all that much; the handy [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)][orders of magnitude (energy)]] page on Wikipedia informs me that it's about four thousand bullets, which is a good starting point. Magic bullets (or their equivalent) don't seem like the way to go; instead, I would go with things like remote viewing (extremely powerful even if restricted to a quarter-mile, for stealing things like passwords or grabbing sensitive information). It would probably be possible to make a whole bunch of money really quickly with just that, until I get to the point where money doesn't matter.

Well, now we know why no such culture exists. Prion diseases are nasty enough when you don't have access to cosmic powers beyond mortal ken.

*** Regarding 1:

I can only assume that in this universe, any obvious way of killing wizards will be known--wizards have presumably been around for a while. So, there goes my plan for capturing wizards with partially-lobotomized other wizards, cans of chloroform, and insubstantial spell effects to catch attention. If wizards have been around for a while then any living wizard will be good at avoiding such traps.

I might experiment with sharing brains with other wizards, or even normals. If I can make a new wizard by feeding a normal some wizard brain, things get interesting. It might be possible to trick a normal into becoming a wizard, teach them to meditate, then kill them and have a larger store as a result. Again, it depends on how well wizards are known in this world.

It would be useful to turn friends and family. With a group of people, any solitary wizard can be confined, rendered unconscious, and consumed. With five people, my group's recharge rate is 5x. We can rotate as needed.

The thing I really find troubling is, what if others have been using these tactics? It is easy to imagine a world with a few very powerful wizards, who can incapacitate any wizard they encounter with their massive stores. How would you fight a wizard with 50 times your power and plenty of practice eating other wizards?

***** That is also a possibility. As a wizard wanting to be the last in the chain, however, it is risky to allow other wizards to snowball before you. Also, you gain the same benefit if you eat them individually after they meditated, but only if they can eat a small fraction of a brain to become a wizard. If the whole brain must be eaten, then the chain method you describe does the most with a single wizard brain (and a bunch of normals). The chain method also minimizes your exposure to diseases, assuming it takes more than fifteen minutes for a person's brain to become diseased after they eat a diseased brain. You'd only have to worry about the single person you ate, not the entirety of the people they ate. At that point, you have to decide which is the bigger risk--trying to kill and eat a single powerful wizard, or exposing yourself to many brains.

Actually, with force-feeding and consciousness-sundering drugs... you could expose one wizard to all of the brain-eating risk, and eat just the person you convince to eat him. This discussion is exceeding morbid, isn't it?

EDIT: I was mistaken about the chain method.

  Magic has computational power, but no intelligence.
#+end_quote

This needs to be quantified, along with the efficiency rate of converting other kinds of energy to magical energy (or how magic may detect variation in nonmagical energy levels, whether through conversion to magical energy or magically abstract information, as in 7), because these are the most important parts. This determines the costs of remote viewing and automatic analysis, as well as other computation in general, and replenishment of a spell's individual power or your own through ambient means.

In addition to this, saying that it has computational power but no intelligence is an oxymoron, as intelligent processes are a computation, and would be achievable in this system regardless.

You need to specify whether replenishment occurs not at all while spells are in effect, or at a reduced rate, possibly inversely related to the current energy drain. Your rules 9 and 10 seem particularly artificial in their limitations, and I would recommend a less contrived ruleset for a story based in this setting. I am wondering what is so special about the brain here as well, and this would be something my character experiments with, as upload is a very highly-rated instrumental goal.

You need to clarify how the detection of magic works. What is an "effect," and how much information do you have about the effect? Can you sense magical energy levels or detect them through magic with any amount of accuracy? This question in particular is important, as my immediate reaction to 11, despite the contradictory 8, is to always run a spell either alerting me when my energy levels approach 0 or shutting down all of my spells for me. Another possible interpretation of 8 in light of 11 is that spells are at least able to determine your own reserves, or there is the capacity to build in cost limiters into the spell itself.

An accurate form of magic detection is /necessary/ to answer any of these questions in-universe. I would require answers for these out-of-universe to know my character's capabilities, and how quickly I would be able to determine those answers in-universe through experimentation. You also don't specify how much of this information is given to the character, so I would assume the entire contradictory text is given to every wizard simultaneously. Even with these rules, there is not enough information to proceed, and an accurate form of magic detection is the largest prerequisite to even approaching breaking this universe. At the current level of information, with no other way to gain more (besides research to find a magic detector), there is very little I could do other than participate in the global cannibalistic deathmatch these rules would inspire.

Research into safely eating brains would be required regardless of answers. I want my life bar to be as large as possible.

EDIT to add:

What kinds of sensory powers does magic intrinsically have? Can it follow normal human definitions of what an "object" is? Can it take inputs within the 1/4 mile (eg. "produce photons going away from this sphere, as if all of the incoming photons had reflected off of a perfect mirror.")? Can it take inputs from outside the 1/4 mile for free (eg. produce photons coming out of this surface that are identical to the ones passing through that distant object/location.")?

** Experiment how magic works at molecular scale, as a catalyst. Kickstarting an exothermic reaction with a catalyst uses no joules of energy, other than the creation of a catalyst and the start of the first exothermic reaction. The start of the reaction is utterly minuscule on a Joules scale, but it's the "creation of a catalyst" which is vague. Magic seems to usually act as a 99.9999999...=100% perfect thermodynamic engine, so by extrapolation it should be free.

If exothermic reactions can in fact be catalysed using magic, as the rules seem to indicate, all terrestrial matter other than Fe-56 is now susceptible to nuclear detonation, at minimal magical cost.

I'm not sure how to use this knowledge without risking global extinction. There are so many actors in this world that MAD is unsustainable. What I need is knowledge. Experiment with building an autonomous magical detection system; one which can recognise casting and some to-be-determined authorisation system. If that works, set up the following global rule, or one like it:

#+begin_quote
  (while 0) If [someone who isn't authorised] uses magic^{1} , trigger a small nuclear explosion in their voice box (disabling their ability to cast magic while hopefully keeping them alive).
#+end_quote

This should serve to keep me anonymous while eliminating all threats other than non-exploded wizards who happen to see me in person. Since any magic is invariably suicidal, it is hopefully almost impossible that someone would stumble on a functional magical machine capable of significant damage within this system.

I would also try to invent a system which allows me to incapacitate a wizard before I have to vocalise a trigger word. Most crudely this would be destroying someone's voice box if I snap my fingers while I look at them, and most sophisticatedly it would read my^{2} thoughts, pick up the "that guy is a wizard" signal, and use that as a trigger to destroy their voice box.

So, /GM volente/, this would serve to make me and people I authorise the only people capable of magic. It would leave me anonymous, except perhaps in the distribution of wizard fatalities which may be higher in my wake (solution: stay indoors until the number of people whose throats mysteriously explode starts dropping).

I would then go about making the world a better place. Crank up particle accelerators, make fission/miniature black hole reactors, threaten world leaders into good governance, blow up terrorists, rapists and murderers, detonate all unauthorised chemical and nuclear weaponry, burn smallpox and cocaine, threaten to destroy the entire planet with my dying breath if it ever comes, etc.

*edit: magic as a nuclear catalyst*

Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon by which an atom can 'hop' from one side of a potential barrier to another. This relies on the quantum wave-function being spread out over space, and not actually being blocked by potential barriers higher than the amount of energy available to the particle (which is in an energy eigenstate for purposes of this explanation), only decreasing at an exponential rate, going from "likely" to "pretty much impossible" in the span of femtometers. Quantum tunnelling is the key mechanism for all particle physics reactions, particles jumping from one energy eigenstate to another at nearly the speed of light and then staying there again for a much longer timescale.

Important for my idea is that the probability of quantum tunnelling never quite goes to zero. It's an exponential decay, but those never reach zero. Nuclear reactions are exothermal, so the quantum tunnelling probability is non-zero, so without adding extra energy it is possible for the hydrogen in water to spontaneously react in accordance to typical solar fission reactions, though the probability means it probably hasn't ever happened at room temperature in the history in the universe.

However, it can happen, therefore it constitutes "any other way" under rule 6. Since quantum tunnelling doesn't require outside energy, the magical reaction doesn't require energy either. Therefore you can catalyse nuclear reactions for free.

That requires conversion of energy into magical energy, which has not been specified. You can push two nuclei together so hard they'll fuse, but that doesn't give you magical energy to replenish what you've used (which is possibly enough to kill you outright, at least on the scale of attempting to create a detonation). It's much simpler to directly convert to heat to melt their vocal cords, or kinetic energy to shred them. I'm not optimistic on their chances of survival, whether by heat, kinetics, or nuclear detonation.

It would be much simpler and safer to melt the recurrent laryngeal nerves, resulting in a complete loss of speech and difficulty respirating during physical activity. To prevent whispering, you would also want to melt the facial nerves. Then you can recognize wizards not only by reserves, but by having the appearance of double stroke victims. You might want to leave the nerves leading to the upper face intact. It's hard to communicate with no verbal articulation as well as facial. Their eyebrow game will still remain.

Ideally, you would want to do this to every wizard who enters your perimeter. However, you deal with the extra risk that every wizard who enters your perimeter will immediately want to kill you. Fortunately, difficulty respirating during physical activity will make their task exceedingly difficult. Depending on the capability of magic to detect magic reserves or magical activity, you would want to extend your perimeter of voice-killing.

You would be exceedingly incapable of making good on destroying the Earth "in your dying breath." Your method of doing so is dependent on the unspecified conversion of natural energy to magical energy (which I doubt is intended), and with such miserably detectable tactics, you would be assassinated without ever knowing about it, and I doubt the OP intends spells to remain active after their master's death, considering rule 8.

First of all, we're talking about nuclear reactions, not chemical reactions. I'll admit I don't know anything about nuclear physics, but cursory research reveals that quantum tunneling happens by /default,/ lowering the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier from classical predictions to what is predicted by the Gamow factor, which /still/ requires high relative velocities to overcome the barrier, meaning you're /still accelerating body-temperature atoms at each other./ If you're talking about muon-catalyzed fusion, you still need to create muons, and muon-catalyzed fusion does not represent a return on investment even given natural to magical energy conversion. None of these methods represent zero cost on your magical energy reserves, and it is not at all clear that this means you will be able to create a sustained nuclear reaction with only four megajoules. You are massively overrepresenting your capabilities.

So, as a physics master student, let me tell you that I'm right, but that I'm just bad at explaining. (Or frankly didn't even bother to, because of careless assumption that people know how quantum tunnelling works).

Quantum tunnelling probability never goes to zero. It increases massively if there's less stuff to tunnel through, so giving particles higher momentum so they can get higher up the momentum bump and/or have small enough wavelength to even be capable of getting closer increases quantum tunnelling probability to macroscopically detectable levels and is one way to accelerate the reaction. But normal radioactive materials perform quantum tunnelling-assisted nuclear reaction often (though only within atoms, not between them), without requiring outside energy sources.

The kind of reaction I'm talking about - entire molecules being spanned by quantum tunnelling - wouldn't occur in all the hydrogen in the observable universe given a hundred trillion years, probably. But in a googolplex years it might.

Quantum tunnelling was just supposed to indicate that it's physically allowed (satisfying rule 6), though, not be the actual mechanism.

It isn't classically defined. You might tend to read it classically, but that's because intuition is classical, not because the rules don't make sense in quantum mechanics.

I did talk about "experiment with catalysts" because I'm not sure this would work. The rules do seem written without regard for quantum mechanics, so if I can't explode the entire universe I'l have to come up with something else.

For example: if I had a lens or parabolic mirror in space, I could use it to focus light on a single point on earth. There would be some absorption losses in the intensity of the beam, but the lensing itself wouldn't cost outside energy (again, other than having to exist, which isn't a problem for normal magic). Therefore I can make an orbital kill sat which can strike anywhere on the planet for free.

Essentially, what is the maximum number of brains you can physically strip the magic from in a given timeframe?

Can you extend the eight hour limit by freezing/preserving the brains? By magically putting them into a volume of slowed time? By accelerating them under thousands of gravities (see also the question about whether liquefying them makes a difference)?

If its one way, I would probably start by draining away a certain amount of magic each day to charge a battery to run all my stuff off of. If I can somehow store pure magical energy then I would do that as well to start accumulating a larger buffer.

I would probably not heavily use my own magic pool to do anything, I would just convert it into some other sort of energy pool and use /that/ for everything.

Geometric increase. Start with a thousand untrained, neophyte wizards (actually 1025 plus spares). Kill and eat the brain of one, making you (on average, and presumably you planned this) about twice as powerful as the other wizards. Use this power to either serially or in parallel arrange to pair the other wizards off, including pairing one with yourself (who will be less powerful than you). Kill half the wizards and have the other half eat their brains, /ideally without them knowing they are doing it or being aware of the brain-eating method of powering up/. You now have 512 wizards, including yourself who has approximately 3 wizard-power compared to their 2wp.

Repeat, killing half the living wizards and feeding their brains to the other half. Do this until there are only two of you left. Kill the other wizard and eat their brain.

You now have the power of a thousand wizards.

 

In all this, it would be best to be able to create/raise wizards who are unaware of their power, untrained in its use (or trained to suppress it for religious reasons etc), ignorant of both its true nature and how to increase it, and so on. It might even be a good idea to deliberately brain-damage them if that would not affect their ability to act as a magic container, so they wouldn't be able to realize their likely fate, wouldn't try and escape, and wouldn't be able to gang up on you. And use a very effective assassination method where the victim is unlikely to react in time, even when holding the power of a couple hundred wizards inside them.

(Oh, and while it would be efficient to eat the brain of a 500-wp wizard as a last step, it would be /safer/ to eat wizard brains until you were at, say, 10wp, and then only let other wizards get to perhaps one quarter or less of your power reserves before eating their brains. It means you'll be eating a lot more brains, but it also means you'll have a far less likely chance of accidentally creating a personal nemesis with the same power level as yourself.)

Really, then, your only limit will be how many wizards are born/created/evoked per year on the planet, if you end up eating /all/ their brains and magic (even by proxy).

If magic works faster than light, you can get FTL signaling, which can lead to time travel.

You may be able to transmute neutrons to protons for 1 x 10^-13 J. So move roughly 1-10 milligrams of a substance up one atomic number. Which doesn't seem super useful. Though you could make some exotic isotopes.

6 Sv of radiation (About 360 J for an average person) should be fatal if dosed all at once. 20 Sv (1,200 J) should create a nearly 100% risk of cancer (an untraceable killer), though you would have to dose over time, to prevent massive organ failure.

Alter a cell to become a malignant cancer. Energy should be nearly negligible.

Relatedly, you have a tremendous advantage in chemistry and materials science. You can probably construct nanowire and carbon nanotubes fairly easily from graphene. Nanobots are also viable, provided you have the designs for them. Nanobots in turn give you nearly unlimited manufacturing capabilities, chemical alteration of the human body (No need to eat, sleep, or catch a disease, possible intelligence upgrade and brain-machine interfaces), grey goo, genetically tailored nano-plagues, pollution control, etc, etc.

Or, I could shift every atom on Earth by an infinitesimal amount. Every wizard on Earth knows I did it, at the speed of light--with sufficient wizards, a predictable result is that many will immediately replicate the experiment. If thousands of wizards do this, every wizard on Earth will momentarily be severely distracted by the sheer volume of spells. I could use this opportunity to have a few normal friends incapacitate wizards I previously identified, for example. Maybe that is how I'd get my first few brains.

** 1) Set out permanently working spell "If my reserves drop to 100 joules or below (for safety), disable all my magic IMMEDIATELY". This should overwrite any other spells.

2) Since killing people is very easy with this sort of magic, you should concentrate on researching defence first. Make a spell "I cancel all not-mine magic within X meters of my body", leave it up permanently. If it doesn't work, make a spell "If anything gets affected by magic within X meters of my body, affect it back with the same energy". If this doesn't work too, you're out of luck - any violent mage can rip your heart out in 1/8 second from VERY long range.

Btw, if it does work, you'll need bullet shield next. It can be formulated like "Stops (relative to my center-of-mass) any small (get working definition) object moving faster than (get bullet speeds) m/s when it comes within 2 meters of me". This shouldn't activate in rain and should be always active. You can try to refine this shield to be skin-tight and also melee strikes.

3) Research information magic. You SHOULD get some extra information from your magic, otherwise you won't be able to achieve much besides throwing lasers. If you know that there's your jacket in a wardrobe, and you try to summon it without knowing it's exact location - what would happen?

4) About lasers - GET THEM! Perfect lasers allow you to somewhat bypass your range, which may help you survive.

5) Start making money! If your information magic research bore fruit, game online casinos or currency markets. If it didn't, then enrolling into chemical study and doing synthesis of hard-to-get chemicals may net quick buck. Just don't overdo purity, you may rise suspicions.

6) While you're studying, learn AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE about mind-affecting chemicals. Experiment on people (synthesize it inside their brains; well rats may come first), THIS IS IMPORTANT. You want at least truth serum, but ideally find something that make a person extremely open to suggestions without damaging his brain. If you got information magic, classified CIA research can help.

7) Try to learn about computers too! Distances may be a bitch, but you can always fly to server's physical location, and changing several bytes of data may give you admin access. Actually, learning about it yourself may take too long, try to get in touch with some hackers. If your mind-affecting magic worked, it may help. Tell them some convincing lie, like you have connections, and do your magic tricks.

7.5) Magic can do math, but how fast? Can magic solve modern encryption in reasonable time? If it can, you just got free Wi-Fi and ton of other perks like money (from hacking banks), classified information from goverments and a lot of cool stuff. Your hacker friends can offer ideas, but they better be brainwashed enough.

8) Try to do some immortality/regeneration research. Will your magic allow you to patch damaged tissue without all underlying knowledge? What about halting aging? Get knowledge if you feel it helps. What about rising your dormant clone in a basement and making a spell that will transfer your consciousness into him if you suffer lethal damage?

9) Optimally with violence defence, mind-affecting spells, hacking friends and some safeguards you're ready to enter business world. Beware - your less scrupulous competitors are already there. Try to get in contact with some bio-tech start-ups, show your abilities with getting stuff done (mind-rapes, yay!). You want to get research team under your command. These people know about chemistry and biology MUCH MORE than you with your unfinished chem grad, and as a boss you get to ask stupid questions.

10) Start getting serious about immortality research. You want this done as fast as possible, because your brain is slowly dying every second! If you get any muggle-usable result, show it and get more people on the problem. If you meet other magi and can persuade them to cooperate, DO IT! You want to be able to do anti-aging spell ASAP.

11) Maybe this is time to research magic itself. What makes human a mage? Is it something in the brain? Clone yourself, would your clone be a mage? If yes, shit's too easy (you can also eat his brain). Can you make normal human into the mage? Probably not, but worth several weeks of research.

12) If You're alive, you should've made some magi friends by this time. Network among them, get to know prominent mages. Be extremely careful, they are DANGEROUS (especially if protective spells don't work. And even if they do, 4 Mj steel ball may very well be the end for you). Try to convince them that you only mean well. If you can create a perfect copy of yourself, you can offer it for interrogation (assuming you don't plan world domination).

13) Time to take over some African country! Persuade your magic-wielding allies, get there and brainwash a dictator or something. Get good political consultant so you won't do more harm. If you want, try your hand at stopping geopolitical crisis (like ISIS or Ukraine), credit may come handy.

14) Start rebuilding your country! Set up schools with magic-tests, get as much recruits as you can. Persuade your allies to teach the newbies. In several decades (assuming WW III: Magic Edition didn't destroy humanity) you'll have loyal following. You may try to opt for brainwashing army, but this may alienate your initial followers. And if they are brainwashed too... well, one of them may be faking it the whole time. Don't risk eternity for child soldier parades! Well, unless you got great safeguards.

15) Actually, one African country may be small potatoes. Spread your influence, maybe run for Presidency (there may be other mages willing, maybe join a coalition and become major supporter), maybe marry into Royal Family. Actually, with all your bio-tech research, you should be able to convincingly alter body appearances. Find adventurous friend/underling among ordinary people, kidnap Putin and make your friend look-alike Russian President. Don't forget to thoroughly interrogate Vladimir - KGB can be scary, maybe they have safeguards for this. Actually they probably already have mages on payroll, so this stuff is SERIOSLY DANGEROUS, do at your own risk.

16) Well, there are 3 scenarios after several decades. Either you're the only competent mage, and then it's time to bid for world. Or there are several, and they divided Earth between themselves and their followers. Try to mediate tensions and get magi to unite, or at least not slaughter each other. Or there is WW III: Magic Edition, and then your best option is to run as far as possible (Antarctica may be interesting, keep yourself warm with magic) and survive.

17) Assuming you can continue your research, get working nanotech, solve FAI and enjoy your Singularity! If you managed previous steps without massive screw-ups, you probably deserve it.

** #+begin_quote
  Using magic to do a task uses exactly as many joules of energy as doing the task any other way, times a variable for distance between you and the object affected.
#+end_quote

I can "break" this if you don't define the constraints a bit more. If you saying that the energy cost is proportional to the amount of energy I'm adding to the universe (that's what it sounds like) then breaking is pretty easy.

For example: Suppose I wanted to convert one form of energy into another (say, use magic to convert sunlight into electricity). /If I had a solar panel/, it would actually cost me zero energy to do this - just place the solar panel near the light. Does it cost me zero energy to do it with magic?

Or lets say there's a rubber ball hurtling towards me and I want to change its direction. I could exert force over the ball and expend energy... or I could say "if there was a giant slab of solid between me and the ball, the ball would just bounce away and no energy would be introduced into the system".

How do we calculate the energy cost of things like this? Obviously floating rocks or something have calculable energy costs in the form of how badly they violate conservation, but many useful actions won't.

In fact, all actions which don't actually increase entropy can be conceptualized as "free" under some interpretation. There's no distance limitation on that so....basically God already, I can put out the stars at my leisure.

*** I suppose you need to affect each atom individually. You can't "borrow" energy to transfer it somewhere else. If you're trying to cold the air, you're expending energy to stop molecules, not getting it back.

**** That doesn't fix it, it only makes the problem on a smaller scale.

Take "levitation" for example. Should it be costless or costly, to levitate a bunch of atoms (hold them against the force of gravity) assuming they are not currently in motion, and why? The human intuition is that it takes energy to hold something up, but it doesn't really - /we/ might get tired from keeping our arms stiff, but that's a quirk of physiology. A different physiology could stay rigid with no energy usage, like a stool. How on earth do we plan to calculate the cost of levitation?

Note that if you dis-allow costless bouncing, costless invisible walls, and so on, you'll have a fairly tough time justifying costless levitation.
