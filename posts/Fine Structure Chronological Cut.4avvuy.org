Sam has [[http://qntm.org/chronological][posted]] a listing of the chapters of Fine Structure in chronological order. I can't comment much without a re-read, but it seems to be an interesting way to read the story.

He also mentioned an ongoing "end-to-end rewrite of the story," which I'm /very/ excited about.


** I haven't reread /Fine Structure/ in far too long, but it stands as maybe one of the most enjoyable things I ever remember reading. (Maybe because I happened to read it alongside the Sequences, but I digress.) Very much looking forward to this edit!

And hell, maybe this has motivated me to finish Ra tonight. It's only 11:50, and school starts at 7:30 tomorrow ... I have time.

** I tried reading fine structure a few years ago just after finishing RA but I was sort of put off by all the jumping around in the timeline. Now with the chronological order things make a lot more sense and it's actually enjoyable

** I'm (slightly) annoyed that Sam makes posts that he doesn't put on his RSS. Thanks for the update!
