  “What don't you like about yourself?” I asked.

  “Oh, lots of things,” Amaryllis replied.
#+end_quote

The Amaryllis technique of getting a boy to date you: first, magically remove all romantic interest you have in him, keeping him fully aware of this. Second, have a child by someone else (magical deer are preferred but not necessary). Make sure he is present during the conception, although the conception can occur before step 1. Then, have a genuine outpouring of all the things you dislike about yourself, especially if those things are related to feeling guilty about stabbing people. The boy asking for cuddles as an oblique way of asking you out is soon to follow, at which point you have succeeded.

Jokes aside, we're about two significant Mary-Joon interactions away from them being officially a couple (that they admit to themselves. Everyone else on the isle is shipping them hard). It's been a long time coming, and been handled very well, showing that they're genuinely friends and depend on each other.

The interactions with Grak and Raven have been nice in these chapters as well. The bit after the meeting with Esuen shows, rather than tells, how much Grak looks up to Juniper (other than literally). In contrast, Gemma returning is mentioned in one line and then basically forgotten.

Speaking of Grak, loyalty 20 is pretty close, and that will be a big thing. Not only will Joon get ~40 in warding instantly, Grak will get access to all of Joon's magics. For someone who really dislikes himself, I'm wondering how he will handle getting the ability to change himself so freely. Would boosting his values effectively end or lessen his depression? His comments on what Fallatehr did to him seem to indicate that this would work.

The jokes are always good. Uther just using the German word for castle, using the German grammar for naming the people who made the metaphorical castles, the Tuung calling themselves Battletoads, /The Princess Diaries/. Some of the understated things get a laugh out of me as well, like the blunt "yep, this thing just makes elk." I'm sure there's some that went over my head, as a number have in the past.

For the Respec, I'm a little unclear on a few things. Taking Rune magic seems odd given that there will probably be tight restrictions on people entering the runeforge. Air magic is said to have a really good use case, but I'm not seeing it right now. And warding seems redundant given that Grak will be hitting Loyalty 20 soon and give Joon an instant 40 in warding, which would make it on par with his other skills for a number of levels. And speaking of that, not unlocking warding seems a bit odd given that Grak is one of the best warders alive and is right there to train Joon. Just finding out if he can quickly make a wand and monocle seem like they are worth the time it would take to unlock warding.

This comment has gone on long enough, but as a last note I love the idea that Joon got the effective skill of at least 10 years spent as a flower mage, and then gave that skill up, before he ever actually used a flower.

***** I don't know, removing romantic feelings and removing a depression does not seem in the same ballpark. A depression is universally seen as a bad thing. We treat it with pills and therapy right now, but if we could make them go away with a snap of the finger I'm pretty sure everybody would do it. It would, of course, not fix the cause of the depression, but diagnosing and fixing that becomes easier when the depression is not in the way, murking the waters.

****** I mean I agree in principle but based on Juniper's editing of himself the way he would accomplish this would be to lower the spiritual emotional threads involved. There is no depression thread or value to change. There are just the threads that are reacting to the in Grak's case the tragedy that caused it. Basically if my understanding is correct to accomplish what you're talking about would require Grak to make himself care less about the fate of his home. If Grak was still suicidal I could see Juniper endorsing this but with the situation as is I don't think anyone will see it as necessary.

******* Joon's understanding of spirit is pretty good at this point. He could probably fine tune the feedback mechanisms of the spirit to favor motivation and hope over self-hatred and despair without affecting the individual weighting of specific things relative to each other (except insofar as the changes will affect Grak over time).

If he only had soul magic to work with, you'd have a point given that that's how the values system works, but spirit seems to be ALL ABOUT manipulating feedback loops, and depression (and many other mental illnesses) can be understood by seeing our mind as a vast system of various feedback loops, some of which, particularly in the case of mental illness, are tuned suboptimally and are thus too excitable/susceptible-to-positive-feedback or too unexcitable/susceptible-to-negative-feedback. This is of course a vast oversimplification of the actual processes involved (which probably differ between Aerb's spirit based system and the electrochemical processes we use on earth), but Joon is something of an expert on spirit, and based on what we know of spirit, this seems like exactly what it's good at.

******* I agree if there is no depression thread things become far more complicated. Now that you say it, I am not even sure Grak is depressed, more extremely emotionally traumatized due to his past. I always saw depression as a separate thing from trauma. Atleast, I know a few people with depressions who have not suffered any bad trauma (as far as I know). They might very well exacerbate each other, of course. Grak might very well have a depression on top of the rest. If it is "just" emotional trauma, it is probably not the right choice to just handwave it away. That seems extremely shitty to all the people that died and are suffering in the hells. But on the other hand, what does it help them that Grak feels continually shitty about it. Complicated situation, like everything else in this novel I guess.

You wouldn't call them vehemently against domestic abuse, because of all the abusing that continue to do.

Like, we saw Juniper let Amaryllis self modify, plus or minus some talking. I don't see a reason to think he'd do different for Grak, maybe there's a hypocritical lecture, maybe there isn't, but I think the day Grak gets essentialism is the day he cures his depression.

******* When he soulfucked someone without consent, obviously that's different from doing something to yourself. And he doesn't seem to have any philosophical problem with modifying the parts of himself he considers evil, like manipulating his spirit to not value level-ups too much, just with carelessly modifying the soul and spirit to avoid dealing with something hard.

But contextualizing depression as a failure to deal with something hard is problematic for reasons I hope I don't need to explain. Grak's depression isn't some failure on da nad part or something it is necessary for di to suffer now in order for di to be happy later; if curing depression is taking the 'easy way out', then doing things the easy way isn't a bad thing in this situation. But regardless of anything else, it's a decision Grak has to make for di era.

******** For the record I've strictly been arguing from what I believe Juniper the fictional character believes and would do. That said I did not intend to contextualize depression as a failure to deal with something hard. I did not even imagine my comment could possibly be interpreted that way. I was arguing strictly for how the magic system we've seen in story might accomplish the effect of "curing" Grak's compression and why Juniper might take issue with that. Suffice it to be said, I'm more in line with Amaryllis's view of self modification than Juniper's.

And yes Juniper may be a hypocrite with his beliefs. That said the level up thing was a bit different. That was an involuntary change to his soul being forced on him by the DM. He was just putting himself back at baseline, which is entirely consistent with his beliefs as stated on soul modification.

With vibration magic, it is considerably cheaper to modify an existing oscillation than it is to create one from nothing.

** Post-Respec it definitely feels like the social values have gone down and the mental values have gone up, in a more noticeable way than just 'Juniper immediately solves complicated maths problem to indicate he is now smarter,' as some media might do. He thinks his way through his problems more logically (though I guess this could be some kind of placebo effect on my part), or at least seems to - when he raised issues with Amaryllis and Esuen, it seemed like there was less waffling, and more of Juniper zeroing in on a problem, and either finding a solution or asking what solution was preferred.

Also it seems a bit like the enhanced MEN is helping to allay some of the potential fallout from reduced SOC, which... actually makes a lot of sense? Sometimes in the past it felt like all the enhanced SOC did was make Joon aware of a problem, without pointing out any resolutions. If he allocates those points instead to MEN - well, sometimes people really /aren't/ all that complicated, and /can/ just be solved by knowing more things. Or maybe it's that, without Joon trying to be suave and understanding, his bluntness comes off more endearing and honest than his half-hearted attempts at manipulation did?

In any case, great chapters. These felt like downtime chapters, but even so the interaction and subtle complications that arise are keeping me very much invested. Even the introduction of those minor characters, like the captain, or the border guards, feels like the introduction of nuanced characters - enough that, in any other book, I'd mark them down as being plot-relevant later on. Bravo, Mr. Wales.

**** Right, but that's what I meant by MEN compensating somewhat by giving him better analytical ability. He doesn't have to rely on a social sense in all situations, he can sometimes just rely purely on his ability to figure things out and apply it to other people.

To me, he felt a bit less smooth, and a bit more direct when it came to his conversations with, for example, Grak, explicitly telling him what he thought Grak's version of heaven would be instead of going for a more subtle resolution.

I don't know if that makes sense? Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that (at least to me) the drop in SOC made him a bit less socially competent, but the hike in MEN meant that that wasn't as noticeable, because he could see what people wanted and how to give it to them anyway.

There'll probably be consequences for the SOC drop at some point anyway (and like you said, he's grown as a person unrelated to his stats), but for now it feels a bit like Mr. Wales is pointing out that there's a lot of overlap when it comes to social abilities and just pure cognitive ability.

I've recently started playing in a FATE campaign, and this to me looks like a rules-as-written interpretation of FATE.

Purely conceptual beings, with a powerful relationship to narrative, who can insert retroactively true people and places into the world? That's the power of the DM, basically---just slightly lesser, and therefore reachable, as proven by Uther. My guess is that Joon will visit the Outer Reaches and, somehow, take the power of the schlossvolk for his own.

The power to retroactively edit history by inserting ‘schloss' is so near to the power of a god that it makes little difference what you call it. And considering that the Ice Wizards are the direct result of the schlossvolk's meddling, and also the result of the DM's insistence on Uther following a never-ending narrative path, it seems clear that there's a major connection between the two.

Given Juniper's reluctance to tinker with his soul to improve it, it seems likely he'll be similarly reluctant to fundamentally alter his conceptual self. But he's been willing to make exceptions when it's needed, so perhaps that won't deter him.

None of that helps in this situation. Your eye is not a telescope.

To increase magnification, you need a second lens. And even if you did, the size of the lens is important, because that determines the light gathering power.

That's why telescopes are so large, and scientists keep making larger and larger ones. You need to gather more photons from a distant object, because you receive less light from it compared to a nearby object.

Cheap telescopes often advertise high magnification numbers, like 500x, but that is useless because the image is so dim.

My understanding of squinting is that it reduces the angle light is coming in from, which reduces noise and makes the image more coherent. Does squinting help if your lens is already shaped optimally? (Also, I'd think you could magnify at least a little by making the lens really thick, though not close to the level of a telescope.)

Not exactly.

Squinting is the same as making a pinhole camera. The image is in focus for any distance, for any magnification. This is because only photons from one specific location on the target object may strike one location on the film or retina.

Why don't we use this all the time? The number of photons coming in at a straight line from one point of the target is very low, resulting in a dim image. The smaller the pinhole, the better the focus, but that results in a lesser number of photons.

****** No, that's the tetrahedral d4 IMO. Sure, it's platonic, but it doesn't have an up-facing side and so it has to go with a shitto workaround. They also roll terribly and are worse than legos to step on. I've seen videos of d4s based on the truncated tetrahedron, though I don't own any myself. They have a very small chance of landing on the small labelled sides (so small as to be negligible), but in return you get an up-facing side to put the label on (and thus one that's much easier to read), a die that can't double as a caltrop and perhaps most importantly a die that rolls much better (I haven't tried it, but I can tell just watching that it's rolling more instead of landing straight down). Also, I personally find them more visually pleasing with the nice clean hexagons, but that's up to personal preference. Now that I've remembered these, I might actually buy them, though my group hasn't been able to meet lately.

The company that made the truncated tetrahedron d4s also made another die that I like in principle (but have never actually used), the rhombic dodecahedral d12. Sure, it's not platonic, but it tiles space beautifully and is just as fair.

By the way, "shitto" was a typo, but I'm leaving it because I like it.

Bethel and valencia, their most powerful members by far, were "coincidentally" removed too.

*** Think of how the Chernobyl disaster happened. There was no singular point of failure that caused the disaster. Instead, it was a compounding series of small mistakes folding into large problems folding into an overall catastrophe.

*/Worst Case/* puts a floor on large-scale plans created by Joon, such that regardless of the number of variables involved, the overall results can be no worse than the worst case of two compounding mistakes. How it accomplishes this (adjusting Joon's planmaking, adjusting reality on the fly, adjusting things posthoc) is unknown.

This sounds, on the face of it, tremendously powerful. Plans of any scale can have no more than two relevant errors when written by Joon. Except...

1. It has no real impact on smaller or on-the-fly plans, where two variables are about as much as you should be dealing with in the first place (see [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/24][Malfoy's 'Rule of Three' explanation of plotting]] in HPMOR).
2. Joon currently offloads all large-scale planning to Amaryllis, who doesn't have the virtue.
3. Two compounding mistakes can still be pretty huge. The Death Star was destroyed from the results of a single mistake in placing a thermal exhaust port. When the world runs on narrative, an unbeatable plan with a single tiny flaw is arguably a /bigger/ problem than an overall '90%' plan where all the bases are more-or-less covered.

Which together explains why it's merely a level 10 virtue on par with ambidexterity, and not a capstone.

*** So there Geejo's answer, and then there's the RPG term-of-art version, which is what I think is actually being implied.

Suppose you had a system much like the one shown in Worth the Candle. You're making a Logistics check by rolling a 1d100 die and then adding your total bonus of +50, and the Target Number is 75. If you roll a 24 (for a total of 74), that's just barely a failure, which should suggest to the DM that you only just barely failed in character. If you rolled a 15 instead, you'd have failed by a larger margin and this should suggest to the DM that your character failed to a greater degree. Likewise, rolling a total of 139 should imply a more successful result than just scraping by with a 79.

Some TTRPGs formalize this notion as 'degrees of success' and 'degrees of failure, often with 5 or 10 point break points. For example, failing by 1 point is an ordinary failure, but failing by 10 points is 'one degree of failure', a failure which is one step worse than an ordinary failure. If this is what the Worst Case virtue refers to, it means that any failure of the third degree or worse gets treated as a second degree failure - there is a sharp limit on how badly a person with this virtue can screw up their logistics chain, in other words.

** I assume this is because I've never played D&D, but could someone help explain again the math the Joon and Reimer go through here:

#+begin_quote
  “Right,” said Reimer. “Right. So, let's compare you against a hypothetical optimized character, even a poorly optimized character. Heck, even one as poorly optimized for social skills as you are optimized for physical skills. An eleven in SOC means they're multiplying their skill by ten, and that skill is going to be thirty or so, which means they get a bonus of three hundred against the TN. That means achievable range in the naive case of three hundred and one to four hundred.” He waited for me to nod. “Right, so you're sitting here with a four in SOC, meaning a multiplier to skill of three, and you cap out at a whopping nine on that skill. That means a bonus of twenty-seven, and an achievable range, again, in the naive case with no adjustments or multipliers, of twenty-eight to one hundred and twenty-seven.”
#+end_quote

Is it just in the rules that the multiplier is your skill minus 1? And we are assuming a skill level of 3? And an achievable range automatically adds 100? Also what is an achievable range?

*** The add 100 is due to rolling a d100, which can have values between 1 and 100. The achievable range is the range of values that you can get when rolling against a number to see if you fail or not. With a bonus of 27 from skills and stats, the lowest you can roll is 28 (27 plus rolling a 1) through 127 (27 plus rolling a 100).

*** The Spirituality virtue means that Juniper divides the mental strain of Gem Magic by his current skill in Gem Magic, making it considerably cheaper for him to use than for anyone else. Like, roughly twenty times cheaper at his current skill level.

But even if you're not Juniper, being a Gem Mage means having an automatic weapon with a couple magazines worth of target-seeking, IFF-equipped bullets. Or several shots of magical battering ram. Or the ability to cancel enemy use of such weapons on the cheap. Any or all of which can be readily concealed as ordinary jewelry of the sort a non-Gem Mage would be equally likely to wear, and which appears as such even to wards and warders.

Furthermore, these shots can be projected from any part of the body and the activation of the magic is purely mental - making it ideal to use alongside Multithreading (which lets him focus on two things at once, say using Blade-Bound stuff on the defense and Gem Magic on the offense).

*** I don't think it's been put on a pedestal. Quite the contrary, until recently Juniper constantly complained how it was a pain to use. It was only after he got a Spirit virtue that greatly reduces the downside of Gem Magic that he started considering it worth something. Its main advantage in comparison to Juniper's other magics is that it allows for ranged attacks that track enemies.

*** I may be forgetting a magic or two, but in general it's range and relative usage against most common defenses. It's sort of like how void weapons are better than normal guns, gem magic is sorta better in the same ways, it's the best possible offensive magic. I think it's put on a pedestal because it's a directly offensive magic that can in theory be used to take down an army if one has enough power behind it (which Juniper is finally hitting). That's just not a thing that's theoretically possible with any other single magic (save for example Soul Magic and modifying a commander kind of things) we've seen on screen to memory. It's homing abilities are especially scary. But I think the real issue is: are Gem Magic projectiles physical and hence stoppable by any of the kinetic mages (gold, still, etc.) or are they light and hence pretty unstoppable sans revision mage or warder, not sure if we know that yet.

**** There's only so many magics available, and a number of them aren't useful for him (wood, steel). There would need to be something he could take that is better than what he has now, and I doubt there are many skills better than the magic ones. Rune, air, and warding are a bit questionable, but the rest are fairly defensible, especially since he's both sharing skills with soon to be two other people, and they're collectively running a country. Synergies are also possible yes, particularly in regards to Fire, Plastic, and Alchemy.

*** Punch lasers, yes. It's a good way of attacking large groups of people from range, and a cheap way of seeing if you can take out a stronger opponent. Vibration magic can do the same thing, but attacking a large group with enough force to be lethal uses up a substantial amount of breath which could be used on other things. The best example so far was when they were going to Kuum Doona, using gem magic with a sapphire was able to kill a bunch of soldiers that would have been hard to hit with non-homing attacks.

Aside from that, it was always a powerful direct-damage skill that he /wanted/ to like---it's just that now with whichever virtue it is that makes the cost more bearable, it's actually viable.

I can't imagine how. If AW had put in changes for us to find, how would it be breaking the unwritten rules of the mystery to, you know, find them? I guess there's an argument against automating it rather than looking for changes by hand, but I'm not too sympathetic to the idea that that amount of tedium is necessary for the challenge to be fair.

My guess as for why I was downvoted was that someone didn't approve of me not feeling like putting in the effort myself.
