- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

*** Not too certain here. Not a D&D player really. Can objects with no weight have any sort of effect on the world? No weight implies no mass, which means it has no energy to be utilized, correct? Burning it would (presumably) result in destroying the object with invisible, intangible flames (as the fire would produce neither light nor heat)

The mere fact that it's visible at all implies it must possess some form of energy. Your challenge, as a noobie lvl 1 starting character, is to figure out what that is and how to use it. I wish you luck.

I would also like to point out that this study was referring specifically to practicing motor control which is useful to know for martial artists and sports athletes.

Either way, this is helpful to know explicitly that having more variety in one's practice is a good thing, so thanks for the link!

*** I saw this mentioned elsewhere, and basically if I understood correctly in this study the difference they made in the exercise was so minor that the participants didn't even realize it was made. Thus for all we know A change "bigger" than what was performed could lower the performance. So it is not exactly clear from the research if and how this could be implemented generally for skills to truly benefit from the effect shown here.

Essentially I would say this is mostly a call for more research to be performed on this to better understand the phenomenon rather than an action point which you should implement right now.

so what is to convince us that we need more difference than the actual differences that happen naturally in the physical world simply because it is not as controlled as the virtual world?

*** Nice!

If you're interested in a book that collects a lot of research into learning techniques that optimize for making concepts stick around, try [[http://makeitstick.net/][Make It Stick]].

Seems like massed practice/rereading many chapters to review material is not a good technique. Instead, they recommend mixing up what you're learning, doing retrieval practice with flash cards or simplistic quizzes, doing practice tests, and trying to push hard to get to a difficulty level where you're not already confortable with your perf (depends on what you're comfortable with as a perf level) and then improving that. Among other things.

I employ these kinds of techniques when I'm learning new skills at work. Especially mixed practice and also getting a bit outside my comfort zone. Seem to work well. I have the usual hours but I'm still able to deliver really good outcomes now. It's harder to measure things like this at work though; if you're at school, you at least don't have to solve the measurement problem yourself and you have more easily predictable time frames and topics too.

*** Hmm, it's probably a bit of a stretch to say that altruism in Africa is the BEST use of money to help Americans, but it certainly does something to help Americans. The goal of altruism isn't "help me personally" so it's not going to be as helpful as just putting that money in the bank then using it later. Whatever you do is likely to be less useful than buying more stuff for yourself or putting cash aside for a rainy days

That being said, making the world more stable and wealthy in the long run probably makes things better for Americans by providing more trading partners and reducing the likelihood we need to get involved in wars.

******** The main impact terrorists have on American well-being isn't killing Americans anyways. Terrorists are like pedophiles or guns (contrast: swimming pools and cigarettes). They seem really bad and scary but they're not actually doing that much harm, in America at least. Most of the harm terrorism causes has to do with money and lives we spend on counter-terrorism efforts that range from modestly effective to "actually causes more terrorism" rather than Americans killed.

Terrorism is interesting to think about stopping, but not actually the main benefit of helping Africa. Getting involved in overseas wars kills more Americans than terrorism. Assuming you could actually spend some kind of money to ensure that all 50 or so countries in Africa became and remained stable, you'd probably save more American lives via reduced need for American intervention than reduced terrorist risk.

Normally like 10 Americans are killed per year tops in this kind of thing. Even 2001, the worst (best?) year for terrorists killing Americans, only about 3,000 died. Contrast 38,000 americans who die per year in car accidents, deaths that are by and large completely avoidable (breathlyser ignitions in every car, for example, or just people not driving when they're sleepy or drunk), or the 21,000 who die via suicide from gunshots, or heck, even the 500 who died via accidental firearm discharge who might have been easier to save than any of these groups.

The CDC estimates the number of alcohol-related deaths to be around 30k per year. So you could have TEN 9/11 terrorist attacks every year, and it STILL might be a better idea (from the point of view of just saving lives) to focus cash and effort on stopping alcohol deaths than terrorist attacks.

I guess I'm just saying, whether or not spending money in Africa stops terrorism, even if it did, it would only prevent like 10 deaths per year, since that's about how much terrorism happens, and even if 9/11 happened every month it still might not be a great idea???

**** Just playing the devil's advocate here, but I noticed that your argument is making the unspoken assumption that:

Donating money to Africa -> More stability in Africa.

I'm pretty sure that people have made arguments that constantly giving money is making African governments dependent on it as a source of revenue. In addition, corrupt officials have no interest to actually use the given money to improve Africa in a way that would decrease donations.

I can't actually remember what proof there was for the above argument, just that people have stated this was something that happens.

** Well, this isn't really a rationality related question, I suppose. It could be, but it probably isn't. However, it IS a fiction/author related question, so I figured I could still ask it in the general thread.

I'm about to start a multi-chapter fanfiction story. It won't be a rational work specifically. I haven't really finalized any of the details, but I've had trouble finishing multi-chapter stories in the past. I get about 20, maybe 30k words in before I run out of steam and abandon the project. Here's my question:

To our authors. Those people that have written and completed many chaptered(?) works. What sort of tools/techniques do you use to assist you? Do you storyboard things? Do you build outlines? Do you schedule time just to write? What methods do you find effective in maintaining both your desire to write and your passion for the current story? Some gentlemen of note I'd be interested in hearing from are [[/u/eaglejarl]] and [[/u/alexanderwales]]. I'm sure there are other noteworthy authors here as well, so please comment! :)

*** I use a program called [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php][Scrivener]], which is where I do all my outlining and planning these days. So my whole manuscript looks [[http://i.imgur.com/QqYaRmv.png][like this]] with everything broken down by chapter and scene. Most scenes are planned out ahead of time, if I'm doing things right, and they'll have a single line description like "Sander goes into the woods alone". On a higher level, I tend to plan out story and character arcs, usually with [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details][a story circle]]. Breaking a whole big thing down into 20 or so story beats is really helpful, especially if placed along the circular story path.

As far as keeping up motivation ... deadlines tend to help me with that, especially when I've stated them to other people. I definitely set time aside specifically for writing, because it's easier to write when that's part of my routine. Scrivener lets me set session goals and I usually consider par to be 600 words (actual output varies quite a bit depending on what's going on and what I'm trying to write).

If you need a break, take a break, but ideally take a break that you have a set time to come back from. When I was writing /Shadows of the Limelight/ I needed a break so took a week off to write a novella (/The Case of the Sleeping Beauties/). But I had a definite restart date, so it wouldn't have been easy to just let one week off turn into two weeks off, which would have changed into three weeks off, etc. It's still definitely possible to burn out on something and struggle with remembering what attracted you to it in the first place.

Edit: Also, if you want to see some of my planning process and don't care about *spoilers for The Dark Wizard of Donkerk*, in 2014 I wrote three articles ([[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][pt1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][pt2]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][pt3]]) detailing my pre-writing process for National Novel Writing Month (for a story that I'm still in the process of actually writing).

***** It really depends on what you want to do. Scrivener works just like any other text editor, it's just got it's own file system in the +right-hand+ left-hand pane. If all you want is to organize chapters and scenes in a logical way, you can do that in a matter of seconds. Compiling (where Scrivener turns your writing into a PDF, epub, text document, mobi, etc.) is mostly just a single mouse click, but it depends on how fancy you want to get with it. The presets are pretty good if you follow the suggested file structure of having folders represent chapters which contain files that represent scenes.

So to do the basic stuff (actually writing chapters), there's maybe a minute or two of learning. The more you want to do, the more there is to learn, but I haven't found that it puts any barriers between me and the actual work of writing, and lowers barriers in a few places (mostly by centralizing and organizing projects).

*** It sounds tangential, but one important thing is your physical environment. Make sure that your desk is the right height and etc so that you don't start getting sore shoulders / painful wrists / etc from being at the keyboard a lot.

As to what you asked: for my books until now I didn't do a huge amount of outlining or preplanning, although I'm doing more as I go on. 2YE was written completely off the cuff. Induction was planned on an arc level but the actual writing was pretty freeform. The Tinker's Daughter has much more planning, but still not down to the outline level.

This works really well for me because it makes it fun -- I'm not spending effort writing a novel where I know everything that's happening, I am reading a novel that is exactly tuned to my tastes...I just happen to be writing each sentence down as I read it.

There are some issues with this, of course. I've had things go completely not where I expected -- when I wrote 2YE I never intended for Loki to be in it. He just inserted himself at the end of chapter 21 and started stealing the show. Next thing you know he'd talked me into making him the power behind the throne that was driving most of the plot. Albrecht and Jake making a peace treaty was another surprise -- I had intended to have a big blood-and-thunder war with cannons and fireballs and whatnot. When they sat down and signed a peace treaty I was gobsmacked.

(Note that I'm not being hyperbolic here -- I literally had no intention of these things happening, but that's what my fingers wrote. It makes the writing process a lot of fun, but it can play merry hob with your plans.)

The question I would ask: are you writing this for fun, for money, or for something else? If it's for fun, don't spend a lot of time doing the planning -- just let your fingers create a new novel that is specifically tuned to your tastes.

I mostly write freeform. I'll plot out a general idea of where I want the story to go from beginning to end (/very/ general) and then just see what I come up with. I'll usually end up creating a lot of content for it on the fly.

** The D&D campaign I'm running these days is set in a world where most characters (for unclear reasons) never level up beyond ECL 6 or 7. This setting is set a couple thousand years after the previous setting I ran, which took place in The Age of Legends, when the level cap was 20. During The Age of Legends, most countries were just "the amount of area this particular monster/dragon/magelord can personally project force over" and that was that.

Now, in The Age of Kings, it's plausible that a level 5 or 6 mage (who would be one of the most powerful mages in a country, if not the most powerful) may not be able to just murder the King, seize control of the country, and put down anyone who tries to stop him. A level 6 mage is still a sizeable threat, of course, but has a pretty limited ability to project force. No Teleportation, and a lot of the greatest tricks don't work.

So, most countries are feudal monarchies, with adventurers forming their own companies and guilds. A typical country will have one or two major PMCs operating within its borders, each having a few thousand employees. Most of these will be apprentices (levels 1-2), a couple hundred will be journeyman (levels 3-4), a few dozen will be partners (levels 5-6) and there will be a very small number of masters (levels 7+) who are living legends. Rank in the corp doesn't always correspond to power, but it does most of the time.

In any case, our heroes are traveling in a neighboring country and dodging patrols from from enemy PMCs while they carry out their mission. Along the way, they end up encountering wild cats several times. First, they encounter a mundane Great Cat (like, say, a leopard) and kill it. A few days later, their camp is attacked by several Great Cats, a Greater Cat, and a Greatest Cat. They down the Greater Cat and drive off the Great Cats and the Greatest Cat. The ranger decides to kill and skin the unconscious Greater Cat, refine the hide and use it to create a sweet cape or cloak.

They're traveling on the road a few days later when they spot something flying through the air towards them. It's tough to tell how big it is, but it's too big to be a man, and anything that can fly and is bigger than a man is a potential threat. They calm down the apprentices with them and prepare for the encounter. The creature approaches, and is an elephant-sized quadripedal demon with a huge set of leathery wings that end in clawed hands.

He lands in front of the party and accosts them, accusing them of murder. He introduces himself as Arrkupalak, King of Cats, and charges the party with the murder of Nyanor, his granddaughter. Over the course of the discussion, their defense, and the negotiation of what their penalty should be for killing Nyanor, the party learns more about Arrkupalak.

Arrkupalak is the offspring of a Great Cat and a Demon, born thousands of years ago during The Age of Legends when the barriers between planes were weak and Demons, Gods, and Dragons walked the material plane. Arrkupalak is not a particularly intelligent creature, but he's clever, careful, and has seen The Turning of the Ages, the rise and fall of countless kingdoms and many empires, and more besides. Most of what Arrkupalak does is hang out in the wilderness and mate with Great Cats. He can't die of old age and nothing can really threaten him, so his life is pretty good. He doesn't really venture out of the wilds, except when his children are attacked. All the Greater and Greatest cats in this area, unnaturally large creatures that they are, are his descendants, and he takes attacks on them seriously.

The party makes a decent case for it being self-defense, and he demands services from them (or their descendants; he's a long-lived cat, after all) to be cashed in at a later point as punishment for their catslaughter.

Later, the party does some digging and learns Arrkupalak is known to exist (at the very least as a legend) but the local PMC, Insha Corp, has never made an attempt to kill him. Insha Corp makes a good amount of its income from merchants and caravans hiring it on as guards to take them through Arrkupalak's territory. They carefully frighten away any Greater Cats or Greatest Cats so as not to anger the creature that provides them with so many easy, lucrative, low-risk contracts to fulfill.

I had fun with Arrkupalak's stat-block. I took a Dire Lion and applied the Half-Fiend template to it, and carefully optimized the resulting creature. With 6 Int, 14 Wis, 12 Cha, and millenia of experience (Arrkupalak gets a +15 "lived through it" bonus to knowledge checks related to the Age of Legends, which are normally quite difficult to make), Arrkupalak was difficult to RP. He's not smart, but he's bright, and he's seen it all. The actual statblock he got in the end was pretty solid, too. A Dire Lion that can reason, fly, think (6 int! He's sapient now!), use a couple SLAs etc is good. And he can't really get taken down by town guards, either. With his Damage Reduction, Spell Resistance, and various elemental resistances, there's not really much Arrkupalak fears.

The party could have taken him out, but probably would have lost several apprentices in the fight. Also... it's actually fairly hard to catch Arrkupalak. He can fly. He'll just turn and run if things look rough for whatever reason. This cat has seen the death of an Age, he'll not get crushed by a fight he can easily flee.

**** There's a Magus and a Wizard. The Wizard knows Summon Monster II, so if he prepared only that, he'd be able to summon a good number of creatures. A problem: the only flying things that Summon Monster II can summon are elementals, and at that size they're unlikely to able to overcome Arrkupalak's DR 5/magic, and nothing that can be summoned by summon monster can keep up with his speed (celestial template isn't that great). If he's flying away, it's probably already over.

Arrkupalak's Speed of 80 feet while flying is a huge problem. If the party really wanted to kill Arrkupalak, the main issue is holding him down. I'm guessing the best strategy would be to draw him into melee, feigning weakness, then cast Enlarge Person on the Paladin and have him wrestle the cat. Once they're grappling, try to take Arrkupalak out before he escapes or tries something too tricky (or kills the Paladin)

Summon Monster II does come up a little short. Going from the fact there's a Magus, I'm assuming you're playing Pathfinder? What sort of spells to the party casters know? If I'm guessing wrong and you're not playing Pathfinder, one thing the party could do is see if they can find a partner who's a craft-oriented Warlock, and see if they can kit them out in custom gear.

****** So the party (and yeah, it's Pathfinder) has:

*1x Wizard* who mostly knows transmutation. Her favorites include Pyrotechnics, Enlarge Person, Glitterdust, Summon Monster II, Haste, and so on. She doesn't have any entangling or web-like spells, and she has a couple evocations like Scorching Ray that she prepares sometimes. She has 7 wisdom, 14 charisma, a huge force of personality and an insane, paranoid irrational fear of birds and bird-based conspiracies. She is risk-averse, but her conception of what constitutes a "risk" is unusual. She is by far the most effective combatant in the right circumstances due to her ability to disable or blind groups of enemies.

*1x Paladin of Law* who in theory hits things with swords but spends 90% of his effort trying to talk his way out of situations. He thinks that violence is a last resort. That said, he is very good at hitting things, and very good at taking hits. He carries a light crossbow in addition to his greatsword. He is a monotheist. He's also the only worshipper of his god, who is named "God", and he's having trouble getting new converts. His goal is to create a continental government and bring order to the land. He is an amiable, ruthless fascist who asks questions first and shoots later.

/Note: Paladins in my campaign setting can be of any alignment as long as they believe in something. Their abilities are "Detect Sinner" and "Smite Sinner" and so on. A Paladin's power comes from faith, rather than the favor of a god. So, for example, a hypocritical LG Paladin that was sufficiently self-righteous would retain powers-- they would not be revoked by his god or pope or whatever. Paladins spend a lot of time praying, meditating, and having religious debates with other members of their orders in order to make sure their faith is correct./

*1x Monk* with a variety of combat abilities and good sneaking skills. He is modestly risk-averse, and usually supports the Paladin's attempts to talk instead of fight whenever possible. However, when there are fights, he leaves no survivors. Fame would be dangerous to him.

*1x Magus* who uses every spell slot for Shocking Grasp (including his level 2 spell slots) and fights with a sword. He is the most risk-averse, advocating running, hiding, and talking whenever possible. Although he's not a huge fan of it, he usually gets talked into executing prisoners and so on after fights because of his risk-averse nature. He's not a big fan of killing innocents.

*17 level 1 and 2 NPCs:* these guys come in various non-casting classes, but there are two sorcerers and a druid. These guys are armed with crossbows, but are fairly flighty. Most of them are in their teens and not used to battle. A PC often has to direct them in combat, yelling at them not to be heroes and to keep shooting. Out of combat, the PCs find themselves often advising and couseling these children, encouraging them to stay with the group and helping them through their problems. They handle the carts, horses, tents, fires, cooking, and so on, in addition to providing support in combat. They are paid little but learn on the job as apprentices.

*1 level 4 Rogue NPC* - This guy is Iraj the Sly (known to most as Iraj the Honest) and is no good in a fight, but has lots of useful plot hooks, er, knowledge, that makes him a useful resource when the party is in a bind. Give him a dagger and he might be able to take an unexpecting enemy down, but he's more of con man / sleight of hand / guy in the know sort of fellow than a fighter.

In general, the party makeup and lack of a Divine spellcaster doesn't reallly have any impact on the party's effectiveness. In a typical session, there will be 5 or 6 encounters, of which one at most is resolved with violence. The Paladin has the ability to do some small amount of healing, but in any sort of fight where the enemies are capable of dealing more than 15 damage quickly, things are gonna go really badly. Most of the PCs are quite devoted to keep their level 1 apprentices alive, so what kind of fights they can get involved in are pretty limited.

******* Violence avoiding parties, reasonable. Though, I would note that clerics are useful for considerably more than healing (which, assuming battles are running the ordinary 2-5 rounds, really shouldn't be an in-combat thing anyway).

Given how much the whole party seems to be against violence, a non-violent solution seems like it might be best. Violence or no, however, the party doesn't seem especially suited to it right now. The best bet will either be looking around for a diplomancer-for-hire, or getting one of the newbie sorcerers to start training up for it.

(If violence does turn out to be the solution, a Summoner might be a good thing to look for. A properly spec'd Eidolon should be able to really start helping by around level 3, and once they hit level 5, it should be able to fly up to the target (with greater than 80 ft/round speed, so that's not an issue) and successfully initiate a grapple pretty often, possibly plus some decent extra damage in addition to whatever it lets the rest of the party do by holding him down.)

******** Until the Paladin player joined us, it was pretty hilarious watching the group try to handle every encounter diplomatically and also manage the apprentices. The Wizard has some ranks in Bluff, and the Magus has ranks in Intimidate, but none of them had great charisma (besides the insane Wizard) or ranks in Diplomacy. The Paladin has several ranks in Diplomacy and a decent Charisma score which has helped a lot.

***** Okay, now I'm looking at the creature list, trying to find the "best" legal abilities. So far I've found some funny ones:

- When $THIS enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Swamps, you may return $THIS to its owner's hand.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, scry 4, then sacrifice $THIS. (pseudo-evoke?)
- At the beginning of your upkeep, tap $THIS and it gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a creature, that creature gains haste until end of turn.
- Whenever $THIS attacks, you may have it deal 1 damage to target attacking or blocking creature. (Blockers aren't declared yet, so you can only damage your own creatures)

Some incredibly broken and OP:

- When $THIS enters the battlefield, search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost 3 or less and put it onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library. (the card has CMC=3)
- At the beginning of your upkeep, you may pay {R}. If you do, take an extra turn after this one.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, target opponent gains control of all Mountains. (broken, but not really OP)
- Whenever a source an opponent controls deals damage, you gain that much life.
- {0}: $THIS gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
- {T}: Target player skips his or her next untap step. (on a 2 CMC creature)
- Defender, Whenever $THIS is dealt damage, put that many +1/+1 counters on it instead.
- Whenever a creature attacks, each other attacking creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn. (Note: applies to enemies as well)

and some unique and flavorful ones:

- If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard $THIS, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library.
- Whenever $THIS becomes blocked, regenerate it.
- {T}: Return $THIS and target creature you control to their owner's hand.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, look at that player's hand.
- Flying, $THIS can block any number of creatures. 1/2 (chump-block /all/ the things)
- Whenever a creature you control attacks, creatures you control get +0/+4 until end of turn. (with 5 creatures attacking, you get +0/+20)
- Whenever $THIS attacks, each creature you control becomes the color of your choice until end of turn.
- {1}{G}: Put a token that's a copy of $THIS onto the battlefield. (on a {1}{G} 2/1 elf)
- Sacrifice $THIS: Destroy target creature blocking $THIS. (on a 1/1 that costs {W})
- Defender, At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy target land. 0/0 (If you can find some way of keeping this alive, it is powerful. Otherwise, it dies as it enters the battlefield)
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, you may sacrifice it. If you do, return it to the battlefield under your control.

EDIT: more of them:

- Your maximum hand size is reduced by seven.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, you may return target land to its owner's hand.
- {T}: Target player draws X cards, where X is the number of cards in your hand.
- {T}: Gain control of target creature blocking or blocked by a creature this turn, $THIS deals 2 damage to that creature.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Plains, you may cast an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.
- Whenever a creature attacks you or a planeswalker you control, put a 1/1 green Saproling creature token onto the battlefield.
- All Sliver creatures have "Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices a creature.

I'm building a story involving Jupiter's moon, Io. There's a geological map of it on the bottom half of [[http://gallery.usgs.gov/images/03_15_2012/xcs1VIh77P_03_15_2012/large/Io_figure_press_2xglobal_300dpi.jpg][this image]]. What I'd like to figure out is which sites have the widest variety of terrain types within the shortest distances? Or, put another way, which sites would be most worth dropping an automated factory down on, as they'd require the minimal amount of road-building to get to a useful variety of resources? Or, put a third way, what's the fewest number of sites that would be required to have a complete set of the terrain-types within, say, a hundred kilometres of each site?

I can sort of see how a computer program might run some colour-detection on that image to figure out a map, and then run some algorithms about the value of each pixel - but that's a notch or two above my programming skill, and I don't think I have the time to both improve my programming skill and keep working on the story.

Any suggestions?

What you want to do is called "image classification", and it's pretty easy in a program called QGIS.

However getting the input data for Io is a lot harder than Earth. I'd suggest looking for existing geological maps, such as in that image, and picking sites by hand. Remember to account for the map projection!

** *Final update up!*

So does anyone remember when I made a hypothetical post about a poster posting hypothetical questions about powers that actually has those powers in real life?

Not a hypothetical. Or at least, not exactly.

The long and short of it is that I got in contact with someone who has what I'd hesitantly characterize as "magic." (At least until we study it some more.) I won't get into /why/ I believe them, but I do.

I'm keeping his name (and username) in trust, because, hey, while most if you guys seemed to be pretty benevolent in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3mw44m/mkmeta_we_as_a_community_discover_a_poster/][the thread I posted]], a fair few of you were basically treating empowered humans as x-risks. But I would like to get help from you guys on figuring out what exactly their powers are, since we're a little stumped, and because, hey, even if you don't believe me, you guys like puzzles. The general idea seems to be that, if he gets two different objects in his hands, dust gets attracted to those objects, and only if he's close to the ground. Underwhelming, I know.

But there are a /lot/ of bizarre caveats. First off, they can't manage to manifest anything if they're more than a few dozen miles from their home town. Second off, his powers only work a limited amount of times per day. Maybe. We used to think it was just once per day, and only in the afternoon, but then one day he woke up pretty early in the morning and it worked then too, and has every other time he gets up before dawn. Maybe it's something like half a day of chargeup? Third off, it doesn't work for every object, too. Organics never worked once, and neither did plastics. Fabrics alone don't work, but while most shirts are a bust, pants tend to work. He tried a few metal objects, but tinfoil and car keys don't work, while silverware and his macbook did (but only poorly, for the macbook.) He haven't tested any ceramics yet. And if he does the exact same thing at the exact same time twice in a row, it's absolutely guaranteed to not work. I used to be that he would wait a little bit and then it would start, but that stopped working after he left around christmas/new years to visit family.

For reference, this first started happening in august, and he's only ever done it at home with the blinds closed to make sure other people don't notice. When he's out of town travelling, it didn't work in or outside of a house.

Feel free to ask questions about the data we've gathered, there's more to it that this, but I don't know what could be important and it would be potentially dangerous to just post everything at once.

Edit: there are more caveats than these, these are just the ones we're more sure about.

New results are in as of this afternoon! This is pretty blatantly some sort of electromagnetic effect, because he just got a positive test result for extracting iron from crushed cornflakes.

*** What do you want exactly? We can't exactly suggest he test new items if the power stopped working. Or if we're trying to determine a natural cause there are a few possibilities.

It could be related to something in his behavior, It could be related to something in the air, Or there could be something in the dust.

A change in one of those might explain why the phenomena is location dependent and stopped working.

That said, My first guess would be something related to static. Since static would account for charge times and interaction with dust if nothing else. I haven't played with static all that much though so I'm not certain it fits all the described phenomena. In any case, you could make a static generator and cross reference the phenomena to see if they match.

Honestly as far as minor superpower gadgets go a personal static generator is one I'd recommend anyway. For the lulz. Speaking of which if it is some supernatural power he could probably disguise it as static anyway. Probably doesn't need to hide it...

Actually, I dimly remember sliding down these big, rubber slides as a kid, then levitating small woodchips with the static electricity off of my fingers.

A large part of the reason why I think this is so anomalous is that experimenting in the same conditions consistently fails to produce the same results. If nothing else, my curiosity has been piqued pretty badly, so I'd like to find out what exactly is producing the phenomena. If we can get it to be consistently replicated, it's probably at least worthy of minor internet fame, which can still be flipped into cash. I'm not making any expenditures in testing the phenomena, so it's not like it poses much of a risk to me.

And as for the guy himself, he's pretty average, honestly. Around 6 foot, scraggly goatee, no real medical issues besides some family history of type 2 diabetes and an allergy to peanuts. Caucasian, black hair, and that's about as much as I'm comfortable with describing his appearance. I have access to some lower-resolution (720p) videos I can look over, and I can ask him directly if you need anything specific, though.

#+begin_quote
  I have no clue what exactly you think you're describing when you say "dust gets attracted to those objects."
#+end_quote

To be a bit more specific, his house tends to be rather dusty, and when the action goes off, the dust in a radius of a (up to) few feet of the objects is visibly attracted towards them, although the exact radius depends on objects held.

#+begin_quote
  This isn't interesting unless you actually describe what is so anomalous about it.
#+end_quote

The anomalous part isn't that the dust is attracted, but that it only happens so rarely, and under diverse conditions. Under the obvious explanations (magnetism, static electricity, airflow) he should be able to replicate the process by doing much the same thing each time. As is, though, that doesn't quite work.

It doesn't seem like a very big deal, I admit. But at this point, we're still blindly groping in the dark. It might ultimately just be a scientific curiosity that doesn't really change anything, but at the same time, we just don't know enough about the phenomena to really risk publicizing it. If nothing else, this way, we don't look like crackpots in real life.

Not really. Atmospheric variables change from day to day; it's called weather. "Diverse conditions" doesn't mean you've controlled for everything, particularly when there is /clearly/ some variability of function like you're describing. That reveals dependence, and you don't know what to.

Did you take a measure of humidity, air pressure, particulate content from weather sites when you did these experiments? From any devices specifically in their house? Biometrics? Heart rate, blood pressure, eye dilation, sweat, skin galvanization?

On the crackpot side, emotional state, mood, hunger, thirst, tiredness, physiological arousal? Are any anomalous subjective experiences described, that would be called hallucinations or delusions? Other than the dust thing and the obvious paranoia, I mean.

This, however, would suggest something anomalous, assuming it's even true. Does it appear to act like a force/acceleration? Does it follow an inverse-square law? Is all the dust attracted, or is some left behind? What objects are held and how does radius vary with them?

Actually, yes (at least for most of these.) For everything related to the atmosphere, it's a fairly simple matter of just comparing the phenomena to the weather reports-- it's not exactly precise, but so far there's been no observed correlation between the phenomena occurring and differences in the weather. For biometrics, he typically wears a fitbit, and typically observes himself in a mirror to try to see the effect from the different angle (Which works, but hasn't given off much useful data.)

He's usually some combination of hungry and thirsty by the time the effect resolves. Interestingly enough, though, it's worked each time he's been eating, as long as he held silverware in each hand. Nothing anomalous psychologically, or at least nothing he's reported. I suppose it's possible, but from my personal judgement of him, it doesn't seem like he'd hold that back. Got nothing on arousal, though. I think he's held a copy of playboy once, but every piece of organic material we tested failed, so results would be inconclusive.

#+end_quote

It's a little hard to describe exactly, as I've only seen video recordings (where dust doesn't pick up well) but he describes it as the free-floating dust settling into floating bands around the two objects. He's been setting up paper nearby for about a month, and each time it works the dust that falls on the paper lies in fairly neat striations. Not sure on the inverse square law. It's pretty much just dust that was already in the air that's held, as he typically stands up to test. It also works when he sits down, of course, but the effect is more difficult to observe.

edit: yep, I found the playboy test. January 17th, from 4pm to 6pm. Nothing. Other object was a fork, which tends to work more often than not.

He did another test, and it turns out it's /exactly/ like that. He decided to look a little more closely into the "static electricity" route, and came up with the idea to grind up his fortified corn flakes, to see if the iron in them would be attracted, and that's basically what happened when he tried it. I've just gotten the results, and they match up pretty closely to those images.

That seems to demystify things quite a bit-- in fact, if it's almost definitely an electromagnetic phenomena of some sort, I should be able to check back over the list and make sure everything that worked is some sort of

Edit: yep, it seems to be holding. Kind of, at least. Nearly every piece of cutlery tested worked, the pants that worked had zippers, and the metals that didn't work were stuff like car keys or coins, which are made of stuff like zinc and magnesium. Though I will note that nothing made out of nickel (like a a few items of cutlery) without some steel or iron content seems to have worked, though, so it looks like it's just iron, and not just any ferromagnetic metal.

Now it's a matter of figuring out why this only works so sporadically.

********* So your friend's ability seems to be operating by taking a piece of iron or something with iron in it, and then the iron attracts dust to it?

There's a couple of complications to that though. What dust is being attracted? Because there's the dust which is formed from skin cells, dust made from dirt, and dust which might be tiny pieces of metal or semi-metallic material. Can you say anything about the type of dust in your friend's house?

When you are talking about "sporadically", what do you mean? Now that your friend knows he needs iron; is he still not having it work multiple times with the same piece of iron in his hands, not all pieces of iron work, or something else?

You said that your friend needs to hold two objects for it to work. Do they both have to be iron or just one of them?

EDIT: Joke idea - has your friend ever taken iron supplements?

EDIT 2: I just read your updates in other comments, and if the effect is only occurring when he has iron in both hands and some iron in the dust, then I suggest getting a strong magnet, a non-magnetic piece of iron, and some iron fillings. First test it yourself to see how the magnet and iron reacts in your hands to the iron fillings and compare how it acts to your friend holding them. In addition, the both of you should play around with the magnet. See if your friend's power is amplifying magnetism. It might be inconsistent due to him expending some sort of energy or charge.

He mentioned living near an open-pit mine, once, and he crafts stuff as a hobby (why his house is dusty in the first place) so while I can't give specifics on the dust content, I'd wager it would be relatively high in metal.

#+begin_quote
  When you are talking about "sporadically", what do you mean?
#+end_quote

Two things. The first is that it only works twice each day at most, and the second thing as that it never works at the same time. Today it worked at 12:43 UTC (in the morning) and 23:26 in the afternoon. Yesterday it worked at 12:45 UTC (in the morning) and 23:24 feb 22 in the afternoon. The day before then it worked at 12:47 UTC (in the morning) and 23:23 in the afternoon.

Here's a list, because this is getting a little tedious, actually. Morning times, starting Feb 19 and working backwards:

12:48\\
12:50\\
13:52\\
13:53\\
13:55\\
13:56\\
13:58

Evening times:

23:21\\
23:20\\
23:18\\
23:17\\
23:15\\
23:14\\
23:12

Times are in UTC because it's a pain accounting for timezone.

Hopefully that gets my point across. It's not much of a jump each day, and honestly the amount of sleep he gives up to figure it out is a little overmuch, but the trend reversed back in december and he lost a lot of days with failed tests so he's wary the timing could make a big change.

#+begin_quote

Nah, using the same items gets the same results, just not at the same times. Though to clarify, I don't think he's every just held a big chunk of iron, he's just held things that have iron in them.

Check to see if anyone else has ever had something similar happen to them. Is it a family trait, or can anyone else do it if they did it while in his hometown/house?

If you say yes there are others, then there's probably something going on in his town that involves heavy duty electricity or magnets. Either a business or some regular environmental phenomenon. I'd actually suspect his town to have a lot of lightening storms if it's a phenomenon in nature.

If it's specific to your friend only, then I want to know if the trend reverses based on the equinox. Because you said the trend reversed in December when the winter equinox is December 21st. See if the timing reverses around the spring equinox which is March 20th.

It's not necessarily specific to him, he just wants to keep it relatively quiet so his neighbors don't think he's a crackpot until he gets more information on it. And again, he does want to try and profit from this, at least by submitting it to some Randi Prize equivalent.

He was gone to visit family from December 18th to January 2nd, and reports that he found out that the trend in times getting later and later must have reversed either around then, or a little later, because when he started at the same time in the morning as the previous day, then waited a little, nothing happened until he moved his time back by thirty minutes a week after returning home. Oh, and the trend where evening times have been getting later and later might be a recent thing too-- he was a less likely to record evening times because it was happening so sporadically when he first started testing, and unfortunately this bad habit took a longer time to break. The data seems pretty strongly in support of the times getting earlier and earlier before he left on the trip (at least, there weren't any occasions where he recorded a later time, providing he used the same clock), but I didn't mention it in the initial paragraph because it was a little iffier.

tl;dr yeah, it seems at least somewhat likely that it did reverse around the winter equinox.

So test this by attaching a piece of iron to a string and to minimize human influence, poke it with a stick or some non-organic material when the expected time arrives. I suspect that there is a periodic phenomenon which briefly amplifies magnetic strength twice a day in his hometown. The previous times it occurred was probably due to your friend moving the iron around which made it more obvious when it picked up dust.

It lasts about 30 seconds. Not exactly (it's a little difficult to time) but within a few seconds of that. Honestly, It's probably something like 29.2 seconds, but the human propensity to like round numbers is screwing with us. If he picks something eligible up /during/ those 30 seconds (it's happened a few times) it works too.

#+begin_quote
  Okay since he lives in Eastern time, and the effect occurred at about 8:50 am and 5:40 pm on 2/19, then by 3/20 which is 30 days from now and the timing is moving over by a minute per day, then on 3/20 it should occur at about 8:20 am and 6:10 pm respectively with a range of 9 hrs and 50 minutes in between.....
#+end_quote

(Out of character, I actually made two pretty bad mistakes tabulating the times. The first one was that each time should have been an hour before (a mix up when converting time zones. I hate them for a reason :P) and the second one I actually don't understand. I've modified the original data set to the correct times, and as an apology, I'm going to give you a hint-- aside from the realization that the phenomena has something to do with magnetism, the single biggest clue I'm leaving as to the explanation are the times combined with the rough latitude. You'll have to look over some previous comments to understand why "he" hasn't realized this, though. I don't actually expect you to get an /exact/ explanation, but once someone gets close enough I'll "figure it out.")

#+begin_quote
  I have no clue if this is meaningful or what else we can try. Let me know how the string thing works.
#+end_quote

No problem. We're guessing that it'll happen around 23:27 UTC, and while he takes a little while to get back to me after tabulating data (And eating dinner), I'll be sure to inform you.

#+begin_quote
  EDIT: Are you guys sure that this happens only twice a day? Because if no one's ever tried staying up throughout the night, then maybe it happens once every eight hours without anyone realizing it.
#+end_quote

Not at all. He thought it was only once a day, but then we found out it happened in the mornings too (by accident, actually. He was eating breakfast.) Of course, the problem with testing whether that happens is that it's, quite frankly, incredibly tedious for him, and while he's /relatively/ sure it's something supernatural, there are still potentially interesting, but natural explanations (especially since we just confirmed it has something to do with either magnetism, electromagnetism, or static electricity.)

**************** Alright, he just tested your suggestion. Actually, he went even further, and instead of holding the metal, he just suspended it from the ceiling about the same distance as he usually holds the objects, and it /still/ worked. He's a little disappointed that he isn't a wizard, but a haunted house would still be pretty cool to show off. Maybe it's something with the wiring? Still doesn't explain the time shift, though.

At this point, he's more or less been convinced that it's not supernatural after all, merely "weird." It's a pretty massive shift from what he was thinking even two days ago, but I guess he's just quick to accept new evidence. So he said it was OK to tell you he lives in Negaunee, MI. He's not going to post his name, because that's a dumb thing to do on the internet, but it's a pretty small town so you could probably figure out who he is.

I feel a bit like an idiot for not asking this earlier, but is the sun rising and setting in that area whenever the effect occurs? I even had a hint to that idea when I realized the connection to the equinoxes. The times roughly match up. I just didn't notice it because I live so far down south.

In addition after wiking [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negaunee,_Michigan][Negaunee, MI]], it mentions the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Iron_Range][Marquette Iron Range]]. I don't know why it would be connected to the sunrise/sunset, but it seems to be a good hypothesis to why the effect occurs and makes sense with your information.

Also if this is true, is there a reason why your friend hasn't noticed that?

It seems like sort of an obvious thing to miss... Then again, he's told me he only ever tests at home with the blinds on... And I wouldn't put it past him to have some sort of aluminum foil shielding to prevent observation...

Wait a second, I just need to check back with him to ask him to google sunrise/sunset times.

Edit: turns out that it does. Huh. We're really hitting ourselves over not noticing this.

Edit 2: actually, looking back, our numbers pretty much exactly match with the NOAA website's, which is a little weird. But what causes an electrical phenomena, tied to the sunrise, that has a connection with computer data?

Edit 3: Don't laugh, but he evidently has some solar panels on swiveling mounts. Logically, they /would/ begin their tracking on sunrise, and shut it off on sunset. And they're visible from his window too. But he never saw them, because he was a little too enamored with the idea of discovering magic and paranoid because of it, and I never thought to ask him about whether he owned any nonstandard machinery, because I was having too much fun... Well, it should be fairly simple to test if the phenomena are connected. He just needs to open the blinds and remove anything he has blocking the windows, and we should have the data whenever NOAA predicts the sun will set.

Thinking inside the hypothetical, I'd say the best result is observing a side-effect of a previously unknown phenomenon \ law of nature. So the recommended order of actions would be something like this:

- 1) go ask in physics.stackexchange.com and some other physics-related forums what (un)known phenomenon could --- hypothetically (they like downvoting inane questions) --- cause such an effect.
- 1b \ c) go find some more physics kids (undergrads, professor relatives, whatever) and ask them the same.
- 1b \ c) go check the guy for yourself and see that he's not simply attention whoring;
- 2) if still nothing comes up purge your current internet persona, advice the x-guy to do the same and from here on work through i2p\tor
- 3) advise him to learn how to properly document scientific studies\experiments and to start doing just that with his daily tries.
- 4) record his attempts on a high quality camera in a setting that will reveal neither his identity nor his location, then remove all the meta-information from the recording files and put them on an i2p server.
- 5) ???
- 6) [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/locke_and_demosthenes.png][eventually the scientific community gets interested in this goofy project and learns something new about the universe.]]

I'll definitely keep that in mind as an option. For now I'm just sticking to [[/r/rational]], and maybe spacebattles, because you guys are fairly likely to humor hypotheticals (and have a lot of experience doing so.)

I believe that he's not intentionally misrepresenting anything, but there's still a pretty high chance that it's just a minor scientific curiosity. It currently doesn't cost me anything to believe him, but I'd rather not look like a crackpot IRL.

#+begin_quote

I'm reasonably certaint he's not, for reasons I won't go into here. He could be, but it's not like believing him is costing me anything, while not believing him would cost me a car trip to prove him wrong.

The benefit to my current internet persona is that I have a /lot/ of stuff posted, as well as several hypotheticals and misleading posts claiming that I wanted to do something like this as a writing experiment. I can easily pass this off as a meta-joke if I need to.

Unfortunately that's a little out of his price range. I mean, his phone camera is pretty good, but he has some unspecified fears about the NSA. That leaves an older camcorder, and we all know how easy it is to fake footage with lower resolution cameras. /I'm/ convinced for reasons I won't get into here (it has to do with how I initially made contact with him) but I'm not necessarily trying to convince you guys this is real anyways-- if you guys take it as a hypothetical, that's perfectly fine with me as long as you respond seriously.
