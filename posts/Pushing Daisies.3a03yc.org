In the 2007-2009 show Pushing Daisies, the protagonist has the power to raise the dead (of any species), with two catches:

- Touching someone (or something) twice undoes the effect, and the same person cannot be affected more than once.

- If you don't undo the effect within sixty seconds, something with "equivalent life value" dies somewhere else, generally nearby. This doesn't stay within species lines, but you also don't have any control over it, so whether the cost is paid by a human or something else seems to be random.

The protagonist of the show worked with a private investigator. What would you do?


** I become a vampire hunter. One touch turns the dead back into the living, which neutralizes all of a vampire's advantages. This only works until the point where vampires start using handguns. If they're already using handguns, then I probably die in the first encounter.

On a more serious note, the first thing I would do is gather some information. The 60-second limit is basically so crap that it's almost not worth bothering with. That means turning my attention to permanently bringing someone to life. This "equivalent life value" business is poorly defined in the show, but assuming that there are any rules at all, enough experimentation should be able to find the principles. It doesn't appear that there's a limit on how long resurrection lasts, nor does it appear that resurrected people age, so "equivalent life value" seems like it works out in my favor.

/If/ I can control who dies (probably by manipulating who is around; I would get a sectioned off site in the middle of a desert with plenty of warning signs up), then I can go into business resurrecting people. There are plenty of people who would be willing to die to have someone they love brought back to life, it would just be a matter of marketing. If I were especially unscrupulous, I would try to get some funding through insurance companies, but that would require secrecy, which goes contrary to marketing (and the fact that I'm bringing people back from the dead).

Edit: Possibly contentious, but if at all possible I think trading human immortality for the death of a lower animal is perfectly acceptable.

*** Never saw the show, but in the same vein, if the human sacrifice element is truly required, you could attempt to trade people who are terminally ill, people who are already sufficiently damaged that they will die immediately regardless, people who are sentenced to die anyways, etc, for more permanent lives. There are obvious moral and ethical issues that will arise from this, but still seems worth pursuing

**** I'd say it's more moral than current execution methods, as it's guaranteed to be painless and quick.

It does also make a superior euthanasia method, for the same reasons. Both of them do have moral issues, but if they're going to happen, this is a better way.

This is one of those things that needs experimentation to prove for sure; the basis of the equivalence isn't explored in the show, and so far as I recall, Ned never does any serious experimentation (for obvious ethical reasons, though there are certainly ways around that). The fact that you can trade a squirrel's life for a dog's life indicates to me that the possibility of trading something else for a human is a possibility worth pursuing.

** Sell "life insurance": Basically, I sell an extra 59 seconds of life, contingent on their body being intact enough to revive. During that time, they can say goodbye to loved ones, present evidence in a murder case, etc. For a substantial extra fee, they can name an activity within the bounds of legality and reason that they'd like to do before they die, and be revived in time to do that, so long as it's within 59 seconds. If there was someone really, really important that needed to be revived, I would probably try to find terminal patients, prisoners on death row, and other people with low expected life duration and quality, and pay them a very large amount of money to collectively gather around the one who needs to be revived.

Is it ever not payed by a human? I've only seen a few episodes, but it seemed to always be a human for a human and a non-human for a non-human.

We might have an interesting loophole in using people on death row to pay the price. Of course, we might then have incentivized the system to add more and more reasons to apply the death penalty, not unlike the world of Baby Blues.

******** Yeah, and you test the power's range and selective ability with rats or mice first. Go into the middle of as uninhabited of an area as you can find with a bunch of mouse corpses, and get an assistant with a walkie-talkie to bring live mice in and then clear the area. Doing it this way, you can probably test how much the power responds to different variables, most notably proximity.

  If you don't undo the effect within sixty seconds, something with "equivalent life value" dies somewhere else, generally nearby. This doesn't stay within species lines, but you also don't have any control over it, so whether the cost is paid by a human or something else seems to be random.

I think from what we see bringing a human back always costs a human life, presumably meaning that humans have a substantially higher (or at least different) life value from other animals.

***** There's a pair of ethical questions here.

1. Do you have an obligation to bring people back from the dead?
2. Is it murder if you undo your resurrection?

For point #1, assume that you need to sacrifice a human (as opposed to a cageful of rats) in order to resurrect someone. Don't you gain utilons by sacrificing a dead-row mass-murder for a Nobel-prize-winning life extension expert?

For point #2, you have a living sapient being and you are taking away their life. Furthermore, you sacrificed someone to bring them back in the first place, which means undoing your resurrection is actually killing two people.
