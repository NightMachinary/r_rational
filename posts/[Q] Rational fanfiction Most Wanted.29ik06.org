If you could see a treatment of a particular book/movie/franchise, what would it be?


** I'd really like to see Star Wars done properly, with an explanation of what the Force really is, and eventually its exploitation. I have no real interest in writing it myself, but the Thrawn trilogy opened up my eyes to what the setting could be like in the hands of someone who takes the time to think, and I'd like more of that.

*** A couple of thoughts on the Force in Star Wars:

1. Dark side users are almost always stronger than light side users.

2. If you do not constantly control yourself and your emotions you end up on the dark side.

3. All dark side users basically end up with the same goals (conquering the universe / becoming "evil"), no matter what personality they originally had.

4. Dark side users have no concept of self-preservation beyond furthering their new goals, they literally train the person meant to kill them (their apprentice).

My conclusion: The dark side is the only side of the Force. "Light side users" are just those people mentally strong enough to tap into this power source without succumbing to its corrupting effects.

*** It's rare for me to disagree with you, but...

I am familiar with very little of the EU material - mostly, I just saw the movies. From those, I wouldn't actually be super interested in the background of the Force. Pretty much everything about the films' depiction of the Force worked really well and was great when it was Yoda talking in pseudo-mystic gibberish in a swamp about it being some magical power in everything as some sort of pantheism, and the canonical explanation of midichlorians/microorganisms in Phantom Menace is completely missing the point of what made the original trilogy's depiction of the force cool. Making everything more rational and understandable (like in Phantom Menace) and less mystical gibberish (like in the films that weren't terrible) seems like a bad decision. Even if you don't go for midichlorians, I don't think anything good would be added by having the Jedi discussing what particles allow for the apparant action-at-a-distance of the Force and trying to work out if Telekinesis followed an inverse square law, or why they couldn't just use their TK to sever nerves in their opponent's spinal column and instantly incapacitate or kill them.

The setting conceits of Star wars are nonsense all the way down, and by the time you've ripped up or explained away enough of them to have something that 'made sense' you've bored the reader and discarded the vast majority of setting material. Fundamentally, Star Wars was amazing when it was essentially a fairy tale of wizard/monk/knights and princesses in space with a whole bunch of nonsensical conceits and people using laser swords because laser swords are cool, and became steadily worse when it was trying to draw the viewer to follow a complex (and nonsensical) plot about trade disputes and senatorial politics.

Midichlorians were a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/][fake explanation]], that's why they sucked. But I agree that it'd be really difficult to come up with a simple, coherent set of rules that predicted the way the force is depicted as working in Star Wars.

**** We definitely come at it from different angles, which I can understand. For me, it's a case of playing the Star Wars RPG and reading the EU novels. In the RPG especially there are strict definitions of what the mystical wizards can actually do (mostly for reasons of balance). They never really explain the how of it, but it's much better defined than in the movies, which makes it seem more "real" to me.

I think, if I were enough of a Star Wars nerd to do it, I would write a Star Wars fanfic that never gives a full and complete explanation of the Force, only defines some of its limits and offers reasonable exploitations of it based on what's shown in its various levels of canon. There are some wonderful conflicts within the Star Wars universe that I think I would like touching - the conflict between Sith and Jedi as an actual difference in values rather than just "right" and "wrong", the routine memory wipes of the pretty-much-sentient droids, the fact that the Emperor had a pretty legit reason to try to unify the galaxy (the imminent invasion by an immensely powerful alien race).

But I totally get where you're coming from, and largely agree with what makes Star Wars compelling to so many people, and why the prequels sucked.

***** Hmm... that actually sounds like a really interesting rabbit hole to go down. How /does/ a post-scarcity communistic society /actually work/? And I mean /actually work/, optimizing for making it work as shown in the show rather than waving your hands and saying, "Well it actually doesn't work so they have a very capitalist/proprietarian system and futarchy instead like Good Rationalists Who Read Robin Hanson!"

On slightly further thought, I support this project very wholeheartedly, on grounds that making people believe in futuristic communist utopias is much easier when you can point to a fleshed-out thought-experiment and intuition pump in how one /really, actually works/.

Here's a start to get people thinking: after a severely damaging war caused by biologically-focused initial forays into transhumanism, first contact with the Vulcans was made. They showed humanity how to build FAI. FAI thus worked, and the associated kinds of "godvomit"-level technology thus worked, but [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xb/free_to_optimize/][the AI decided to take a hands-off approach]]. Keeping society running thus remains a /human/ problem, and the story explores the human solution space for that problem.

After focusing on Jon for a while, switch over to Dany's story, which has proceeded in the background as per canon right up until the flames, and then is derailed heavily once the dragons start whispering in her ear.

Have dragons be dangerous not because they're big and breathe fire but because they're /smart/ and naturally evil - they were the true power behind the Valyrian Freehold (and later the Targaryen throne) and the "Doom of Valyria" was actually a deliberate last-ditch attempt to wipe them out. Make the Maester's Conspiracy a more explicit plot point (you've already got Jon in place to hear about it). You'd probably have to have some handwaved reason why dragons that are just hatched are /already/ dangerous - maybe there's some sort of Qwisatz Haderach-style Lamarckian inheritance of gained knowledge, so they start out knowing everything that their parents did at the point of conception, as well as everything /their/ parents did up to /their/ conception, etc.

I'm not quite sure where you are getting that. It is shown that brain damage has an effect on the behavior of the afflicted. Furthermore vampires retain their pre-conversion memories and the greatest part of their personality. The only difference is that their 'soul' is replaced by a 'demon'. But what does that mean? The effects of having a soul as shown in the series seem to be restricted to maintaining inhibitions and enabling moral reasoning, without forcing the host into any particular morality or behavior. That seems to me more like a symbiotic relationship with some sort of spirit, like we have with the bacteria in our gut, than anything resembling the common understanding of the soul as the core of our being, whatever the hell that might mean. So yes, spirits and gods and so on exist in the Buffyverse, but that doesn't make it all that different from, say, the world of Harry Potter. And to me the characters in the former are just as moronic as those in the latter. For example: There are almost immortal demons whose blood has incredible healing powers as well as being the only known cure for vampirism AND NO ONE CARES. Call me evil, but I would summon or lure in as many of those things as possible, string them up and harvest their ever-replenishing blood. For starters. Damn, that world is just begging to be broken by a munchkin...

The world of Harry Potter is even /more obviously/ fictional than the Buffyverse.

Yeah I can but not right now because I'm in a hurry. However, there are more-or-less decent explanations of that on Yudkowsky's fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]] and in one other fic that has the reasoning more explicitly laid out except it'd be /very spoilerish/ for me to say which fic it is so that leaves me in a bit of a pickle. I'm going to say which one it is under a spoiler tag below, if you're too curious to care about the spoilers of an unknown fic.

And as for the fiction thing, the basic idea is that Occam's Razor would lead one to expect that there's a threshold in rule complexity after which, if you find yourself living in an universe where rules are more complex than it, probably most of your measure comes from a simulation in another, simpler universe.

** I am a bit curious to see a rational supernatural or another rational "monster hunting in modern times" style fanfic. I would want to know how they survive in modern times undetected. My answer would be that anything that survived that long was either ridiculously clever, literally no one lived to tell the tale, or a reality warper. The only response is truly brilliant monster hunting where each fight is against something that has been dealing with monster hunters for centuries and yet is still here, or its ancestors have, or it is so stealthy that finding it is an epic effort in itself. I might be writing this. No promises as my time constraints are high and it isn't the most helpful use of my time.

To me, any individual monster battle should be an incredibly grueling thing, especially if the monster is 500 years old. Anyone who can take out double digits worth of monsters would have to be practically inhumanly clever about it.

  Rational Supernatural Fic anon sends the following message:

  (Sorry if you get this twice; connection is being glitchy.)

  Rational!SPN thus far consists of the following plot shreds:

  1) Mary does some properly clever thing (IDEAS NEEDED) and survives instead of John. If Sam ever winds up at Stanford, Jess also survives and turns hunter. (I have an image of Sam descending into Hell to rescue Dean, as per the original s3 plan, with Jess by his side.)

  2) Uriel lets Lilith out and then teams up with her, forming a plan with all sorts of genuinely-threatening-villain cleverness. (MORE IDEAS NEEDED) There might be time-travel angelzapping so one of them, or Ruby or possibly Meg, can keep an eye on the Winchesters. (I also have an image of bb!Sam with a pet hellhound.)

  3) Sam trains in his powers, possibly going a little demonic in the process. (Fantasy transhumanism, fuck yeah!) There's also Man of Letters training in the SPNverse magical arts (YET MORE IDEAS NEEDED), because in hindsight there's no way a bunch of clever/rational hunters wouldn't investigate Henry.

  4) Dean is also awesome, though I've somehow not mentioned him. He's probably better at the lateral-thinking rational-exploitation-of-magic stuff than Sam is. (STILL OTHER IDEAS NEEDED)

****** Thank you for following up. I actually was planning the holy water in the water supply and portable salt lines too, which is funny. On the other hand, my focus wasn't as much on the combat and was more on the aspect of large organized groups of malevolent beings existing and preying on humans, yet we don't know about it. I have a pretty good system for why this would be completely under the radar, and yet the hunters can still track down monsters that I really want to use.

The problem is that I am much better with plots, intrigue, and gimmicks than I am with dialogue and humor. I know adding that would take me ages so what I really need is someone capable of actually writing human beings and being reliable with a schedule. If I had that I would write this, and it would be epic.

The thing I liked from this post- Mary survives instead of John. Oooooh I want to steal this so badly! I have been stuck on what would cause the divergence but I don't want to be an idea thief. Oh well.

Can you imagine how incredibly dangerous a mechanical drill-arm is in such a universe? Applied consistently though, stars could never exist in such a universe. But with just a minor correction, like saying that only one element or one specific material (artificial or natural) has this property, you can make it work.

Antispirals would be placed in the role of Mass Effect Reapers as they were intended in ME1 and ME2: not dumb life-haters like you would think at first, but custodians of the galaxy/universe which (pretty immorally) try to preserve the universe for future life. A race which has given up hope in the possibility that the crisis can be worked around, and instead prevents anyone from getting near the point of triggering it.

However, that entire universe makes so little sense in terms of tech capabilities possessed vs tech capabilities actually used properly, how all the tech would change society, what the hell the Force is and so on, that you really would need to do some extensive work before you could make a truly sensible world and story out of it (edit: and retain the original feel and flavor).

Incidentally, I've been procrastinating horribly about writing reviews for Metropolitan Man. I'll get around to fixing that - promise.

The big problem with Superman in general is that he's ridiculously powerful, and if you have him as a protagonist it's hard to give him some credible threat.

Alternatively, you're right, it would have to be the story of how he gets started. I can see a few ways you might go about that, but generally the conflict has to be moral in nature - as you say it's hard to establish any credible physical threats to him.

The big problem with Geass is that any rationalist with that power wouldn't take anywhere near as long as Lelouch to actually effect a revolution, particularly with the canon revelation at the end of R2 that [[#s][CG Spoilers]] You'd need to do some de-powering or just outright have Lelouch do his thing /without/ Geass powers.

** I really want to see a rational fanfiction of Bleach.

It's an ideal setting for such a thing. There's magic to work with that is interesting but not so easy to abuse. The characters and plot in general are so nonsensical that I'd love to see them become more intelligently reorganized.

Most importantly, the world of Bleach is seriously messed up. It is so ridiculously and needlessly cruel...and the canon characters seem to be blind to this fact or just not care. It's a world that I'd want to see a character go about trying to fix with their intelligence.

Well it's less cruel than /ours/. At least the dead there go to an aferlife. And then if they die in the afterlife they come back.

Though of course that's just "souls" nonsense, since the identity/memories/personality /isn't/ preserved.

(That's a huge peeve of mine with reincarnation-based religions: if a person "comes back" but has no memories, nothing of that identity, then it's /not the same person!!!/)

No no, if you die in the afterlife you come back to the real world. That's what the shinigami are all about, "balance of souls" and stuff. There's a cycle of souls, they go from real world to soul society to real world to soul society... And it's why Quincy are /bad/ because /they/ destroy souls forever and break the balance.

I mean, other than the occasional ghost in real world, everyone we're shown in the Soul Society seems to be a "native" so I kinda expected that Soul Society babies are born when reality's people die and vice-versa.

If people in the afterlife live indefinitely until they're killed, and people on earth keep being born and dying, there's no reason why the afterlife portion hasn't totally outbalanced the living portion by now.

And that's putting aside the number of hollows, which, can actually be estimated into the billions if we go by Adjuchas being made up hundreds of Gillians with hundreds of regular hollows making up each Gillian.

In any case, that boy who was sealed into the Parakeet apparently came into Soul Society with the same physical age as when he died, and was able to recognize Ichigo and Co. So yes, it's only when dying in the afterlife that people lose their memories.

How do you think people get smart in the first place? Randomly assigning intelligence points to people without prior cause is just author inserting plot. If you have a character that makes good decisions based on forewarning or plot then all you learn is situation based knowledge, like a trivia quiz. But if you add rationality lessons and principles then you can learn methods that are applicable in more situations and are consistent with a predetermined cause.

Main characters already includes ones doing science to magic, and one slightly superhumanly intelligent one that's surprisingly well depicted given there are no other hints of the author knowing about LW or the like.

** I'd like to see a rational take on the Inheritance Cycle. Basically, dragons are thought to have been all but exterminated, until the boy Eragon finds a dragon egg. When it hatches, Eragon unlocks latent magical abilities and gains a psychic link to the dragon, which has human level intelligence and memories passed down from ancestors.

The real exploitable part though is the magic system. Basically, as long as you know the ancient language of magic, you pretty much just describe what you'd like to happen and it happens. Magic works as intended by the caster, so for example a skilled magician saying the word "water" can mean anything from "move this water" to "freeze this water" or even "create a hovering ball of water over my hand by collecting the moisture from the atmosphere". I'd like to see a rational take on that, especially exploring what would happen if both the protagonists and antagonist were straight up /smarter/ about it.
