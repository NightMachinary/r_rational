The Machine Intelligence Research Institute is [[https://intelligence.org/intelligence-in-fiction/][putting out a call]] for intelligent stories illustrating concepts related to (artificial or natural) intelligence. Guidelines are quite specific; read below.

- -Pay Rate: 8c/word, up to 5000 words.
- -Multiple Submissions ok
- -Simultaneous Submissions ok
- -Submissions window: Until July 15

 

This call is intended to reward people who write thoughtful and compelling stories about [[http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell/temp/q-and-a.html][artificial general intelligence]], [[https://vimeo.com/165348147#t=22m10s][intelligence amplification]], or the [[https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/][AI alignment problem]]. We're looking to appreciate and publicize authors who help readers understand intelligence in the sense of [[https://intelligence.org/2013/06/19/what-is-intelligence-2/][general problem-solving ability]], as opposed to thinking of intelligence as a parlor trick for memorizing digits of pi, and who help readers intuit that non-human minds can have all sorts of different [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf][non-human preferences]] while still possessing instrumental intelligence.

The winning stories are intended to show (rather than tell) these ideas to an intellectually curious audience. Conscious attempts to signal that the ideas are weird, wonky, exotic, or of merely academic interest are minuses. We're looking for stories that just take these ideas as reality in the setting of the story and run with them. In all cases, the most important evaluation criterion will just be submissions' quality as works of fiction; accurately conveying important ideas is no excuse for bad art!

To get a good sense of what we're looking for---and how not to waste your time!---we strongly recommend you read some or all of the following.

- [[https://intelligence.org/smarter-than-us/][Smarter Than Us]]

*Withdrawal policy:*

After you submit a story, we prefer you don't withdraw it. If you withdraw a story, we won't consider any version of that story in the future. However, if you do need to withdraw a story (because, for example, you have sold exclusive rights elsewhere), please send an e-mail telling us that you need to withdraw ASAP.

 

*Important Notes:*

MIRI is neither a publishing house nor a science fiction magazine and cannot directly publish you. However, MIRI will help link a large number of readers to your story.

We frankly do not know whether being selected by MIRI will qualify as a Professional Sale for purposes of membership in the SFWA. We suspect, through readership numbers and payscale, that it will, but we have not spoken to the SFWA to clarify this.

If you have a work of hypertext fiction you think might be a good fit for this call, please query us to discuss how to submit it.

 

*How to Contact Us:*

To contact us for any reason, write to [[mailto:intelligenceprize@gmail.com][intelligenceprize@gmail.com]] with the word QUERY: at the beginning of your subject line. Add a few words to the subject line to indicate what you're querying about.

 

/(We've discontinued the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5lnj5r/announcement_intelligence_in_literature_monthly/][previous, smaller monthly prize]] in favor of this more standard 'Publishing House Call' model.)/

*** It didn't fail, exactly, but it didn't (as far as I know) generate any /new/ stories, so we're trying a second, higher-visibility push with a larger prize.
