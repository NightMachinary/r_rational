I recently read this, and it's /amazing/. I see it's been [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rziob/rt_hsf_the_martian_by_andy_weir/][mentioned here before]], but it definitely merits the repost.

As you may have gleaned from the post title, it's about a man on the third manned mission to Mars who ends up stranded on the Red Planet, and MacGyvers everything he needs to survive. Expect everyone to be rational like only NASA can be.

Why I'm recommending it here: most of us love puzzle-solving and magic/superpowers/etc leveraged extremely creatively and intelligently. That is not only the entire plot of this book, it's the first story that's pushed those buttons for me while being entirely within the laws of our reality. I'm thinking along with the hero how to solve the problems, and instead of the laws of magic it's just mechanics, chemistry, and physics.

Heads up: you can expect a lot of Very Dramatic Math with the hero's life in the balance. Incidentally, if you like Kvothe's penny-pinching or the chakra counting in "The Waves Arisen", you'll be right at home too.

For what it's worth, the Audible narration is also great.

** Read it. Loved it. Most likely going to re-read it again in the next few months. It does a good job of making you feel like you're there with Andy, while still managing to not be too dark or depressing. Andy's actually a fun guy to follow, as he does what's usually super boring stuff, and deals with disaster after disaster. His mental fortitude is insanely high though, to be able to go through such an experience.

** I listened to the audiobook and I loved it! (Although the narrator pronounced ASCII as A.S.C. 2, which I found amusing.)

*** You listened to the older version. The original version has that mispronunciation, but it was fixed when they made edited it to match the hardcover version of the novel.

*** Really? I somehow missed that, or maybe it was edited in my version. That's really funny, though.

** Absolutely! A great book.

I didn't care for the third-person sections (you know what I'm talking about) but they're brief, and the rest of the book is great.

*** I do know what you're talking about. I think having it on audiobook made it much better - I tend to not like such parts normally, but the author did a good job with everyone's accents, which helped mitigate the "ugh it's a new character that I don't care about" problem. Later on in the story, I admit I got somewhat tired of Mark's pattern of "something went wrong, I calculated that I had [x number] of [y resource], so I did [z clever hack]." the third-person sections did a good job of breaking that up, and helped the story feel less episodic. I would have probably felt the same if I was reading it, though.
