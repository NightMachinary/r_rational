You are Wile E. Coyote. How can you exploit the knowledge a higher power will cause your actions to comedically backfire when you attempt to catch the Road Runner? Also, can you catch the Road Runner?


** /Why/ are you trying to catch the Road Runner? Can you go to the supermarket and buy a roast chicken instead?

If you tell me that my utility function is just to catch the Road Runner, I think I'll start by taking some of my amazing inventions and selling them to Acme, then hiring mercenaries. I will also try to place the Road Runner in morally compromising situations - maybe trolley problems - so as to try to strip It of Its plot immunity. And I shall employ all my wits and perhaps professional comedy writers to set up a situation in which the Road Runner escaping simply cannot be as funny as the Road Runner being caught.

Make a trap ringed with elaborate failsafe mechanisms that, when it inevitably fails, leads directly into a trap with bigger and more elaborate failsafe mechanisms, with another even more complicated trap with bigger failsafes after that, which leads into yet another trap - a stick propping up a cardboard box that's clearly labeled "roadrunner trap" with no failsafe mechanisms at all. Commit to looking dejected when THAT's the one that works.

Unfortunately, Acme is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Roadrunner Corporation, so this seems unlikely to work. (I would also be afraid of all of the mercenaries ripping off their masks and revealing themselves to be roadrunners right when it looks like I have the roadrunner caught.)

*** Depends how smart the God is. Jehovah is telepathic and dislikes any hint of defiance, but It has a very limited focus of attention and probably isn't bothering to read your mind at any given time, and Its architecture is clearly humanlike in other ways. It might be possible to subtly set up a clicker-training-like scenario in which Jehovah was reinforced into behaving in useful ways, pending its outright takeover by a constructed superintelligence.

*** I liked it apart from one line: "I have been sent to a world which obeys no scientific laws." While this may just be coyote speaking and not qntm, it does reinforce the idea that scientific laws are mathematical laws.

I strongly disagree. Scientists try to discover how the world works, our world seems to be very very well described by maths. Loony Toons could much more simply be described by humour. The rest of the piece seems to describe this very well (the whole, am a scientist not was, and the very last paragraph) so that one line made me strangely angry.

Again the rest was quite good, I enjoyed it.

** There's a fanfiction crossover story which is about the idea of a person being transported into a cartoon or anime universe where the protagonist even uses his meta-knowledge about the laws of comedy to anticipate certain events and set certain situations up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping_with_the_Girls_Vol_I_Fictional_Reality][Sleeping with the Girls]] isn't rationalist, but the protagonist does make multiple rational decisions and he does have very good excuses for most irrational behavior.

** Under ordinary circumstances Roadrunner WILL win because loony tunes appeals to an audience that wants to see you fail. The best idea I have is to get rid of the audience, draw vulgarities on EVERYTHING, make it so that no one could ever watch this episode, then go with a very simple plan with one point of failure and take out the the road runner.

** I would fund my roadrunner catching escapades by getting a film crew to document my endless comedic failures. Eventually the show would become so successful, I might even stop really trying to catch the roadrunner, just going through the motions for the audience. After all, if I caught it the show would be over.

** catching or actually eating the road runner, and by eating the question is it ok for the roadrunner to respawn in the end after i "win" or not. if the requirement is for an absolute zero-sum win then i would have to say it is impossible as its essentially a physics rule of that universe.

if the requirement is merely for me to catch it then all i would need to do is look sorry\sad etc and then "catch" the roadrunner in a friendly manner. that kind of thing is plausible.

if i need to specifically eat him but it doesn't "really" need to be him i would engineer some kind of situation where multiple roadrunners will exist(hire a few from a company, where i am expected to return them or other wise suffer a fine\pain), where most are not the real road runner and make some kind of an elaborate plan which is supposed to get me to eat him. which will backfire and cause me to eat one of my own roadrunners , thus for example needing to pay lots of money to the organization i rented it from. which would be funny. and would for a split second allow me to eat the roadrunner, before reality changed to me actually eating something else and the roadrunner being intact.

*** thinking about this a bit more it might be possible to eat the "actual" road runner and let a fake\different one live.

there are 2 ways that i can see that hapenning depending on a condition. am i on camera all of the time?

if yes then all i need to do is get someone else to get another roadrunner for after i "lose" so the "other" roadrunner will live while the real one will be eaten by me(using something similar to what is described in the previous post)

if no then i need to get into an alternate universe, thus i will lose the camera forever(it will follow the clone i switched with in that alternate universe during the mayhem) and i will get to eat the roadrunner. it will just never be shown on screen.

which is what is the actual law of that world, not that the roadrunner cannot be killed, but that on camera it must always appear as though the roadrunner won in a funny way

** Humor is about subverting expectations. Therefore, it will be difficult to control the situation unless I'm also able to control my thoughts and beliefs well enough to make myself expect something other than what will actually happen. I have to catch the roadrunner on accident, perhaps without ever knowing I've caught him.
