*** I think the main part missing here is where they pay him an obscene amount of cash (even a tiny fraction of what he's producing would go a long way) so when he gets replaced he can retire in luxury and doesn't need a new job.

**** Maybe they did and he still felt lost without a purpose to his life? I mean, canonically, he went so far as to get a day job with a newspaper rather than lounge about.

***** Why would he even need to lounge about? He could just do even more superheroing instead.

******* Wait, are we talking about the SMBC strip or the Superman canon? Since you said canonically, I thought you were talking about the Superman canon, where he has a day job at a newspaper when he could be spending that time helping people.

********* Its definitely a case where it depends on the writer, but the standard explanation is that Superman is still very human-like in how his brain operates. In some cases he can perform feats of mental fortitude that surpass humans, but he still has limits. Essentially, he doesn't just, "Do more superheroing instead," for the same reason most of us can't sit down and do our jobs for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. It has bad side effects for your mental health. This fact that he can't just be everywhere at once and do everything he wishes he could even though he is capable of doing much more than a normal person tends to be at the core of most well written Superman stories (although the example of why he spends time at the Daily Planet is rarely addressed directly).

** there is a story somewhere that had a word with a periodic problem with an adapting evil force and resorted to summon a hero every time.

turns out that world was the result of anthropic bias and 9 out of 10 heroes actually failed and that world ended.
