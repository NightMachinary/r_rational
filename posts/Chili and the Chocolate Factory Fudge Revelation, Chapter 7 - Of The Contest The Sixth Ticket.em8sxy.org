There are a lot of references in this story to Dahl's works. I'm either too unfamiliar with them to get the level of humor involved, or these are just homages thrown in for the sake of it.

I'm not trying to rain on parades. I would love for someone cleverer to tell me what I missed on my read-through that made this an amazing and wonderful tale. I'm 100% certain that I missed a huge number of references or in-jokes, but I would have expected the story to stand up without those pillars.

That's set dressing; the author does a very good job of invoking Roald Dahl's goofy style, and all those unexpected elements are just in service of imitating that (it wouldn't be Dahl-ian if it didn't surprise you!).

The glossed over bits that it examines include how, for instance, all the winners of the original contest were white caricatures of Kids These Days, as opposed to a more normal distribution that one might expect. This new contest points this out by having a contest that /enforces/ a result similar to the original, and shows how much extra work would be required to have that outcome.

This is what I meant by meta-rational; the world itself might be insane, but the things it has to say about the work it's responding to are coherent.

This is where the suboptimal naming of the genre rears its head again. Is it rational to play a trick? An action can only be analyzed in context of its goals. Is it consistent with rational fiction to play a trick? I don't think the tenets of the genre say one way or the other.

******* My thinking while setting this chapter and the last one up was that the fun readers would get from seeing something come back from the dead would outweigh the sadness of seeing something die, since it's much more rare for that to happen. I wasn't trying to leave you or anyone else feel sour in the long run and I'm honestly sorry if I did. Many of my favorite authors like/liked to horribly abuse their audience and I must have absorbed that.

This story is not rationalist but I thought it had enough rational themes (by say, the standard of UNSONG) to be posted here in spite of the surrealism. I've written works before that I haven't posted here because I didn't think they had enough to justify being here so I hope that shows that I'm not viewing it as an opportunity grab.

This story may or may not also be approaching a point where it (I think) it justifies itself further, but that's subjective and it still might not hit the mark for you. I'm not trying to cause ill will or trouble and if more people told me that they didn't think it belonged here I would stop posting it and tell other people to do the same.

******* I greatly enjoyed the whole thing. The story didn't die a random meaningless death, it did dramatically, with meaning and purpose, to make a point!

Now, initially when reading the title about the end, I had my suspicions. This is gaizemaize after all. But by the time I had read the chapter and the discussion around it, I totally forgot my suspicions; just like a good movie you have seen before makes you forget what happens next. I had suspension of disbelief, not for the story itself, but the process of it being shared in the internet.

I'd say this story "explores goals and motivations", and "intelligent people solving problems" not of the characters (so far), but of the author and the audience.

Of course, being part of a story is at times a very unpleasant experience, so being made a part of one when you didn't sign up for it can be hurtful. But as far as I am concerned, my joy is worth your annoyance. (Not sure if selfishness or a profound philosophical stance.)

The hating astronomy thing is quite supported by Roald Dahl's canon - see the events of the Great Glass Elevator. Even a wiki summary will do.

In canon, they've already caused several extinction-level events on the other planets - there /was/ life on Venus and Mars, but the Knids got in and ate everything.

They're intelligent enough to form letters in order to communicate with humans, which means that given enough time (and telescopes), they could potentially convince people to send up space trash that they could ride back down to the surface of the planet.

***** All fiction makes things up: you can still have a rational (but not strictly) story in a surreal ("irrational") world.

If you go down the checklist, the story toes the line for nearly everything. The only things that are off are:

1. the Dahliesque cast - pretty much everyone besides the chat (usually). There's agency, but most of them aren't very intelligent about it.

2. We don't know the world's rules so it's hard to tell if they're being consistent (or predictably inconsistent).

P.S. not sure what rationality has to do with playing a trick, but cruel is subjective!

P.P.S. You know what's really cruel? Playing a trick on smart people who thought they understood the riddle and making them face all kinds of uncomfortable truths only for the contest to turn out to be a lottery after all (just not in the way people thought).

**** A one note joke side character does not any sort of theme make.

Combine it with all the other stuff going on and you get a very surrealist theme, not rational or rationalist.

***** On a meta level, this story (and others by this author) directly address this particular community, subtly and not-so-subtly (I'm pretty sure the character "Blakin" is an homage to Makin-, and the moderator character GW is loosely based on our dear moderator and author Alexander Wales ("AW".))

From my perspective, addressing the rational fiction community directly is sufficient for a story to fit in here.
