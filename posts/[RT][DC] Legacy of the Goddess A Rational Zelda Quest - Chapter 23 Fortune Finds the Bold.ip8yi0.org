** Pre-read thoughts: (spoilers up to last chapter)

I'm terrified of reading this. Is link still alive? Do I want him to be? OMG I'm freaking out. Will link "respawn" like he did with the Talus?

Post-reading thoughts: A deus ex machina was just about the last thing I expected, and I'm impressed with how it's expanded the mystery and given us some clues about previous events. Like, is the Goddess really dead, or did she just go through the same thing that she did before? If she's really dead, how is Seff doing Seff-like things? Is this a result of Ibosso not being "idealistic" as link, and the shard of courage re-attuning to him?

While I'm relieved that our hero is still alive, I'm concerned about his plot armor being to thick.

Truly, he is far too kind.

  [X] Are Ibboso and his tribe at peace now?

  [x] You were friends with my uncle, weren't you? How much did he know about all this?

  [X] Can you tell me Ibboso's story? He was a hero once, wasn't he?*
