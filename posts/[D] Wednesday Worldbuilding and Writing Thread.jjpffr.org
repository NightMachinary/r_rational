Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I'm not sure if this belongs here, or in the Saturday munchkinry thread, so apologies if I'm in the wrong spot.

I've been working on a Harry Potter/Kingdom Hearts crossover for a while now, and I'm trying to think through interesting ways for two different soft-magic systems to interact. I'll assume most people are familiar with HP magic, but to give a little context for Kingdom Hearts:

Kingdom hearts has weapons called 'keyblades' which can be summoned at any time and lock/unlock any lock. Keyblade wielders can usually do elemental magics, throw fireballs, call lightning, etc. They also have a generic 'magic shield' ability. The setting also has generic light and dark magic with what one might expect in terms of associations with creation/healing and death/decay respectively. Pretty much all magic in this setting is combat based.

There are only two hard rules I have entirely made up so far.

1. Defensive magic trumps offensive magic. E.g. A /protego/ spell protects against most keyblade attacks, and a keyblade guard protects against most spells. (this is balanced by both sides having access to both types of magic)
2. Dedicated functions trump general functions. e.g. /Avada Kedavra/ still goes through keyblade guards, and keyblades can unlock magically locked doors.

So far in fights, keyblade wielders try and get close and keep the wizard from casting, but if they're pushed back they have trouble blocking/undoing the more esoteric wizarding attacks. However, a few people have both types of magic [Harry has a keyblade, Voldemort has The Power of Darkness^{tm} ] and I'm still trying to figure out how those fights might go.

Any thoughts on the magic systems, or how you think the settings might go together would be greatly appreciated!

*** Just to be clear I am not that familiar with Kingdom of Hearts.

But as I see it, it would be very hard for a normal Keyblade wielder to actually threaten a wizard, since the vast majority of wizard can just apparate out of range. Though this isn't a perfect defense, since Keyblade wielders can teleport too.

And as I understand it the magic in Kingdom of Hearts actually relies on magical energy, unlike Harry Potter magic which isn't more tiring than just saying words.

So just by fighting defensively for a while, the Wizard should be able to easily outlast the Keystone wielder before finishing them.

I think it would be best to just fully remove mp from Keyblade wielders, to balance things out and make their magic more like Harry Potter in regard that the hard part is actually learning it, while using it barely takes any effort.

**** I agree. Right now, keyblade users are at a pretty heavy disadvantage, especially because HP wizards have a lot of crowd control abilities that keyblade users don't have access to. Expelliarmus, in particular, would be devastating, but even Wingardium Leviosa could hamper a keyblade user.

Because of the gating costs of MP for keyblade users, I'd probably pick one or two changes from a few options:

- An equivalent gating mechanic for HP wizards.
- Heavily amped spells for keyblade users (because the standard spells are weaker than HP spells in general).
- Allow keyblade users to generally deflect /any/ spell, with a possible exception for "beam" spells.
- Fleshed out keyblade spells. We've got the three tier basic spells (fire, fira, firaga), but we should also add either new spells or different modifications to spells. For example, a typical fire cast might be a typical firebolt, but perhaps spinning your keyblade while casting fire does one thing while slamming the keyblade into the ground while casting does another, etc.
