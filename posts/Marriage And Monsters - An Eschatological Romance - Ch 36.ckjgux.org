** Reading this I realized throughout the work there's a lot of hyphens (-) where I'd have used double hyphens (--) -- as when breaking up a sentence containing separate but related thoughts. Not a typo really, just a stylistic observation.

#+begin_quote
  Eulogy's gonna have all our asses”
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  /Yeah definitely video game slavers./
#+end_quote

Maybe a stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'Yeah.'

#+begin_quote
  not killing any of them on principal.
#+end_quote

Principle*

#+begin_quote
  anyway. ”
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  this world operates on but you
#+end_quote

Another possible stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'on.'

#+begin_quote
  “Ah, welcome back”
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  /Whatever that was I don't/
#+end_quote

Possibly-stylistic missing comma after 'was.'

#+begin_quote
  small arms
#+end_quote

I'm not that familiar with the IP, but I think it's Small Guns (with that capitalization.)

#+begin_quote
  place 3 shots
#+end_quote

This is nitpicky, but I think the style guides would call for 'three' rather than the numeral.

#+begin_quote
  the rest of the mad max gunmen
#+end_quote

/Mad Max/ unless intentional style choice.

#+begin_quote
  Roy wasn't in immediate danger.
#+end_quote

Oh, the irony.

#+begin_quote
  “ Damn you, Emrys,
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  function of our utility . ”
#+end_quote

Extra spaces around the period.

#+begin_quote
  knowing what you know.” he said
#+end_quote

Period instead of comma.

#+begin_quote
  perhaps I can just show you” he said
#+end_quote

Missing comma.

#+begin_quote
  impact me long-term, but short- term
#+end_quote

Space between short- and term.

#+begin_quote
  we were just outside of town.
#+end_quote

Could be stylistic, but 'outside town' is correct.

#+begin_quote
  “ God DAMN it,”
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  “ OW. I don't know.
#+end_quote

Extra space.

#+begin_quote
  he killed... god,
#+end_quote

Usually capitalized, but that's between you and the big guy of your choice.

#+begin_quote
  “Did you say Merlin ?”
#+end_quote

Extra space before question mark.

#+begin_quote
  who else does the Concept have.”
#+end_quote

Period instead of question mark.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't know,” I told the little creature honestly. “I really don't know.”
#+end_quote

Yes, Haley, Sauron /does/ have the Death Star. At least you seem to have found some minty, party drug proton torpedoes! Now it's just a matter of finding the right thermal exhaust port to stick them in.

Great chapter! A few more typos than usual, but I enjoyed it a lot.

I wasn't expecting Haley to run into the Concept in the wasteland, but in retrospect it's a good thing; if she had no forewarning she'd have gotten stomped upon her return. I enjoyed Haley's reactions to Fallout physics.

**** Always happy to help (especially since you're so responsive about fixing typos!)

I know you have some backlog/cushion to keep up the impressive post schedule, so if you ever wanted an extra proofreader, I know somebody who would be supes excited for the opportunity to get a few chapters ahead ;) (it's me.)

***** I appreciate the offer- I've been searching for a way to share chapters early but I haven't found one that satisfies me yet.

There's an awful lot of plot-relevant stuff that stays fluid right up until the day of release and I feel like letting anyone read those chapters early would set the worse versions in stone mentally, so to speak.

I might start pre-publishing the next week's chapters as some kind of super-cheap patreon reward, like a dollar a month or whatever their lowest tier is. But that's going to depend on me getting far enough ahead to be comfortable with the quality of the work. Right now I'm juggling a new job and a house sale, so writing and polishing time has suffered considerably.

****** I'd definitely be in for a $5 Patreon tier, but I absolutely know what you mean about the early chapter mechanism issue and the problems that arise showing things off before they feel "done."

I had to take the shot. I'm loving this story!

** Oh.

Oh right. They have a lot of celebral characters and a race of genies. Shit.

Well... it isn't so bad though. It's less "All your minds belong to the Concept" more of a crazy free-for-all, with pretty much every Concept-controlled character secretly working against it. Does help that they are geniuses.

I wonder if that witch girl is [[https://umineko.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Ushiromiya][Maria Ushiromiya]] from Umineko no Naku Koro ni. They'll have a theme going, then.

*** Witch girl is +Hermione+ Gretchen, who has meta knowledge of HP. And I don't think the Concept has gobbled up the efreets yet, has it? Pretty sure they just decided to make their play while Haley was out.

**** I don't think that was Hermione (that "Griffindor through and through" said more about Merlin than her). She's from real world, and a narrator to boot. She /could/ be Sean's fanfic author (he did mention her being /no more than/ 16 years old).

Yes, Efreets are for sure their own faction here. However, I don't remember who was their narrator. Didn't it come from Haley's Pathfinder, so essentially our dragon lady?

Also, that was my gut reaction to a known genius having possibility of an access to genies. Forgot to mention they would /at worst/ have this odd, adversalial relationship, where Concept!Characters try to monkey paw on purpose.

***** Oh right, my mistake. I don't think she's Sean's fanfiction author--her name is Gretchen, and Sean's current narrator is Harriet. Regardless, she's explicitly using Harry Potter magic, not the system from the visual novel you linked.

Pathfinder seems to be the odd man out as far as the stories go--it's a ruleset, not a narrative. Even if Haley is the one bringing it into being, the efreets will still act according to their Lawful Evil nature. Haley made them a promise (the details of which I'm forgetting), and now they're taking their due.

** And the sasapariller delivers! I complained last time that dragon lady seemed less interesting than protagonist dude, and you've certainly addressed that ☺

I'm forced to ask however, how different this chapter would be if the dragon lady was a dude. If the answer is "texts no be pink", then something is amiss...

Also, killed on principal, dayum.
