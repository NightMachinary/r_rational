** Okay so I'm on chapter 35 and, uh.

Does it ever get less edgy?

**** It's not that I don't like dark moments, it's that this is pretty much as vanilla as twists go. Given how you established the character, I half expected the mice to completely innocent and that he'd just invented that overheard conversation in order to get the others to attack. (It wouldn't even be out of character!) That's what I mean by /edgy/ - it's very "hard men making hard decisions". But if it's supposed to be a deconstruction, it's like ... these are tropes that were deconstructed twenty years ago.

Please tell me they at least start a beastfolk rebellion? (Or join the one that's already clearly ongoing somewhere)

[edit] Okay I read to chapter 37 and no. No. I'm out.

I would have been a lot happier with this story if the mice had been innocent.

***** You have every right to bail whenever you feel like it, but you are jumping to conclusions. Things are not as they appear. But it takes time for them to become clear.

btw you asked if it gets less edgy and then seem to complain it isn't edgy enough. I'm still not sure what your idea of edgy is.

Part of the trope of "hard men making hard decisions" is that the universe conspires to make their decisions the right ones. In real life, this doesn't look like kicking people out of the lifeboat so you don't all drown, it looks like impaling people on stakes to teach the survivors to fear you, or cutting off thieves' hands, or taking slaves because the savages need the guiding hand of western civilization. We're still dealing with the fallout from some of those "hard decisions for their own good".

******* I still don't understand what you're saying. How is kicking people out of a lifeboat so you don't drown different to killing people to make the rest fear you? I mean in the context of the hard decision thing.

I'm not being a dick, btw (not intentionally anyway) I'm genuinely asking.

I also still don't see why you asked if it got less edgy, as though you felt it was too edgy so far.

Yes. I do? I think it would be /less/ "edgy" if the mice were innocent, because that'd mean the main character had made a questionable or outright wrong call. It would reassure me as to the integrity of the setting, if that makes sense.

Well, the lifeboat example is pretty much settled physics. But there's lots of things we did, like beating our kids or debtor's prison, that we thought were obviously a settled matter at the time and who in retrospect turned out to be highly problematic. That's the point - hard decisions aren't a /virtue/, they're a gamble. You're basically hoping that you understand the situation well enough to take complete responsibility for the consequences. But that's meaningless if the universe conspires to make the consequences turn out well, because if it /didn't/, you wouldn't have trust and charity to fall back upon. The cost is effectively omitted.

********* It's very hard to follow your thinking because you have a very specific definition in mind (in this case of the word edgy) which you assume is obvious. Simply asking "does it get less edgy?" does not convey your specific meaning of the word. I'm not saying your use of the word is wrong, just that without context there's no way someone would know that's what you meant.

To the actual point you're raising, as I said you're jumping to conclusions. It's written in first person POV so you only find out stuff as he does. But if you aren't enjoying the story there's obviously no point trudging painfully on to get to the "good stuff".

*********** Then I'd say read to the end of ch43-"When You Got To Go" and that should give you a better idea of what's going on. And that still isn't the whole story.

Mind you, you are right not to trust me. I'm bound to let you down eventually.

** Read the whole thing over the past day. Very, very interesting story. I will keep following along with it, undoubtedly. Colin manages to be a supremely selfish, rude, short tempered ass hat while still being likable to read. That's pretty damn impressive.
