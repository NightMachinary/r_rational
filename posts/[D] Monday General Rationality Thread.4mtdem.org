Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I find I do enjoyable things beyond the point where I enjoy them, in both entertainment and food. It's hard to notice the transition between doing it because I want to and doing it until it's done.

The other problem I've been having is that I tend to overestimate the unpleasantness of doing something other than what I'm doing in the moment. It leads to nonurgent tasks not getting done for a very long time. I know my intuition is wrong but it's still a very strong influence on my decisions.

Has anyone had any luck with stuff like this? What would you recommend?

*** That used to happen to me with entertainment, but eventually I just developed a hair trigger reflex towards dropping things I wasn't finding fun anymore. I think it happened when I went through a period of reading a lot of fanfic; so many of them fall apart or stop updating that it never seems like that much of a loss, and some of them are so long that if you're going to sink time into finishing them, you're going to sink a /lot/ of time.

**** I'm trying to do this, but atm it conflicts with my fear of being somebody who never finishes things, so sometimes I go the extra mile with something that I don't enjoy anymore just to prove to myself that I can still finish things and I can tolerate boredom. Oh well.

***** I have a big problem with not finishing things, but I think giving up on having to finish out a television or book series has helped me with that. I imagine it like there's a limited pool of gumption available to me, and I can either spend it on finishing actually productive things (like writing stories I've lost my enthusiasm for) or I can spend it on things that gain me nothing (like reading fiction I don't like).

Of course, my unfinished works to finished works ratio is still something like 4:1, so I can't really say it helps /that/ much.

*** As for food, use smaller plates/bowls.

It's much easier to think "Am I full?" every time you empty your plate and have to get up to get a new one, compared to every time you take a bite.

I don't have an answer for entertainment. I have the same problem. It's just too easy to binge watch/read/play something. There's rarely a good point to stop and re-evaluate if you're enjoying yourself.

*** Wow. I thought that this was a mixture of bad compulsiveness, depression (leeching the joy out of things that I'd otherwise enjoy), and procrastination.

Do you find that this lack of further enjoyment of food or entertainment connects consistently to procrastination or depression?

**** A fter the initial enjoyment fades it's more like the task is engaging but at most mildly enjoyable than completely empty of value. It's usually only after that I noticed I wasn't hungry / entertained after some point. The second problem definitely contributes to procrastination. I'm not sure about depression.

I think there could be causation the other way for entertainment as an escape from unpleasant thoughts rather than for its own sake.

** I'm looking for a productivity tool (ideally as an extension to Chrome). Here's what I would like it to do: When I navigate to a website in a list I specify (say, facebook), I'm presented with a challenge page that asks if I want to continue or not. This trivial inconvenience will help to remind me that I need to stay on target without expending significant willpower, in the same way that putting snacks far away from your workplace reduces the amount of snacking you do.

My attempts to search for an extension like this have mostly turned up productivity apps that completely block sites, or limit time on them. Does anyone know of an extension that does what i'm describing?

** I have previously been under the impression that I was a fairly rational person. The past two days have shown that I am under the influence of my emotions as much as, if not more than my intelligence and reasoning.

An individual near me has slighted me in what others may consider a small way, but it completely infringed on my territory. Today while pondering on my irrationality, I understood the rational reasons why I was upset with the individual, and was (today) able to explain like a rational adult why I was so pissed at them for it, and garnered an apology from them.

I also apologized for being upset in an irrational manner...

I'm striving to be a rational person, but some times I have an emotional pull into so many things.

*** Sounds like a good victory for self-control and getting what you truly want. Learning to control your temper is an important skill for anyone, and you should be pleased with your accomplishment. I'd be hesitant to shy away from emotion in general, though.

I've always thought of rationality as steering and emotions and choosing the destination port, so to speak. In this sense, I always am under the influence of my emotions in the most profound, deep ways that influence my goals. I love my girlfriend, I gain great joy from my job, I feel exhilaration and excitement from playing video games and watching sports, and I get a feeling of accomplishment from doing a good job at work so on. These are all emotional responses, and I am quite pleased that I am under their influence.

*** The key thing there is to stop and pat yourself on the back for /noticing/. You can't possibly preemptively negate every irrational emotional bias you have. The best you can do is to notice them when they come up, then take steps to negate, work around or ameliorate them in the future.

** I was checking the book *Brain Rules* trying to find some method to improve my performance and discipline. Overall can't recommend it, the rules so far have been:

- Exercise daily.
- Eat your vegetables!
- Don't multitask.

I don't think there's much of value to get so far and I'm past half the book. I've realized I read a lot on Reddit and at school but only a small percentage stays on my long term memory so I'm trying to come up with techniques to improve it.

Currently also checking mnemonics and *Anki* which is a flashcard software for accelerated learning of concepts. The software is much more entertaining than the mnemonics as those take time to build and it seems to really work. I'm using it to learn Japanese and it along with repetition exercises has been giving pretty good results.

Also still struggling with the discipline problem. I wish I was even as half driven as the rational protagonists of our stories. I still haven't found a reliable way to build up willpower/motivation/discipline. And it seems they are different things to booth.

Oh what I'd give for some of those aranean spells for memory retention and focus.

I've, um, considered calculating how many lives I could by working in a given hour (or, really, what fraction of a life, given that there's nothing that I could do that would make $3,000/hour) and then framing things in terms of "You're going to kill X people if you lose an average of one hour of productivity a day."

I feel like this might work for me, but I'm also kind of afraid to go too far into trying it because I have bipolar and it's kind of possible that I might decide that I'm wasting so much time that I might as well stop consuming resources and, um, quickly die in some manner that would at least let me save some people by donating my organs.

(It's ridiculous to think that I've legitimately considered whether I'm morally obligated to kill myself, but that's bipolar/depression for you.)

If someone else with greater mental health is interested in this, though, then let me know. I'd love to see if it works or just makes you feel horrible.
