Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** Not quite what you're looking for, but it's so good I'm gonna recommend it anyway: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26974/apocalypse-born][Apocalypse Born]] explores an IMO really interesting aspect of the apocalypse (a System apocalypse in this case): what happens after the initial wave of suck? What happens when everyone starts building towns and having kids?

The main character is one of the first children born after the apocalypse, and it follows him as he figures out what to do in this still dangerous but kinda explored world.

More in line with your request, there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23018/life-of-numbers][Life of Numbers]] which also has an interesting twist - it's not quite a system apocalypse, it's more of a system reset apocalypse. There was a very lightweight system before the story begins, but then all of a sudden everyone's stats reset and everything goes nuts.

** I'm looking for written fiction featuring protagonists that have unusual or *alien value systems*.

*** Well-written dungeon core stories might scratch your itch? [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27261/thieves-dungeon][Thieves' Dungeon]] for instance, is based around a core who might have been neurotypically human at some point but is definitely a psychopath now, and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20846/the-concubines-tomb-a-dungeon-core-novel][The Concubine's Tomb]] has a definitely human-based dungeon core who doesn't really want to fight the insatiable bloodlust inherent in his new state.

Also, there's a bunch of stories with theoretically human people but who have particularly alien value systems. For instance, the main character of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10703/the-godkings-legacy][The Godking's Legacy]] is theoretically human-ish (she's a squirrelkin) but has a decidedly atypical view of reality; it's mostly a joke story, though.

There's also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality][The Perks of Immortality]], where the main character is kind of in a time loop (it's complicated) but he has all sorts of perks that greatly distort his values compared to normal humans.

Edit: Oh also I totally forgot about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]], which hits all of your points; one of the main characters is a dragon, who obviously has an entirely different value system than everyone else.

Edit edit: Also I didn't forget this one, but I thought it'd been abandoned until it was updated today: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26127/a-beginners-guide-to-napping-sunbathing-and-slaughtering][A Beginner's Guide to Napping... &c]] features a house cat protagonist who gets his fuzzy little ass isekai'd, and proceeds to terrorize the local wildlife. It's mostly told from his point of view. He's very similar to Vainqueur, now that I think about it.

** [[http://golem-studios.com/prae.php][Prae]]. A work in progress table top gaming system. The designer is focusing on less 'rule of cool' story telling and more on gameplay. The setting integrates magic into the worlds economy and reduces its scope compared to games like D&D.

Mana is a resource that people receive each day while sleeping. Spending mana creates a localized magical debt in the area. Debt can be paid down by offering prayers of mana to one of three presences. No one is sure what they are and different cultures have different ideas about what they represent and which ones they should be offering prayers to.

If debt is not paid down over time monsters are created. The cultures in the world developed different ways of deciding structure societal mana use. One is nomadic as mana debt is localized to a geographical location. Another has high percentage of warriors to fight off the monsters. Another creates laws around who can use their mana and developed a temples to create social pressure for the average person to offer their mana as prayers.

The system is structured without dependency on the setting, so if you wanted to make your own you could create a cost for mana use other than monsters.

That's a really neat idea. It would make war even more devastating too, which could make for some interesting campaigns. I've always liked the idea of setting trying to work monsters into the World Economy. The nominally naughty game the Last Sovereign talks about this.

**** The adventure I was apart of an adventure centered around taking back an old keep from some monsters. Previously one of the nomadic tribes was at war with a medieval Europe analogue. The nomadic tribe just dumped a lot of debt near the keep then backed out and waited for the monsters to soften up the target. That the debt primarily cares about a region certainly makes war with a stationary culture interesting.

Mana is also transferable between creatures and objects that can contain it. So it can essentially be money. However the human capacity is 3, which is how much they regain each night. Finding gemstones, called Tears in their world, that can contain a lot of mana is important to storing mana over time or from a group to cast large scale rituals. Thus villages are limited in by both having access to Tears (mana batteries) and by how the they control spending it as not to attract to much monster attention.

Of course you could weaponize mana debt for fun and profit. Mine a bunch of gems. Charge them up a ton each day, and choose not to care about debt. Kinda like how in the WtC guide it talks about weaponizing the exclusion principle.

  To get rid of potato blight, you need to completely clear out any infected plants. Any potato plants at all, really. Then leave the field fallow for a year, or plant a crop that isn't susceptible---no potatoes, no tomatoes

*** Yes, you don't know which plants have the blight on them, some won't be visible yet, so they all have to go. The rot especially shows during storage: the mold loves cool, humid environments and is able to move and spread on it's own. You then have to wait for the spores in the soil to die off or they will just infect the next crop and keep reproducing. The mold isn't very good at surviving outside of host plants so a year without hosts(of any kind) will clear the area. Fallowing it might be dangerous though, any potato plants left behind will keep the disease alive on them.

Your second question is too vague. Potatoes and tomatoes are from the new world, in the real world.

**** I know what you mean, so it isn't a perfect example. There actually is a Warcraft fanfic that fits better, but I can't find it.

That said, his knowledge initially even confuses him and also later on he seems to only remember stuff that the author himself remembers before looking it up, though his OP ring powers give him perfect recall of previous knowledge or something like that, which paves over the fact that the author will of course not be able to simulate what he'd actually remember if he hadn't also been researching DC lore for years to write this story with a daily schedule.

*** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/teenagers-suck-worm-cyoa.343807/][Teenagers suck]]? Worm fanfic, guy gets the memories of the author minus all Worm parts. Power is a DnD derived magic set. I don't think it's actually /good/, but it's the only example I can think of that's not actively /bad/.

*** 30% of the worm fanfics I read are isekai though I can't think of any that I would recommend. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/any-means-necessary-selfish-manipulative-si-worm-fate-eventual-multiverse.49938/][Any Means Necessary]] is one I am reading right now though it feels like the MC is doing the 'accumulate power for the sake of accumulating power' thing which I am finding bland.

**** But aren't most of those isekai Worm fanfics written in a way where the MC knows they are in the Worm universe and start trying to fix Taylor's life and/or avert/mitigate the apocalypse?

*** Have you seen Good Omens the miniseries? It doesn't take itself very seriously, but IMO it has one of the more rational approaches to "everything in the Bible is literally true, including the parts that are nonsense".
