Enjoyed it though

** So, something a little bit different this time around: A romance scene! I know romance is usually not as popular in rational fiction, but I never really understood why. After all, Less Wrong is pretty explicit on rejecting the idea that emotions are irrational.

I do see that this chapter has a higher percentage downvotes than usual - I wonder if that's the reason why? Ahh, trying to interpret reddit votes is maddening. I imagine this is what ancient augurs felt like, trying to divulge the future by looking at a chicken's intestines. :v
