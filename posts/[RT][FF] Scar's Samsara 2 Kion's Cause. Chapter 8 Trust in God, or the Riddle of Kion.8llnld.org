*** Mufasa may have intended the vision for Simba, but Simba is too spiritually disconnected to receive it, having "forgotten" his father. Only because Kion could eavesdrop on the conversation was Mufasa able to get through at all.

Or it might be a trick aimed at driving an edge between Kion and his father.
