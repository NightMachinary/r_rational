It's not /exactly/ rationalist, but it's about as close as you can come with a musical comedy. It's by the same people who made "A Very Potter Musical" and is a parody/retelling of Disney's "Aladdin", in the style of "Wicked".

It's an inversion in which Jafar is the only reasonable, rational person in the kingdom and is forced to deal with living in a civilization where everyone else operates on the Disney logic that if you want something badly enough, your dreams will all come true, whether you work for them or not.

It's also really funny and has lots of dirty jokes and (good) referential humor.

** Thank you. I was intending, in a vague sense, to watch this, but this post actually gave me the kick in the pants to go ahead and actually do it. I'm glad it did. If it hadn't, I'd probably have gotten around to it sooner or later, but thanks to this, I can say I actually watched it, not that I plan to watch it. It definitely was good enough to watch. I'm glad I did.

Edit: Also um, if the Prince is from a vassal state then why does Jafar say leige/lord? Wouldn't that make Jafar the vassal?

**** Yeah I figured that it was just they said he was a delegate of a vassal earlier. Maybe I misheard

Also I can't help during the villain song think of the "The path to hell is paved with good intentions" but I suppose that's the point
