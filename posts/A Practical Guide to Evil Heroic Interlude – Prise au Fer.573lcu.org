  “It's possible to bind or usurp a Name, with the right tools,” he agreed. “But a proper ritual site is needed to manage it. The only usable one in Callow is in Liesse, which would make the matter rather tricky.”

And she's got that Goblin in tow and a nice ritual spot.

** They will make fight the Angel with the Demon.

If everyone is turned near the Angel they can fight it with undeads. Time to see the dragon in action.

Probably this is the closest Black can come to say Fuck you in the face of Gods Above. He has to have some plan for an Angel.

** I'm going to take this opportunity to shit all over this story. I quite like it in a lot of ways, but after reading almost the whole first book there are just too many problems for me to be able to recommend it to anyone. I dislike the way world-building is done, I feel it paces itself far too fast, especially at the start, and I have HAD ENOUGH OF FAKE BATTLE ARCS AAAAAAAAA

- The world building is terrible. Being a DnD-rip is not a good thing, even if you're aiming for the 'rational' genre of 'genre-savvy hero in recognisable world'. Why do you need a /mechanised/ set of deities: why do priests need magic? Why do /wizards/ need magic? Why do you need Devils (who are devils from dnd, and are lawful evil, because of course), /and/ Demons (chaotic evil) /and/ mysterious eldritch beings sealed in stones?

None of these were remotely story important except for 'building out the setting' at the time. There's a place for this, and I appreciated it the first couple of times, but then the author did it about 4 times more. I have no expectation that any of these details will be plot/thematically relevant, or handled in a particularly interesting way. You don't have to copy every aspect of a setting, if you arent going to use those aspects appropriately.

The reason I'm so annoyed about this is probably because of the mysterious high-tech gnomes, who ordinarily would be the biggest culprit of eye-roll, especially since we already have isolationist elves and a massive underground dwarf empire. However, the author actually stated some sort of storytelling intent- we're given an actually interesting detail about how gnomes are actually interesting, and potentially plot relevant. The fact that it occurred /after/ all of the 'standard irrelevant genre-required random shit' was extra irritating, since it shows that the author is actually capable of having good ideas.

Another related point is the chapter-starting pithy quotes. These I initially enjoyed a lot. However, it's clear that the author wasn't defining a list of characters to quote, giving say past emperor 'Horribilis II, the cowardly' a personality or relevance, by quoting him multiple times, but was instead just picking random names to go with the quotes he'd thought up. I'd compare this to Terry Pratchett's use of General Tacticus in quotes- one oft-quoted source of pithiness gains a personality. A long list helps imply the immense age and stagnation of Praes, but feels lifeless, in an already too-broad setting.

- The pacing improved, but definitely still deserves to be slammed. Admittedly you want to get to 'main character has Name, moves on with life' relatively quickly, but there was a real chance to make Catherine seem clever and badass, by making the other contenders from Squire deeper/tougher/giving them more than 2 chapters to be introduced and killed off.

- AAAAAAA WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO FAKE BATTLE ARCS THERE'S LITERALLY NO TENSION, EVERYONE ELSE HAS ALREADY DONE IT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WE'RE LIVING IN A POST-HUNGER GAMES WORLD. YES I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TRAIN YOUR OFFICERS IN A LOW-STAKES COMBAT SETTING. YES I KNOW ITS A LOT OF FUN. YES I KNOW IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF INTRODUCING US TO A LOT OF MINOR CHARACTERS. IT JUST FEELS UNORIGINAL AND HAVING THE HEIRESS BET ON IT TO TRY TO GIVE IT AN ARTIFICIAL LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE OVERARCHING PLOT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THAT

*** Literally the entire point of the story is that it's what the world would look like if all the tropes were actually accurate. The story wouldn't make any god damn sense if the author was like, "Yeah, so I'm playing with genre tropes in an interesting way but I'm going to ignore the tropes I'm playing with. Because that makes sense and would be logical with the rest of my story."

Like jesus, dude, you're completely missing the point. It's not a 'rational' story, it's a deconstruction. I don't even know why it gets posted on this sub.

**** Well as well as being a deconstruction, I'd classify it as tending to be rational...

Factions are defined by their beliefs and values (while one faction is called "Evil" and another faction "Good", the stories and motivations are more nuanced than this), characters solve problem through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources and the rules of the world are consistent (not sure I'd call them sane though :)).

One thing though, some things happen because the plot requires it since the plot and name is a powerful force in that universe.

****** This is flatly untrue. In fact, I'm pretty sure this has been discussed and refuted multiple times on this subreddit, but I don't know of a good way to find the threads in question, so I'm going to quickly go over why this is untrue. To that end, I'm going to use LotR as an example of your standard "good fiction". From the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Nope.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Sorta, but not really.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Ahaha... no.

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Not particularly, no.

So there you have it: LotR--which, I should note, I actually really like--fails to satisfy all four characteristics of "rational fiction" as described on the sidebar. More to the point, /you can write a good story that isn't rational/. You could /maybe/ argue that the first two rules ("nothing happens because the plot requires it" and "factions are driven by motivations other than good and evil") are present in most good fiction (although there are obvious exceptions to that--LotR is but one example), but there is /nothing/ requiring "good fiction" to obey the last two rules ("characters solve problems through intelligent use of resources" and "the rules of the world are sane and consistent")--in fact, I would argue that most stories actively violate these two rules, and are none the worse for it. They just don't qualify as rational.

TL;DR: No, "rational fiction" is not a synonym for "good fiction", and I wish people would stop conflating the two.

****** The thing is there's just so much of bad fiction that do not respect those things. There's just so much work where I think that the characters are just being dumb or where things just happen because the plot requires it.

So, yes 'rational' is just a way to define good fiction but since there's so much bad fiction out there, it's good to have clear rules about what we value in fiction imho.

******* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/573lcu/a_practical_guide_to_evil_heroic_interlude_prise/d8pv06q][No, goddammit.]]

Is UNSONG rational? No. Is UNSONG good? Yes. Is Discworld rational? Fuck no. Is Discworld good? Hell yes. Is Harry Potter rational? Not even close. Is Harry Potter good? Arguably, yes.

I want to make this clear: /the term "rational fiction" is not just another generic synonym for "good fiction"./ It's possible that some people use it that way. Those people are /wrong/. Rational fiction is not just generic well-written fiction. Rational fiction generally contains world-building designed to hold up under close scrutiny. Characters in rational fiction tend to make reasoned, logical decisions based on what they know, rather than acting on impulse. In rational fiction, logical implications /actually hold/--there's little to no glossing over the consequences of some minute detail. Above all, rational stories /stimulate the readers' minds/--they /make readers think/. There's a strong argument to be made that most fiction--yes, even most good fiction--does the /opposite/ of that. Thinking is hard. Most stories optimize for entertainment value, which means avoiding stuff that requires undue cognitive effort from the part of the reader.

I... look. This subreddit exists because certain people find certain qualities in certain stories appealing, and those qualities are not present in the vast majority of fiction, including published works of fiction. To that end, a new term--"rational fiction"--was coined to describe works that /do/ possess said qualities. Redefining that term to refer to generic "good fiction" (whatever that actually means) dilutes its meaning, and weakens its ability to specify targets in solution space. If that happens, people might start posting things here that are unappealing to the majority of this subreddit's users, which I don't want to see happen--but even more importantly than that, /it's an abuse of the term "rational"/, which I wouldn't want to see /even if there were no consequences/. Words have meanings. Please use them properly.

Rational fiction tend to be good fiction because by following those rules they are less frustrating than most fiction but there's good fiction that is not rational.

**** Tropes are not just whatever is identical to DnD, though. "There are Lawful Evil devils and Chaotic Evil demons" is not a trope, at least not in the way that "Arrogant isolationist forest-dwelling elves" is.

****** It's overly nitpicky depending on what the story's a deconstruction of. If it's a deconstruction of DnD, then sure, but if it's supposed to be (or is being "sold" as) a deconstruction of the high fantasy genre then it's a valid argument to make that it clings too closely to DnD.

Personally, I've always heard it billed as general fantasy rather than a parody of DnD, which is why it's been hard for me to get into the story.

*** Personally, the fake battle arcs didn't bother me in the slightest. They progressed the plot, made sense in setting and were enjoyable to read. And the resolution felt sufficiently novel that I don't think "the hunger games did it" is a sufficient critique for unoriginality

*** I agree that the fake battles were annyong. I hated them too. I disagree with wroldbuiling. First I love the worldbuilding just for the sake of it so I'm biased. Second the various Devil, Demon, Angel relationships play later in the story and they are NOT the D&D ones.

Also I forgot about the thing trapped in stone, where was it mentioned?
