Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Suppose you have a character John that has an inborn ability to time travel by just thinking about when he wants to go back to and has grown up always able to fix his mistakes.

No time limits. No travel count limits. Sends his mind back to his younger body. Cannot go forward. If he dies, it's permanent.

Let's not make John rational/ist because such a character would have infinite time to think and it's going to be as hard to predict as AGI, but this time the FOOM period is 0 seconds. Instead we have Alice who John talks to. Since John can simply rewind time if he screws up, he has no fears about confiding his ability to Alice (even though it could actually be dangerous. Think how Zach in MOL talked with everyone). Alice does some quick tests and finds that John does indeed have this ability. Alice realises major implications of this but must tread carefully, because it is all to easy for John to back out in an instant.

You are Alice. What are your objectives and how do you achieve them?

Eg:\\
a) You are convinced that it's a terrible ethical problem for John to exist, so you must find a way to kill him and you cannot afford any chance of failure.\\
b) You would benefit greatly from exploiting his abilities, but so would anyone else. How do you convince him you're more important, trustworthy, etc?

EDIT: added details to the ability. Elaborated on the task.

*** He can time travel or he can send his present mind back into his past body? Can he go to the future?\\
Cause I think that is important.

I would convince him to have a child (not sure if with me, cause giving birth sucks) or better more children. And to let his ability be tested. Try to find the mechanism. (And steal it for myself.^^ And some decades later give as many as possible that power. )

Other than that, try to make him smarter, and teach him to think before acting. Also give him the reflex to go back in time (1hr or some days), if he panics/gets threatened. Assuming he is a decent human being.

Next get some money via betting and lotteries then invest it (in the past). Start an organization that influence the world for him/me/us. (They get told they work for aliens with a predictive algorithm or some other bullshit.)

Now no clue what technology he could jumpstart. But whatever he does, he should tell his organization, which would give the knowledge to someone else. Let's start with internet and rockets. Maybe cheap food or cloned meat.

And whenever a war breaks out send the organization some years before out for non-violent activism and peace propaganda. (Depending what the cause and reason for the war is. Maybe send assassins.)

Of course in RL I would tell John to go back in time and kill himself, so we/he can find out what happens.

I actually want to ask more along the lines of what you would do, precisely, since what you have highlighted are objectives to reach but not how to reach them. Of course, my original statement only asked for what you would do, so your answer is good. I will edit it to add that in.

***** Well, it all depends, if he is a somewhat decent guy, teach him stuff and train.

If not, get him drunk and kill him in his sleep.

If he is somewhat decent, I would try to convince him of forming that organization. Since he would do all the work in the past and can't come back asking for question, he would need to do it mostly by himself. I would advice him, to get some decent lieutenants, who do most of the work.

So my todo list for him: 1. Go to this time, and write down following instructions: 2. buy lottery ticket with that number 3. employ these guys for your organization (via pay phone) 3a. tell them to kill these guys at time/locations 3b. tell them to infiltrate these companies/countries/organisations 3c. tell them to start propaganda campaign 4. go to university and learn what you like (economics, biology, physics, programming, math or painting) 5. when you see an opportunity to achieve a goal or make the world better, use your power to make sure you can use it. 6. work some jobs (waiter, mechanic or whatever) 7. come back to me

I mean, I don't know John. I don't even know how old he is or in which country he lives or how far back he can go. And honestly John would be pissed at me, cause I would try to talk him into time travel suicide/murder.

Also he would get sick of me, trying to convince him to go vegan and make a vegan propaganda cartoon in the past.

Now more realistic, I would look up, what other people did after the earliest time John could do something actively (like after he learned to walk) and convince John to let his organization do this. Like the Bill& MelindaGates Foundation who fights against some diseases. Or smallpox. Some enviroment laws lobbying, before the products, we made the laws for, get to the market.

​

Were I Alice, my reaction would depend very much on the character of John. Unless he's incredibly actively malicious, killing him seems unnecessary. To kill him, explosives seems like the best option.

​

I would try to convince him to use stock market fuckery, and use the perpetual money stream for utilitarian social causes. $1.5b could eradicate polio for example. The argument would be, "you will get rich and famous and people will love you." I don't think it's really that hard of a sell.

**** Question is, why would John care? He doesn't need to be rational to know he's omnipotent and he's had (more than) a lifetime to develop methods of exploiting time travel to manipulate people. For all you know, he could've talked to you already and knows exactly how to act to get you to think he's a good person. He could be repeating the last few seconds of your conversation hundreds of times until you give the response he wants. And why would he care about the welfare of humanity when all of his progress would be wiped when he goes back in time?

***** It's far more rational to assume that he's average, good, or the mundane / shitty sort of evil than a supervillain trying to maximize harm. This situation appeals to all the vast majority of people:

- Get rich quick (that appeals to virtually everyone).

- You have so much money that it's now meaningless. (It could eventually break through to most people).

- Make everyone love you through works of charity. (Again, this appeals to most people).

​

I really think that a selfish person who wants to maximize positive fame with the ability to eventually choose the most efficient path is almost indistinguishable from someone who is perfectly altruistic. And as to the question of what is he manipulating you, well why is it important that he is doing so? The most obvious answer would be to sleep with you; well, a selfish person with the ability to redo actions until they maximize effect would present as no different than an incredibly attentive partner who naturally knows your needs.

​

In the vast majority of cases, motivation doesn't really matter unless they're a psychopath. The ability to maximize the affect of actions means that if you can convince them to do great works of good by spending something that is essentially meaningless, there's no difference. The only difference is if they want to maximize harm; which isn't the way the vast majority of people work. The probability of net gain far outweighs the probability of harm.

*** (a): John's abilities /should not/ present any sort of ethical problem. But if he needs to be killed, the obvious way to do so is with a painless poison that will kill him in his sleep.

(b): Appeal to alturism. Find a way to leverage his abilities to help not me personally, but the world as a whole. Memorising lottery numbers and donating the winnings to charity is one option but there are so many more ways to benefit from the ability to bring information into the past. Wait until a scandal breaks and then go back, armed with certain phone numbers, to make sure that the scandalous activity in question either never happened at all, or was stopped almost at once.

From John's point of view, he can travel to the past. From Alice's point of view, John can bring information from the future.

** So recently I've been thinking about "Avada Kedavra" as an offensive spell. In a universe where the magical rules are more in tune with the natural ones, it would obviously be horribly inefficient. If we assume it takes proportional magical energy to destroy something containing that magical energy, what would the optimal offensive spells be, and what form would they take (beam, projectile, gas, shock wave etc)?

Ground rules:

1. Larger area of effect = larger cost.

2. Each spell can have multiple layered effects, up to 3.

3. Spells can either be static or dynamic. A dynamic spell will fulfill it's effect whether or not it hits the correct place on the body. Static spells must hit the correct body part. Dynamic spells are more taxing.

4. Effects follow a semi-realistic system. Destroying something is more taxing than displacing it (to a point), creating something is more taxing than altering something. Heating is more efficient than cooling. You can set things on fire, cut them, explode them, glue them together, inflict pain, cramps, change properties, induce actions etc. Be creative, and think common sense when it comes to mana cost.

Example spells (just to jog your imagination)

Blood boil: A projectile that boils the blood around the area struck. Static. Two effects, applying heat (1) to a specific area (2). Not very taxing, due to its simple effect and specific scope.

Glue: A 30 yard 45* degree shock wave attack. Victims body is stuck to anything it touches, including itself. Lips, fingers, etc. One effect, attachment. Expensive to cast, because of its large area and unspecific scope.

Avada Kedavra: Beam that instantly stops every cell in the victims body from engaging in further chemical reactions resulting in instant death. 1 effect, altering cells. Impossible to cast, because of its expensive effect (alteration) and scope (every single cell).

If you need clarification just tell me, but feel free to post your ideas even if you're not sure. My rules are probably full of holes so I'd appreciate any suggestions. The point here is for you guys to find all the obviously broken stuff so i can patch it up.

**** In the original HP I'd agree. With my modified rules i could see a few situations where you'd need something else.

If you're outnumbered spell incantation speed isn't the only important factor, but also cost. It depends on the method, but knocking someone out would probably be pretty costly (most effective method would probably be by pain, unless you know some other easy way to turn someone unconscious). It doesn't matter if you're able to knock 10 enemies out in 10 seconds if it leaves you out of energy against the other 10.

Counters are also a big thing. There are wards against offensive spells, and most the popular offensive spells would probably also have the most extensive wards. People also know how to play around it.

Knocking someone out also isn't permanent. If you're vs a group they could just go around waking each other up, with magic if need be.

*** Most effective combat spells are probably a dynamic one that makes tiny cuts severing specific nerves. Another effective spell would be one that induces an air embolism. An effective static one shoots or sprays hot sparks that effect a very limited area but are hot enough to ignite on contact. Flashbangs should be cheap as well.

It seems that based on the versatility every offensive spell would have a specific counter defense. If you think someone is going to flay your skin then you can make an enchantment to keep your blood in or hold your skin together before the fight. How many defenses you can keep up and offenses you can make for each fight is going to vary based on your magical power. Wizard combat could be a bit like rock, paper, scissors though it depends a bit on whether you can make contingent spells and the relative efficiency of defenses and attacks.

**** All good ideas. Severing nerves is probably the most efficient way to render someone helpless. Air embolisms would be powerful as well, but that constitutes creation. So I'm not sure which is best.

I'm thinking of making things have a "magical density", meaning that certain materials and things require more mana to affect. So the brain, nerves, heart etc would be harder to affect than a lump of wood equal in size.

This is sort of how i envisioned it would turn out as well. Not sure how i want to make the general costs of defense vs offense. On one hand, offensive spells have to move, and be launched outside the wizard's body, which would accrue some cost.

On the other, some defensive spells have to be applied to the whole body, and they have to be maintained (generally speaking). I'm leaning towards making defensive spells less costly, as they are a counter. Maybe by making them only trigger once, or a set amount of times (according to wizard).

I assume knowledge of the opponent would be priceless in this situation. Knowing an opponents favored offensive spells and wards would practically win you the fight. Even knowing stuff like his home country or family might give you a clue to what meta he follows. In the same vein spontaneity would be powerful as well.

An air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists favoring entry of gas. You don't need to create the air when you can force it through capilliaries or some other entry point.

****** Wasn't aware of that, thanks. I thought the pressure in the blood vessels were too high for it to be on the low-pressure side of the gradient, but that doesn't really matter when you can just affect the pressure.

*** Study neuroscience, create a spell to nudge a specific part of the brain that will kill the individual. The spell would ideally be invisible, work from any point of contact (i.e. it hits the body, locates the brain, and only applies the force there). If that's pseudo-science, you could probably still do something similar. If vital organs are too magically dense, with a whole lot of study you could probably create a spell that can use quantum tunnelling(magically created, but itself non-magical enough to bypass the magical density defence), or simply travel between atoms until it reaches its destination, at which point it non-magically expands and damages the target.

Outside of something of that style, the best thing I think would be something like a micro railgun to shoot holes in heads. With magic, you can easily apply a lot of force to even something very light, potentially even cancelling air resistance completely. Thus, almost the only thing the spell needs to be able to do is produce enough kinetic energy to pierce somebody's skull. Even just air particles held together by magic could work.

To avoid stuff like this you could introduce an extra cost to extremely precise spell work, i.e. really large and really small effects both take a lot of power.
