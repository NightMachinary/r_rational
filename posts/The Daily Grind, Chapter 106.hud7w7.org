** Argus does a great job leasing up to boss fight conflicts in this story. The world building is good. Some of the downtime section drag on but not nearly as bad as downtime sections in something like delve or wandering inn

Hax galore. Is a grape an item? A tooth pick? A mushroom? A plastic bead?

They should probably buy the building soon.

*** Where does the money come from? If it appears from nowhere when the transaction is made then it could be used to make trillions with automatic transactions, if it causes people to overvalue units by that amount that is still exploitable but it's a bit hard to think of an ethical way. Actually that first one would bring the feds down on their heads pretty much instantly for printing money. Would Bitcoin work? If so would that imply it could be exploited for P=NP computing?

**** Well, they had a similar situation with the bathroom. It was 1) transforming raw matter into a form that would presumably have a higher market price. 2) But it was also disappearing once taken out.

So if 1) is true then cheap ben would turn into a $15 pen. If 2) is true is would turn back once taken of the property.

The wording of bathroom one and this one are different though so 2 might not apply.
