Jekssimil is apparently a real but very uncommon Portuguese name.

There's a Spanish footballer named Uxío Marcos.

There's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocha_(surname)][bunch of famous Rochas.]]

There's an [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4312092][Uzbekistani singer named Ozodbek Nazarbekov]], and not too many more Ozodbeks on the English-speaking side of the Web or the easily-googlable wider Web.

In Portuguese, "reveles" is the second person singular present form of [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reveles][revelar]], or translated to English, "You reveal." I wonder if JUROR will be facilitating, receiving, or performing the Fudge Revelation.

I have performed highly scientific anagrammatical analysis of JUROR's full legal name. You will be happy to know that "JEKSSIMIL UXIO ROCHA DE OZODBEK REVELES" is in fact easily rearranged to spell "I AM LORD CHILI SO SEEK BOOZE U VEXED JERKS"

You heard it here first, folks: JUROR is actually Chili, drink up

Also, the point of a tag is probably to convey information to potential future readers, so it might not the best idea going forward to continue to use an obscure in-joke for the tag just to jab at maybe like three people.

****** I got the point of the tag. It's whimsical and sarcastic so it fits with the tone of the fic. That's not really a "joke" so to speak. My concern was less about practicality and more about precedent.

I don't think I ever said this explicitly, but I think using [RT] for this fic is perfectly fine and shouldn't be controversial. I think that it should not be decided that [RT] is an inappropriate tag for this fic.

However, if it /is/ decided that tagging it [RT] is inappropriate then future postings of it should probably be tagged in a way that future /"idk if this fic is necessarily 100% appropriate to post in this sub but I think lots of people here would get a kick out of it"/ fics can share the same tag for the sake of consistency. "SATIRICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF BELOVED SURREALIST WORK WRITTEN FOR AND PARTIALLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT" is too specific to this fic [EDIT: too specific for other fics to also use the [SDOBSWWFAPATS] tag], and it's probably not desirable to set a precedent for fics of questionable appropriateness to use invented tags specific to themselves.

Yes but [RT] and [RST] aren't just "tiny little boxes" though, they're the very reason this sub exists. If a story doesn't fit into the "[[/r/rational]] box" then it doesn't need a tag /at all/ because it shouldn't be posted here in the first place outside of the Monday and Friday threads.

This fic's "questionable appropriateness" is questionable - like, I think posting it isn't inappropriate and I don't think it's an edge case, I think it fits in the [[/r/rational]] box just as well as anything else considering the fact that people really have no idea how the box is shaped. I think it's only a minority who views this fic as outright inappropriate, but it seems (I think - this was days ago and I've moved on) that some people might view it as an edge case, hence the discussion of what to do with edge cases.

Edit: bumping up to ~70% probability /some/ kind of life extension shenanigans are in play: I just read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator for the first time in many years and Wonka-Vite exists in-universe: a pill that makes you 20 years younger (stacking.)

It was growing faster than we could cut it! In the end we had to use a lawn mower to keep it in check! But I'll get the mixture right soon!

  'Thank you,' said Mr Wonka. 'I shall now tell you how this amazing television set of mine works. But first of all, do you know how ordinary television works? It is very simple. At one end, where the picture is being taken, you have a large ciné camera and you start photographing something. The photographs are then split up into millions of tiny little pieces which are so small that you can't see them, and these little pieces are shot out into the sky by electricity. In the sky, they go whizzing around all over the place until suddenly they hit the antenna on the roof of somebody's house. They then go flashing down the wire that leads right into the back of the television set, and in there they get jiggled and joggled around until at last every single one of those millions of tiny pieces is fitted back into its right place (just like a jigsaw puzzle), and presto! --- the photograph appears on the screen ...'

  'That isn't exactly how it works,' Mike Teavee said.

  'I am a little deaf in my left ear,' Mr Wonka said. 'You must forgive me if I don't hear everything you say.'
