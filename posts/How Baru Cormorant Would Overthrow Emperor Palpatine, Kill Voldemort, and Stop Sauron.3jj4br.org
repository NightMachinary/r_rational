** OK, this is more of a teaser than anything, but it's a fun little read. I will also point out that I have promoted Seth Dickinson's short work several times on this forum, cuz he's an incredible Rationalist author, and I absolutely cannot wait to get my hands on this book.

Ha.

Actually, fun fact, I have a sibling named after a protagonist from that series.

Hmmm, let me guess.

Your sibling's name is...

The Disreputable Dog?

** This is awesome! His tips to Ripley are the only ones I question, though. If you try to ransom the coordinates to the company, what's to stop them from quietly capturing and torturing you? Or sabotaging you in some other way, and demanding the coordinates in exchange for backing off? You can't hide a bully's lunchbox and say "Be my friend and I'll tell you where it is."

But, this is all in the fun of thinking about rational characters. I realize he didn't write this article to be his final word on these plots. The rest is quite awesome :)

** I recently finished reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] and, based on this fictional Q&A, Baru reminds me a lot of said fanfic's main character (minus a few slices of ham)

EDIT: The story isn't complete. I say finish to mean I read it from beginning to its current point, which I would approximate at around 55 chapters (forum posts)
