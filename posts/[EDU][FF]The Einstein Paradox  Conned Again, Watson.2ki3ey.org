(I haven't read these books in quite a few years, so my recollections may be slightly off.)

In the short stories that compose these two books (Goodreads links: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76261][here]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130873][here]]), Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (with Mycroft Holmes, Dr. Challenger, and Charles Dodgson showing up as well) solve mysteries with the use of probability, game theory, and logic (plus mathematics and physics). In particular (IIRC), Watson basically invents the double-blind study (with some philosophical waffling about how ethical/moral it is to /pretend/ to treat someone), and Holmes outlines several logical fallacies (confirmation bias, gambler's fallacy, sunk costs...), plus the Prisoner's Dilemma, among other items.

(A very memorable exchange between Mycroft and a prisoner, with Sherlock smirking knowingly in the background and Watson looking on: "Having listened to all my game-theory arguments about why you should defect, why won't you defect?" "Because the other prisoner would bash my head in when he got out!")

The stories themselves are pretty fun to read, though some are more related to physics (including relativity) and mathematics than to game theory and probability.


** Thanks for the recommendation.

*** It's always possible that they were never re-released in electronic form. I read the paperback versions, years ago.
