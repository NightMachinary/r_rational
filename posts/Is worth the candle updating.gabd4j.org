*** "Another"? Didn't even think of that, but it makes sense. From the Patreon(portion visible to us beggars): "Early access to new chapters of Worth the Candle, 24 hours in advance, plus access to a channel on my Discord for discussion. Chapters will be posted publicly as normal the next day." Does anyone know if he had a patreon right from the beginning when he started writing WtC? I'm kinda concerned that there's gonna be more delays and nickle-and-diming towards the end of the story. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the free content and a guy has to make money, but I much prefer a transparent business model and I'd further argue all the 'leeches' contribute a lot by word-of-mouth, reviews and finding typos -so it's odd to have to find out like that we have to wait longer. :/

**** All he did was add one day to the early bird time, once, presumably to have more time for feedback before a public release. He's been writing free content for this community for years, as well as moderating it, I think we can trust him lol

**** As far as I know AW has not used alt accounts in a malicious way. He once wrote new stories under a different account to keep them unassociated with his old stories. Which authors do all the time.

**** The Patreon rules have been like that since the beginning as far as I'm aware. Being a Patreon member gets you viewing access to the chapters a bit before everyone else, not sure how that translates to having concerns that the author doesn't have a "transparent business model" or worrying about financially-motivated delays? As a non-Patreon reader who's followed this author for a while, I haven't had any issues yet and this comes across a bit paranoid.

**** This batch was going to be nearly the length of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, over 70,000 words, after the last batch (of 28,000) was released in March.

That's why this release is different. He asked his (free) Discord what they wanted, and I saw both of these ideas coming from people there. I know earlybirds do a ton of editing work, from typos to consistency, and I think that was part of the calculation in the longer lead time for this huge batch, too.

**** He is now maintaining the story on 3 separate public platforms (ao3, royalroad, and his own website) so I imagine it's easier to give the patrons an extra day for consistency checks/typos while he still only has to fix it in one place. Things were presumably more convenient when any edits only had to be made on ao3.

** Check the Paetron for an easy answer, but yes early birds for a batch has gone out, likely with more on the way.

I don't think worth the candle sticks to a set schedule it comes out when it's ready

**** There's a 2 day gap for this batch, something AW is trialing. Expect 5 chapters in ~10hrs from now and then another 5 chapters 3-4 days after that.
