And according to Uriel, such a p-zombie would emphatically insist on having a soul and even exhibit existential dread at finding out otherwise, but not actually be conscious.

/shudder/

Should p-zombies have human rights? Assuming that you can experimentally verify somebody not having a soul, and you have an archangel's word for them not having conscious experience but being complex automatons, should you value them the same as a human with a soul?

If there is nothing there to experience suffering, there is no suffering to alleviate. In Unsong, any ensouled who are subsequently de-ensouled at that time meet oblivion, even if the rest of the world cannot observe it.

As in, if the real me was this story observing events as they unfold and knowing everything the reader knows, I'd still believe Uriel was either philosophically mistaken about what counts as a person (he's not infallible) or had a morality not perfectly aligned to mine. Even if the sky cracked and a bunch of propositions I previously believed required questioning, that belief wouldn't be one of them. At least not enough to play it safe and give rights to the behaviorally conscious.

Unless you're Uriel yourself, there is always the possibility of being mistaken about what Uriel meant.

With objective knowledge about the metaphysics of the universe, the issue of soulless' rights doesn't seem complicated to me, but any given individual in-universe is going to lack that important piece of objective knowledge. So I guess there's an important distinction of the issue from the viewpoint of the reader who has this knowledge, and the individuals in-story who do not.

Certainly in the real world, time and again whole swathes of the population have been dehumanized and abused by others, so we know it is a real risk not to have in place a default policy of humanizing others.

********** I wasn't clear on you being of the anti-philosophical zombie bent, but I figured that what I wrote was not quite what you believed. I do think it is the extent of overlap in what we'd agree to though.

I personally am of the strong opinion that there is no such thing as a consistent "strictly materialist" stance which believes the universe is governed by certain physical/metaphysical laws and that those laws do not directly have anything to say about consciousness. In other words, I do not believe that the whole "consciousness is an emergent property of matter" shtick is sound. It'd be a long post or two to get into that so I won't here.

Unfortunately there's nothing I can do for those unwilling to admit to the meaningfulness of consciousness as a concept outside of working definitions.

I'd argue with your definition insofar as it's not the thing we usually refer to when we talk about consciousness, except my stance is that you can't define consciousness anymore than you can define the epiphenomena we associate with "volume" or "the passage of time", or better yet, the idea of "physical existence" itself. (With access to the mathematics/physical law we attach to the associated physical phenomena you can talk about the abstraction, but the idea that some tree or electron or ensemble of particles composing the sun "exists" is a completely different notion of "existence" than that used in mathematics, and I do not believe it to be formalizeable. Without formalizeability, you don't have definitions. And in the case of consciousness, we don't even have whatever physical law it presumably obeys, so discussion outside of presupposing that consciousness is a thing, like volume, and aside from being part of the rules of the universe it further has a certain physically semantic interpretation, like volume, is difficult.)

If you'll give me that consciousness like the inner-thing we conscious beings experience is some actual meaningful-though-not-definable thing itself, and suppose in the usual modern way that it is governed by some physical laws which are expressible via mathematics, then I'd say that the point of philosophical zombies is in the claimed /non-(mathematical)uniqueness/ of the universes' interpreter which reads off the particles/whatnot obeying those equations, and which says that there will be consciousness expressed in this particular way, or even that consciousness is physically realized, as opposed to, say, the case of the phase of the wave equation (which is not). Or shorter, that it is not mathematically or logically necessary that a given consistent set of symbols possess one semantics over another, and the mystery is that the universe chose this particular one. Syntatics does not imply a unique semantics. Which is all just a fancy way of saying and justifying that under these assumptions, the /experience/ of consciousness is entirely independent of anything external or measurable, and even more strongly, its "existence" is logically independent of the rest of the set up. But I recognize that it is consistent of you not to grant nearly so many assumptions about things.

Is it? It's not even controversial to claim that there is no way to prove anyone else is "conscious" (i.e. to /disprove/ solipsism). The best we could ever hope to do is to understand reality so well that we can describe what kinds of physical interactions result in the physical state which we hypothesize is behind a conscious being's existing as a conscious being. And that's assuming that there is such a thing. Maybe all matter is "conscious", but most lives a very boring, mindless, memoryless, senseless life.

This is the fundamental point of difference. I am claiming a distinction between the underlying "syntactics", the abstract rules describing what is going on physically, and the way they are "realized" in the universe ("semantics", I'll refer to it as).

To avoid confusion more than that it's necessarily natural to say here, my viewpoint will jettison free-will, various aspects of identity such as a link between your "thoughts" and the thing doing the observing (i.e. that minds != consciousness), etc. Not that I am particular attached to abandoning these things or happen to know that it is necessary, but they appear problematic and are beside the main thesis.

Given that context. Our conscious experience seems like it interacts, but it is a mainstream observation that the outside world gets no information about whether I am "conscious" or not. The presence of "consciousness", in this sense, does appear to be "independent" of what's going on outside. Is a "consciousness", whatever that is, /impacted/ by what's going on outside? Maybe, but as I said, I think it's a mistake to conflate a "mind" that has thoughts with the "consciousness" that hears them. Maybe in the grand unified viewpoint these two concepts are equivalent, but then that's some theorem nobody's yet written the definitions to even state. So maybe not.

Now the prevalent materialist view is that consciousness is an "emergent property of matter", whatever that means. End of mystery. But my claim is that it is not a mathematical necessity that the rest of the abstract "rules" of matter and their semantics within the universe - physics - should entail that consciousness as the thing I claim I have should accompany the rest of physics. "It's an emergent property of +matter+the rest of physics" is just false. Syntactics does not imply semantics. Absent a bate-and-switch, consciousness as I experience it is not /by necessity/ the consequence of having "matter" obeying the other laws of physics, even if that is the way that it happens to play out in this reality. That the particles moving the way they move should /mean/ that I have consciousness rather than merely instantiating a false shell which interfaces with everything else as though there were is the question at hand, and the source of all dualism.

Maybe the stuff which makes up reality has some rule about consciousness attached to it and is fundamental in some way that it wouldn't make sense to talk about other realities existing which weren't made of that very same stuff with that very same rule ... but this is far away from a discussion of what the physics entails, and into metaphysics, and ultimately sounds like an explanation by fiat - matter has consciousness because matter has consciousness. /-- Alright, but why?/ Or at the very least, /-- well isn't that interesting?/ Certainly not "well it all makes sense consciousness is an emergent property and consciousness is just an illusion, man," which, sadly, seems also to be the prevalent mainstream viewpoint.

This isn't any greater mystery than any other metaphysics. But, the mysteries of metaphysics are the greatest mysteries of all.

Not everything has an explanation rooted in something else. At bottom, some things are /given/.There are axioms you assume, and then move forward from there. Your perceptions are sort of like an axiomatic starting point. You logically figure out what the physical laws of the universe you live in are from that axiomatic starting point. It's hard to explain but the question you are posing, "why do we have perceptions in the first place", isn't sensible. It's like I'm saying 1+1=2, and you're asking "why is there a 1+1".

In-universe, one doesn't have to use nebulous terms such as "alive", since the mystery of consciousness is solved - it's a physically/metaphysically colloquial-use!logically independent of everything else presence of a "soul." In Unsong, conciousness is something with a real metaphysical existence, and it does not exist in the soulless.

In the real world, you are not concerned with the well-being of rocks. I am fairly confidant making this assumption about you. Let me further assume that you are typical enough that one of the reasons that the suffering of abused animals weighs on you more than the rocks ground for ore is that, in real life, you do not believe that rocks experience anything at all, so there is no "suffering" to be concerned about.

He's essentially the only person on the planet qualified to speak on the matter, so his word can be taken as the next best thing to the word of god. So if Uriel says that consciousness is non-material and certain people aren't actually conscious and have no moral value, that deserves some serious consideration whether it fits with our understanding of neuroscience or not.

Or perhaps more credibly, if Thamiel lacks any desire to torture p-zombies then that's some damn good evidence p-zombies don't have any genuince capacity for suffering. Of course, that's if Thamiel isn't just acting that way to inflame racism.

******* Ok.

#+begin_quote
  In the context of the story, it's clear that Uriel operates on a level that is actualy beyond human comprehension. He's essentially the only person on the planet qualified to speak on the matter, so his word can be taken as the next best thing to the word of god.
#+end_quote

On one hand. On the other hand, it's been pretty clearly demonstrated that Uriel is an unreliable narrator of sorts because he's really bad at seeing the world the way humans see it. So Uriel seeing no value in the soulless might be because they intrinsically hold no value or maybe because it's just Uriel being Uriel and misunderstanding something.

#+begin_quote
  Or perhaps more credibly, if Thamiel lacks any desire to torture p-zombies then that's some damn good evidence p-zombies don't have any genuince capacity for suffering. Of course, that's if Thamiel isn't just acting that way to inflame racism.
#+end_quote

If this is true then I agree but I don't see anything pointing to this so it sounds like empty conjecture.

*** Actually, I think this whole p-zombie thing is entirely missing the point. in my opinion, souls and consciousness are orthogonal qualities: someone can have a soul and not be conscious, and someone can have no soul and be conscious. This is based on the fact that a soul is completely optional, and whether you have one can change over your lifetime, apparently with no observable side effects.

I think that having a soul is sort of like having the right to vote. You still exist independent of your rights, but when you have them the world tends to work differently for you. In this case, having a soul lets you use names, let's you move on to heaven or hell, and plugs you in to the api holy beings like angels and Uriel have access to, which tracks suffering, happyness, sin, etc.

It has to be emphasized that you exist independently of this system. Even if it does noticeably change your behavior, it would just be added to a massive list of environmental variables that control you, including things like sun exposure, air quality, exposure to nature in your enviroment, trace minerals such as lithium or lead in your enviroment, smog, pollution, food quality, etc etc etc etc.

**** It's not missing the point. It may well be the case that in real life, consciousness can occur in animals or machines or other entities purely as a consequence of how they are built. You are conscious, in other words, because you have a brain organized in such a way that it hosts consciousness. (Call this the view that consciousness is a physical property of systems.) If you then further suppose that souls exist, then you're right: Whether you have a soul, given that consciousness is physical property, has no bearing on whether you have consciousness.

However, if you believe that consciousness is something that ensouled beings have and non-ensouled beings lack--no matter how much they insist they experience things and no matter that their brains seem to light up in the same places under an MRI under the same conditions as to an ensouled being's--then the talk about p-zombies is terribly relevant.

Your point seems to boil down to the fact that p-zombies don't exist; displaying the behaviors expected of conscious beings is identical to being conscious. That may well be the case in real life--I happen to believe it is. There is little evidence for the existence of souls, so if we are to conclude that we ourselves are conscious, we must conclude that consciousness is possible without souls. However, in Unsong, souls do exist. They seem to be very important, they possibly have a place in some Divine Plan, and the Archangel Uriel (who is more knowledgeable about these things than most) says that beings without souls don't suffer, even when they appear to, and accuses several apparently normal humans of lacking souls. This seems like strong evidence that p-zombies do exist in Unsong.

It may turn out that Uriel is wrong in this case. He is bad at understanding humans, sometimes. But the rules in Unsong are different than those in real life, and it might be (and seems to be) the case in the story that physical mechanisms are not sufficient to produce conscious experience, and no soul = no consciousness.

***** Even if that was the case, we already knew most creatures didn't have souls in this universe but as far as I'm aware no one has rescinded animal abuse laws. It seems like pain is something to avoid whether or not the creatures are conscious.

****** Well, pain is just feedback. It's your body's way of saying "don't do that" or "take it easy" or "keep this spot safe while it heals." A p-zombie avoiding things that bring it "pain" is like Google's Go-playing neural network avoiding moves that have given it negative reinforcement values in the past. In neither case does this feedback indicate an experience of pain, or of suffering; it only results in the outwardly observable and behavioral effects that we normally associate with such experience. While I think that animals do experience pain in real life, it's logically necessary that they don't if they lack souls in a world where only souls experience anything. (Which, though likely, is not really certain in Unsong yet. Offhand, I'd put the chance that Uriel messed up and humans without souls have consciousness at ~30%.)

As for the animal abuse laws, there could be any number of reasons for that. Maybe they have been rescinded but it wasn't worth noting. It could be that people don't like seeing things that look like suffering but really aren't, as with watching torture in a movie. Or, seeing the suffering-like behavior of abused animals (who aren't actually suffering) might make people less sensitive to the suffering-like behavior of abused humans (who actually are suffering), and so outlawing cruelty to animals actually decreases cruelty to humans. Or, it could just be that people haven't thought things through, as usual. Point is, there are valid reasons to not legalize animal abuse, even if animals have no experience, just like there are valid reasons not to legalize p-zombie murder, even though p-zombies have no consciousness.
