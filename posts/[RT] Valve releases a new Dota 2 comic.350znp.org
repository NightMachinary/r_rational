** ...Well done. Thta seems like one of the easiest ways to find powerful labs and artifacts with little effort.

PS: Did it show up in English for everyone else? I had to go to the blog and then navigate to the comic from there to get in in English. It was some Asian-looking language when I followed your link the first time.

*** Is there any place which keeps an up-to-date list? Valve doesn't seem to have one on their own site the way they do for the Team Fortress 2 comics, and these are good enough that I want to follow them despite not actually playing the game, so I'd really like some way to periodically make sure I haven't missed any new ones.

***** I did a little digging around, and managed to find a list which seems at least /more/ likely to stay up-to-date than any other currently-existing one: [[http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Category:Comics]]

It's slightly awkward, since most of the comics don't have their own pages and are just linked in footnotes on their associated items' pages, but it should be basically passable until Valve decides to make a list of their own.

*** Wow. These in addition to the OP's... There is some crazy stuff about to go down in the Dota2-verse. And isn't Dota completely multiplayer? They're putting a lot of effort into backstories that won't be more than novelty value, seems like.

**** Yes, DotA 2 is completely multiplayer. That said, the characters tend to be very well-executed and comparatively well-backstoried - most have hundreds of voice lines including specific responses to killing/dying/meeting/etc dozens of other heros, and so forth.

Still not a game anyone plays for the story, but the little touches certainly don't detract.

***** In fact, all four of the fundamental forces have a hero:

Chaos Knight - Strong nuclear force

Keeper of the Light - Weak nuclear force

Io -Electromagnetic force

Enigma - Gravitational

So does this mean we can have a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] dota2 stack ? That could be fun.

******* I think that would either work really well or get crushed. I've heard of this KotL mid thing, but I've never actually seen it pulled off. He'd be good to pair up with the CK after he gets some levels though, the chakra would let CK own the lane.

******** To make it less decisive on mid, defensive safelane duo of FV and KotL, offlane Enigma, Mid CK/Wisp similar to the mid Tiny/Wisp I've been seeing lately.

********* Mid Tiny-Io has been a thing since the bounty runes got added. Getting the minute 0 bottle just makes Io that much better in lane.

I think it could work, with a five stack. You'd need a wisp player who knows how to really play the hero. Enigma is going to be a little stunted compared to a jungle Enigma but the Eidolons should let him do pretty decent, especially with units you control now giving xp for kills (I assume that works for creeps as well as heroes? Or maybe not, since Naga Siren would be broken. I'm going to have to look that up) but he should do fine if he can zone the other team effectively with the threat of a black hole. Overall I'd say it would be entertaining to give it a try.
