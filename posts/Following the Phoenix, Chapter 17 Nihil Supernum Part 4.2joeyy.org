*** Partial Transfiguration and the Patronus are completely distinct things. Patronuses work by thinking happy thoughts which distract you from thinking about death, so being told that they are death stops you being able to do that, since deliberately distracting yourself is incredibly difficult. Partial Transfiguration operates off of completely different mechanics and is to do with world beliefs, while the basic Patronus is not

There is absolutely no way that distracting yourself from a thought is harder than distracting yourself FROM ACTUAL FEELINGS OF FEAR AND HORROR AND SCREAMS OF YOUR PARENTS DEATH, since all of those are also thoughts but + actual real physical effects.

There's also the incredibly nonsense idea that no one has ever mentioned the word death in the entire history of all people using patronus ever, or thought about it (for example a lot of peoples worse memories will be of death which would mean they could never cast a patronus).

***** Don't shout at people, it's rude.

Nobody ever said that these people aren't allowed to have ever thought of death, it's whether they can distract themselves from such thoughts that is the issue.

People like Harry, Hermione and Padma weren't good at so distracting themselves, so they couldn't cast Patronus v1.0

******* There's a large difference between thinking of death, having your worst memory be of death, versus knowing to specifically connect the dementor to death. The first two are things you can push out of your head by summoning a happy thought of life to banish the fear monster. Happy thoughts don't do shit against a /death monster/, unless they are a very specific, rare kind of happy thought.

******** But that presumes that everyone immediately took what he said at face value and truth as well as instantly comprehending the link between seeing dementors as death something that they have believed their entire life was not the case, and then never being possible to not think that. Imagining me telling you that Santa was actually Hitler, how nonsensical it is. This whole Death sucks and if you think that you can't be happy any more ever it's just one huge circlejerk because we all hate Death

This is an obvious Strawman, and nobody in this conversation has ever supported that position

And, if you had told me that Santa Claus was Hitler but that I should not think this when I next think of Santa, that would be very hard to do. Regardless of whether or not it is true, or if I believe it. Sure, given time, that association might fade. However, if the knowledge given is demonstrated to be true by my inability to cast the Patronus, that will just reinforce it and make it incredibly hard to ignore

********** Considering this is a community based on immorality I think my point that you are bias to view death being the biggest baddest is more than enough for people to start rationalising, so I disagree that my circlejerk comment is irrelevant.

As I've said repeatedly the whole function of a patronus involves ignoring thoughts you have, there is literally nothing better suited to not being instantly cancelled by a thought, also note it was at the same time for everyone meaning no one was distracted or had a slower thought process everyone instantly connected death and dementors in their mind. Considering all of these people have spent their lives ignoring the screaming of their family and friends dying to cast a patronus it's just so absurd to think that thought of death (would it work on a child who can't comprehend death, do these people really comprehend death if they aren't immortalists) is so special that it instantly evaporates years of hard cognitive dissonance

That's not necessary. If you are a historian, do you choose to point a loaded gun at your descendents, or do you lie? The idea of patronuses being death would be largely erased from history.

As for the last part, that would be true of some, but there are plenty of egocentric people for whom, well, the memory /features/ death, but what makes it their worst memory is simply that they feel bad.

Does that count?
