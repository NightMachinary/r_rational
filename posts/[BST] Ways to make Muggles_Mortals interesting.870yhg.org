So a common trope in fantasy novels is that whatever special race the story focuses on are always decisively better than muggles. In Harry Potter wizards are muggles, but they have magic. In Eragon the elves are like humans, but smarter, longer-lived, better at magic etc... And dwarves are also longer-lived than humans and posses magics and technology humans don't, as well as an actual god?like being that appears whenever they crown a king, making even their strong religiosity somewhat rational.

In all these stories, the main advantage of humans seems to be 'numbers', which is kind of boring and overused at this point. So I'm trying to think of way to give humans a decisive, advantageous trait that could explain why they still exist in a world full of fantastical beings.

But just giving humans a magical ability would kind of take away from the point of them being muggles, so I'm deciding to go the other way, and take something away from classic magical beings instead. There is some essential human quality that they lack, because it actually is a 'human' quality; there are drawbacks to being magical.

I ran into a roadblock when I started considering ways to find a basic human ability that could be removed from wizards (for example), and still result in them not being too alien to write.

But then I read The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, and was inspired. Maybe only muggles have the language instinct, and other beings actually do have to learn language from scratch as babies, impairing the progress of their civilizations.

And that go me thinking; there's a whole wealth of potential there. There are probably tons and tons of now defunct theories on how human intelligence/mental capabilities work/evolved, all defunct because they are less elegant than the current accepted truth (the human mind works better than the old theory thought it did). Making these old theories of mind true for different magical beings, and then extrapolating from there, could make for some easily alien-but-still-very-humanlike characters.

It would even make some rational sense; the advantages conferred by magic allowed these beings to make do with relatively 'inefficient' minds, while muggles, without such advantages, had to evolve to what appears to be the limits of how intelligent biological brains can be (in that any more improvements would be an evolutionary disadvantage due to tradeoffs).

And it would provide an interesting way for any muggles in on the Masquerade to avoid jealousy; maybe, in the modern era, not all muggles even want to be magical. If Petunia, growing up, watched Lily struggle horribly with language, or in some other mental area, maybe she wouldn't have been so envious of her magic.

And it could even make for an axis, with the power of different magical being/humanoid groups depending on the severity of their deficiency. Wizards might struggle with language, for example, but still manage to be successful because their magic allows them to compensate for that in some way, while elves could be held back by a crippling lack of empathy that prevents their societies from properly functioning.

So I've come here for help brainstorming; what are the best old, wrong theories of mind/cognition/mental faculties that, if taken to be true for different magical beings, would make for the most interesting characters or civilizations?


** I am an ecology student, and instead of viewing things in a strictly direct competition sense, which tends to result in a clear loser and a clear winner, I prefer the interpretation that there are different evolutionary /niches/ that different kinds of intelligence have evolved to fit.

Imagine humans as being your standard endurance-runner savannah-dwelling species, living in small tribes, developing language and intelligence due to strong /intraspecies/ competition and sexual selection. Take any aspect of that formula, and tweak the conditions, and you'll get something different.

Let's imagine elves as being very similar, but evolved for sprinting like a gazelle, ostrich, or cheetah. Suddenly, you have a vastly different metabolic profile, which will affect how the brain develops. You also have an entirely different set of instinctual responses, which means an entirely different /psychological baseline./ How does cooperation for such a species look different? How do they react to conflict or being startled? What draws their interest, what's their beauty aesthetic? All of those things will be reflective of their different niche. And, of course, any clever being might find ways to exploit these psychological differences.

You can do the same for dwarves. Imagine them as being subterranean creatures, like aardvarks or wombats. Imagine if they had a completely alien hierarchy---eusocial, like naked mole rats or ants. Suddenly, the stereotypical obsession with tradition and the social order makes a lot more sense, as they're physiologically and hormonally conditioned to operate that way. Imagine if they live underground because they're more of a prey species in their environment---how might that affect their worldview?

You can do this for any number of fantastical creatures or even magical systems. Magic would be /at least/ as big of an evolutionary factor as the advent of vision or language. In that context, how does it play a role in competition and ecological niches? How does it foster or inhibit competition? Does the way magic is structured incentivize altruistic behavior or selfish behavior? These are the questions you need to ask about the system.

**** Well, nothing's known with /certainty,/ but bear in mind that “sexual selection” and “intraspecies competition” are both extremely broad categories that cover practically all the bases, both evolutionarily speaking and in terms of the top theories today. It covers at least the sexual selection and social exchange theories for the rise of human intelligence---it's my own personal opinion that these reinforce rather than conflict with each other, but some consider social (Robin Dunbar) or sexual (Geoffrey Miller) theory to be the dominant, driving force behind the evolution of human intelligence.

The only things /aside/ from those reasons are pretty implausible as applied to human evolution. It's not given much credit that humans evolved greater intelligence to outsmart predators, for example, considering things like /Australopithecus/ also lived in similar environments with similar predators yet never manifested higher brain volumes even remotely as fast as did humans over the same exact time span. Similarly, while hominids did likely come into hostile contact with each other and intelligence probably played somewhat of a role in determining who went extinct, they also were /separated/ from each other long enough to speciate in the first place, and things like Neanderthals and other hominids had often /independently/ developed to be about as intelligent as humans were at the time, or perhaps even a bit smarter, given their slightly larger brain volumes. Thus, the comparative advantage that determined who lived and who died out was probably something other than intelligence.

There are exceptions, of course, as hominid evolutionary history is rather messy, with more primitive species living contemporaneously (albeit not necessarily alongside) other, more advanced hominids. /Homo erectus,/ for example, lived a surprisingly long time alongside more advanced (taller and bigger-brained) descendants. Hominids were constantly migrating from one continent to another, undergoing speciation, and migrating back where they came from.

Long story short, high intelligence is such a wildly useful and broadly-applicable tool that I'd be amazed if there was only /one/ single factor that led to it predominating hominid evolution. If you ask me, it was probably at least partly due to natural selection (given the climate and ecological calamities of the time), but the primary driving force seems more likely to be sexual and social, evolution operating both on the individual (in the context of selecting a mate and successfully rearing children) and on the group (more intelligent/communicative groups being more successful), with the latter in particular determining which hominid species survived when and if they eventually came into direct competition.

Many systems work this way, with wizards and witches living lives of relative privilege and wealth compared to peasants.

Also consider that what might be the /single greatest unifying trait/ of the first world as compared to developing countries, aside from their wealth and industrialization, is that the first world experiences a stark reduction in birth rates.

********** Uh, who said anything about dipping below replacement? Evolution only “cares” about /comparative advantage./ A lower birth rate just means that the isolated population in question grows more slowly than the other populations do. It doesn't say anything about whether those offspring are more or less successful, or whether the population in question goes extinct.

For example, elephants have a very low birth rate, but theoretically, even they could have a ridiculous exponential growth in population if all their offspring survived to breeding age and bred successfully themselves. Likewise, out of the millions of eggs that a tuna or sturgeon produces with each spawning, they're doing fantastic /even if 99.99% of their offspring die,/ as is often the case, or more. They only need two to replace the parents, and that applies to elephants as well as tuna. Now, since tuna and elephants are obviously both still around (although both populations are looking rather iffy due to human overhunting, ironically enough) there's no way you can say that a super-low birth rate is any “worse” or “better” than a super-high birth rate.

*********** Birth control is leading to subgroup population declines in Russia and Japan.

Your point about comparative advantage stands. Point is, with the arrow of time, any sub-subgroups that have traits that 'resist' birth control, whatever those traits are (vulnerable to religion, takes impulsive actions, addicted to handling small children) will become more prevalent.

Anyways, since wizards have immense advantages, maybe some of them won't breed, due to their easy lives with trivial to access birth control, like citizens of advanced countries. But all it takes is a subgroup with an inheritable advantage and pretty soon the Weasleys are everywhere. Eventually there would be so many of them they'd crush out muggles.

****** Throw in something like "Wizard fertility is highly dependent on the amount of magic in the area." In areas which had been saturated by repeated magic use for centuries, or which were naturally magical, wizards would have a normal reproduction rate. In areas which didn't have this, wizards could certainly /live/... but probably wouldn't have anywhere near as many children (or as many children who were wizards instead of squibs).

So in the UK and Europe, you have wizards. In the middle-east you'd probably have lots of wizards, although the culture might be different. In Africa you'd have squillions of wizards if there wasn't something else working against that - maybe a far-distant wizard war clobbered the continent or its magic reserves.

In North America, you have a reasonable amount of wizards, and slowly increasing. In South America... who knows? Could be a plot point. In places like Australia, either there's no magic, or the magic is continually drained away, or it's fossilized and can't be accessed easily.

Asia? Lots of magic-users, of a thousand different styles, but not so many in the European mold. Maybe Asia has too /much/ magic, and it's all jumbled up - spells which work in one location might not work the same way, or as well, or at /all/, if you travel fifty miles away.

people in first world countries have low birthrates.

this is often attributed to having high standards of living, and high survival rates. heck, they'd also been disconnected from muggle life for so long those fully immersed in the culture effectively had no idea how muggles lived without magic.

that suggests that wizards might have had super low population growth for centuries, while muggle birthrates exploded.

  crippling lack of empathy
#+end_quote

Perhaps subvert this - suppose a crippling surfeit of empathy. Along with the ability to do magic comes a new sense: the ability to sense magic and magical connections. This changes everything, but in particular it enables and /forces/ magicals to perceive the interconnected web of all being. This results in much beauty and harmony but also cultural stasis. Inflicting violence on others is literally inflicting violence on yourself, where violence is very broadly interpreted as not only physical violence, but also emotional violence and, at least for a faction, change in general. It isn't that magicals couldn't invent agriculture, but that the resulting 'violence' to the web of being is intolerable. Overpopulation doesn't occur in the first place because the community can perceive the violence it would entail (e.g. agriculture).

Mundanes are blind, but this enables them to commit violence without perceiving the harm they do to themselves - they are like fire consuming its own fuel, inevitably leading to its own doom, but overwhelming in the meantime. The magicals discuss controlling the blind mundanes so they don't do so much damage, but the mundanes are no less strands in the web of being and control is a form of violence. As always, the debates are endless and the action plans have timescales in the order of millennia. As a twist, have the mundanes be a secret weapons program of an anti-stasis faction. The faction protects the mundanes from magical politics and is able to use them to inflict violence on their (pro-stasis) political enemies mostly by reason of their existence.

*** it's a good idea that could be written brilliantly, but not by me; one of the tropes I hate most in some of the HP fanfics I read is the whole 'wizards aren't only behind both the world wars, but also, somehow, all the scientific advancements of the last two centuries', that usually goes along with 'all the great ancient philosophers were wizards, as well as all the folk heroes, and the gods, etc...'. It portrays muggles as lacking a fundamental self-agency that makes one question if Draco Malfoy wasn't right all along; if all the greatest 'muggles' are actually wizards, then what do muggles really offer the world?

My main point for doing this is that I want to craft a fantasy world that muggles have a place in. A world where, conceivably, they can actually hold their own and, throw hard, hard work, maybe even thrive. A world where they have their own agency, and make their own decisions and can have a positive impact on the universe.

The idea is good, but it feels like a case of magicals being 'better' than mundanes. The mundane's blindness isn't really an advantage if it's eventually going to lead to their doom, and the magicals are actually right in their desire to control them.

Thanks for offering an idea though :)

*** Rather than magical immunity, an idea I've often had is this; science and technology is actually muggle magic.

Magic is all about warping reality; that's the basis of spells. Muggles are always casting a rather simple, but powerful spell, that sorts the universe into the shape we know it to be. The universe is actually a wild place, akin to something out of an animist religion, where everything was a will. Smartphones don't work in Hogwarts, not because magic interferes with it, but rather because if there isn't a muggle nearby the electrons simply do what they want rather than conform to the expectations needed for high technology to function. Muggles would think we 'discover' new laws of nature, but rather this would be 'powerful' muggles or groups of muggles imposing new laws on nature. Science would make sense, because muggles would have to come to some kind of minimum 'consensus' for the law to take affect, and therefore laws that make some kind of intuitive sense would dominate.

A prehistoric wizard throwing a spear would have to worry about how the wind felt about him, his karma, whether or not his pray was in any way 'blessed' or something like that. A prehistoric muggle throwing a spear would only have to worry about wind resistance, weight, and how well he could throw.

And so it wouldn't be that magical races can do everything muggles can do, and have magic on top of that, but rather that they can't do everything muggles can do and so have to use magic.

A story like HPMOR would be about Harry learning that the tradeoff for being a wizard is that he can't make scientific investigations into the world/magic, as the world only 'behaves' when muggles are looking at it. The reason magic is declining could be something as nonsensical as 'the universe doesn't really like wizards that much right now', or anything else, and the reason the Founders so much stronger as simple as 'the Earth liked them better'. Becoming a greater wizard would be less about trying to munchkin spells and less about figuring out how to seduce Nature so that, if you were throwing a spear, the wind would always help you out.

Any thoughts? I just think that this idea would be a bit more boring to write from a muggle perspective, then some of the things I've written in my comment replies below.

They should be able to. Rather than adding artificial handicaps you can raise the stakes. If anyone has a handicap it should be the humans /until/ they discover or are able to use their ability, and not later in the story, but as quickly as possible after the story starts.

***** Ah, but I'm not entirely sure I fully understand your objections. Why would muggle become meaningless? It would just go from meaning 'can't do magic', to having their own magic. From a muggle point of view nothing would have changed; individual muggles would still just be muggles, as vulnerable to everything else in the world as they always were; it would just give a reason for large groups of muggles to have managed to survive. That's even the reason I feel like that is my weakest idea; from the perspective of an individual, nothing really changes, and so it would be boring to write.

And the thing is, this entire post is about adding handicaps, because without adding handicaps I can't figure out how to explain how muggles existed long enough to 'find their ability', whatever it would be. But enough on this topic, because this whole technology is magic thing is not the kind of idea I wanted to discuss in this thread and I really shouldn't have brought it up.

I've brought up a few better ideas in my comment replies, and would be very glad if you read a few of those; I understand that real people don't have their strengths balanced like in rock, paper and scissors, but the thing is that different species are kind of balanced in that way. If one kind of deer is actually just straight-up better than a different kind, than over time the inferior deer will just go extinct or be absorbed. So, in my world where the different magical beings really are different species, not just different cultures, I need to come up with a way to balance muggles. And if I buff them too much then, as you said, the word 'muggle' would become meaningless. And so instead I have to nerf magical beings in a way that lets them retain their classic flavors, and still keep them interesting and enticing; I don't want to risk turning them from different!muggles into worse!muggles.

Naturally the balance shouldn't be as clear cut as Rock, Paper and Scissors; I still want my muggle characters to struggle. But I need there to be a reason they have a chance in the first place that isn't just numbers; because if they really were as straight inferior as they tend to be written they wouldn't have a numbers advantage in the first place.

My other comment replies go in depth on the kind of differences I'm looking for; qualitative differences in mental faculties (usually made up for by magic) that leave magical beings with 'holes' in their thinking that muggles can take advantage of, but don't make magical beings just look 'stupid' or 'dumb'. The difference between being tricked because you're too foolish to know the difference between an apple and an orange, and being tricked because you're blind and your opponent can see.

********* I don't want humans to be magical. That's the thing. I do not want muggles to be magical, as that would take away from them being muggles. My earlier idea, the whole science/technology thing that I shouldn't have brought up and no longer want to talk about because I think the other ideas I've seen/brought up in different places in this comment section are more interesting, was a way to give muggles magic without individual muggles actually feeling like they had power, which is foolish and hard to write and that's why I don't want to talk about it anymore.

So I don't want muggles to be magical, but I do want them to have advantages. And since I can't buff them by giving them magic, it does mean I have to nerf everyone else. I know you don't have to, and asking this of a stranger could be pretty annoying, but please read a few of my other posts in this comment section for a clearer view of what I'm trying to do.

Essentially it boils down to this; in a lot of the old stories I like, the human hero wins not because he's stronger, or faster, or better than the clearly more powerful magic opponent, but because he manages to trick them. And I want to preserve that feel in the story I intend to write; that a human (and human societies) can scrape by, and even manage to thrive in some rare cases, by being clever. Not by being magical, because they're muggles and I want them to stay muggles, but by being clever.

And in order to write that without making every other race idiots/dumb, I've decided instead to add 'holes' in their thinking. Which makes some sense to me because our brains are something that evolved slowly, and over time; magic is such a powerful advantage developing magic could slow down the evolution of other traits.

So in my story, just as magical beings can exploit muggles lack of magic to win, humans can exploit these holes to survive; I wanted this thread to be a brain storm of what those 'holes' could be, and people have already come up with/inspired some ideas I think are pretty good.

I don't want muggles to be magic; I want them to be able to survive without magic. And in order to do that I looked to a bunch of fairy tales, where the only way the protagonist wins is by trickery. And the only way I see to write humans being able to consistently win via trickery and guile (without the other races being idiots) is for there to be certain things human minds can do, that certain races just can't imitate; just like how no matter how hard a muggle waves a wand, they can't cast a spell.

Also I don't see how handing out 'boons' is any different from handing out 'handicaps'; to me they both make the same amount of 'sense' story-wise.

I agreed with you; the first idea I posed to you isn't even one I particularly like or want to write (like I said earlier, in the my reply before this one).

I don't know what to say either, because I keep saying I want to ignore 'muggle magic', and I keep trying to change the topic to what I actually want to talk about, and you keep fixating on something I have clearly said I want to stop talking about.

And I don't want a story about people fighting various handicapped people; I just started using the word 'handicap' because you wrote it first and I thought it might help us understand each other better. I don't want magicals to be handicapped, in the common understanding of the word. I want them to be different; I want their mental experience of the world to be quantitatively different from muggles in an important way, and I've been having success brainstorming ideas for that in other places in this comment section.

So can we please stop talking about muggle magic, because this is the third time I've tried to change the topic, and actually brainstorm what I wanted to all along?

In the essence, while I did start of with the whole 'science and technology' idea, I have since tried to move the topic away from 'muggle magic'. This is another attempt to do that; I do not want to discuss how muggles might become magical to fight magical threats. I want to discuss what mental abilities muggles have right now that, if made uniquely muggle in a setting, would give them a fighting chance against magical threats. That is the purest form I can put my idea in right now. I'm sorry if I misled you with that whole 'muggle magic' thing earlier, but it is not the point of this post at all and, like I said earlier, I shouldn't have mentioned it at all.

And I understand if that is not something you find particularly interesting, but in that case simply do not reply. And I feel the need to repeat this at the end because I feel it needs to be said. I don't want a story about people fighting various handicapped people. I just don't want to write a story were magical beings are basically muggles, but better, because I simply don't see any reasons for muggles to exist in such a world.

************ One of your fundamental assumptions is that muggles and wizards are separate races and that 100% wizard is a potential state. On the other hand, in Harry Potter we see hints that wizards can have non magical offspring and muggles can have magical offspring. Maybe magic is not wholly racial or genetic. Only a subset of humans in any culture may have magical potential regardless of parentage. If all the muggles were to be wiped out the wizards would find many squibs being born. If the wizards self annihilated many natural wizards would be born. Eventually a situation could arise where it is discovered that muggles too have some special talent because they can never go extinct.

To add to this, maybe the advantage of muggles is that they are more customizable than natural magicians, who are already woven into reality in a certain way. Maybe muggles can undergo augmentation via cybernetics, AI, ritual, divine blessing, fey deal, or other mechanic that a wizard cannot without some expensive way of cutting themselves off from magic.

But the 'inability to lie' it something I've been mulling over in my head for a while, trying to figure out how to make it work the way I want to. I want these mental differences to be qualitative. I don't want to make it so that the Fae are basically normal people plus magic powers, but when they try to lie they can't. I want to make it so that the Fae mind works in such a way that crafting a lie is almost completely impossible, as inconceivable to them as imagining a new color is to us.

And I'm having a hard time coming up with a way to do that, that bases the reason in a mental faculty. The only interesting reason I can come up is this; according to some youtube video I watched once, lying involves holding both the truth and the lie in your head, and keeping track of both without getting mixed up.

So maybe Fae minds are easily corrupted by imagination, so that if they tried to lie, the risked overwriting the truth with the lie in their own heads? It would explain why their culture is so whimsical, and rooted in the arts and performance; a Fae person picturing a dragon actually sees the dragon flying in the air around them, and actually hears whatever background music they came up with to accompany it; they'd perceive it as clearly as they would a real physical object.

Muggles evolved the stark difference between imagination and reality to keep us safe, but the Fae can just use magic for that so they never had to.

And so it would be that lying is actually very dangerous to Fae, as they would imperil their own memories, overwriting what actually happened with what they say happened. Exposing a lying Fae would be as simple as probing for details, and then you could just insert your own details into the story, confusing them until they believe whatever you say happened. The Fae sticking so strongly to the truth would be less about being magically compelled to be honest, and more about protecting themselves from being bamboozled; it would be similar to how muggle memories are fluid (experiments on eyewitnesses show how changeable memory can be), but way easier for non-Fae to take advantage of, if a Fae dared to start lying.

And it would also be why changelings are capable of so easily blending in; tell a Fae that it's a four year old named 'Dennis' enough times, and tell it stories about being Dennis, and remind it of days out Dennis went on with you, and eventually the Fae will believe it (never mind if it's really a 20 year old named BlueLeaf or something) much more readily than a muggle would.

Any other ideas? I couldn't think of a way to make lying actually impossible to a truly intelligent, sentient mind, but two heads are better than one! :)

I sort of want to say that maybe you can take the next step, and Fae lies have the risk of becoming actually true, but in unpredictable, dangerous ways. That's getting a bit beyond the realm of purely mental effects though.

Getting back to the original point, I think this sort of deficit would also come up in argument; a Fae can't readily be the devil's advocate for fear of accidentally becoming the devil. To even argue something hypothetically, a Fae must actually believe their own words. This could logically be extended to Fae often being surprised by other sides of an argument in ways a mortal might not be. The contradictory nature of human argument might leave Fae often bamboozled diplomatically, since the true intentions of a human can be so difficult to follow and their goals are often unclear.

You can't evaluate a plan very deeply if the moment you start thinking, "If I do X, then she'll do Y, which means I'd have to do Z...", your perception gets overridden and you start to believe that X, Y, and Z are /actually/ happening.

From the point of view of other races, humans would have an incredibly ability to predict future events.

I already had the idea that elves simply have incredibly impaired empathy, and so their societies are plagued by large amounts of 'cheaters' that make it very hard for them to function; society is based on trust, and elves simply wouldn't be able to trust each other outside of small family based groups.

**** Make magic flow between elves, and not losslessly. Two elves standing or living near each other would, eventually (and if no other action was taken), drain each other of magic over time.

So a solitary elf has the most magic. Elven families would be deliberately giving up part of their magic for the advantages of a group, or at least making it harder to maintain a high magic level. Even with an ability to hold off the drain with an effort of will, allowing meetings and so forth over the course of hours or even days, an elf can't stay awake and mentally alert forever; they'd have to retire and recharge, and for longer depending on how long they'd been in the company of others. A society of elves would thus naturally tend to be somewhat distant, standoffish but polite (because they needed to be able to get along with each other during the times they /did/ interact, without being able to maintain/reinforce those social links every day), and efforts which required multiple elves to work on something or collaborate in any way would take longer to achieve.

Individual arts, skills, and talents would be far more prominent; painting, sculpture, carving, weaving, swordsmithing and armor-making and horse-caring and poetry and mapmaking and so forth. But you'd see far less evidence of /group/work, including things like industry, elves hiring other elves for grunt work, elven businesses which were larger than sole traders (and the occasional very rare family business).

** I find this explanation of humans in star trek pretty fun and interesting, [[https://imgur.com/gallery/qSmHy]], tldr other races see Doc Brown as the prototypical human. To carry over that to a fantasy setting you could have humans be really risk taking due to their much lower life expectancy and higher birth rates or something like that. This could lead to things like 1) other races avoid cooperating with humans since the death rate in all human plans are way too high for any elf involved 2) Human protagonists outsmarting people from other races since they are better at exploring riskier plans that wouldn't occur to other races 3) Other races struggling to negotiate with humans since they can't understand how humans possibly could value their lives/family/home etc when they always act so carelessly. Human society could also be marked by extreme progress and equally extreme variance. A society where all mages make crazy inventions that are extremely risky and completely goes against the common understanding of magic. This causes a near constant amount of huge explosions, magical pandemics and other threats that also put the older races at risk. But every once in a while they find something that works and they are approaching the level of sophistry that the ancient experts from the older races have developed over the centuries. This risk taking could also mean that even muggle humans have spells cast on them for increased strength and similar. But if you want most humans to be complete muggles then maybe it could just be the case that there have been so many self experimenting humans in history that a muggle can bluff that hes super strong or that he has a self-destruct button and no one dares to call them on it.

In the time the books were set, Hogwarts as an institution was nearly exactly one thousand years old. (/Very/) rough estimates of European population around that are about 50 million, with about 740-750 million today. Even assuming various plagues and wars affected the Wizarding World as much as muggles, Hogwarts back then would have had one-fifteenth of its current capacity. Rowling's said there are around a thousand students at Hogwarts, with fans running the math saying maybe a third of that. So that would put Hogwarts-at-founding with perhaps 20-60 students (again, very roughly). Has it been upgraded over the years, or does it have some kind of standing spell similar to the Room of Requirement, which automatically increases its volumes, grounds, and other facilities as the need arises?

*** I like this, but kind of want ways to narrow this down to 'faculties', rather than something like 'rationality', which is less of a basic mental ability and more of an application of your mental abilities (or at least that's how I understand it).

For example, if I were going for emotional resolve, I would make it less 'humans are more courageous than wizards', and more 'wizards are completely incapable of regulating their emotions'.

So calm, collected wizards are naturally capable of taking full advantage of their magic and dominating stuff (the Dumbledores), but wizarding society is plagued by things like dramatic Dark Lords and dangerous spell accidents because wizards can't will themselves to be calm. They can't take three breaths and calm down, but instead have to let their fear or anger or curiosity play out fully to get rid of it. And this would make them vulnerable to things like taunting or intimidation in a way muggles aren't, and make their groups less effective, because once a wizard's lost their cool, that's it. Wizard armies cannot rally once their ranks are broken, and tons of wizards die during puberty due to the upsurge in emotion mixing badly with the growth of their powers.

And so the differences between muggles and wizards would be due a qualitative difference in experience (the ability to properly regulate emotion vs. the inability to do so), rather than quantitative (humans are more courageous than magical beings). And it would be interesting and easy to write was well; it's a lot easier to show someone steeling their resolve, or fighting their fear in a nice, obvious to the audience way, than it is to show muggles being more courageous without making wizards look like complete cowards.

I feel like there's a certain amount of inherent tension here - on the one hand wanting the magical races to not be /too similar/ to the muggles (i.e. not just have some naff shared character trait or cultural quirk as the sole differentiator) but also wanting them to not be /too different/.

Threading that needle is /always/ going to be difficult, regardless of what difference you pick on - might need to just embrace the xenofiction. Although of course that is difficult in a different way.

** I'm generally not a fan of different humanoid races evolving in tandem. Maybe it's just because of the experience on planet Earth, but the whole evolution thing doesn't seem to like it much.

Another couple of unique muggle traits could be ambition and creativity. Do the whole elves never change thing, and Dwarven reproduction is basically they spend their entire lives working on a single original work (their kid) and that's the sum total of their creativity. So humans do all the inventing, art, science, etc. Even better would be just using a single alternate race with these qualities - probably dwarves would work best, but they don't have to look like dwarves (mole people, maybe)

These aren't original ideas (though taking them to the extreme could be more novel), but they're ways to distinguish humans other than population.

If there's actual magic though, and the people that evolved with magic are on the same continent as people without magic, I find it hard to believe that the people without magic would survive (there's a natural competition for resources) long enough for ethics to really come into being enough to prevent genocide. Unless the drawback to magic is huge without being crippling enough that the muggles end up killing the magicians.

*** Ah but that's the thing; I don't want it to be something like 'ambition' that sets muggles apart, though 'creativity' is somewhat closer to the mark. I want it to be something more basic, something more essential, that muggles could exploit to gain a foothold in the land.

A lot of the old fairy and folk tales I know hinge on the protagonist tricking their magical foe, not on brute strength, and that was something I wanted to maintain without making magicals all idiots/fools. Instead I'm planning on inserting 'holes' in their thinking, that muggles could exploit in order to survive.

For example, if I wanted it to be that muggles advance faster, I wouldn't do it by giving muggles something as nebulous as 'ambition', because then it would be hard to write elf characters in a way that made them seem truly different, not just unambitious muggles.

Instead I would make it so that elves posses no intuition. Their conscious experience is, somehow, the sum total of their mental processing. They never have 'aha!' or 'eureka!' moments, and they never just 'get' a topic; instead they have to laboriously link ideas together every single time. An elf is never just 'good' at something, the way a human can just be talented at maths, or art, but instead must work for every single skill they have. This would be slightly mitigated by their long lives, and explain parts of their culture. Elf society is so striated because, without such a thing as talent, the elves higher up really are better than their peers in every way; the elf capable of becoming the best mathematician is also likely to be the best biologist and the best chemist and the best painter etc... because they have infinite time to learn and only one skill that matters; how well they manually link ideas.

So a human watching an elves would be in awe of their long lives and elegant aristocracy. And an elf watching humans would marvel at how fast humans can learn, how quickly ideas can come to them and how, inexplicably, they just appear to be 'good' at things, where an elf would always, always start at rock bottom. And so the envy would work both ways.

And that's why it can't be something as nebulous as creativity, and why I choose the language instinct as an example. Wizards lacking a language instinct wouldn't mean they are any less intelligent than muggles, or less creative, or anything. It just means that, in some fundamental ways, the two minds work differently, in that if you put a group of 'blank slate' muggle children together they would quickly and almost effortlessly invent a complex, grammatically rich language, while a similar group of wizard children (despite being just as clever in every other way) would have to consciously and laboriously construct a language, and then teach it manually to their kids (who wouldn't just 'pick it up' like muggle children would).

**** I get what you're saying about vagueness, but I think creativity is less vague than it is broad. I was using it to mean all original thought, basically saying that they get 1 original thought per lifetime, and it manifests in their offspring, and maybe they can learn from others of their species. Potentially all of their thought is tied into their magic, similar to how the fae in, for example, a practical guide to evil, are living stories.

So like, the first ever magical spell of the first ever sentient being (perhaps it was magic incarnate) was the spell to create offspring, and then the offspring found they could also create food, and then maybe one of them learned how to create multiple offspring and that's how it became a race instead of a single entity that just sorta reincarnates (i think you could probably skip straight to creating multiple offspring, in retrospect), but all the new generation are a fraction as powerful as the original. and then one of the new generation did it again and /that/ created muggles, with the magic too diffused to be even usable, but that generation gained the creativity trait, but none of the "elves" ever did the multi-offspring or creativity thing again because it became idk taboo or something

Not saying that it's /unlikely/ humans would wipe them out, just that it's not implausible that they'd still be around.

There's another way to look at it, which is that dwarves or elves or whatever are actually way more powerful than humans, but for various reasons don't bother to wipe humans out. Humans could be to elves what rats are to humans--exterminate it if you see it, but not think about them too often. If elves and dwarves are sufficiently powerful, it the human psychological and ecological profile matters a lot less. You just have to say that this hypothetical pyschological or ecological profile, that you get to make up, doesn't dispose the more evolutionary fit or long-lived species to wipe out humans. This take isn't even a massive departure from many fantasy novels, in, say, the /Prince of Nothing/ series the elf-analogues basically just keep humans as pets and it's only through a bad science experiment that they wind up declining as a species.

** Well, the standard option is usually something like empathy or goodwill, resulting in the magic race failing to form civilizations. Or mental corruption from magical knowledge causing them to go insane or die. Or emotional corruption like Orange Lanterns.

A rarer option is some kind of sensory failure. For example, you could make mages have permanent mage sight, so they always see the world based on how much magic an object radiates rather than how much light it does. That way they are effectively blind to mundane non-magical objects, and can be taken down by sneaky muggle rogues. Or constant communication with the spirit world so they can't hear well over the voices of the spirits.

Some of my own ideas:

- *Sleep*: You can make the mages require way more sleep than normal humans, like weeks of sleep for each day of activity. So even if they have the same lifespan as muggles, the amount of time they can be active during their lives is much less.
- *Facial Recognition*: Do you know how hard facial recognition is? Programming a computer to recognize a specific person's face is ridiculously hard, we only manage it because there's "software" instincts in our brains that automatically recognize faces for us. You could take away this software from mages, so they can't distinguish between two people with similar body shapes. They can still form societies, but they would have a lot of trouble with individual identities.
- *Limited Memory Space*: Give mages a limited amount of memory space, as most of that space is filled up with spell components needed to cast their magics. So mages have to frequently use memory magic to choose which of their memories to keep and which to delete. They would be able to remember important information like their names and properties and contracts, so they would be able to form functioning societies. But otherwise they would behave a lot like amnesiacs, forgetting strangers, forgetting minor things they recently did, forgetting various details about their friends, etc.

** The easiest fix is probably to take the muggle/wizard divide further. "Muggles" can't do magic because they are immune to it or at least are highly resistant. A mage might be able to cast a spell that hurts them by heating up the air or by speeding an arrow on its way, or other circuitous means, but a "magic missile" or a healing spell would bounce off with no effect. Now, all of a sudden it has gone from a complete disadvantage to a situational advantage, but one that leaves your muggle characters unable to seek magical healing directly, leaving them with consequences. This is a fairly common trope applied on the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer][individual level]] at least.

Another approach to keep visibility low might be to incur some sort of karmic debt to everyone you introduce to the magical world. Now everyone could do or know magic, but you are responsible at some fundamental level for either the well-being or actions of everyone you introduce to the system. This requires an annoyingly global system of right/wrong or management though and some sort of control to prevent one person from damning themselves by introducing everybody to magic.

To directly answer your question, if you feel the need to tilt the scales further against the wizarding population, you can always bias their experimental results with their expectations, cause technology to start to fritz out as a result, and you largely rob the magical world of the scientific method -- except for maybe a handful of monks who train to remove their internal biases, hello [[/r/rational]]. This then justifies the more classic wizard vibe in the modern world. This has already been explored pretty effectively in the Dresden Files and the like, though.

** I find it interesting that you immediately thought elves were smarter.

Have you ever actually read something where this is proven? as in, Elves are the ones who push forward science? elves are the ones that are glib talkers who will outsmart you in every deal?

Elves... live in tree houses in the forest.

As far popular depictions of Elves go, they're always wise. Never smart.

*** I got the depiction of smarter elves from Eragon, and it is the main reason I stopped reading the series.

The elves in Eragon are just straight up... better, then all the other races. They're clearly the author's 'favorite child', so to speak. Immortal, scientific atheists whose cultures explores magic in a kind of experimental way (and therefore they are the best at magic, which really is an analog to science in the series).

Even in mental combat they have the advantage; I finished the series a while ago, but I don't think I ever saw an elf depicted as being anything less than an expert in mental combat (which in Eragon is based on things like focus and willpower, so apparently elves beat humans there as well).

And their minds are shown to be special as well; whenever Eragon touches the mind of elf he remarks on how strange and beautiful they are compared to human minds.

So to be honest, the groundwork for my drive to find a way to make muggles 'special', comes from reading a passage in one of the Eragon books where an asshole elf rants about how dumb/inferior 'humans' are, and realizing that, in the context of the book, the elf was kind of right. The elves were longer-lived, faster, stronger, smarter, better at magic and better at telepathy. In Eragon, humans really did have nothing to offer the world, that the other races didn't do better.

In these asian fantasy novels I am reading the sword-arts and potion/alchemy recepies are secrets that are kept in certain states/sects/schools maybe muggles are more prone to share knowledge and thus learn faster?

** Perhaps ambition and innovation? The magical races believe they're great as they are and do not try to change or surpass their limitations. Sorta like those big ainchet civilizations towards the end where they're so confident in their superiority that they resist even the basic change nessesary to remain competitive and end up being concured. So cultural limitations, bogged down by centuries of tradition that they refuse to refine and improuve. Like dragons for exsample, they could make armor and fortifications but they don't. They're smart enough but they're so confident in their innate superiority and still continue to look down on armor even though that opinion was formed long ago when there was just copper sheets and leather but has not changed with steel and heat resistant gels and ceramics. They don't take the time to question themselves and thus don't notice that their tactics are now mearly mindless repitition of manuvers that in different times and surcomstances were once brilliantly insightful but are now tiredly predictable and never notice how outside their own heads they are starting to be regarded less as the terrors of the skys and now more as pests.

*** Ah but that's the thing; that would be less like actually different races, and more like just different cultures. I posted a reply above about what I'm trying to get at, so read that if you want, but I'll give another example here and try to be a lot clearer.

I want the differences between the races to not just be simple cultural variations, but qualitative differences in mental experience. Each race has magic and, as a trade-off, a certain mental quality they simply do not have; muggles, having no magic, would posses the full range of mental abilities, and would have somehow used that to continue surviving in a world of magic. What I'm trying to do here is get help brainstorming what those mental abilities should be, and I think a better example than the language instinct I used above, is aphantasia.

Aphantasia is a condition in humans where, for some currently inexplicable reason, the people affected are incapable of forming mental imagery. Take a moment and close your eyes. Picture a tiger. You can actually 'see' the tiger right? It's nowhere near the same as normal vision, but you can 'see' it in your mind, stalking through the grass. You can picture it's orange fur and strips and the way it might move, etc...

A person with aphantasia is completely incapable of that. They can hold the idea of a tiger in their head, and they can describe it perfectly well (because they are still perfectly clever and witty and everything else), but they simply cannot form that picture in their head. Their mind has no 'eye', so to speak; the difference between their mind and a normal person's isn't quantitative (e.g a lower or higher IQ), but qualitative (Mental Imagery vs. No Mental Imagery).

So in order to make it so that the civilization of a certain magical being doesn't progress, I would have to somehow root that in an actual, concrete mental faculty that would also make them interesting to write. Take Dragons, for example. Another long-lived species that doesn't seem to change much; if I wanted them to never adapt, I would probably alter something in their memory. I'd probably give them a weird memory condition, where experiences actually grow less and less clear as a dragon goes older. It would be almost the inverse of human memory; the memories formed when a dragon is young are crisp and perfect and clear for it's entire lifetime, but as they get older the new memories they form get weaker and weaker (similar to how we find that days get quicker and quicker as we get older, dragons would find that days also get a lot harder to hold onto).

And this would explain how old dragons can sleep for thousands of years; it's easy to not get bored lazing around if each day feels like the first. And it would also explain why they don't adapt; the world that existed when they were young feels far more 'real' to them than the modern one; in order to adapt they would have to make a real, concentrated effort to first notice the change, and then actually retain that new memory as they adapted.

And so I would root the differences between dragons and muggles not in culture, but in the mind (in this case memory), and so give muggles a way to survive dragons. If dragon attacks got to severe, all a muggle village had to do was move. The dragon would keep returning to where they used to live and, due to the long time it would take a dragon to update it's map of the world, give the muggles enough time to settle somewhere it hopefully couldn't find them again. And if muggles invented some kind of awesome dragon killing weapon that hurt any dragon that came too close? Dragons wouldn't all start simply bombarding muggle settlements from long range, not because they weren't smart or sentient, but because, after each battle, the memory would fade, and so they simply wouldn't remember the weapon clearly when they came back.

And this would even fit into the idea of dragons as ancient keepers of knowledge and wisdom. Teach a dragon a something when it's young, and it will always remember it, not matter how old it gets.

**** I see your point, I do think you should consider mental diffrinces being in how cultures work for diffrent races, dragons for exsample could be solitary by nature, social in the same way that cats are, with no intrest in copereration or teaching beyond what surcomstances make prudent. So each dragon needs to start pretty much from scratch and while they may be individualy a force to be reconed with they are never more than individuals. Elves could be almost literally bound by tradition, incapable of more than incremental changes and refinements. Dwarves could have the opposite problem we do, instead of being easily lead they could be overly willfull, unwilling to overlook even slight flaws in a plan, arrangement or device resulting in dwarven society being in an almost constant state or revolution, dwarven society and machinery could be nigh flawless but spend more time being fiddled with than being used.

Also don't underestimate how deep culture goes, without a culture humans would just be planes apes, if you look through history you can find facinatingly diverse cultures, facinatingly ailen. Ever hear of "feral children"? Babies that were actually raised by animals, they turn out facinatingly weird.

** One thing I've rarely seen explored is that if wizards are common then being a muggle doesn't matter much. There's jobs that require magic and jobs that do not. If you're the only one who can do magic, then you corner the market on all the jobs that require magic and you can make an absurd sum of money. But if you're the only one who can't do magic, then you can still do all the jobs that don't need magic just as well as anyone else. And it's not like those are all terrible bottom-of-the-barrel jobs. You can be a CEO or a lawyer or a banker or tons of other things.

Also, there's the idea that muggles have better science, but that's pretty old hat.

** Just random ideas

Low resilience. Magicals heal wounds slower, and heal spells is hard, time consuming or something like that. They can get tired quicker. They need to sleep much more.

Lack of simultaneous attention. Since magic requires extreme attention on a single thing, they can't adapt faster in two on one combat. I Don't think it will work on itself, maybe in combination with something.

Need in specific environment. So muggles can live in mana-poor land where magicals will just die in a matter of seconds. Ultimately, they will make mana SCUBA, but not in a stone age.

Impaired cooperation skills. Excessive self-sustainability means no need to really propagate and amplify knowledge like our society does.

Using magic is harmful and emergency only. Combined with low resilience it takes away much of strategical advantages.

** For something a bit different, I like the idea of "little magic" as described by this tumblr post: [[https://imgur.com/EVfY3eF]]

In the story I'm writing, the muggle-wizard divide is not a bright line as it is in Harry Potter: /every single human/ has something magic about them, and they range a spectrum: someone might have an uncanny ability to never burn popcorn (everyone has something at least that powerful), another with the right training can shoot fireballs (one in a billion). And all the shades in between (e.g. visions of the future: maybe one in a million).

It doesn't fill your stated purpose of giving humans an advantage, unfortunately, but I really like the concept. It does mean, I suppose, that enough of the weaker magicians can have an impact if they know what their powers are (next saturday munchkinry thread: "how do you munchkin the ability to never burn microwave popcorn?"), which is "power of numbers" which is exactly what you wanted to avoid.

--------------

to maybe better answer your question, I remember starting an audiobook on the now-defunct "podiobooks" site, and they had a story called "hospital earth". I don't remember the actual plot, but the premise was interesting: technological progress is not uniform across species, so some species discovered FTL travel, others discovered advanced chemistry, etc. Each species excelled in one thing, and they all got together and traded. Humanity was good at medicine, hence the "hospital earth". No other creatures got as far as say, germ theory.

Perhaps give humanity something like that: full domain over medicine. Elves have some minor healing spells, say, but they can't heal appendicitis; but because of the existence of the healing spells, they never were motivated to develop medical skills.

Or choose something else - in Stargate, humanity is unique in having ballistic weapons, which are the only things that can harm the Replicators.

*** Point, but then you have to come up with a reason why the non-humans can't just go "Oh wow, you guys are really advanced in area X; we'd love to read your books and learn the scientific method and bring your hospital practices to our land and get our best and brightest trained up in your medical universities," and in one or two generations they're pretty much on par.

** Make magic like "real" magic, not fireball +4 but mystical power which can only be attained by rejecting logic and common sense. As result magical beings are not only poor in logical thinking but can barely follow cause-consequence chain and see /everything/ as magic. They don't see difference between mundane and magic, mundane ability to reason and infere looks like just another type of magic to them, different but not worse or better then other magics.

** I'm writing this from the perspective of RPG designer. Interesting equals leading to interesting, exploitable situations for PC to participate in.

I have those ideas: 1. Humanity has some kind of arcane pact with magical creatures that gives muggles an edge in certain situations (e.g. fairies can't harm a human person as long as they are very careful about what they say, eat or drink). 2. Magical creatures are a lot more rigid in their ways: i.e. no fairy can go for a simple and brutal solution where a cunning and mocking is available. Every magical creature has weakness you only have to find. 3. Humans are the only species in setting that's not united and locked in wars and alliances as a whole. That means that each individual human is weighted on their own basis instead as a part of group, which in turn means there are a lot of diplomatic opportunities open that are not available for magical creatures.

** One standard one I've seen is creativity -- elves etc simply copy culture and etc from humans and then make small modifications because that's the best they can do.

An interesting twist on that: magical beings can't eat in the human world (or have a finite magic supply and die when it's exhausted), so they need to go back to the Fae Lands for meals. Time passes faster there, so dipping in for breakfast causes you to lose a week in the human world. Unfortunately, the Fae Lands don't have reliable physics so you can't really do science there. As a result, magicals are continuously losing time compared to humans. This explains why they seem to have longer lifespans and aren't as creative -- from a human perspective magical don't have /time/ to create.

** Well, in "No Game No Life", the humans aren't especially more numerous, and their strength is basically pegged as "we got kicked around so much by the other races, we learned how to be shrewd and win by any means possible". So that's a possible answer, though not an especially interesting one.

For something a bit more fantastical - what about humans being the only one with the brain wired in such a way they have a capability to lie? Not just state an outright falsity, but fundamentally convince themselves it, and let it show through all of their body language. That'd make for an interesting dynamic.
