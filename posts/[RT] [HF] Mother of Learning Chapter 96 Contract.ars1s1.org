*** Yeah, if I had any criticism of this amazing +fanfic+ rationalist fiction it would be that the tone and speaking style (even down to the slang used) of most characters when they speak is fairly similar. It helps deliver rational dialogue however when people speak plainly, so I appreciate it for that, and maybe it's something unavoidable with rational fictions in general, but it's more noticeable here, at least for me. I still very much enjoy it though!

  Zach sent Zorian an almost imperceptible frown. He clearly didn't understand why Zorian was so certain, but didn't want to call him on it.

  Zorian didn't blame him. He had long had his suspicions, but it was only when he saw the true form of Zach's angelic contract that he became completely certain...

Nor did I get impression that the contract was somehow imprinted into the marker, and it's not like they could summon an angel to show it to them while inside the loop. So all Zach really had to go on would be the summarised version given to him in the dream, which didn't seem like something that would require a lawyer.

**** Seems reasonable.

The angel did imply it could be done, and did let slip both that the angels lack information on what happened inside the time loop, and that the time loop is similar to a black room in that both isolate the contents from the universe (something Z&Z already knew but the angel provided conformation, and if they hadn't known they would now). The missing piece is whether the mechnism that would kill Zack is built into the blessing/contract itself or is something that uses the blessing/contract as a marker and has to search creation for the marker to act on it.

​

That's enough missing information the angel didn't tell them how to evade the auto-kill, but also provided the black room trick would work, not necessarily a piece of information they need to be sure of in order to try.

***** I'd assume the kill mechanism is built-in. It might even make him attempt to commit suicide if he isn't dead after the mechanism activates, just as an extra fail-safe in case he survives it somehow. I can't imagine a black room to be the solution.

​

I think they have to either find a loophole so that the contract is technically fulfilled or make the contract/marker be inactive at the time of the deadline. I'm not sure how they would accomplish either, but just spitballing here: They could just kill Zach near the end and let him be absorbed into the giant soulbattery, then extract his soul and put it into one of Zorian's golem bodies after the deadline. This way he would be "dead" at the deadline anyway, probably voiding the contract. This is probably not an easy thing to do, but it might be possible.

​

But tbh I think the real solution (if there is one) might be simpler than that.

******* It's an interesting interpretation. It still seems like such an easy exploit and it's not like the gods didn't know about those kind of chambers when they made it. And that's assuming the contract was even made way back then, which I don't think is the case. I think the contract was made recently by the angels and only made divine by some divine artifact (as some other poster theorised) and I just can't imagine them overlooking something that simple, especially considering how the timeloop works.

Although my personal theory is that the "real world" is also a simulation just like the loop was, just slightly larger to contain the angels as well. We don't hear from the gods because the universe is in safe mode. I don't really have enough evidence to back this up, but there have been few if any other theories about where the gods are. If that's the case, there could be interference from whichever god is hosting the simulation, just as we saw in the time loop.

******** The difference is probably irrelevant physically and definitely irrelevant ethically. Sapience is a pattern, not a material, and that pattern imprinted on "virtual" atoms is still a "real" person. Whether or not they are real atoms (in which case, where did they come from and where did they go? That seems like it would take far more magic than just a simulation, but the fact that Zorian's soul escaped, and considering that a soul is made of magic, means that the whole process was somehow exothaumic and produced real magical energy from somewhere, even if it didn't directly produce matter), either way it all behaved realistically from the perspective of the people inside it.

But I don't see a utility from the gods' perspective in looping across that much time, so I doubt it's a simulation in the sense that they intend to revert it. More like they just shoved the whole universe in a pocket as long-term storage that they can bring it back out of if they want to, to observe whatever progress it's made in the mean time. Still I would expect that they're at least considering the possibility of reverting it if something particularly shitty happens (as the angel described it "scorched Earth" tactics, such as restoring a backup state).

Heh. Worth pointing out that RR doesn't reveal his identity until after Zorian says the name, and if he wore one fake face, what would stop him from wearing a second?

And unless RR reveals that Zach had already solved the invasion and knew the way out of the loop when they first interacted in the loop, how did RR get into the loop if Zach literally never knew how the loop worked? How does Zach give him a temporary marker? How does Jornak even have time to learn enough to get to the gate and meet Panaxeth? These things are a problem no matter who RR is, of course.

All that said, Zorian openly doubts it's anyone other than Jornak, and it's not really clear why RR would pretend to be someone else at this point. Maybe Zorian!RR would want to as part of some bizarre contract-avoidance scheme (he plans on occupying the body of whichever Zorian wins), but that's more a little nutty.

I suppose we'll find out when we see how this conversation ends. It would be pretty funny if this was Yet Another Fake Reveal though!

***** When you spend over half of a novel treating the villain's real identity as a central mystery to the plot, with thousands of words spent on the investigation, who it is ought to feel relevant.

The fact that things are playing out just as Zorian expected is typical of rationalist fiction, a genre that more or less has its roots in “all according to keikaku.” And, admittedly, what nobody103 does particularly well is setting up difficult problems for Zorian to solve, which is definitely the case here. As I've said elsewhere, the worst you can say about the underwhelming RR identity is that it's inelegant from a mystery standpoint, and even that's a matter of taste.

It's not rational, it's characteristic of “rationalist fiction,” a silly genre created in part by a guy who wanted to let everyone know how smart he was by writing himself as Harry-Potter-But-Really-Smart. Ideally, it involves works where you treat genre fiction or fanfiction as a serious literary exercise, especially w/r/t /telling a coherent story that is grounded in the plot's earliest chapters./

And sorry, but introducing a masked villain and unmasking the villain 80 chapters later, only to show that it was a guy we didn't even know existed until the story's third act? The only thing “rationalist” about it is how Zorian acts like he already figured it out, and personally, I'm still very much hoping he's proven wrong.

******** It is rational in the sense that there is no reason why dramatically satisfying answers are more likely to be correct.

You having unresolved issues with a sibling does not logically make them more likely to be the mysterious person scheming to topple societies. This is the sense in which it being Jornak as opposed to Fortov (for example) is "rational". It makes perfect sense given information we have had for a long time.

I'm still hoping he's wrong too, though. It's the best when the dramatic and the logical align. But such solutions are challenging to make surprising.

The idea that someone else would've been nonsensical and illogical is bizarre, though. For one thing, prior to this chapter, there were lots of perfectly reasonable candidates; the fact that Zach knew nothing about the loop until Zorian helped him figure it out throws a big wrench in that, but it also /makes it way more confusing to figure out how Jornak got into the loop,/ so it's not like this was the more logical result.

I actually still don't know how I was supposed to figure out it was Jornak prior to this chapter, honestly, especially given that everything we thought we knew about how things worked turned out to be wrong. And that's kind of the thing: a result where you can't figure out a mystery ahead of time, based on the same information the characters have, is bad writing even according to the inane rules of “rationalist” fiction!

And changing it wouldn't require making the story worse, what is so hard to understand about this? nobody103 has controlled the /entire story./ He has had the opportunity to foreshadow Jornak since chapter 1, and the right to change the story however he likes to make it work. For example, he easily could've had Zorian discover Veyers' body and Jornak prior to Chapter 26, gone back to talk to Jornak after realizing what had happened with Zach, and then incorporated him into their plans, so that Jornak appeared alongside other characters late in the story.

But he didn't. We met Jornak a single time, discovered that he dislikes Cyoria just about as much as most of the other characters, and was otherwise wholly unremarkable. My problem isn't with the guy himself, my problem is that he wasn't actually set up in a way that makes him a satisfying culprit, and nobody103 had /literal years/ to set it up.

In your opinion 🤷‍♂️. Fair enough, you don't like it, but it certainly makes sense imo. Definitely satisfying. He's just as unremarkable as Pre-loop Zach+zorian so not sure what you expected.

Like, when I explain how nobody103 could've easily brought Jornak into the story earlier and made him a more prominent character---why does that not make sense, exactly? It's literally just adding foreshadowing and development to a character we now know to be important to the plot. And that doesn't make sense?

Seems way more likely you're just being insulting for no reason. For example, I obviously understood Jornak as a distant possibility---I even mention him by name in my own big post on the topic as an anticlimactic choice nobody103 could go with. It's just that given what we knew prior to this chapter, he was /very unlikely/ since the novel had more than implied a) someone had done very sophisticated mind magic on a relatively well-equipped Zach and b) Panaxeth can only talk to people inside the unbarred gate. The idea that the lawyer friend of a classmate he /actively dislikes/ would get an invite to check out the gate with Zach, and would be so well-trusted that he could do difficult mind magic on an archmage? It's silly.

Of course, we now just have more questions than answers. If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did Jornak get brought into it? If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did anyone get down to the gate to talk to Panaxeth? These are pretty serious roadblocks to /any/ possible culprit, and we didn't know about any of it until literally a few pages before RR's reveal. So how, exactly, was anyone supposed to figure out what had happened before this chapter? The /only clue/ the book provides is that Jornak doesn't like Cyoria for similar reasons to Zach. We never see Zach mention him again, or act friendly toward him, or give any indication of a friendship that was once great enough that he let Jornak get close enough to erase his memory and become his greatest foe?

That's what doesn't make sense to me. But like I said, it's p. clear that we have very different understandings of “sense.”

Not being insulting, but you do seem to be struggling with it a lot when it really does make sense.

Idk why you're fixated on "difficult mind magic" - zorian (and Zach) we're both scrubs Pre-loop too. Jornak was an already reasonably experienced adult mage, plus a few months of risky loop growth + Zach helping him out = rapid growth. Him being a lawyer implies he's not an idiot, too.

Plus, what you mean by relatively sophisticated mind magic? Taking a mental sledgehammer to a portion of his memories isn't that sophisticated, it was obvious something was done to him, it wasn't subtle.

Zach doesn't actively dislike Veyers tho? It was quite explicit that Zach befriended him and took him on adventures, you say you've read it 3* but you seem to be missing things like that? How else do you think he also befriended Jornak lol.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, there are no more questions. It's all explained in what we've been given.

Which ass are you pulling Zach not knowing about the loop? It clearly happened after his first loop. Zach isn't mentally handicapped you know? He knew he was looping, hence he, out of boredom, became buds with veyers. He would have worked a lot of stuff out especially with Jornak (being obviously not a dumb guy) helping out too, Jornak seemingly being just as, or more, capable than zorian who even entirely without Zach's help started getting places. So Jornak with Zach acting as a kick starter... Surely that makes sense to you?

Plus given Zach could bring Jornak into the loop, it's clear that pre-zorian and pre-mind sledgehammer, Zach worked out the 5 treasures and either had all or some of them, since he could get Jornak to loop.

He had the crown at least which isn't exactly easy to get since he could place temp markers. So it's not hard to assume he probably had other items too. And significantly more knowledge about the loop than when we first meet him in the story.

Plus it sounds like Zach REALLY liked Jornak, he likely brought things to the looping like some of the other characters where before the crown, they were given a loop primer/their research notes

#+begin_quote
  We never see Zach mention him again, or act friendly toward him, or give any indication of a friendship that was once great enough that he let Jornak get close enough to erase his memory and become his greatest foe?
#+end_quote

Because his memory was sledgehammered?? You seem to be forgetting some fairly major plot points. And there was no further friendship with Jornak because while RR was in the loop Jornak dealt with veyers (and well, was also off doing his own shit being an antagonist), then post-exit, veyers was ejected from the loop so there was no link to become friends with Jornak once veyers was dead.

"Props to you, Sir Lich, your decision to raze the church turn out to be correct. Not only the angels will involve themselves, they also already had plan to descend. As for your expectation that they just leave after disposing the primordial? That, I found, to be woefully misguided."

If Quatach Ichl was surprised to be suddenly addressed, he did not show it. The fact that he did not readily respond actually helped Zorian prepare a wedge he's about to drive in.

"Tell me, Mr Merenptah, did I need to tell the angels anything about my scheme, your scheme, and these two clowns' schemes to know what they're going to do? Nay! The angle saw through me, Mr Merenptah, right at the moment our eyes met. Not a single word I need to utter before they reached their decision. It would be wise for you to retreat right now rather than later. The moment the Primordial get released, there'll be no war breaking out for you to take advantage of."

Zorian was never a man with flair for acting, but knowing what will happen helped him let lies went through his teeth. True that Zorian had told celestial tree trunks what and what will happen from his perspective, but it didn't help him to his cause. The angels cannot bend their contract after all. However, since he knew what about to go down, that inflexibility should not help their enemies either.

*** Not sure what nobody's take on romance in this story is but I saw Raynie as the likely candidate once outside of the time loop. Just the personal connection that both Zorian and her had in regards to their family dynamics. Plus, when Zorian saw that he was becoming close to Raynie he decided he was going to stop doing so with her while he could abuse the time loop and I believe he ended the relationship while thinking that he wished he could help her situation. So I'm half-expecting some developments in regards to that though it would be kind of silly considering the impending doom hanging over their heads.

***** If some romance plot line is included, which I think probably won't be, it wouldn't really be Zorian purposely looking for it. Whether it is Raynie, Taiven, or anyone else, if he runs into them he has to treat them in regards to the relationship he wants to have with them.

This is now real life with no loops so if he is interested in someone, he can't just completely spurn any interaction with them or be a dick to them for practicality's sake since he is now playing for keeps. Not to say he will be going up to them carrying flowers but if someone approaches him and asks to meet or anything else, he will have to consider whether he wants to ruin the relationship by rejecting.

** Facts we know:

- Some parts of the contract are enforced by Zach's perceptions. If he doesn't know who is fucking with his memories, he won't go after them.
- Black rooms / time loops prevent the divine from peeking in.
- The contract, whether Zach dies or not, ends at the end of the month.

​

So here's my guess how Zorian is going to 'cheat' the contract: After they prevent the summoning (fulfilling the bits of the contract the Angels seem to 'care' about), they go down into the Black Room underneath town. Inside, they have a month of free time while a small amount of time (I think it was a day?) passes outside. Crucially, have this day span the end of the contract. Inside, Zorian erases Zach's knowledge of who knows about the time loop, his knowledge of Zorian knowing mind magic, and his memory of being tampered with.

Basically, my thinking is the trigger for the 'kill Zach' clause can only come from two sources: the Angels or Zach himself. If you block both at the same time, then the contract is done with, and once you emerge from the Black Room, Zach is fine. For extra insurance, Zorian lies to Zach and tells him that it was going into the Black Room that solved the problem, so that he doesn't even suspect that any memory altering took place.

Of course, all this depends on them actually preventing the summoning, but they were already planning for that, so the stakes are still the same.

Incidentally, the fact that the contract that Silverlake is under works even if the summoning fails (and thus she's in a different dimension that the contract holder) suggests she's also self-triggering. Maybe you could convince her to switch sides with that knowledge?

Keep in mind this's just speculation and assumption.

The key to start this discussion is from this senteces.

Ø *"It is a secret,"* the angel responded**. "There were considerable restrictions in regards to candidates. They had to begin the month in Cyoria. They needed to have a certain potential and mentality. They needed to have considerable freedom of movement and association. They needed to satisfy the ethical guidelines. And so much more. I cannot tell you the details." (MoL chapter 96)**

*Ø* *“Heavens no,"* the angel said. *"He (Zorian) fails just about every criteria, especially in regards to mentality. I am surprised he was even willing to risk his life in this manner, based on his previous actions and attitudes."(MoL chapter 96)*

So at the first restart when Zorian still not gain the Marker, he was introduced as whiny, edgy teenager who thought like world owe him big debt for every bad thing that befall upon him, worse parents, worse siblings especialy Daimen, and uncontrol empath ability that make him unstable. Zorian is smart, studious, and person with highly work ethic and spark of talent in some field of disciplines.What if He start as looper with temporary marker and retain his knowledge across restart instead got original marker from Zach ?

Now take those qualities into consoderation and imagine with me, will you ? What could happen to him and what high end feat he could be ?. I mayself imagine he will corrupted by watching people doing wrong and immoral action across restart and knowing how corrupt Nation authorities can be especialy Eldemar, and thinking it's common sense of human nature to do horrible thing just for power.

Once Zorian start wrong doing he will continue do that until he start disregard about human right just to pursue magical knowledge. Looking how Jornak end up as Red Robe and with his experience in Time Loop and set him as exemple I won't suprised if Zorian become far worse than RR as ultra extreme mind mage, full pleged Necromancer, and top blood mage as demon summoner. The reason, Zorian is a kid and kid can be influenced and change personality and prespective much faster than adult. That's end of my assumption about Bad Ending or Dark Zorian could be.

Now we start the reason why a whiny and edgy teenager Zorian end up to be moral and compassion person. I take Soul Bond, Lukav assumtion, and Shifter ritual to boost my assumption in this theory.

Ø Soul bonds were a dangerous and poorly understood branch of magic, capable of causing some pretty horrifying side effects if used recklessly. The main issue was

that one of the participants usually started to mentally and spiritually dominate the other, *making them more like themselves in mind and soul*. (Zorian monologue, page 164 MoL ebook)

Ø Your soul appears to be converting it into just another piece of itself rather than trying to keep it distinct. So there shouldn't be any major personality shifts and you probably won't get any nifty abilities from whomever or whatever it was that donated a part of their soul to you. Though, *I guess it is possible that the fragment had affected your personality to an extent* when you first got it, before your soul had the chance to assimilate it sufficiently, and such influences may linger still.(Luka Assumption, page 468 MoL ebook)

Ø Being a *shifter means you get instincts from the other part of the soul*, and magical creatures always have very strong souls. . . the more magical the creature, the stronger. And they tend to be extremely violent and territorial. With regards to grey hunters, I'm fairly certain they don't tolerate even their own kind, much less anything else.(Kael warning about becoming a shifter, page 591 MoL ebook)

Those theory make assumption that gaining other people/being soul that connected to your soul will inlfluences your personality. Zach is compassion, moral and upright standing person and in this regard the similliar character like Zach is Naruto. Zorian gain a chunk of Zach soul make him inherited that qualities like Zach, that is core reason Zarion personality become good. Time loop further enchance this qualities, in the time loop Zorian start befriend with other people like Zach, Kael, Alanic, Xvim and his other classmates, and that friendship experience make him to be Lawful Good person, with his empath ability in control make him less jerk .

***** I think it's unfair to Zorian to say he only became a good person because of the soul blending. He risked his life to save Zach's in the very first loop. He was surly sure, and he definitely had the potential to go down a bad path, but he wasn't a bad person. I think the soul bond had very little influence on his personality and it was more Zach's commentary on him that forced himself to reevaluate after he realized how others saw him.

** Welp!

I did a lot of RR theory reading when I was developing my own wrong idea; I can say pretty confidently that few people had Jornak as their first guess. I'm at least joined by many other people in being super duper wrong.

For good reason, imo. Van Dine and Knox alike would be aghast at this as the solution to a mystery---the culprit wasn't introduced until well into the second act, breaking what's probably the cardinal rule of mystery writing. MoL isn't a mystery, but those rules exist for a good reason: a story that hides the identity of a character should make that feel consequential.

Jornak just doesn't feel like a big deal. The fact that he's RR doesn't meaningfully change the stakes of the story or have an impact on the protagonists. In fact, if we had known all along that Jornak was RR (say, he didn't bother putting up his hood in Chapter 26, and Zorian recognized him when they investigated Veyers later), it wouldn't have made much of a difference to the plot.

None of which is meant as a damning critique of MoL, I should add. It's just a bit underwhelming after all the debate and consideration, it's the second person Z&Z would've investigated if Silverlake hadn't warned Jornak that they had discovered Veyers in the loop.

But now there are no mysteries, and I'm pretty sure all the outstanding issues have been addressed. All that remains to be seen is how our heroes will be victorious, and on that score, I remain very much invested and excited, especially because all the other twists this chapter (the angel! the dragon!) are so juicy. It's shaping up to be an exciting ending.

*** I think it's interesting to think about the challenges of writing a solid mystery setup-reveal in a rational story of this nature.

Zorian is very intelligent. He always makes the obvious logical leaps. Furthermore, the story is entirely from Zorian's POV. If we (the readers) have the information to deduce who RR is, then Zorian does too, and he'll probably figure it out. In this case, there were several plausible candidates (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) but without the full picture it was impossible to guess who, especially without knowing what sort of person Jornak would become when exposed to the time loop.*

What's the solution to this? How does one make a mystery in a rational story than the protagonist doesn't crack open as soon as the readers have everything they need? (As I'm trying to write my own story with smart protagonists and mystery elements, this something I have to think about.)

One solution is to make the solution solvable using Doylist reasoning and Themes. If you think about it, all the plausible solutions fell into two camps. Watsonian-reasonable answers (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) and Doylist-reasonable thematic answers (Zach simulacrum, Fortov, Daimen (he was a popular guess before he showed up in-story, I think?)). Zorian had basically no way of guessing any of those latter possibilities, especially since most of them required some apparent rule of the story to be broken (which was definitely possible, since Zorian was learning new things about the nature of the time-loop and recontextualizing things all the time) but they were still possible for the audience to guess.

(I'm sure reasonable people will disagree on the extent to which the latter type of mystery has a place in rational fic.)

Anyway, I think since it went the less-thematic route, it feels less narratively satisfying. To be fair, it /does/ work very well on the logical level. "RR has some relation to Veyers but is not Veyers, and also Veyers interacts with Zach near the beginning and would notice Jornak acting oddly" seems so obvious in retrospect that you almost feel dumb. This is a key ingredient of a great mystery reveal, yet somehow it still lacks a punch. (Although, again, some people might argue that it's rational to feel obvious and anti-climactic.) So it's not obvious what the author should have differently to give it more punch. Presumably, he was planning RR=Jornak from the beginning and he misfired in the setup, either by not anticipating the degree of importance that the fandom would place on the RR mystery, or by not making Jornak stand out enough.

(*) TBH, "The Jornak that Zorian had known was a nervous, risk-averse man [...] This was just one more proof that the time loop was capable of radically changing a person. For better or for worse." is a bit of a cop-out. A /little/ bit of foreshadowing of what sort of man Jornak could have become would be nice.

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a7vk5w/mother_of_learning_who_is_red_robe/ec63iru][2 months ago]] I felt it was more and more popular that Jornak was RR. So it's been coming for a while.. You're right that it breaks the classic rules, but plays on that trope that someone we know IS the villain. And as time went on, we learnt about Zach's inheritance, and as we learnt more about the society of Altazia... Jornak's inclusion starts making more sense. Plus, Veyers was set up from the very beginning so it was I think that counts a little!

Well, it first shows the good nature of Zach. Zach's inheritance was stolen too, but he didn't use this opportunity to destroy the city and the government. Jornak just shows you what is possible.

I dunno, I still want to know what Ibery's deal is, lol. And also the headmaster. Plus, Alanic's background. But yeah, the main issue was RR. And as ZnZ became so strong, RR was just not strong enough to matter. He needed Silverlake's information to understand how exactly he's fucked, and QI to back him up. So Jornak hasn't been the issue for a while now. It's the combination of what SL, QI, and RR will do that's the key.

So they'll have to build on what's there and I never cared for Zach to care if he lived or died as he was, at least if there was tension if due to evil zorian/zach then it'd make it interesting. I think the ending will go down with a whimper.

**** I don't really see how this is an asspull, or anything else like that. At the very worst, it's inelegant; the story made RR's identity a fairly central unanswered question, but the answer is that he's a tertiary character that only survived the first few days outside the loop because Silverlake warned him. And rather than having a more interesting motive, it's literally what Zorian figures out the first time he researched the whole “hates Cyoria” angle.

But nobody103 has always focused his work on creating an interesting fantasy world with a very complicated set of problems and following a protagonist who doggedly solves said problems. It's what makes it a hit with the “rationalist” crowd and litrpg types. Given how every step of the climax has included major setbacks and big stake-raising surprises, I'm still looking forward to the solution to all this.

** I was disappointed that the chapter ended so abruptly. It does not seem like that conversation was over, and yet I suspect the next chapter will not begin with the conversation continuing.

Zach and Zorian still need to bring up a couple points. One is to determine just how insane and/or bloodthirsty Jornak really is. Is he bluffing about triggering the wraith bombs and assassinating people around the world if Zach and Zorian continue fighting before the end of the month? If Jornak really wants to improve the world (rather than just lying to advance his selfish desires), then that much destruction does not seem reasonable. Which would prove Jornak either insane or lying about his goals. Or bluffing if he would not really do it.

Which leads to the additional point that they needed to bring up. QI and Silverlake seem to think that releasing Pan will not be such a terrible thing for the world, and they likely have influenced Jornak's views on that subject. But Zach and Zorian know that releasing Pan would result in some "scorched Earth" countermeasures which are likely to be unacceptable even by QI's standards.

Even if Zach and Zorian cannot convince them of how bad it would be, they could at least persuade them that /they/ believe it would be that bad, in fact worse than what Jornak is threatening. In which case there is little reason for them to accept Jornak's deal (unless they are very confident they can win the final battle, which I do not think they are as things currently stand). Which could at least allow them to negotiate something more in favor of Zach and Zorian.

***** Depends on the author, and depends on his mood at the time. Up to him to consider it however he wishes, really. In the past, a "ping" like this made him realize a plothole, which he then tried to correct in a later chapter. (Specifically, it was in the first restart that Z&Z interacted with Daimen, before they found the Bakora Gate. Z&Z went in a time dilation chamber, which meant that their simulacrums disappeared, and they theoretically had lost their method of travel to Koth. In a later chapter, after it was brought to his attention, the author decided to include a paragraph about how Zorian had taught Daimen the Gate spell beforehand.)

If Zorian /doesn't/ bring up that tidbit of his conversation with an angel (and I'd be surprised if RR and Quatach's agents didn't already know that they went to a temple to communicate with an angel), then I'd be curious to know why. Whatever the author does with this comment of mine is entirely up to him.

**** Good point. Zach and Zorian can argue for not one but two drawbacks to Jornak and Silverlake if Pan is released.

One is the altruistic point that the world will be basically destroyed by the countermeasures if Pan is released. This may work better on QI, maybe on Jornak (depends on whether he is lying about wanting to make the world better), probably not much for Silverlake if she thinks she can hide in a bunker and survive by herself.

Second is that the angels will be free to act if Pan is released and will almost certainly kill Jornak, Silverlake, and QI for releasing Pan or for knowing about the time loop. That, of course, puts Jornak and Silverlake in a tough spot, since they have a soul contract to die if Pan is /not/ released. But maybe they can be persuaded that their chances of survival are better if they work with Zach and Zorian to try to find a loophole in their contract.

Either way, I think QI should be the easiest to convince. Maybe the thing to do is for Zach and Zorian to approach QI alone and turn him, and then get QI to try to persuade Jornak and Silverlake.

** It seems worth pointing out that Oganj, that dragon mage Zach wasted dozens of restarts to kill way back, was said to have a group. MoL's worldbuilding material noted that dragons are highly solitary creatures, which contributes to the reasons why dragon magic is difficult to pass from dragon to dragon.

If Oganj has a group, that seems to mean one of two things: one, he's an exception who has other dragons at his beck and call, or two, he has some assortment of underlings whether animal, monster or human that serve him. None of the previous chapters alluded to either being the case, I think, but maybe Zach would know more and will explain next chapter.

The likely answer was that RR prioritized something, elsewhere. (We could say he was lazy, but, really, not really)

But what? Well, we know now. While Z&Z honed their personal skills, ignoring politics, albeit, for different reasons, RR did the opposite of that. He somewhat neglected personal growth as a mage to devote more time figuring out continental politics and what strings must be cut to start a new great war.

*** Of course Red Robe is a shitty mage. Zorian and Zach loop for years on their own, having to fight against all kinds of necromancers and monsters singlehandedly. Meanwhile Red Robe can just drag QI around with him to do the fighting and sit back until the enemy is defeated, just like how he beat up Zach during one of the early time loop parties.

But yeah, not having to train his combat skills would give him plenty of time to research ways to exploit the time loop. Still though, that's a somewhat empty threat. Red Robe only knows how to trigger a war under the controlled conditions of the time loop, and most likely without significant interference from other time loopers. Outside of the time loop with Zach and Zorian causing chaos it's entirely possible to make things go differently.

** So, new questions about this:

- In what way would the 'scorched earth' method affect the angels that they would intervene without the highest ones permissions?
- It seems that the time loop is kinda an event horizon, no information can ever escape, not even to the spiritual world. Given that, and that the cage was connected to the time loop and the real world, how would the triggers react if Px was released in the time loop? I mean, we could release it there and then destroy it/let it expire and it wouldn't affect the real world.
- If the above is possible without triggering, would other conditions analogous to Px being out of the cage (ie. mana levels dropping drastically, the Cyoria dungeon/hole disappearing) but not on the real world activate?
- "Oganj and his group" does he means other dragons?
- How the heck did Jornak figure out that Zack was under a contract if a) he didn't even know, b) it seems to require a adept divine mage to even try to pry into the contract/blessing thing, much less reading it? (btw, the angel saying the "figured it out" should ring several alarms about the abilities of Jornak)

I don't know if the Aranea will be that effective. They were wiped out by Jornak while the time loop was still in effect. Granted, they were caught by surprise, so they may be effective this time around. I'm sure Jornak has anti-divination wards as well as a mind blank spell that makes him impervious to the Aranea, as well as anybody else he casts it on. I wouldn't be surprised if he enforces a "everybody has to cast Mind Blank on himself" policy. Who knows, maybe he even has a wraith bomb planted near their nest. Wraiths don't have minds, do they?

However, I doubt that the vast majority of the invading army will have great mind protection due to Mind Blank's tendency to cause mental issues. So as long as the Aranea stay alive until the invasion, they will contribute greatly.

***** Also remember I'm not just talking Cyoria's Aranea, I'm talking all of them, or at least all of them in Eldemar, and it was heavily foreshadowed that Zorian, Daimen and the Aranea worked out a way through mind blank, so it isn't a perfect defense, and there are consequences to using Mind blank for an extended period, a month likely exceeds that safe period, so at least some of the higher ups will be vulnerable some of the time, not to mention how vulnerable QI is to a surprise attack, from a lot of mind mages, if just one of them gets a hold on him in he hopes out automatically, which would give them the crown, a significant advantage for the final battle.

On top of that Zach was restricted on the type of mind magic he could learn, if it was Zorian who was the main looper it would be absolutely crippling.

** From a purely "I want to survive the month" point of view, why would ZZ accept the terms of Jornak, and leave Team RR alone?? Someone else starting a Splinter War does not trigger any of the conditons in the contract with the angels. Also, if Team RR starts a Splinter war, the various countries would start amassing their resources towards the war, and which would make it more difficult for Team RR to work towards releasing Panaxeth, as ZZ can just go to the authorities at that point to reveal the invasion plot.

Also, if RR can start the Splinter Wars without releasing Panaxeth, and in a much easier fashion as it has been implied, QI could just use that path to satisfy his goals. QI wouldn't need to then release Panaxeth - only RR and Silverlake would need to. Starting a Splinter war would fragment Team RR.

Thus, any moves by RR to start a Splinter War will only make his position weaker (as he is less likely to be able to release Panaxeth). The only thing RR is counting on is the reluctance of ZZ to let so many people die. I love how this conversation is even more Do or Die for RR than it is for ZZ - probably why RR requested for it in the first place.

Apologies if I have forgotten any basic facts - it is early morning here :)

Zach would die if team RR survives:

#+begin_quote
  "Isn't that just a little unfair? It's obvious the situation has changed from the time I agreed to the contract... and even you admitted the way you got me to agree to it was kind of dodgy and inappropriate."

  "We cannot absolve you of fulfilling your part of the bargain,"the angel stubbornly said. "It simply is not within our power to do so. The only thing I can promise you is that if you find the way to remove or evade the contract in some fashion, we will not seek to punish you for it."
#+end_quote

They can probably avoid the terms of the contract in regards to Zorian in a few ways, but if team RR survives to the end of the month, Zach will die even if the primordial isn't released, because he has no good way of erasing their memories of the time loop like he might have with Zorian.

Actually, they just plain can't kill team RR right now. QI is a Lich, and killing his physical body merely returns his soul to his phylactery. So Zach would all but certainly die even if they managed to completely annihilate team RR before they could trigger their contingencies. Zorian would come out ahead, but it wouldn't be in character. Zach has little reason to not accept since a straight fight is his specialty, and it's the only realistic path he survives through.

RR also has the pseudo nuclear option of placing a description of the time loop in a newspaper if Zach doesn't agree.

Exactly, which is why they shouldn't accept the terms of Team RR to leave them alone. It is asking for a lot from a final fight, to kill all of Team RR.

I see what you are saying as well. That accepting Jornak's terms is the only way of ensuring there is a final fight. My thought process was that the final fight will happen one way or the other, regardless of whether they hound Team RR through the month or not.

**** Heh, same. I still don't think it's a bad theory based on the information we knew at the time; a lot of things that invalidated the Zorian!RR theory were literally learned this chapter, like the fact that Zach never knew about the time loop to begin with.

Honestly, Jornak as RR is boring to me. It's a character who wasn't introduced until long after RR left the loop and I'm not sure it was possible to figure out prior to this chapter. At the same time, it's also exactly the first person you'd check after Veyers, so not exactly the sneakiest solution, either.

That's mostly sour grapes though. At least now I can enjoy the rest of the book without distraction.

** my reaction after reading this chapter:

I AM DISSAPOINT. At least to me it seems that quite a few details are not fitting that well.

I'll have to re-read the chapter about Jornak, but the impression I had that he was a NoM (not a mage, a regular citizen). Or a substandard mage at all. I think by the time Zorian performed a mind reading on him, he was qualified enough to identify his traits/status for pre-loop.

Anyways, some random conclusions/thoughts after reading the chapter:

given enough resources/time even monkey can become archmage/mindmage/whatever. (Jornak as very bland person prior loop. If he had any decent talent, he would be most likely working as a mage already instead of being lawyer).

The Red Robe stolen from cultists can be explained, however getting crown as newbies from QI for initial temporary mark, getting QI to modify temporary market, getting access to royal vault for dagger - those details are very thin. The knowledge about SG (the artifacts, soul markers) and how they knew that QI had the crown of the king to even include others in looping - it does not seem to be that Jornak was privy of this information and Zach knew pretty much nothing besides the bars. If Zach had visited SG , he could have learned something from controller, but it is still very far fetched. (I think it was Zorian who entered SG by feeling/using soul markers, Zach was oblivious to them). A very catch-22 issue in general. I just can imagine any plausible scenario how this situation where Zach granted a temporary marker to Jornak might have happened reasonably.

There might be an explanation for QI holding his end of the deal all the time. It is part of divine blessing he has. As a whim or not, the god who placed the blessing/contract on him mandated that he never breaks any deals (or there he will die/lose the divine blessing/whatever). There might be some clause about others approaching/offering a deal (it cannot refuse a reasonable deal). E.g., if the undead vampire management asks him to be a general and they promise to take care of his subordinates or what not, he has to accept due to divine blessing (has was offered reasonable deal with reasonable compensation). So Jornak with Zach randomly asked QI to borrow a crown for 5 minutes (and provide a relevant payment - very little for such request) and QI just had to agree due to his divine contract/blessing.

It is also very likely that contract Pan had signed with SL and RR is of different nature than Zach. Zach agreed to it in the sleep and then he was shoved into SG with very little information about SG. Pan is enforcing his contract some other way (not divine magic), but it is complicated enough that SL can untangle it during the month until it expires.

#+begin_quote
  I'm guessing Veyers introduced you to Zach, and you hit it off with each other since you have both been cheated out of your inheritance and empathized with each other because of it
#+end_quote

This is the emotional core of it, I think. In Chapter 75, when Jornak was first introduced, we learn his story. He had his inheritance stolen from him and he empathized with Veyers. So, duh, Zach meets Jornak, they "hit it off" as Zorian says, because Jornak empathizes in exactly the same way. We know Zach had been talking to lawyers about what to do with his situation, so it's not unreasonable that he'd come across Jornak.

(It would be really neat to get an interlude where we see them meet, start looping together and eventually turn against each other...)

#+begin_quote
  Have you two ever tried to look into what our country has been doing these past few years?" Red Robe said, looking at Zorian. "I just wanted to figure out how to ensure justice for me and Zach at first. However, I couldn't stop myself from looking... and the more I looked, the more awful things I found. The prosperity we enjoy right now is all built atop of mountain of lies, theft, unspeakable corruption and even straight up murder. Even if I got justice for myself and Zach, it's all just a drop in the bucket.
#+end_quote

At one point, Zorian even suspects Zach as the enemy on account of Zach having reason to hate the Establishment because they stood by and did nothing while Zach was robbed by everything. Jornak is actually Zach's character foil here. Zach didn't fall like Zorian suspected, but Jornak did.

Where's the thematic part here, BTW? I can think of a half-dozen characters who could provide the whole “turns out anyone can become evil” angle better and more surprisingly---who doesn't already assume that lawyers have the capacity for evil, after all, especially one we /know/ to be involved with an evil cult? And that's all you get from Jornak; you don't get the familial struggle you'd have with Fortov, or a more dramatic reveal and interpersonal conflict you'd get with Alanic, Xvim, or Taiven. And none of those really drive home the theme like Zorian as RR would've done.

** I hoped that contract would clear something. It didn't. We still don't know it's full text, but we got some angelic summary that I assume is more or less true. I'm very confused about what is angels goal.

Implied goal is “to stop anybody but Zach to know about time loop”.

Implied method is “Zach will die, if anybody know about time loop at the end of the month”.

So, from angels perspective:

What is stopping Zach from telling everybody about time-loop on the first day of new month ?

Why is Zach self-policing on the pain of death more likely to succeed that just banning Zach from talking about time loop when he is back from it ? Or all the time ? You can argue that this would limit his options, but they don't have problem with banning mind and soul magic, a much bigger obstruction.

So, what angels goal here ? No idea. But it doesn't seem to be stated goal.

​

Additional observation (may or may not be related to above):

Angels can clearly lie (or say things that are not technically true, or be imprecise to the point that they are saying something really misleading), as :

“He cannot let anyone know about existence of the time loop or he'll die at the end of the month. “

Is not like this obligation was described before, this imply that Zach will die if anybody “knows about existence of time loop” regardless of when that occur. So Zach fate would be sealed as soon as he told about time loop to first person in the time loop. And this seems to hold true in any reasonable definition of “knows about existence of time loop” that still would kill Zach if anybody knows about time loop at the end of the month.

My prior for J=RR wasn't very high, and this chapter shifts it downwards if anything, I think you need to assign /some/ probability to Jornak not admitting it so casually after all the lengths he has gone so far.

** Thoughts:

- If ZZ accept the offer, the next chapter might timeskip to just before the final battle. Imagine a Zorian + Princess vs RR + Oganj all-out fight.
- The RR reveal doesn't feel very satisfying. RR let Zorian say who he thought he was instead of revealing his identify himself, so could just be lying, and they never verify his identity. I'd still put 10% on RR = Fortov.
- If ZZ accept the offer, couldn't RR and crew could just trigger the release before the summer festival, as the cult did in one of the restarts? I guess ZZ will know this and monitor potential ritual locations closely.
- Not telling Damien seems silly. Tons of people know about the time loop and they need all the help they can get. Either they find a way around the angelic contract that allows Zach and loop-aware-humans to survive or they don't.
- I wonder if there's a future where ZZ + RR + crew team up to beat all their contracts and the final battle is against Panxeth + the angels instead of each other. Zorian reverse engineers the angel summoning cube which is probably divine spell formula (with QI's help) and instead uses it to attack or imprison the angels.

RR had to fit a set of pretty strict criteria even before we knew about his Veyers connection. He had to be someone Zach could reasonably meet and grow to trust in the loop. He had to be connected to the Cult of the Dragon Below. He couldn't be someone Zorian would reasonably meet or else it would be obvious Zorian was an extra looper. Later it had to also be someone connected to Veyers.

** The most obvious solution to escaping the "knowledge of the time-loop" clause in Zach's contract is cleanly mind wiping Zach's awareness that other people know about the time loop, because Zorian figured it's Zach's /perception/ that matters. However, this doesn't mean that this loophole wouldn't be arbitrated by the angels, since there's also a clause that rulers cannot be killed. Also, it'd be sad to see Zach lose all his memories of interacting with Zorian throughout the time loop.

Jornak's motive reveal was a great twist (insomuch as we can trust that's the truth). The committing evil for what one perceives to be utilitarian good reminded me of Ozymandias in Watchmen. Now that it's brought up, Z&Z have always been working on a relatively small scale, from the pettiest point of personal gains to the larger resolution of the Cyoria crisis. I doubt they're the type to be swayed by optimistic evil, but I'm curious how this conflict of ideals will be settled.

Hope they've already started preparations on new plans because Silverlake is genuinely their biggest weakness. Almost all of their plans and abilities in the time loop were leaked to SL. Now RR's side has an overwhelming advantage in information, and information wins wars (assuming SL is not a triple agent and there is a chance given how inscrutable she's been). Not sure what Alanic's got for counteracting the wraith bombs, but since they knew about that plan already, that seems to be the priority as the biggest threat. Assassination of major people (rulers of nations) might be a serious danger to Zach's life. Oganj might seem like the big bad saved for last, but he's small fry in the grand scheme.

Actually no. It would be simpler to alter Zach's memories to think that all those people are dead. Then they can just show up again after the contract is over and there aren't any problems.

Here's my bet. Alanic and Xvim die. Silverlake and Jornak die. Not really sure what they do with QI, but let's say he dies as well. The only person remaining is Zorian. At the very last, something in the contract makes Zach break down and he attacks Zorian rather than just dying.

So the time loop wasn't a divine contingency, it was the Angels' attempt to stop the contingency from triggering.

At least Zach's situation looks slighty better now, since he doesn't have to go against the Angels.

I wonder how the "don't kill the ruler of any nation"/ "don't cause anarchy" rule will come into play.

So what was Zach's goal inside the time loop? Stopping invasion by itself would be poinless, since it is not real. Learning how to stop the invasion would also be impossible, because in the real world it will play out diffirently because of Demons.

** Although mind wiping Zach seems like the obvious solution, I don't think it'll Pam out like that. Initially I thought Zorian might leave some memory packets in Zack of all his memories in the time loop (plus anyone that they tell). They wouldn't even have to put them in zach's soul I guess. Then Zach just has to guide him into learning min magic with the Aracnea. Though, this could also have gotten Zorian out of the loop, so this is probably unlikely. Zorian is big b in trying to recreate things that no man can. Like a portable pslace, or a soul cage, and so on. Thus I think he's gonna find a way to copy souls. Then Zach could feasibly have a copied soul without a contract/dI vine soul cage, or Zorian and anyone that knows about the time loop could be 'copied ' souls. They would have to kill their current souls though. Then as soon as the month is iver, just put their soils right back in their bodies.

** Personally I'm sticking with "Simu!Zach is RR" since Jornak is a "mechanically feasible" but boring result. No pathos, no difference if he'd been unmasked far earlier, and his identity has zero relevance once revealed. He's just "some guy".

Everything that's happened is still consistent with the Zach theory, including his rant about how similar him and Zach are, but Zach refusing to see how they must purge the world.

Still, the Jornak thing ties up loose ends enough I won't feel like the author has dropped the ball if it's true. I'll be satisfied with the story as a whole.

But I do think it's unlikely.

**** Ah, no, I forgot about the discussion around Zach being brought into the loop through a dream contract. Yeah the Zach theory is probably dead.

The reason I was unhappy with giving it up was if RR is just Some Guy, then a lot of what looked like interesting foreshadowing and set-up just becomes...pointless? I wasn't really all that certain I'd be right, but I did expect more then...this. The stuff with Zach's Mind Blank was also resolved recently, then immediately changed from an inescapable fate to another thing on Zorian's list of problems to tick off. Like, the iterative problem solving and slice of life was fun, but seeing how the author pulled the themes together and brought us to an interesting and powerful conclusion was my primary motivation to read for years. The fact it was matching a number of Time Braid's story beats further suggested the villain would be someone relevant. But instead if it's an unknown who's motivation is "the world is rotten to the core and must be purged" and Zach's mystery is "Zorian needs to spend some time analysing a legal contract" then the story probably won't do anything like that. For me, the story has lost something from this reveal instead of gained.

I'll have some hope there's actually a pay-off to all this, because if there isn't I'd have no motivation to read any more and be sad at all the wasted narrative potential.

** I still don't believe RR is Jornak. I think there is a sleight of hand going on between Zorian and RR.

I want RR to be another Zack, or Zorian. Somehow I don't know how or which.

My main reason for thinking this is that RR could have been given the means to exit the Sovereign Gate as the person whom completed the Angel's task. So, RR is Zack, and Zorian know this from finding a loop hole in the contract.

Pulling a switcheroo between the real Jornak and RR would get RR off the memory wiping hook.

Or possibly if RR is Zack, one of them can survive.
