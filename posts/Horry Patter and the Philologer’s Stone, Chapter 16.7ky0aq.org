***** I didn't actually notice that. Good spot.

I wonder if Luna is in the same sort of position here that Hermione was in HPMOR. If I recall correctly Elizer said for that story everyone got an intelligence boost except Hermione, who didn't need one.

Here everything got a weirdness boost, except Luna so she's now on the same level as the rest of the universe. Though I'd need to see a bit more of Luna's character to be sure.

******* Luna=Deadpool confirmed.

That said, if we think this situation was caused by time travel somehow, Luna being totally normal might indicate that she's one of the time travellers. We already know large-distance time travel is possible because Horry has met a far older version of himself, so I'm thinking Luna somehow got pulled along for the ride.

That said, I've just had an insane tinfoil moment. What if this universe is the result of HJPEV successfully casting /Becomus Goddus/ and then immediately screwing everything up? Say he accidentally bumped the machine operating magic, rewriting something small but significant, and in his haste to stabilize the universe before it was too late, snapped his fingers and created The Library.

This would stabilize time for him, but leave a messy universe where everything ran on Fate. Obviously, Harry /hates/ fate, so he wants to fix it, but he didn't get to see enough of the magic machine before he changed it to know what he changed and how to change it back. His safest route is to sort of...nudge everything back into alignment over the course of numerous overlapping time loops, each person steadily becoming more like they should be over time. We're just in one of the universes after Magick has a stable set of rules, but before those rules have returned to normal.

Or maybe this is the end state. These rules do seem like they would appeal to HJPEV.

***** is the cover image of the story meant to represent a point of divergence? because i cant see at what point they could have possibly diverged. magic seems to /work differently/ in the Horry Patter universe than in canon. And yet even though they would have diverged so long ago, both branches seem to have remarkable similarities.

Maybe the reason has something to do with information travelling backwards in time as well as forwards. Actually Im not sure where that thought came from. Not sure what I was thinking.

Or wait, maybe someone figured out the secrets of time and divination, and used that to transmit any info they wanted from future to past. But the information that gets sent back is a bit garbled, so the prophecies fulfill themselves in different ways? So Horry's parents name Horry instead of Harry because they misunderstand the message sent back from the future about his name. And messages about magical discoveries get sent back in time as well, so Hogwarts ends up being much more magically advanced than it was at the time in canon.

And maybe overtime their understanding and control over time and divination advanced to the point where they could get their messages sent back through time much clearer and much less garbled.

And then when people were abusing these prophecies too much they started locking them away, making them unreadable until they actually happened.

It seems like a really big coincidence that Luna would be transported from canon to this particular everett branch.

Also, the first name Horry is an italian first name which means "timekeeper". This is certainly not a coincidence.

1. Write a story in a world that vaguely resembles J.K. Rowling's wizarding world, but with an internally consistent magickal system /and/ in which realistic (and by this I mean realistically rational and irrational) people have lived in.

2. Write an existential mystery where /something/ is wrong with the world as presented and we, along with the protagonist, will have to figure out what that /something/ is.
