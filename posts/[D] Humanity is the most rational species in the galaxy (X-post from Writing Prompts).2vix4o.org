"We got pings from /weUvCtxfeko2MnDh/. No sapients."

"Then that's all of them, right?"

"Should be."

"That's anti-climactic. So what's the total?"

"Five Eganed out, seven Strossed, twelve other stupid AI events, a couple hundred nuked themselves, a slightly smaller number ran out of resources, about twenty did both, eighty to eighty-two from pandemics depending on your definition, and three volcanoes."

"So that covers the Fermi paradox?"

"Well, here at least. The bottles more or less match up, but we haven't observed any oscillators yet. There should be at least a dozen according to the models. The /KReeYHrs535H6oPh/ descendants are already launched towards everything in the Virgo Cluster."

"Things going around in circles aren't exactly that interesting."

"That's the entire cosmos in a nutshell. Honestly, I'd be bored out of my mind if valuing 'actual' observations wasn't hard-coded in."

"Then it's all a crapshoot for Team Reality."

"If you lived through Old Earth, you realize that's always been the case."

"How often do non-solipsist cultures turn up in the bottles, anyways?"

****** Who's stupid, the character or the author?

Paul Durham has weak experimental evidence that his idea will work, and he's more than a little delusional. Stupid, but narratively acceptable.

Greg Egan was writing a story about the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. It's only stupid if the MUH is... and all right, the MUH is pretty stupid, but at least it's asking the right questions.

Now, there are also at least two major plot holes in the book, which are tied so closely to the premise that I don't think they could be fixed without rewriting the entire thing. Those are indeed stupid.

Right. That bit. I'm pretty sure Egan isn't /himself/ stupid, but he was writing about the distinctly stupid idea that there's nothing actually distinguishing nonexistent but logically possible things from actually-existing things.

********** You're implying that things that are non-existent to us can be existent to each other. Everyone's real to themselves, in their own special way? I think that's Permutation City in a nutshell.

Mind you, I don't think Tegmark's ideas hold water either. Everything equally real? Far too simple. We need to build on that.

******** I'm also pretty sure Egan isn't stupid, as he also wrote a trilogy about a universe in which time was just another spatial dimension, and devised laws of physics for it. He writes a lot of novels that are based around one or another theoretical models.

**** They are famous science fiction authors who've wrote about the Singularity and how humanity might behave during the Singularity.

Charles Stross's book [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando]] is probably the one being referred to when they said 'Strossed'. His other books are good too.

'Eganed out' can be referring to any number of his books since a lot of them involve transhumanist themes and the Singularity or similar stuff. Check out the Wikipedia entry on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan#Novels][Greg Egan]] for a list of his novels.
