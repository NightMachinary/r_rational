  *Gun Safety Courses Spark Controversy*

  Wasilla Alasksa: A local principal's gun-safety policies have become the center of a community row.

  "My policies are simple, common sense," explained Principal Bumble, "We know that all children in this town will, at some point, come into contact with loaded firearms. Any responsible parent should support gun safety classes for all of our community's children."

  Bumble's planned curriculum includes lessons on the rules of gun safety, instructions on the proper assembly of firearms, and a course on 'defense against dangerous creatures.'

  The principal, with advice from NRA educational specialists, has also introduced students to a number of gun-centric games, such as "Exploding Snap" or "Gunslinger's Checkers" designed to build student's proficiency and comfort with firearms.

  Bill Black, local hunting guide, opposed these changes, particularly Bumble's decision to require students to attend classes while armed.

  "Yes, I've taught my own son about guns." said Black, "But only with direct supervision. The principal's policies are a completely different matter, bordering on neglectful."

  Local security guard Dave Lestrange, echoed Black's sentiments. "I guess I'm ok with my kid carrying a gun. He's heard me talk about safety since before he could walk," said Lestrange, "But I've heard that the school's loaning guns to kids from the lower-48. Those kids come from household's where no one's ever seen a pistol. That's just asking for accidents."

  Other local parents, who commented on the condition of anonymity, have said that they've told their children not to sit near children from the lower-48, at least until Bumble's gun safety courses have actually begun.

  Bumble strongly condemmned this pratice, and explained that the gun-loan program was a necessary step towards ensuring that all children, even those from households without firearms, could receive a complete and equal education.

  "I'm deeply saddened," the Principal said, "that this sort of xenophobia has taken root in our community. To hear these people talk you'd think that an 11-year-old shouldn't be immediately trusted with an instrument of distruction merely because they've never been told how to handle one safely."

** I will eventually get my Hermione/Draco fic finished, but it's largely about this. Why do people hate muggleborn? Well, why do people hate blacks? I went on some white-supremacists boards and tried to find the most cogent arguments, then just used those, writing in my own counterpoints.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione didn't look up from the labels, where she was writing in neat little script. “Muggle-born come into wizarding society at the age of ten or eleven, picked up by the Ministry,” said Hermione. “Even with professor McGonagall around to help us, my parents and I were barely able to find all of the items on the list of school supplies, and my parents are rather clever people.” She looked up at him. “And I don't just mean clever for muggles.”

  “Spare me the story of the poor disadvantaged muggle-born,” said Draco with a sneer.

  Hermione continued on like she hadn't heard him. “A muggle-born arrives at school with far less preparation than someone who was born into a magical household, and the teachers and curriculum assume a basic level of knowledge about magical subjects that the muggle-born just don't have. When muggle-born go home for the summer, there's no one that they can really talk to about schoolwork, and their parents can't really help them, which means that for most, they go into the next school year without remembering as much as their pureblood peers. Did your father help you over the summer?”

  “No,” said Draco. “He hired me a private tutor.”

  “Well, my mother and father wanted to help me, but they couldn't,” said Hermione. “They had never gone through the same courses in their muggle schools, and the subjects themselves were confusing without that background. I suppose they could have hired me a private tutor as well, if they were fantastically wealthy, or the exchange rate between currencies were more favorable, but we didn't even know that there were tutors, which just brings me right back to my point, which is that muggle-born students do worse because they come in at a disadvantage that they must work very hard to cancel out. That's without getting into the issue of the impact of prejudice perpetuated by the blood purists.”

  “Oh come now Granger,” said Draco. “You can't possibly be blaming blood purists for muggle-born getting poor marks.” It took an effort not to say mudblood, but there was really no point in using the slur here, and besides that, she didn't seem to really understand it. Saying mudblood would only make him look like he was too lazy to follow what she was getting at.

  “If you had been listening to me, you would have heard that I was doing no such thing,” said Hermione. “The thrust of my point is that I would expect muggle-born to do worse in school, and that's precisely what a look at the grades will show, on average. Dumbledore does a disservice by trying to hide it from the world, and your father does a disservice by pretending that we should explain with blood purity what can be better explained by looking at how muggle-born deal with school. The same applies to other things as well, like why we tend to have worse jobs within wizarding society or a higher rate of crime; after all, career success, education, and criminality are all correlated. This would be the case even if blood purism were ended tomorrow.”

Do you ever wonder about how things like this look from the outside? For example, when I was writing Pay Attention, I spent a lot of time researching where to buy heroin in Boston. I've also spent quite a few hours reading up on explosives. If someone subpeoaned my Google history, I'd have some explaining to do.

I should do my research through Tor, but Comcast seems to block it in my area.

There have been a few times that I've thought to myself, "In the past day I've read the Unabomber Manifesto, followed by instructions on bomb-making, followed by a white supremacist website, I wonder whether that tripped any algorithms somewhere".

***** Point taken. The "Orcs are born dumber, stronger, and more weak-willied" is akin to the phrenology argument used by US Southern slave-owners' to justify their point of view.

With each new edition, D&D is also changing with the times, changing the thief class into the rogue, using both male and female pronouns, moving away from binary sex/gender labels... and 'racial disadvantages.' There are only minor racial bonuses, no negatives. In fifth edition, players can make their characters be any sort of class they want them to be, as long as they are willing to have their character work a little harder.

Getting a chance and working hard to prove one's worth are key arguments favoring the disenfranchised.

(And to keep this on topic, squibs are also at a disadvantage and could be akin to the disabled. They just need a few custom devices to give them the independence they need in society.)

No, it pattern-matches to that argument, but its truth value need not be the same as the truth value of that argument. It's like telling a socialist that his arguments sound similar to the arguments used by Communists to kill millions of people.

This is especially the case when talking about a fictional world. Whether someone has lower IQ in the real world is something you have to find out, and the process of finding out is subject to bias. In a fictional world, it's whatever you say it is.

***** There's a Forgotten Realms (D&D) series of novels written by a famous author, R.A. Salvatore that has completely killed orcs for me because of this- the Hunter's Blade trilogy. Spoilers!

It starts out as, in typical fashion, the orcs overrun a dwarves kingdom. But then their leader decides to form an orcish kingdom with the conquered land (and thus, a true Orc civilization, begin trade, establish diplomatic relations, etc.). It was very novel at the time but it just completely ignores how orcs are portrayed in the rest of the D&D setting. In hindsight I'm a bit surprised he was allowed to it.

Harry would /almost/ fit, but he's halfblood, not pureblood. There's no good canon answer to how many children really go to Hogwarts, but it's pretty low, so I would expect most students to come from traditional families, especially considering wizarding conservatism (minus some number who were orphaned by the wizarding war). They could also go the other way with muggleborn raised by wizards, but those are probably even more rare.

I suppose if blood purism makes claims about how well halfbloods do you might be able to correct for the inevitable class issues and go from there. But it's really a question of how much data the wizards have available to them.

Though never really discussed outright in canon it does seem that the greatest achievements in terms of raw power are further in the past of the wizarding world (when populations in general were much smaller).\\
If we assume that there is a limited amount of ambient magic which all wizards draw from then an influx of wizards is to the detriment of those already present. This also fits nicely with the tendency for relatively small families among wizards and the scorn commonly expressed towards the Weaslies for bucking that trend.

This suggests an interesting possibility: that anti-Muggleborn sentiment began to increase at the beginning of, and /because/ of Dumbledore's tenure as Headmaster. Perhaps when Hogwarts is run by someone not particularly sympathetic to Muggleborns, there's less negative feeling toward them society-wide.
