Hey there guys,

So recently I got hooked on this story on RR: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire]] , which is about a protagonist who gains vast future knowledge and then uses this to gain power/influence and so forth.

I'm really curious if anyone has suggestions out there for stories with these similar sort of "kingdom building" aspects with (at least some what...) rational characters/plots?

Bonus points if your suggestion also features the MC gaining previously unknown/future knowledge to aid their cause, I find the idea of someone from the now being plonked into basically medieval times and then trying to advance humanity really cool as a story - yet I'm struggling to find more good stories with these aspects involved, all to often they devolve into "haram" stories or the plot is just typical xianxia "all my enemies are just stupid" or "MC becomes god-like" sort things.

Thank you in advance for anyone who has suggestions!


** Two Year Emperor seems right up this alley. Its a "summoned to a DnD-based world to be King of a country" story. Was originally a web move but I think it's on Amazon now.

** Note: Not all of my recommendations are good and very few are actually complete. Also, you will have to sort through it to find what you are looking for.

Personal Favorites:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19690/out-of-space][Out of Space]] - Not a very detailed magic system or even good grammar, but makes up for it with content.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19610/dah-ork-life][Dah Ork Life!]] - a warhammer 40k self insert, although not rational it is pretty funny.

- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/][Release That Witch]] - if you can stand the translation it probably fits what you want the most, though with the large chapter count it does tend to drag in places. I've finished it and it was worth it.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18594/cultivating-civilization][Cultivating Civilization]] - might fall under "all my enemies are just stupid" but otherwise good.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/infrastructure-an-illustrated-original-work.209283/][Infrastructure]] very dry, lacking in character interaction. But look, Pictures!

Others:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/saurons-world-lord-of-the-rings-fanfiction.589980/][Sauron's World]] - Same author as infrastructure

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15756/i-am-urist-book-2-start][I am Urist]] - Haven't read and doesn't look like there is modern knowledge otherwise but fits otherwise.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fae-is-foul-sao-znt-crossover.252187/][Fae is Foul]] - has hints of industrialization like every twenty chapters.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/halkegenia-online-thread-24-please-stand-by.17386/page-263#post-12974511][Halkegenia Online]] same as fae is foul, a lot more content.

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d6v9ty/any_good_suggestions_for_rational_kingdom/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]

There are a few in ASoIaF (I think):

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336][A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My fault]] - Has some (not much) future knowledge use.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-westerosi-asoiaf.393327/][The Westerosi]] - probably what you want but will take a while to get there.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-westerosi-ii-subprime-directives-asoiaf-star-trek-ish.561856/][The Westerosi II: Subprime Directives]]

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.608353/][A Farmer's Tale]] - basically slowly introducing technology, didn't get very far in this one.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/][The King in the Long Night]] - Didn't get far in this one either but looks good.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/asoiaf-greyjoy-alla-breve-si.352019/][Greyjoy alla Breve]] Only recommending this because of how much modern knowledge he has (wikipedia in his head or something?) didn't read it myself because it's a self insert.

If you can stand ponies:

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/403715/zebrican-warlord][Zebrican Warlord]] - No actual ponies and surprisingly good. Focuses mostly on overthrowing a regime so far.

- +[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/133544/of-the-hive][Of the Hive]]+ Nevermind, no real otherworld knowledge.

- +[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/316852/empty-horizons][Empty Horizons]]+ Same as above.

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/439981/luna-is-a-harsh-mistress][Luna is a Harsh Mistress]] - This one is really good, about survival and building a city on the moon with magic. some modern knowledge

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/306787/the-diamond-dogs-guide-to-engineering][The Diamond Dog's Guide to Engineering]] - Human with knowledge of engineering then builds a civilization. Fair warning that is only part of the story and it is short.

There is also some in anime/manga/light novels:

- [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/common-sense-of-a-dukes-daughter/][Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter]] - Honestly the only good one that I've found in this genre, the sad thing is that more exist they are just plagued by harems and generally bad writing.

Some that might possibly head in that direction and deserve an honorable mention:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/record-of-the-inherited-memory-girls-efforts-isekai.50880/][Record of the Inherited Memory Girl's Efforts]] - Written by the same person who wrote "A Hero's War" and waaay better than it even if it is a lot shorter.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] - I haven't read much of this one because the pacing is a little too slow for me, but I expect what you want will be an eventual outcome though that is a guess.

Stories about civilizations that have little to do with isekai:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/][Hope and Silence in the Hive]] - An eldritch comedy that is really good, occasionally confusing but worth it in the end.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terror-peace-among-the-stars-sequel-warhammer-40k.672535/][Terror & Peace Among the Stars]] - a sequel to the above.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/contact-1955.328914/][Contact 1955]] - Pretty massive plot hole of how exactly technology does not develop when it has the whole galaxy (possibly larger) to work on it, even with magic involved, not very long either, but still fun.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/previously-impossible-futures-warhammer-40-000-original.752587/][Previously Impossible Futures]] - Pretty sure this one was a little dry but still interesting enough.

*** Various fanfiction links reminded me of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/][Factory Isolation]], factorio/others crossover.

MC is isekaed onto a biter planet, and given the controls of self replicating machine of war. Eventually he reaches other dimensions with poor living conditions and starts building a kingdom for refugees. Complete.

I found it a surprisingly fun read for this subgenre.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]]: Ami from Sailor Moon gets plopped into the Dungeon Keeper universe. She retains all her knowledge of engineering from Earth, and uses it to get an edge on her opposition, although she does so relatively cautiously in order to try to avoid reverse-engineering. She's not /trying/ to build a kingdom, per se, but circumstances keep on pushing her into it. And the story manages to avoid harem-related plot elements, making Ami too untouchable, and so forth, keeping the tension up even as she gains power and influence. So overall it seems like very plausibly the sort of thing you're after.

**** Dungeon Keeper is a game where you play at managing a dungeon by getting monsters and killing the good guys that explore the dungeon.

Sailor Moon is an anime about hero transforming school girls.

I've read a good chunk of the story while knowing nothing about Dungeon Keeper and only knowing about Sailor Moon through like memes and second hand sources. I can say that as the story progresses a fair amount can be inferred and a quick pop into wiki can help.

It's pretty good.

**** I had no foreknowledge of Sailor Moon and still enjoyed this story. It's competently written, and so long as you keep reading past your confusion you'll eventually pick up all the worldbuilding you need to know. A gripe I had was that she seemed to get shoved on the side of the ‘bad guys' by author fiat more than actual character decisions and natural plot points, but it's easy to look past.

** There is a published series from the late 80s or early 90s called the Cross Time Engineer, about a Polish engineer who actually gets time traveled back to Europe a decade before the Mongol invasion. He does have protagonist luck with the ladies, but spends more of his time trying to get useful amounts of firearms made and dealing with local politics

***** It's a regular horse for 3 books or so, a bit smart but just a horse. Then in book 4 or 5 it's revealed to be a shapeshifting AI or something sent by his future descendents to protect him, and also it's in love with him, and also it changes itself to suit his every desire.

To say this series jumped the shark after a while is putting it lightly. The new term should be "it fucked the damn horse", haha.

***** Untrue. Slander. The horse is actually the only female character he doesn't fuck.

The horse is a bio-engineered thing. What you may be thinking about is he meets other human shaped members of it's...species? Genus?

(For some weird reason people who write this sub-genre tend to throw in harems if the series goes on long enough.)

**** One reason you may have dropped it is that it's bad. A Hero's War starts promisingly enough, and then everything goes downhill from there. The thing is, it gives little hints of something interesting coming eventually to keep you reading and then it never delivers. Aside from the poor writing quality, the unfortunate fact is that it's very much not a rational story. There are two main characters, one in command of an army, the other a sort of innovator/engineer. The engineer dude just solves everything without effort because no one as ever thought about magic crossbows, or poisoning a worm, or whatever. He does this with no formal magical knowledge, just hunches, and he's always right. The worldbuilding is atrocious.
