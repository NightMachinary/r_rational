Hi there, I'm wondering which pieces of fiction (and specifically, which chapters and/or pages) show what it looks like in literature when writing a first-person viewpoint of someone using Bayes Theorem to make a decision, in a useful way.

IE, if I want to write a character who specifically uses this technique, what are some good examples (quotes from text are great!) to look at for how this works, /when written in a narrative/ so the character doesn't end up looking like a Vulcan who just pulls out improbably precise and relevant numbers out of nowhere? Not just good examples of 'how to use Bayes Theorem yourself' but more, 'How to write someone using it'? Any help would be appreciated!


** I think an important point is that Bayes' Theorem /cannot be used to make a decision/: it describes how to update a probability estimate (from "prior" to "posterior" estimate) based on a new observation, and the probability you estimated of making that observation.

So any use /specifically of Bayes' Theorem/ would basically have to be in a story about scientists doing actual science, which tend to be disappointingly rare - not many readers really enjoy statistics or probability theory in their fiction! So on the assumption that you're after "rationalist characters who [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bkSkRwo9SRYxJMiSY/beautiful-probability][appreciates]] Bayes' Theorem displaying the subjective experience of good decision-making/decision theory"...

That said, it's not hopeless:

- [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4tke3ibK9zfnvh9sE/the-bayesian-tyrant]]
- [[https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/beisutsukai]]
- [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/starwink.shtml]]

are all good, and at least reasonably closely related to Bayes' Theorem and practical decision theory.

Do you mean this in the sense that it isn't a decision making algorithm but you could use it as part of a larger decision making architecture, or some deeper sense?

Because I mean, knowledge of the current world is what you plug into the preference function, right?

**** The former, though I'd also note that your decision theory is also independent of your preferences - it describes how you attempt to satisfy them, accounting for your knowledge.

** The main character goes into it in depth in Chapter 50 of Pokemon: The Origin of Species. I know it comes up a lot in HPMoR but I don't have locations. I don't recall if they ever really walked through it in depth.

** Ultimately, Bayes' Theorem is one of many tools or concepts within statistics. It is important, but there isn't anything really that special about it in terms of writing fictional characters. I would suggest figuring out whether you are interested in it because you want to read a story about statistics, or logic, or quantifiable settings, capable characters, realistic cost benefit analyses, etc.

Asking how to write someone that uses Bayes' Theorem is like asking how to write someone that uses the Pythagorean Theorem. I guess I could say that most would do it intuitively, without explicitly naming it or considering it worth mention. If mentioned more explicitly, they might use a notebook and calculator, or a phone.

Also, if someone is going into it without clean numbers, there is a whole lot that has to be done with managing error in approximations. And if you're using crude approximations without managing error then what you're doing is at most a ballpark and at worst a debate technique.
