** I concur that he never actually gives arguments which address any of the points in the book. However, the Dark Forest premise depends on a number of assumptions which themselves have unclear truth value, and of which make its application to real life of dubious applicability.

IMO, the core notion of the Dark Forest requires a couple of technological assumptions usually not assumed in realistic near-term hard sci fi - not that the assumptions must always be true, but that they can be true at some point in history. The first is basically weapons of mass destruction that are also stealthy. If I see you, I can basically instantly kill you, and no one will really be able to know where it came from. Some commentators suggest that the act of attacking is not stealthy. I disagree that it must be so. Near Light speed RKVs are already extremely low warning weapons, at least for the receiver (though probably less so for bystanders). The point is that the arguments depend on an implicit assumption that it's a loud genocidal war, when it might not be lpud, abd almost certainly isn't a war as much as a massacre.

*** Well put, which is why Dark Forest Theory was a really neat in universe plot device, especially since some of the incomprehensible, stealthy, weapons of mass destruction were actually shown in book 3.

In addition, the book series also mentioned at some point, I believe, that hunter civilizations sent out silent probes to spread out in the galaxies carrying those weapons; the entire kill-loud-civilizations process was automated and ran little risk of exposing their own home civilization.

*** RKVs though are an immense materials and energy investment, and it's possible to defend against pretty easily.

How, you ask? Simple. Spreading out. A vast number of low mass space habitats - or, really, separate solar arrays and compute nodes - around a star are a very hard to kill target.

​

The reason is that the attacker has to spend more mass-energy constructing and accelerating the RKVs than the defender loses in mass from a node blown out of orbit.

​

It's only for defenders stuck on planets that RKVs are a civilization ending threat. Once we have the tech to build exponentially replicating machines, there would be no need to live on a planet. And we're within a few decades of that tech - it doesn't require anything but a robust machine learning framework that is easy to repurpose between different robotic platforms. No need for machine sentience, no need for nanotechnology. Just a straightforward bit of software engineering from what we already have.

** lets say you have four species: 3 quiet and one loud. one of the quiet species is genocidal, and kills anyone they see. they attack the loud species. this is a VERY visible action. they just told the universe their position, their hostile intent, and given a rough estimate of their military capacity. timing puts them inside a specific sphere relative to the target.

so, you just realized that you had a loud neighbor, and a psychopath killed them. you now know roughly where the psychopath is, and you know you cant stay queit forever. logically, you should take action NOW to deal with the problem. if one neighbor sees this and acts, its 50/50 who wins. if two or more see this and act, then the hostile species is destroyed, and there may be an alliance made between the survivors. what if there are more hostile species?

the problem with the game theory approach, is it assumes only two actors. in reality, you will likely have more actors than that. hostile response to hostile action means that it is a dangerous strategy in the long run.

we have not seen anything that looks like a space-battle, so space battles are probably very unlikely. thus hostile species are likely rare, unless we are just the first to be able to act and choose. either way, the lack of space battles is a good thing.

nope. bad assumption

  roughly where the psychopath is
#+end_quote

again nope, the a sphere is quite a large area/volume of space, plus the timing doesn't exactly tell you how big the sphere could be

**** To add on this comment, it's a bad assumption for countless reasons, but the biggest one IMO is light lag and the technological explosion. By the time the information has reached you, it will have been decades. How much more powerful is the modern US military compared to its 1960s counterpart? Well, we saw how easily thr US demolished Iraq. This is with downright conservative assumptions too. In this universe where Dark Forest may apply, FTL travel is unavaliable, technology may or may not grow rapidly - you can't tell, and similarly the societal outlook of your possible rivals is dated by light lag and you canmot tell how quickly or slowly they are changing.

** I don't see him refuting any of the DF Theory.

He never addresses the "technology explosion" vs "chain of suspicion". In fact he makes a few arguments that blantantly ignore it. It makes me feel as if he hasn't actually read the book.

Can you give more details on these two ? AFAICT he does not need to address either because he argues that there is no way to hide in the first place and that there are trivial ways to sterilize a galaxy anyway.

** I realize it's not the intent , but it amuses me that in this analogy the trees outnumber the hunters by a couple orders of magnitude and are not in danger of being hunted. I can't help but think the real lessen here is "be the tree".

*** In the Three Body universe, this is actually rather similar to one of the solutions available -- using a certain technology that makes you able to hide but also unable to ever leave your hiding place or see beyond it.

**** Except the trees aren't hiding (any hunter can identify several if asked). They juts aren't perceived as a threat by the hunters, but rather as cover.

I'm not sure how that would apply as a deliberate strategy, but IMO being sufficiently alien that the hunters don't recognize you as a threat is probably an adaptation that an environment like that selects for.

***** You clearly meant something different when you used "be the tree" as an analogy (and I rather like your idea), but let me describe what I meant:

By hiding, I meant placing yourself in a state where you can't contact the outside world, but the outside world can no longer reach or harm you either. I don't remember the details, but from what I remember the Black Domain does appear as astronomical features, just ones that are no longer relevant as sentient species for the outside world.

So in that case, it's not that you've disguised yourself to not be a threat, but rather that you're actually no longer a threat to the outside world, though with the drawback that (kinda like a tree) you don't have the ability to affect the world beyond yourself.

****** I get it.

What I find amusing about the metaphor though, is that the author appears to have forgotten that trees are alive, and in choosing a forrest for the "backdrop" accidentally created something that can be interpreted completely differently.

Unlike the tech described, the hunters don't juts lack the capability or need to attack the trees. They cannot afford to attack the trees as they depend on the trees to hide them from other hunters. And by there being enough trees to hide the hunters from each otehr implies that by sheer numbers the trees are "winning".
