*** Specifically, I liked his Coursera course - "A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior". It's no longer available in its full form, but I found the videos someone kindly uploaded [[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9AAtHvw6OPiX0pELUU2SEc5SlE&usp=sharing#list][here]] and [[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aj7ruq7ypmnttd2/AADsSyfye21BKT4GKzWf8ZAVa?dl=0][here]].

It's mostly basic concepts, but they're pretty well explained and the course itself is entertaining. A die-hard LessWronger likely wouldn't get much out of it, but I definitely did.

Speaking of courses, there's also [[https://www.edx.org/course/science-everyday-thinking-uqx-think101x-1][The Science of Everyday Thinking]] over on EDX. Overall I found it less enjoyable and less in-depth than Dan Ariely's course, but it also focused on some different areas. Both are well worth doing, in my opinion.

And while we're at it, most courses on psychology have direct applications for rationality, so I recommend any and all of those, too.

** Keywords to try looking for in YouTube: cfar, kahneman, giegenzer, dan ariely and Julia galef. Skepticon had talks by Julia galef and eliezer yudkowsky, as well as a panel on "is rationality learnable" (or similar) with Dan dennett on it.

*** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a good one as well.
