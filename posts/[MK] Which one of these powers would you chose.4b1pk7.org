** Shamelessly stolen from [[/r/makeyourchoice][r/makeyourchoice]].

** Umbrans sounds most promising. Meeting aliens and finding out what causes them to be controlled by me sounds fun. Once the effect is reverse-engineered enough, this might prove a viable method of FTL or interdimensional travel and open up all the opportunities that come with that.

** CYOA are almost cheating. The joy of rational works for me is that characters exploit the rules of a game or world they /didn't/ create. It's fun knocking down dominoes, but it loses some of the appeal if you have to set them up. (Incidentally, this is why I don't like Gamer fics.)

I guess this one partially solves it by putting the alternative options into play in opposition to you, but still...

** I would not go for any of the powers that describe themselves as requiring me to visualize something, since I fall pretty far on [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/][the low end of the visual imagery scale]]. I am likewise skeptical of those powers which promise I will develop some sort of "instinctual feel" for using them once I acquire them; my Outside-View experience is that every time in the past I've been told "oh, you'll pick it up with a little practice," that has not been the case.

My first instinct is that Perens Miography (make more of substances) seems like it has a lot of potential.

** Fluid control seems pretty solid. You have 1kg of fluid to turn into a water jet, and if you get into range of an open wound, you win.

** If Shitoko Kinismus and Bradium Kinismus synergize properly, meaning phantom limbs count as your skin or a simple tool, then that might be a winner. You can do stealth punch spam without hurting yourself, and then make things explode or fly as a projectile. Phantom limbs only transmit force, so delaying that means no one feels a thing and it doesn't make a sound. If you can't really move without giving away your position, just stack the force from attempted choking and implode their neck. You can fashion grenades/mines and launch them. I think you could even fly/hover by making a scooping motion and catching yourself by the armpits. I wonder if you could delay force on your self. If you could jump, mimic a jump in the air, and have an upside down phantom jump hitting your feet, you might be able to double jump and even store an arbitrary amount of them for later.

** I'd go for the color changing one. It appears to have no limits, so if you want to, you can turn yourself and the entire island a single color, and just leave your opponents (and your own food stores) easy to pick out. This is probably a bigger advantage than picking a magic power for direct combat - none of them are deadlier than a gun, and most of them aren't even deadlier than a solid tree branch.
