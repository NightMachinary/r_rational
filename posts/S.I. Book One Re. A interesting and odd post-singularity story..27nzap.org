** 'Interesting' and 'odd' are both definitely among what I've been aiming for. :)

(And yes, I'm still working on Book Two; I'm not hitting 4k words a day like I was when I started, but I'm still adding some more every day.)

*** Oh, the author himself appears. You should know that I was not expecting such a captivating story come out of nowhere like this. I'm really enjoying it so far.

An interesting note: I think the story's format matches well with a serial comic. I keep imagining the cell layouts and dialogue boxes as I read. The character and setting descriptions are just /begging/ to be drawn.

It was a comment in this subreddit that I should "Just start writing" that prompted me to do just that; I've been keeping a close eye on this place since then.

If I may ask, where did you learn of S.I.? SpaceBattles? LessWrong Discussion? Elsewhere?

I'm certainly a fan of comics, including having learned some important lessons about story-telling from Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" and sequels; and I try to keep the visuals firmly in mind as I write. I know a few artists who'd probably be happy to create some images, but the going rate is around $20+ for a full-body figure with no background, and while I've got time to think about plots and write things down, it's a bit harder for me to convert my time into spare cash. That said, I have noted down a few visual references that come reasonably close: [[https://sfw.sofurry.com/view/602824]] , [[https://sfw.furaffinity.net/view/12351256/]] , and on NeutronAlchemist on DeviantArt has some NSFW photomorphs that have reasonably representative anatomy.

*** You aren't a furry by any chance, are you? Because a lot of what I am reading strongly suggests either that or strong ties of another type to the subculture. If it weren't already painfully evident by both my username and flair, I am one, if generally quietly. I approve.

*** So, one thing I wasn't clear on but pieced together later and want to confirm if true: The imaginary-friend-turned-into-rabbit body was designed by the AI, and the future-humans /find/ it along with the cryo-frozen corpse, and decide to place the brain inside it BUT the AI designed the body with its own goals in mind so they can't trust it. Yes?

(I'm only part way thru so sorry if this was clarified later)

**** That's reasonably accurate. The closest I have to a quibble is that the cryo-frozen corpse isn't dead when the future-humans find him and the bunny, so 'corpse' might not be the best word. ('Corpsicle', on the other paw, has a long and distinguished history...)
