I was wondering if there was anything that could be considered a rationalist show?


** Death Note is oft-cited, may I assume you're familiar with that since most people who watch anime are?

*** Look; TV shows and movies have been made of many of works of fiction. Among them some very good works, like Death Note. That said, something is invariably lost every time. Who here has watched the Harry Potter movies and thought they were as good as the novels? (Putting aside that HPMOR is better than both, of course.)

This is why I /strongly/ disrecommend watching something in a secondary media, at least until you have consumed the first media. For example: If you haven't had enough Harry Potter after reading the novels, I have no objection to you watching the movies, so long as you are aware that they don't capture the full feeling and flair of the original.

Similarly, read Death Note. Don't watch it, at least not as the primary form you consume it in. It's just not worth. You lose so much.

**** Personally I thought Death Note's adaptation was exceptionally good, better than any I've seen of any other work. While in general you're totally right, in this instance I think the spirit of the original was almost fully captured in the anime.

** Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex might be worth a look. It's more about exploring transhumanism than being strictly rationalist I would say, but the central mystery of The Laughing Man is pretty good. It has some pretty interesting episodes too; there's one which is set almost entirely inside a chat room, which happens to be one of my favourite episodes.

** *Shinsekai Yori* (From the New World):

- /Trailer:/ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybgzmTT_SuM][Extended fan-made trailer]]

- /What it's about/: In a far-flung post-apocalyptic future survives an isolated society of small Japanese villages. The community is rigidly controlled and stratified, with a great focus placed upon developing and restraining the natural psychic powers that all humans begin to demonstrate upon hitting puberty. The story follows a group of children as they begin to question the indoctrination imposed upon them and are steadily presented with the reasons and justifications behind it.

- /Why should you watch it?:/ While not explicitly rationalist, there are a lot of crossover points with topics that often come up in such circles, particularly the "conspiracy of silence" around dangerous knowledge, being willing to trade off otherwise essential values such as personal liberty and the lives of innocents in the face of a true existential threat. Shinsekai Yori has, hands down, the best world-building I've ever seen in an anime. It takes its central premise -- ubiquitous psychic powers -- and follows through on the societal consequences that the existence of such a thing would have. As the show goes on, it's made clear that there really are no “heroes” or “villains”, that everyone has their own entirely self-consistent justifications for their actions, which nonetheless conflict with everyone else's. It's a wonderfully morally grey narrative. As an added bonus, Shinsekai Yori is a rare work in that it treats its audience as intelligent: it doesn't directly narrate connections as the characters make them, it shows you flashes and assumes you'll keep up.

- /Caveats/: The start of the show is *slow*, with much more effort being put into setting up a solid foundation for the latter half and in establishing the unique setting than in showing things actually happening. This pays off, but the "mystery" of the early episodes is not enough to sustain interest by itself at times. "Plot holes", particularly with regards to character actions or motivations, only make sense with information gained later on. The sudden time-skip into adolescence around the half-way point makes for a *very* jarring transition episode with every character (including background ones) apparently having paired off romantically. Again, justified later, but still a bit of a sudden change-up from what had been happening up to that point.

- /Theme(s):/ Liberty vs Security. Identity, conformity and indoctrination. Legitimacy of violence. Discrimination.

__

*Fate/Zero:*

- /Trailer:/ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAIGOt4Eg7A][Fan-made AMV]]

- /What it's about/: The Fourth Holy Grail War: A battle-royale between seven pairs of mages and heroic legends summoned from the past, fighting to the death. The winner is granted an artefact capable of fulfilling their greatest wish, no matter how large.

- /Why watch it/: This is a classic Urobuchi work, balancing psychological and philosophical discussion against heart-pounding action, with little filler or fan-service to get in the way. The animation quality is simply one of the highest out there - the common joke is that ufotable could have bought a small country with what everyone presumes they've invested in this series. But the heart of the show is in the character interactions. This is not a "coming of age" story; every character arrives on the scene with a well-established identity and a coherent set of ethics and morals. The plot is an excuse to throw them up against one another and see what shakes out. The story is gripping and it does a decent job of contrasting different philosophies, with particular attention paid (in typical Urobuchi fashion) to the problems of Utilitarianism and confronting Nihilism. Any anime that explicitly includes a reference to the Trolley Problem merits a look-see, right?

- /Caveats/: This is an adaptation of a story set in a large existing body of work (the so-called "Nasuverse"). As such, the first episode is basically a gigantic infodump where it tries to set up enough context from the source material that the rest of the show can get right down to action without interrupting to explain the mechanics. You *have* to watch the first episode to understand what's going on, but it doesn't sell the series particularly well. Also, the ending, while spectacular, does leave a lot of things unfulfilled, a lot of questions that are only going to be answered in the follow-up Fate/Stay Night re-adaptation coming this Autumn. Everything between the first and last episodes, however, is solid gold.

- /Primary theme(s)/: Conflict of ideologies, with particular focus in the second half given to the conflict between Nihilism and Existentialism/Utilitarianism. The nature of leadership, the place of chivalry.

- /Similar works:/ Anything else by Gen Urobuchi - Madoka Magica or Psycho-Pass. Outside of anime, the Visual Novel of Fate/Stay Night is an obvious follow-up, albeit a major time sink too.

*Madoka Magica:*

This show is one of the hardest to discuss without spoiling in advance, simply because from the description it sounds utterly unlike anything you're asking for. Until it changes. That said:

- /What it's about:/ Madoka Magica begins with the standard "Magical Girl anime" set-up - the moral and upstanding Madoka is approached by two strangers. The first is an adorable-looking alien named Kyubey, who offers to fulfill any wish a teenage girl might have, provided that she's willing to sign on the dotted line and risk her life fighting against strange and dangerous beings known as "witches". The second is a mysterious girl her own age named Homura, who strenuously warns Madoka against taking up the offer.

- /Why watch it:/ Most "Faustian bargain" stories centre around malicious genies looking to exploit loopholes and wreck the entire idea for wishing in the first place. Madoka side-steps that issue immediately - wishes work based on /intent/, and they /always/ come true. Instead, the wisher's comeuppance comes from their inability to deal with the price demanded of them. Madoka Magica is one of the most highly-rated anime series of all time, and for good reason. It's often called a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, though there's some argument as to how accurate that description is. Whether it is or not, after the show gets going, the brakes come off the train as the plot careens towards an action-packed conclusion, with a massive amount of character development stuffed in along the way. The package is completed with a gorgeous soundtrack and a unique approach to animating action sequences that makes this an incredibly memorable series.

- /Caveats:/ This show is *the* reason for the standard "watch three-five episodes before giving up" rule for watching anime. Also, once you strip away the thematic elements that define the show, it /is/ at its heart a Magical Girl series. If you're utterly unwilling to countenance watching it based on that, then, well, fair enough.

- /Themes:/ Faustian bargains. Despair. Some see Buddhist or Christian overtones.

- /Similar works:/ Anything by Gen Urobuchi (*Psycho Pass*, *Fate/Zero*). *Stein's Gate.* If Madoka /does/ get you interested in seeing other decent Magical Girl shows, give *Revolutionary Girl Utena* a go.

** Planetes is possibly the hardest scifi ever on screen (maybe harder than 2001, since 2001 has Sufficiently Advanced Aliens and Planetes doesn't). Think /Gravity/, without the physics mistakes; the only implausible element I can think of is the computer technology not having advanced significantly by the 2070s. Not only is the physics realistic, so are the characters (besides a few comic relief characters who don't get that much screentime) and even the geopolitics; the characters don't carry the idiot ball, but neither do they solve everything themselves. It has one of the most satisfying, well-thought-out Earn Your Happy Endings in all of anime.

** As far as anime is concerned, Steins;Gate has time travel without plot holes.

In Zetsuen no Tempest, most of the characters act intelligently using the information that they have, and some of the plans they come up with are pretty clever. Zetsuen's first half is better than the second, but the second half still ends well.

Psycho Pass is an anime series that's basically about enlightenment ideals vs. romantic ideals in a dystopia. It's sci-fi and also has some transhuman themes.

Mawaru Penguindrum isn't really rational in that the rules of the world are vaguely explained and makes it difficult to figure out what will happen next, but it has a complex plot with interesting symbolism that is challenging to understand the details of. It's by the creator of Revolutionary Girl Utena.

I get the feeling that you had a hard to time understanding it because you expected the rules of the Mawaru Penguindrum world to be consistent, when in fact they are based on and shaped by emotion. However, they are understandable on an intuitive level even if they aren't logical. Also, the show had more than five episodes and you're not supposed to understand everything within just the first five episodes.

But the point still stands, that story created so many plot holes and inconsistencies, it became apparent they just made-up whatever they could the week before making the producing each of the anime episodes. It's more typical than people realize.

The plot twists themselves have no consistency. There was no plot, just a bunch of stupid crap poorly made together with this deluded idea of "mystery" before trying to become some stupid Code Geass wannabe near the end.

**** It definitely isn't a pile of angst. There are themes of family, love, and hope throughout the whole show. Despite all the terrible things that happen and the cruelty of the world around them, these give the characters motivation and their actions aren't in vain. I don't understand your complaint about the characters because most of them seemed realistic to me with the possible exception of a few of the crazy ones. Realistic or not, they were complex and interesting. I guess I shouldn't have recommended it here because most rational stories have complex plots presented in a straightforward way whereas Mawaru Penguindrum has a simple plot presented in a complex way with a lot of the content left up to interpretation. I can see how its style might not be your preference but it's a good show. If you think there wasn't anything to the show, maybe you didn't get it? For example, do you understand the symbolism of the child broiler?

Mawaru Penguindrum, for example, has plenty of events that don't really make sense (is the Child Broiler even real, for example?) but that still serve to convey the themes and character development. This is a good fit for the medium because unrealism is easier in animation, but it does have the effect of not many series being produced that could be considered rational.

** I'd recommend Steins;Gate for a really engaging and human story involving time travel that seems to be /mostly/ internally consistent, with characters smartly trying to figure out why, exactly, time travel is happening and how to fix their mistakes. I love this show because it's a great mix of intellectual stimulation and /mostly/-believable human drama. Note: This is maybe the only the anime that I know of where I /wholeheartedly/ recommend the dub. I think it's absolutely impeccable and most of my friends agreed. There are some legitimately funny (and surprisingly English-centric) pop culture jokes, too. It's two seasons long. Made me cry twice.

I'd also recommend Puella Magi Madoka Magica (a.k.a. Madoka) as well. It's less "rational" and more "people who enjoy content on this subreddit will also enjoy it", in my opinion, but it's a fantastic deconstruction of the magical girl genre. It actually made a lot of people quite mad with this. It had about two episodes of being a straightforward "power of friendship triumphs over things that hold "evil" as a terminal value" show (and was pretty much advertised as such), but took a surprisingly dark turn and didn't turn back. It subverted pretty much everyone's expectations about the general flow of the show. Unfortunately it suffers from the common problem of "everything that's fucking awesome about this thing is a massive spoiler", but there are a /lot/ of bombshells. In terms of overall theme, it deals with some difficulties with utilitarianism, alien value systems, major character death, and powerlessness. If you're willing to give it a chance at all, give it at least three episodes. It's one season.
