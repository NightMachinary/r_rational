[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/89vkv0/biweekly_challenge_comedy/][Last time]], the prompt was "Comedy". Our winner is [[/u/blasted0glass]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/89vkv0/biweekly_challenge_comedy/dwy639m/]["Some of Its Parts"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/blasted0glass]], who has now joined the coveted superwinner club with five wins!

This time, the challenge will be *Complexity*. There are a few different directions you can take this, whether that's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity][Kolmogoroc complexity]], complexity biases, or Occam's Razor -- the other side of the coin from complexity is simplicity, so you might want to attack it from that angle as well. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, May 2nd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Our next challenge will be *Long View*. The story should center around long-term thinking, ideally in the range of decades if not centuries; projects or plans that can't be completed in the lifetime of anyone but an immortal, future-proofing for a future that can't be predicted, and optimizing for extreme endurance - that sort of thing. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/2*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8dat4f/challenge_companion_complexity/][is available here]].

I've been working on this idea for about a year now starting with this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/536z7p/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d7qqzlx/][prompt]] at very intermittent intervals. However, I've only actually written out the scenes three days ago. So this is a very bare-bones skeleton of the first five chapters where I'm writing about two guys playing around with a weird new device. The final novel is planned to be around 30 chapters. The novel is also not meant to be so dialogue heavy, but that's what I ended up with.

I've allowed commenting functionality on the Google Docs. So please, feel perfectly free to tear this story to shreds. I can't improve as a writer otherwise.

*** You're following Eliezer's lesson on how to write Solvable Mysteries aren't you?

#+begin_quote
  Thanks to the Illusion of Transparency, the best way to construct a mystery is to have some latent fact about the story, known to you, that is not spelled out explicitly in the text. And then make /absolutely no effort/ to conceal this latent fact, except that you never literally say it out loud.

**** Subconsciously, maybe. I had completely forgotten about that, but it does fit. It's also the most distinctive thing about this story when compared to my others. Very nice observation!

I've been thinking a lot about the Type-Moon/Fate universe recently, and wanted to try fleshing out how and why the in-universe magic system works. Type-Moon has a lot of lore that is only explained obliquely and then ignored for rule-of-cool shounen shit, so this is more-so base system worldbuilding. Tried writing it where you don't need any background, hopefully.

*** *widened eyes* The [[#s][]]--is this truly non-canon, not confirmed explicitly anywhere? It slots in extremely naturally, resolving several things that bothered me about the universe, and in doing so horrifyingly changes the subjective worthiness of of magic-users' ultimate goal.

[[#s][]]

[[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Magic][Huh.]] Assuming this is trustworthy, it is helpful for me in determining what counts as canon.
