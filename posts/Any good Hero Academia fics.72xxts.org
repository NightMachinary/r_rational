I'm particularly interested in one where Deku uses parlor tricks to fake powers instead of just getting them from Allmight. Could be interesting if it exists.


** Erased Potential is pretty good. Young Deku tracks down Eraserhead and begs him to train him, reasoning that Aizawa basically fights Quirkless. He basically attempts to mimic that style by leveraging his analysis and prediction abilities to understand his enemies well enough to cancel out their special advantage just like Aizawa does. Pretty interesting, almost feels more true to Deku's character, instead of being given the most OP superpower on a silver platter, he works to become a hero without it.

*** Does anyone understand why it seems like in japanese shounen manga there is a trend of a kid who decides, "Even if I don't have the special circumstances of others; I'll be the best anyway!" and then it turns out they have the MOST special of circumstances? Naruto Bleach My Hero Academia Others?

**** It's apparently a Japanese culture thing with the idea of an underdog that has a special innate power/ability powered by their fighting spirit/work ethic/persistence.

The Tv Tropes page has more detail on that. It's basically a foundational trope for the Shonen genre.

***** I would add that the underdog is also meant to be relatable to people who are relative outsiders of their social group, but still want to move up the hierarchy within that group. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmRfmJqE0kM][This video]] talks about, among a few other things, how HeroAca satirizes how Japanese students are pressured to succeed within a conformist system that doesn't grant everyone a fair opportunity to succeed. [[/u/ianstlawrence][u/ianstlawrence]] because I want him to see this too.

****** Said system and conformism came from the centuries of Confucian influence. The same problems, bullying, hyper competitive tests, suicides, happen to Korean and Chinese students.

******* So I will say that all of these comments are and seem to be true and answer my question, but I must say, I still find it very, very annoying to have what feels like a "theme" betrayed.

**** I know nothing about Bleach, but the way it works in Naruto and HeroAca is that the protagonist has a trump card they can use in emergencies, but it too risky to rely on. This allows every conflict to have an arc where the hero is on the ropes until they tap into their "inner strength", which is a fundamentally sound formula for getting people emotionally invested in the action.

It's an archetypical structure for telling a story about an underdog, but one that delivers on what an underdog story needs to. Even HJPEV had his "dark side" that he could call upon, and it worked there just as well as it does in shonen. HeroAca isn't a masterpiece, but it's fun escapism with just enough depth to keep me coming back and talking about it.

***** My problem with Naruto (and I think you are mostly correct about Hero Academia) is that using the Kyuubi never is actually a problem? Like the two times that Naruto goes hard with the Kyuubi both don't really seem to cause actual problems, just the vague telling of problems.

He uses it once against Jiraiya, that we don't see, and Jiraiya is like, "Oh now I have a scar, but its fine" (not a direct quote). So that really isn't a problem (to me).

Second time is against Orochimaru on the bridge with Kabuto (they are trying to see who the spy is or something right after Shippuden starts). And again, like, people escaped and it fucked up the plans a bit, but mostly it seemed like having the Kyuubi was really useful to for stopping Orochimaru.

It never, to me, felt like an actual problem. Like something that I saw cause him pain and problems. We are told a lot about how it made his childhood tougher and stuff, but it just doesn't seem like it even comes close to outweighing all of the positives.

****** Yeah, there's more than one reason I'm not a fan of Naruto. I'm sure there are things to like about it, but I think HeroAca uses the same tropes in more rational ways to tell a story I find more interesting and explores themes that I think are good for the audience it's marketed towards.
