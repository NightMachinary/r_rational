Really like the fridge horror implications of all adults disappearing suddenly.. Haven't seen the show yet so use spoilers when talking about the later episodes please.

**** Yeah, Oh El is a self insert of the author in Young Justice. And so very definitely Rational with a capital r. :P

** I've got to say, that despite how much I've been loving this it's reaching the point where my suspension of disbelief will start breaking because no one questions OL's sources.

He's given so many different one off excuses and justifications as well as small mentions to 'fictional awareness' due to his home dimension that someone should be connecting the dots. At the very least the way he can get just-the-right allies and know so many specific information from their lives should be raising some warning flags.

Perhaps not in this arc, but around the next one I expect Batman to press him relative to this.

*** His rings ability to search, find, and organize information could probably explain a whole lot of what he does.

**** How about all of Constantine's stories, or practically unknown persons he has mentioned across his expositionary dictations? The first were not really noted down anywhere, specially not on digital format, and in case of the latter he has given quite a few descriptions of character which 'did such and such and who has family member a/b/c' based on his knowledge of the common DC Universe(not the one of the Young Justice series) that eventually Batman will catch one which does not correspond to their own reality.

Like I said, it's more of a straining of disbelief than anything else, his knowledge seems to be so encompassing of everything that eventually someone will notice that something is afoot. I expect rationality from all the various sides and factions after all, and we are talking of a universe with far stranger things than just this.
