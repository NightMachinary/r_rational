** People in story make a bit of Catherine being reactive instead of proactive as the source of her problems, but everytime she tries to be proactive something stomps along to kick her teeth in. She's always going to be on the backfoot purely from being in the same arena as people who were moving years before she started. Every attempt to build something that might survive her is smothered in the crib. Hell, in interlude chapters people like Warlock and Malicia look on her as an incipient corpse. Or maybe this is just the start of the purification process the dead king talked about.

And despite her stroke against Callow, Malicia seems to have abandoned her original objective with Black and moved away from calcifying Praes into something less obscene and more into a functional nation. The truebloods are gone, but far from forgotten. Those institutions are beholden to the calamities, who are loyal to Black - who has lost faith in her. She's riding a tiger that's trying to buck her and short all the tools she had before, with new threats to replace the old ones.

**** The populations probably not as high as you might think, given that food from Callow is limited by the terrible farming practices the gnomes keep people using, and also how they have to feed Praes and Praes' armies. There was that slight issue of a hundred thousand people plus being wiped out at Liesse, which is generally just not great for the entire south of Callow, or it's economic and agricultural situation. and then all the people Praes has killed over the years of its occupation (which, IIRC, is /also/ in the six digits).

This becomes an issue when Callow routinely does things like get its soldiers stranded in hell, or explicitly use the Callowan soldiers as meat shields to keep the Praesi alive. They've lost half their army several times in a row now.

And now there are new mouths being sent by Malicia for Callow to feed. And the southern farms were essentially bombed.

But even ignoring that, think about what Ratface (may he rest in peace) says:

#+begin_quote
  "I understand the Hellhound is riding you about funding for the army, but another thousand men will make no difference if we can't pay those soldiers.”
#+end_quote

Callow is, as we've been told over and over again is all but broke. There were concerns about just maintaining the army as it was, let alone rebuilding one, or making an army that can "shake the continent". Like, it's all well and good for Cat to order the treasury emptied, but we've been told many times that it already /is/ empty. And Callow has no trade, no one it can borrow money from. How are they going to pay and provision soldiers?

This is something of a huge deal. I'm hoping that this is the main focus of the next book, and not something glossed over while Cat runs around stabbing people.

I think there was an argument about Callow minting their own currency, which fell on the side of not because it would be seen as antagonistic to the Tower. I can't find that tidbit at the moment. I think it involved Ratface.

As for provisioning soldiers? If by "the southern farms were essentially bombed" you mean the Summer Fae incursion, then that was not explicitly stated, was it? The Fae were targeting people, presumably in population centers like small towns or cities, not torching land. Land doesn't scream. The Fae can't hunt land. So, the crops in the south were not necessarily lost. And rural farmers probably avoided death by dint of being too sparse to bother with.

Money is the most immediate problem for Callow's war machine. If the army doesn't pay, people desert, but Callowan patriotism might mitigate desertion. Anyway, the money problem can be addressed by Callow minting their own currency, then pushing the problem on into the future where spoils of war or land grants or militarily enforced foreign trade could make up the difference. As you've mentioned, Callow does not have any foreign trade now that the Tower has cut them off, so they can pull all sorts of monetary shenanigans without making themselves worse off right off the bat. If they can manage the transition between foreign coin and Callowan coin then avoid military induced inflation in the local prices of necessities, they're golden.

Hell, without foreign trade siphoning it away, Callow probably has a surplus of food.

The less immediate problem for Callow's war machine is acquiring the materials with which to wage war, which off the top of my head I classify as: 1) food, 2) shelter, 3) armaments, 4) supply train, 5) siege machines, 6) goblin munitions.

1. Food is something that Callow has in abundance, this is cannon from the Black Knight's little black book.

2. Shelter is presumably not a today problem, because it's not winter and they're still in Callow--so they may rely on existing garrison infrastructure.

3. *Armaments are a problem.* Gotta get that good steel. Probably from the Goblins or the Deoraithe. I don't remember Callow proper being described as having mines. This is doubly important for the Drow plan Cat is going with, since the Drow were described as low tech. This needs to be addressed in-universe in my opinion.

4. Expanding supply trains is not a today problem either. Callow is raising armies, likely near garrisons and cities. This only becomes an issue for new mobilization, which occurs after training.

5. Siege machines! Pickler's were nuked. This is a concern for the next armed conflict, but that next conflict might still be a ways off. There's nothing to suggest that these require anything scarcer than time to build--timber and rope are common.

6. Goblin munitions are being addressed, re: the envoy mentioned in this chapter.

I think it would have been better had Cat said 'Well, time to print our own currency' than 'Empty the treasury'. And also addressed armaments as well as munitions with the emissary. Otherwise we're on point for a huge army... and Callow as a failed state if that army is not successful enough.

Not so, unfortunately for Callow. Back in between Summer and the Diabolist, and before the latest round of slaughter (and before Malicia started sending refugees specifically to be a problem) Cat said:

#+begin_quote
  Ahead of us lay plains that had once been green, before Summer came to own them. Now half the land was scorched black and the rest lusher than was possible in Creation. Orchards bore fruits regardless of the season, fields already harvested grew again tall and golden wheat. *There would be food shortages, in the coming months.* My homeland had seen war twice in three years, this one even more devastating than the last. *Even if the blackened earth was made cultivable again, how many of those fields would lack men to till them?* Summer had killed many, harmed more and I knew Akua would bring deeper wounds still.

I'm sure there are lots of clever options available, but the book has stressed many times how difficult this is going to be for Callow, and now most of the experts who would have dealt with these problems are dead, and there are major issues with replacing them.

This is a storm of critical issues that Cat needs to deal with, and I think she needs to do it on screen.

******** Calling it /solved/ is somewhat hasty. They don't have food to spare for refugees, that's for certain. The farmland in the south is still all but gone, and there's apparently no one to work it. Plenty of other land has been torched in the various other wars callow's fought in recently. Now they're pulling everyone away from the Fields of Streges - This is all obviously going to limit their production quite significantly, especially if even more men are taken from the fields elsewhere into the Army of Callow.

The last we heard about Denier and Summerholm's food supplies, their granaries had been "all but emptied". Now Laure is apparently out of wine.

I've been searching backwards and forwards through the story, and I can't find one instance of where food in Callow has been plentiful recently. What there have been is mentions of food running out and the concern that people are going to go hungry soon. Maybe they can hold out for a while. But eventually "soon" becomes "now", especially if all the policies we see Cat taking are ones that exacerbate the problem.

********** Maybe? A magical solution would probably be the neater than a complicated socio-economic policy that takes years or decades. But I'm also not sure if human sacrifices can actually help?

The best description we have of Prasei field sacrifices, afaik, is the one from book 3 chapter 66 Refrain:

#+begin_quote
  “On the third month of the year I found myself on the outskirts of the city of Okoro, and stumbled upon one of the famous Praesi field rituals. The throats of ten and three men were slit on dusty ground, and from the lifeblood spilled the earth turned from yellow to black. Granted audience with the lord presiding, I asked him the meaning of the ceremony. ‘Everywhere men bleed,' he told me. ‘In Praes we get the full worth of it.'”
#+end_quote

If the best human sacrifices just increase the fertility of the soil.. I don't think that helps too much? Best case scenario is that it helps clean up some of the south.

Maybe there are other rituals or spells? I really can't make guesses at the limits of the magic system, tbh, or what problend it can and can't trivially solve.

I'm not quite sure. Most of the crusaders either drowned in a lake that became a marsh, or ran away. I don't think there was much lootable gear to be found, especially since most of the crusaders were under-equipped.

Sure, Procer's gonna be brutalized, but they have their entire army + 30,000 Levantines to stall The Dead King for months. And with his invasion of Procer, the need for an army immediately disappears, no? Ashur will keep Praesi forces divided on defense and unable to invade Callow.

  We have been looking south all those years, and *now Evil wakes*. Do you think the Tower will stand alone, when their Legions spill out onto the continent? The Dead King will rise from his slumber and drown the world in death. *The Everdark will band under a single banner and etch the Tenets of Night in blood across our cities.* The Chain of Hunger grows larger and bolder every spring, and when they come it will not be in warbands -- their hordes will blot out the horizon.
#+end_quote

And this is contrasted with an earlier mention in Akua's interlude [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/][Villainous Interlude - Coup de Theatre]]:

#+begin_quote
  /We are the last of our breed, Malicia. The last great villains of Calernia, perhaps in all of Creation./

  *The drow of the Everdark had collapsed into bickering tribes unworthy of the ruins they haunted.* The Chain of Hunger was nothing more than a horde of starving rats, as incapable of villainy as any other animal. The Dead King, that famed monster who'd turned his entire kingdom into undead and invaded the very devils who'd thought to trick him, had not stirred from beyond his borders in centuries. Stygia and Bellerophon had been muzzled by the other cities in the League, reduced to petty border disputes, and the same city of Helike that had broken the Principate's back under the Unconquered now flinched in the face of Procer's displeasure.
#+end_quote

I'm getting the feeling that this is all going to turn into a Good vs. Evil (and Evil vs. Evil, and especially Callow vs. Almost Everyone) showdown sooner rather than later, especially since the only Evil faction in Akua's monologue that are not now gaining in power is the Chain of Hunger.

*** Also, strictly speaking, didn't Cat get just about everything she set out to gain from the Dead King? Her goal was to use his invasion to take the threat off of Callow, while maintaining plausible deniability. This is exactly what she currently has, save that she was not able to negotiate a delay that would let civilians.

On the other hand, scrying is not necessarily secure. We've been told this on any number of occasions, and explicitly in this chapter. Whether or not she is headed for the drow lands, I suspect that she said this meaning for it to be overheard. Just as likely, it's a bit of misdirection before she heads somewhere else. Or maybe even the whole gang will go to Thalassina to see Warlock.

That's just what I was thinking. She needed an army to stop Procer from invading again, and now that Procer is going to be invaded instead, Cat doesn't have an immediate need for an army. The only real danger is TDK and Praes turning on her after Procer is destroyed. Or, y'know, TDK taking over the world. Which is a legitimate concern, but I'm not sure if trying to get the drow on board is going to be much better, if it's even possible.

***** She didn't even really "need an army". Her plan at the start was explicitly /not/ to ally with Keter in any public way, but instead to use his "completely independent" invasion as a counterpoint that would strengthen her own position.

**** Malicia keeps kicking Cat, and some parts of Callow are described as poor for farming. What's to stop her having written in a provision about the King getting a chunk of Callow? One of the bits Malicia doesn't want, of course.

*** They don't have half a year. They had four months befor Papenhein would have digged a pass through Red Flower mountains, and they already spent over a half of that.

Also, the Levantines are to the south of the Iserran lake and will have to move either against the Black Knight or the Tyrant, which means that the only force that's going to be in Dead King's path for now are twenty five thousand beaten and half-starved crusaders, eleven heroes that had trouble holding back Cat, much less Revenants, and whatever garrisons that will be left in Cleves and Hainaut by the time they arrive.

They have to stop digging now or the DK is going to murder-rape their entire kingdom, Callow is safe from Procer until that war is over which could take years.

***** Klaus already let the Black Knight loose. I know that sitting out Dead King's invasion is a political suicide, especially for a Lycaonese, but he still has an option of leaving a portion of his forces to dig, since marching to the north will take long enough that taking everyone he has may not matter that much, while the the army of princess Rosala is already there.
