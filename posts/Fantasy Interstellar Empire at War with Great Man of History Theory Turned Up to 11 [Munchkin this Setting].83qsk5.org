So I had a thought for a setting that might be interesting to consider. I don't usually go for design-a-specific-setting posts, but I thought this one might be interesting for [[/r/rational]] to try and munchkin. The idea sort of grew out of what I know of Nanoha, except I've never actually watched Nanoha so it probably doesn't look much like this. The main points are:

- An empire stretching across a thousand or more planets

- An enemy that represents a serious existential threat to the empire, with no hope of reconciliation or integration - it's a fight to the death. For the sake of conversational consistency, say they're legions of demons invading from Hell destroying entire planets.

- An incredibly low incidence rate for high-level mages/fighters -a few dozen in the entire empire at the top-end (we'll call them "Champions" here, again for conversational consistency), each capable of winning battles not involving other Champions or a similar level of force single-handedly

- A much higher incidence rate for much weaker mages/fighters - an asymptotic relationship between power and commonality perhaps, such that cannon fodder is plenty, but only really serves to try and tip the scales aiding stronger fighters, or if none are available desperately hold the line until one can come or at least slow the enemy's advance

What would the structure of such an Empire look like? Would the Champions be ruling the Empire through an inability to meaningfully oppose them, or would their being absolutely vital to the war effort and inability to leave the front lines prevent this? What would an interstellar army/navy based around supporting a few key individuals look like? How would they prioritise and plan a war where a fully inhabited planet is worth less than a single Champion, unless one of those people also happens to be a nascent Champion themselves? What would a society look like where people are told they can't ever be as important as these few heroes, but are still a non-negligible factor in supporting them when taken as a whole?

And most importantly, what innovations would you implement to try and squeeze out those extra few fractions of a percent of probability of winning the war and saving the empire/human race?


** The thing about people with that staggering level of personal power is that they pretty much do what they want. If the empire still exists, it means that a fine-tuned propaganda machine is making sure that most Champions are holding the front lines... But if a few decide they'd much rather seize political power, nobody's going to be able to stop them. As a result, you've probably got a Champion aristocracy that desperately pushes the message of how it's incredibly noble and glorious and inspiring to go fight the Demon menace, especially Champions, not them, no, don't you see how it's just as important that they remain back here, organizing the war effort? And they probably believe it, too, even if a regular Joe could do just as well with training.

*** A sadly possible state of affairs, though if the enemy was sufficiently strong enough that not having every Champion on the front lines meant the probable defeat/extermination of the empire, do you think they'd all stay out fighting out of necessity, or would a few seize power anyway, to rule over the collapse and death of their people?

But if it's a close enough thing that one Champion is the difference between destruction and survival, then I think it more likely that things would reach an equilibrium, with the Empire retreating and ceding volume until the remaining Champions were enough to defend what remained, probably with a volitile oscillating border region where Champions and Demons batter back and forth, mostly just trying to avoid losing any further systems.

***** Nothing's ever certain in war - it's often not clear who's actually winning. I think your scenario is depressingly realistic, but on the other hand the pool of Champions is sufficiently small that it's not infeasible none of them are that selfish. Jerk-ness of that level is sufficiently uncommon a trait IRL in a developed polity (which a space-faring civilisation spanning a thousand worlds probably is, though I suppose magic might throw that out of whack) that if you got 26 people in a room, there's not terrible odds that they're all actually pretty reasonable.

Of course, assholes do exist and tend to stand out more, so there's certainly no guarantee. Maybe power would be sufficiently corrupting that one or more reasonable people would be selfish jerks in that position anyway? Does the corrupting influence of power even really apply if you don't have to struggle to maintain it through politics? Even kings gifted power by right of birth have to manage their court - would someone whose power couldn't be taken away from them behave the same way as examples from human history, who have always had to maintain their positions one way or another?

******* Additionally, I think that well-intentioned change of policy through force would cause at least some Champions to begin bumbling into politics. Even though the empire is on a war footing there will likely be divisive policies that could see Champions coming to arms if there's a sufficient amount of polarization. Traditional government methods of population control during wartime wouldn't work as well should a Champion decide to go rogue.

Perhaps a King Arthur-esque code of conduct managed internally between the Champions themselves? Otherwise I can't see the empire being able to hold the Champions accountable for their actions.

*** I think one way to stabilise this would be if the Champions had a weakness, or a need, that can be satisfied only by the rest of the Empire. Think of something like Navigators from Dune, that need a constant flow of Spice. There could be a resource whose extraction depends on the Empire, and without that their magic runs out. In that situation they'd be more compelled to cooperate. In peaceful times they'd probably start their own internal feuds over who gets to rule the others, but a common enemy might just be the thing to unite them.

*** Not necessarily. There are thousands of planets to govern after all, if a large enough bureaucracy exists it could prevent the Champions from actually accomplishing anything. They can only be in one place at once and need people to delegate to after all. I would imagine that the major political positions would be in the hands of Champions, not necessarily because they want them but because they would have so much power given to them that it would just be a formality to go a step further. But their ability to actually make changes to the empire would be limited by how much paperwork they have to go through. Kind of like how the US is set up: there are so many things you have to do to make a major change one person can't screw up everything (not that certain people aren't making a good effort at it). And if they're too busy fighting they won't have time to do anything with their titles anyway.

** The thought I had that made me come see what you guys made of this was the idea of Orbital Drop Shock Healers/Medics being deployed en masse into a battlefield to attempt to stabilise/extract a wounded Champion, as their lives are worth so much less than a single top-tier fighter. Or those same healers being deployed into city where a wounded Champion is, and just going straight through buildings and infrastructure on the basis that the tiny chance those seconds saved matter is more valuable than the cost of repairing those buildings.

The absurdity of a setting where this was considered not only possible but obviously a good idea appealed to me, and inspired me to post since you could probably come up with some other fairly wacky concepts based around such extreme scales of value (that's probably not the right description, but I'm struggling to come up with a better one.)

  In the latter half of the 25th century, humanity finds itself locked in total war against alien invaders. The Cephalopods attacked without warning and for no discernible reason. Their weapons have a significant technological edge over humans, and the science with which they build their wormhole generators to spread into human space is inconceivable to humanity's most brilliant minds and AIs. The only hope for turning the battle in humanity's favor lies within its aloof allies: the enigmatic Incubators, and the direct consequences of their meddling into human affairs: nigh-invulnerable augmented superhumans able to bend the rules of causality itself. They are known as... magical girls.

Less than 50, though I could probably have made that stand out more, since it's arguably the point the entire setting/thought experiment hinges on. I'll edit it for clarity.

I am indeed reading To The Stars. I very much enjoy it and I can see the similarities, though that doesn't have quite the level of "entire worlds are sacrificed rather than expose this one mage to unacceptable levels of risk" levels of absurdity I'm looking for here.

** Need more detail to this Empire. What method of communication and FTL does it use? How long has it existed? Is the Emperor/Empress also a Champion? How is leadership determined... is it by bloodline, whoever can seize power, whoever the mightiest Champion is? Is the leader actually in control or just a figurehead?

Knowing these details helps set up a baseline by which you can develop their enemies. For instance, if your Empire has some Star Trek/Star Wars style of FTL (where ships have a vastly reduced travel time that can go almost anywhere if they spend time plotting a course), and their 'existential enemies' have another kind (say, rolling with the "Demon" thing, they don't really use FTL so much as open gateways through which their troops move), you can set up the threat that way and give each side different advantages and disadvantages.

How do the Champions "level up" and what is the reasoning behind such limited numbers? Does the power come from an outside source that grants it? Is it based on some simple, yet horrific method--ie: each person you kill grants you a tiny piece of their power, thus encouraging the tabletop murderhobo mentality to slaughter as many things as possible to raise in levels? Is it a Highlander thing where each time a Champion kills another they gain their power, and at some point that power was once spread out over a larger population but is slowly coalescing into one great uber-being?

#+begin_quote
  What would the structure of such an Empire look like?
#+end_quote

That's why we need details, as above.

#+begin_quote
  Would the Champions be ruling the Empire through an inability to meaningfully oppose them, or would their being absolutely vital to the war effort and inability to leave the front lines prevent this?
#+end_quote

Again, as above. Is a Champion the Emperor/Empress? Or is there some system of controlling them, whether concrete (some magic or tech item or power that enforces obedience) or abstract (a warrior code like /bushido/ that ensures they have no desire or time to bother with ruling).

#+begin_quote
  What would an interstellar army/navy based around supporting a few key individuals look like?
#+end_quote

This one's easy. Basically the "typical" sci-fi nation's interstellar navy. The Empire, assuming it uses ships with FTL, will still need non-military ships like Freighters, Tankers, and Transports to haul all its men and material around, trade allowing worlds to flourish where they normally lack certain materials needed for survival (mining world needs food, industry world needs resources, farming world needs goods--miniature "triangular trade"). Because of this, there will need to be many military and police vessels. The influence of the Champions depends on how well they function in space. Can they grant powers or be a power source for their ships? Can one high-level fighter leap from vessel to vessel across kilometers of void whilst cutting half-mile long starships in twain with a slice of his massive space-katana? Or are they more like Super-Marines whose job is to inject themselves into enemy flagships and neutralize them.

Chances are, they'd have specific ships made just for them, with the vessel itself conforming to their style. Mage Ships would likely be large, complicated things with massive "thaumic sails" that gather standing magical energy like a solar sail but direct it toward the center Sanctum of the craft for the Mage to cast massively oversized spells from all the focused mana. A high-level fighter's "ship" would be either some massively overarmored vessel that can soak up tons of damage so he can deploy into the middle of the enemy fleet and start breaking things--or just have it drop from orbit (perhaps with some adamantium-style 'base plate') and crush an enemy army whilst producing an "instant fortress" on the enemy's world... or it could be more of a giant mecha rather than a 'ship' allowing him to use his skills on a much grander scale.

#+begin_quote
  How would they prioritise and plan a war where a fully inhabited planet is worth less than a single Champion, unless one of those people also happens to be a nascent Champion themselves?
#+end_quote

Define "fully inhabited". How is that measured? Is it enough for its main industry to reach a certain level? X millions or billions of people dependent on size?

#+begin_quote
  And most importantly, what innovations would you implement to try and squeeze out those extra few fractions of a percent of probability of winning the war and saving the empire/human race?
#+end_quote

The most obvious would be determining the basis of the Enemy's own "Champion" system, if it exists, or a Pacific Rim-style possibility of assembling a team of powerful Champions to raid the Enemy's own home territory and stop them at the source.

*** Entirely reasonable points. I was envisioning the setting as being made up of planets throughout the galaxy being inhabited by humans of varying tech levels (the highest of which being builders of FTL-capable ships) as though sprinkled there in the very distant past and left to their own devices, and the Empire as being by far the largest united polity of those with space travel. I was imagining the planets as being roughly comparable to Earth's population, but I suppose it might be more reasonable/realistic to say population varies by planet size and tech level.

In a setting where everyone is theoretically capable of magic with knowledge and training (though not every planet is necessarily aware of this), a Champion would be someone who possessed an extraordinarily large/pure/positive-adjective source of internal power, randomly occurring throughout the galaxy incredibly rarely. Perhaps it's possible to steal these sources from corpses and replace your own with them - that would make the loss of a Champion to enemy forces doubly catastrophic, assuming they can make use of them.

The Empire is made up of a significantly more planets than there are Champions, and the latter are sufficiently rare than the former that the successful defence/annexing of a planet would not be worth losing a champion over - not even close. The foe is ill-defined, but presents a serious existential threat to an extremely hard-pressed Empire and the galaxy as a whole, such that having Champions /not/ on the front lines would be a serious blow to the chances of winning the war and thus surviving - though I suppose if one wanted to rule enough to risk the difference meaning the collapse of their civilisation and species, no one would be able to stop them.

I was also envisioning fighting as being Nanoha-esque from the few clips I've seen of the show - flying mages shooting giant lasers and other attack/utility spells at one another, capable of personal space flight but probably not personal FTL. (This may not actually be representative of Nanoha combat, I haven't watched more than a few clips.) A ship powered by a mage is also an interesting concept though, and I'm not designing an entire system of magic, so that could totally be possible - though if it's deriving the vast majority of its' power from a single mage, they might be better off not having a ship so as to dodge more effectively? Perhaps the Champions are sufficiently individualistic enough that they have different approaches, with some tanking up in massive dreadnoughts and others preferring to fly around and dodge attacks instead?

The aim of the setting was to examine how such a people would develop under these conditions and pressures - especially the absurd value/power imbalance between Champions and everyone else - so I deliberately didn't design a system of government. I'd be interested in hearing how other people think they'd set themselves up.

**** So...it's less grimdark 40k but Primarchs occur naturally is what I'm getting. The goal of the military would mostly to fight a conventional war (conventional for space combat anyway). There are so few champions that only a small amount of the military would be based around them, trying to get them to where they are needed as quickly as possible. Depending on how well it works, a viable strategy could be to launch a RKKV at a planet whenever an enemy champion shows up on it, in which case no one brings out their champions. Or, if the enemy seems to have an endless supply, then the strategy would be to have teams of champions gank an enemy one whenever it shows up. The problem is there are so few champions and so many planets that most theaters wouldn't ever see one. They would just move between the largest battles basically putting out fires, most military strategy wouldn't change.

An interesting question is what did the empire look like before the enemy showed up? Did champions exist, in which case they're probably in charge. Otherwise, they're probably too busy fighting to be in charge. Most people are actually pretty decent and would fight against guaranteed extinction if they got superpowers. The ones who wouldn't would be policed by the others, and like I said above they probably wouldn't be able to make any major changes through the bureaucracy that would build up in an interstellar empire.

In that case, you should decide--fairly early on--what the actual /source/ of them is. Take Worm, for instance. Wildbow already had the whole "Passenger"/Worm thing down from the very beginning, though the audience didn't discover enough details until much later. Basically, /why/ are these powers random? Or are they really? Does it being random further your story? Or is it better if there's a reason? You could spoof on the whole "/Hero of light and good/ rises up to challenge the /Dark Lord/" standard fantasy trope, and turn it on its ear. IE: Each world above a certain population will have a Light and Dark Champion, their power determined on some characteristic--how many people they can sway or simply the population of their homeworld. Or perhaps they will have only one, whichever "won" and broke the cycle on their world. In any event, the Empire accepts all kinds, so long as they obey its rules and edicts. This gives incentives for some of the Champions to care about certain people (their own) as well as the greater existential threat, but otherwise have great conflict with each other.

#+begin_quote
  The foe is ill-defined,
#+end_quote

That's fine from the "perceptions of the audience" standpoint, but you as the writer better well define at least the "skeleton" of who/what they are, what they do, and why they do it. It doesn't have to be in much detail, and you can flesh it out as you go, but its very important so that the Enemy has some level of consistency and isn't just randomly changing methods and motives at the drop of a hat.

#+begin_quote
  A ship powered by a mage is also an interesting concept though
#+end_quote

Well, *my* initial version was a Mage powered by a ship. But you can do it this way, too. In my previous reply, I posited the existence of ships that had massive "mana collecting solar sails" that could funnel all that power to the Mage at the center. Where on a planet he could annihilate hundreds of people with powerful spells, this grants him exponentially more short-term power, allowing his magic to scale up to the level of being a threat to fleets of enemy vessels.

Of course, you could always have them just be themselves, inside tiny bubbles of magic to keep them alive, darting about and unleashing magical wrath on a fleet. If anything, that might be /scarier/ than the above because it would be almost impossible to target them with ship mounted weaponry or even recognize that they are in the fight until its too late.

Or you could roll with all of that.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps the Champions are sufficiently individualistic enough that they have different approaches, with some tanking up in massive dreadnoughts and others preferring to fly around and dodge attacks instead?
#+end_quote

Yep, that's what I was suggesting. The heavy fighter types use a style that suits them, the mages, etc. You've got the more archery or rogue-like hero down with the high-speed evasive type that does strategic attacks. Plenty of room for them all!

If there's not even one Champion per planet, then the answer to this is "not very different from how it would be if they didn't exist", at least as far as the common civilians are concerned. A Champion would be a rare being to interact with, unless you happen to be at the target of one of their military attacks. Where it would really affect things would be at the level of the Militaries, whose tactics and such would be in a more 'supporting' role... sure, you might have your space marines attacking and boarding enemy ships, your strike craft captains leading daring raids on enemy logistics and such, but all of them would be mere window dressing and cannon fodder to the Champions.

** Ooh, this reminds me of something else, actually - the xianxia-derived world of Cradle, by Will Wight. It's a super hierarchical society based on practicing the paths of the sacred arts. Each level is exponentially stronger than the last one, and exponentially more difficult to reach. As an example, one of the plots has a bunch of fantastically powerful forest sects politically maneuvering around each other, trying to squeeze a motherlode of magical resources dry as quickly as they can. Why? Because they're level n at highest, and there are vague rumors that a level n+1 will appear and take everything. The only society is really kept in check because a level n+2 has seized the position of Emperor and wrangles the otherwise impossibly powerful level n+1 leaders of the local branches of clans into fighting against terrible, terrible threats. The only reason the whole thing is even stable is because of benevolence from those at even higher levels stepping in occasionally, and even at the highest of levels, there's a constant battle against chaos that's constantly on the edge of being lost.

** First, I imagine the political system would look very feudal. There would be a head champion (king) who rules the empire, with the rest of the champions acting as lords who check the kings power (constitutional monarchy). A government composed of regular people would have no way to make champions follow them. Arguments for morality and responsibility only go so far. With great power comes great responsibility, however. This ruling class would go to war frequently, and fighting and winning against demons would be the main source of prestige.

Militarily, I imagine that the Champions would focus on mobility. There are very few of them and a large area to cover. To compensate, the champions would travel around in groups launching decisive strikes and then redeploying elsewhere. Spreading the champions too thin drastically increases the risk that they will get caught and killed. By fighting in groups, they will be able to cover each other and retreat if necessary.

Finally, the empire would focus a lot of effort into producing more champions. The way someone becomes a champion is not specified, but however it occurs it would be encouraged. If being a champion is genetic, we would see extensive obligations from the family of champions. Arranged marriages designed to produce champion heirs would be common. If being a champion is decided randomly at birth, we would see a massive empire wide fertility program. More babies would increase the chances of getting a new champion. If champions are made through learning and skill, we would see massive investments in public education, and the formation of battle schools (like Ender's Game).

I guess the easy option of cloning wouldn't work, but I would create a system to track the development of every person in the empire, and try to learn which factors cause more Champions to appear. Experiment with those factors to prove the hypotesis, and implement it on a large scale when proven.

The obvious play is to rkv all champions in support of the demons from hell in their anti-imperialist struggle.
