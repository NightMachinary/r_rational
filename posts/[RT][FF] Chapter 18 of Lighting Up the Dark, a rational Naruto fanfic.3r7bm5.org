*** As a counterpoint, it could be extremely dangerous to be promoted to Chunin before you are ready, which can happen if your teammate totally carries you through the exam. Also, I feel like her's is a pretty reasonable and realistic (though perhaps not rational) emotional response to 1) seeing that your teammate doesn't respect you or trust your abilities (esp. in a domain you consider a particular strength) and 2) going through a high stress situation and probably working really hard to accomplish something and not let down your team, only to find out that nothing you did mattered. Desiring communication from your teammates is pretty reasonable.

** Very nice. I always enjoy the cheat-to-win test in the Chunin Exams.

At first I was thinking people might deliberately write down wrong answers and "accidentally" let their opponents copy them, then they themselves simply don't hand in those sheets. Then I remembered that you don't get penalized for wrong answers, so that would just be a waste.

Ino should have used her mind control jutsu to sabotage others instead of just steal answers. She could have made them run around tearing up other people's answer sheets, which would have gotten the possessed person so many negative points they would have been out, along with their entire team, and would have ruined the ability of the attacked person to turn in answer sheets without stealing someone else's. That would have been a great way to take Gaara out -- possess Temari or her brother and get them DQ'd by sabotaging other students and then punching out an invigilator. (Also, why 'invigilator' instead of the more usual 'proctor'?)

*** I think if Ino had been so blatant in her use of her abilities, the invigilators would have officially spotted them, at which point she'd risk being penalised for every individual thing she did through a possessed body. In the event, she did do some sabotage - as we see from Shikamaru's instruction - but sparsely and only as applied to specific targets.

I don't really know which is more common of "invigilator" and "proctor" - I heard both while at university - so I went with the one I felt sounded better.

diraniola is right about Shikamaru's method, although it would have required certain adjustments, since Shikamaru doesn't use shadow clones and doing it by hand is a bad idea for multiple reasons.

** Examiners: "The rules require that you write the question and answer on the answer sheets. Answer sheets were described as being, and I quote, 'in front of you' at the start of the test. Since your clones were not in front of you at that moment, clones are not considered answer sheets and all answers given on clones disguised as answer sheets are disqualified. Also, you seem to have created the clones with pre-written answers, violating the rule that you write the question and answer, so you'd have been disqualified on that basis alone".

Or even more simply: "Ninjas are expected to understand orders, not blindly follow their literal words. Cloning yourself into answer sheets may fit the literal words of the rules, but clearly doesn't indicate actual comprehension of the intent behind them. Disqualified."

This chapter is bothersome because it seems to use the geek fallacy of "what I did is what you literally asked for, so you have nothing to complain about" thinking the world works like a computer program. There may be one or two cases, such as with bureaucracies, where you can get away with it, but it usually fails miserably; in the real world it just gets you marked as a smartass. Naruto here is like the person who sees items on sale for 0.50 cents and tries to buy 200 of them for a dollar, even though context makes it obvious that someone meant $0.50 and just didn't write it down properly.

It doesn't automatically follow from "this exam is meant to test cheating" that the exam is meant to test every single thing that could conceivably fall under "cheating".

It would be one thing if Naruto sat down and actually thought "let's see, given my understanding of what the examiners are trying to do, would they accept cloning answer sheets? I believe they would". It's another thing if Naruto just acts as though of /course/ cloning answer sheets /has/ to be acceptable because he literally followed the rules and hey, who could ever complain about literally following the rules?

"I did not say I exhaustively listed everything that affects your score. So I'll dock you 200 points for ignoring common sense. You only /inferred/ that I described every single thing that affects your score."

"I didn't say what a 'correct' question-answer pair is. You only /inferred/ that I defined it as 'expresses correct facts' rather than 'expressed correct facts and was produced using an acceptable method'."

"I didn't describe what a 'pair' is. In particular, you only /inferred/ that two instances of the same (by information content) pair counts as two pairs."

Nor is it an exam in which the examinees are told "here is a list of ways in which you can cheat; use these and no others". It's not a test of how well ninja can follow orders; we've just had one of those. It's a test of cheating ability, which includes both technical proficiency and creativity. How do you envision the examiners justifying their disqualification? "Sorry, Uzumaki, you fail the cheating test because you broke the rules too hard"?

They could, but that would signify a lack of "actual comprehension of the intent behind the rules". The purpose of the rules is to provide a structure within which some ninja can prove themselves better at tests/cheating than others. Even if the examiners have the power to fail someone arbitrarily using the reasoning you describe, exercising that power would undermine said purpose.

Naruto already understands what the exam is /for/. It's for testing people's academic and cheating abilities. His trick proves that he has both, and does not break the exam for other people (except Sakura).

Beyond that, he has no responsibility to the examiners to complete the exam in a way that follows some unstated rules which he has to guess to succeed.

Imagine if real-life exams worked that way. "Well, you've given an answer that follows the rules we've given you, and shows us that you have sufficient knowledge of the subject to receive a passing grade. But we're going to fail you anyway because you failed to model the examiner's mind".

As one further note, having to model the examiner's mind unfairly advantages Leaf ninja, who may be more familiar with the examiners or with Leaf's approach to exams in general.

Not understanding them is just another way of describing lack of social skills, and understanding them but using plausible deniability of "you can't prove that the rules actually require that, so you're just making me guess" is just being a jerk.

It works on universally shared rules, such that not knowing them marks you as abnormal - "lacking social skills". There are some exam rules which we can assume to be universally shared - "write in a language the examiner can understand", for example. "Cheat using methods A, B and C, but not method Z", is in no way universally shared. In fact, it couldn't be, because as you point out, only a minority of ninja could ever use clones that way, so Naruto would never have been in a situation where he was told that using shadow clones was an exception to the list of things he was allowed to do with his ninjutsu.

Do you have any basis for that claim? In the event, the rate was at least 1/90, as of 180 ninja at least 2 (Shikamaru and Naruto) considered it a valid strategy.

#+begin_quote
  They do. Try doing your driver's license test riding a bicycle on the grounds that the examiner forgot to tell you to use a car.
#+end_quote

That harks back to the purpose of the exam. The reason you'd fail your driver's license test on a bicycle is because riding a bicycle would not allow you to prove that you are capable of driving a car. Yes, there is an implicit rule, but that implicit rule has an obvious and explicit reason. There is no obvious and explicit reason why using your skills to successfully cheat should be penalised in an exam whose purpose is to test whether you can use your skills to successfully cheat.

The claim you've made is that modeling the examiner's mind is part of the test, not that guessing their attitude to clones specifically is part of the test (which would unfairly disadvantage Naruto). Presumably, you'd raise the same objection to any other activity that violated the stated rules, like stealing someone else's completed answer sheets and using an ink manipulation technique to change the printed name and seat number. If every ninja capable of breaking the rules you deem unbreakable has to model the examiner's mind, then Leaf ninja will have an unfair advantage.

It's your story. When violating the stated rules violates the implicit rules, and how narrow or wide the implicit rules are, depends purely on your say-so. I can't really object on the grounds that Naruto went against the examiners' implicit desires when he obviously didn't.

However, for Naruto to win on that basis would have to mean that he sat down and thought "judging from what the examiners seem to want, I believe that using clones this way falls within the parameters they would consider acceptable". (And it wouldn't be a "guess"; assessing what one's opponents are likely to do is a skill, not the equivalent of guessing a password.)

What it would /not/ mean is that Naruto thinks his solution /has/ to work because anyone can see that he didn't break any explicit rules, and as long as you don't break any explicit rules, other people are automatically obliged to accept what you did. There are lots of people like that on the quasi-real-life that is the Internet, and Naruto pattern-matches to them far more strongly than he does to a specialist who figured out that the implicit rules are particularly loose just this one time.

*********** There were three foreseeable outcomes of the "Cloned Sheet Strategy":

- Examiner goes along
- Examiner disqualifies you
- Examiner pops the clones

One is advantageous, one is neutral and one is disadvantageous. Statistics says he should go with it.

Furthermore, exam could as well have had written "Let's see how well you cheat" on the metaphorical forehead. Cheating is promoted, getting caught is not, and this is because in the life of a ninja, cheating is success, getting caught is torture and death.

This said, there is a last thing to take into consideration. If you give the results of your cheating to a favourable party (as in, one taking the role of a Kage) they will commend you for your cheating. If you give them to an objecting party they will punish you.

So the examiner will either favour you or fail you, depending on their antagonism. In terms of decision theory, this is a fifty/fifty scenario.

Naruto has chosen to be an optimist, and in doing so has taken a risk that might have been avoided.

But this risk was taken against high odds of defeat, so I guess that all in all is a viable choice.

I hope this is clear.

** If the questions are all unique, why was Sasuke blindly copying from a genin a few rows away? The text said nothing about Sasuke being able to see the genin's text to make sure they were the /right/ questions to copy.

Also, who was the Naruto-clone disguised as? The only blonde females I can think of would be female-naruto or Temari. Or was he just disguised as a random blonde ninja?

Besides, if Ibiki thought there was an invasion currently happening, they /would/ cancel the exam immediately. Not doing so would be even more suspicious, as it would indicate that Leaf was fully prepared and could afford to keep the exam going even under such circumstances.

In fact, it would be a legitimate strategy for luring out traitorous sound/sand Genin. If they reacted to the news differently to anyone else, they would have exposed themselves while literally surrounded by loyal Genin who outnumbered them thirty-to-one, plus Ibiki and the Jōnin examiner.

*** It doesn't matter whether they are the "right questions" since you get points for any correct "question number" + "answer" pair. What I'm more concerned about is confirming that the copied answers are correct. I'm not sure how Naruto managed to get every question right since the questions were stated to be so difficult. You would expect some incorrect answers to be passed around, and Naruto would need to know the answers himself to either correct these responses or choose between various options. Maybe as questions are collected by better cheaters, answers are corrected (since being better at answering questions and being better at cheated are probably correlated), but this process wouldn't be perfect. (Edit: I was confused.)

Also, even if Sasuke did need answers to his specific questions, he could just blindly copy random people who seem to be writing a lot and erase/cross out any useless info.

**** Naruto doesn't need to copy anyone. If we assume that Naruto is smart enough to correctly answer his own sheet, he can just copy that 199 times.

Alternatively, he can just dispel the clones he's put on the ceiling, which have a bird's eye view of the classroom. Between them, they have to get enough data to raise his number of correct questions to 10.

***** Ah okay, I misinterpreted a few things. First, I thought that the was able to answer the question you gave an example not only because he was smart but also because clones were a particular interest of his. Also, while I at first thought that he was using the test as an opportunity to observe his opponents, at some point I got the impression (I really can't say why) that he was using his vantage point to acquire /all/ of the question+answer combinations. This is unnecessary given his shadow clone strategy, and confused me for the reasons I mention above.

Actually, as you get points for each correct "question answer pair", you don't even need to go that far.

Solve the easiest question. Make as many copies of that question and answer as possible within the time limit. Win. 300 copies of question 1 is worth just as many points as 30 copies of all 10 questions, and it's quicker to solve and copy.

****** True. On the other hand, given that Naruto had nothing but time on his hands during the exam, there's no reason why he wouldn't have a go at solving the other questions anyway. It's also a more effective way of showing off - "look, I can complete the challenge as formally presented /and/ as implied".

***** Sorry, I don't think I understand. Naruto's got a question. He knows the answer to that question. He writes the number of the question and his answer. He does this, for this one, unique, specific question, 200 points. Does that count as 200 unique correct answers?

****** No, but then the rules at no point specified that the correct answers had to be unique. "For every correct question-answer pair handed in at the end of the test, you will receive one point."

Also, for clarity, he does this to a full sheet of 10 answers 200 times, for a total of 2000 points.

***** Good point. Still sort of inelegant, and every question still needs to be seen by someone who can generate the answer for Naruto to get them all right.

It's described in the story as "Two hundred copies of the exact same *sheet of correct answers*"
