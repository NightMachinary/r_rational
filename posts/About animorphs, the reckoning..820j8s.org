Is this series still going? I finally got to the end of chapter 44 (or 30 something, depending on how you count the interludes), and there is a big dramatic cliffhanger, or possibly a bad ending. It doesn't seem to have been updated in a long time, and I'm wondering if anyone could inform me about it?


** Tk17studios appears to be putting a lot of pressure on himself to release the next chapter soon. I find myself more concerned for his wellbeing than for the next chapter to be released. While I doubt it would be, I hope this thread isn't taken as more external pressure on him to produce quality Content faster

*** D: I hope not.

When I was viewing archive of our own it said last post was back in 2016, but it had also been edited a couple months ago at the end of 2017. the way the most recent chapter went i honestly didn't know if that was the end of the story or not, and this seemed like the place to ask.

** Still going, author juggles a ton of different projects at any given time, so the wait between chapters is variable.

**** The author made an accountability post a few days ago, promising to either have the next chapter out by March 1st or donate $100 to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. They [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zju4c/images_onlynot_an_updatesorryranimorphs/dv2b1h4/?context=0][made good on their promise]].
