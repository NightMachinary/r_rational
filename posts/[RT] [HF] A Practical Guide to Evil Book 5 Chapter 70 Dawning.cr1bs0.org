  She turned to me with burning golden eyes.

  “Do you not understand that the laughs should have been empty?” she hissed. “That it should have been artifice, at show put on for purpose. I am a better liar than any of them, Catherine Foundling, than any of you. I know the face of truth. After years of enmity all it took for them to make room for me by the fire was a word from you. /I could have had all of this years ago/.”

  'Mercy!' he said. `Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'

  'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, `do you believe in me or not?'

  'I do,' said Scrooge. `I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?'

  'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, `that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world - /oh, woe is me!/ - and witness what it cannot share, but /might have shared/ on earth, and /turned to happiness!/'

** Vivienne's absence worries me.

Edit: I can't wait to see Pilgrim *Behold* Ubua. I hope the next chapter will be from his PoV but I doubt it. It would reveal too much.

*** Honestly, Ubua feels more like the Woe than Viv at this point...

Well, this is what happens when you don't have a breadth of life experience. You don't know what you're missing out on and what your mistakes are until it's way too late.

What do you guys think Cat's plan for Akua is? Since she's immortal, I think Cat's either going to force her to act as the Headmaster of the school she's going to build, or to act as a neutral party to enforce the Accords onto the Named forever, similar to the Intecessor's current role.

*** I had a thought, back in book 4, that Cat was planning to turn Winter into the Accords. To bind the whole thing together with Oaths, so any who broke them would be instantly destroyed. She can't do that now, but I do feel the Accords need to be something more than just paper. They need an enforcing intelligence, something bound to them and neutral to all external conflict, to act as arbiter and executor of what will become the new Law. We'd call it an AI, but why make it artificial when you have a perfectly good soul to shove in there?

Akua will become the Shade of the Accords, bound to them as surely as she is bound to the Mantle of Woe right now. Her very thoughts will be constrained to follow only the Law, which will be made Law rather than mere law by her intelligence. All her cunning will be twisted to serve a higher purpose, her ego shattered, her individuality crushed, her memories remaining only as a reference and so what little of /her/ remains knows what it has lost.

She'll get what she always wanted: power and immortality. But it will come at the cost of her agency, her dignity, and her /self./ Her existence will become a single, eternal regret, and all creation will be better for it.

It's the longest price Cat can make her pay.

**** Have you commented this on the story?

I like this ending and I want the author to steal it.

** Question from someone who binged PGtE book by book: is there word on how much longer the current one will take? My gums are starting to bleed, there's so many things in progress r/n and I haven't been able to /really/ indulge in reading for months

*** This one will probably wrap up at least whatever's about to go down in Salia, and that, together with the fact that every next book is 25 or so chapters longer than the previous one, may mean up to the same amount of chapters as there currently is (likely less; consider that this book and the fourth were originally part of the same one, split roughly in half due to the over bloated Everdark arc, which gives us the low estimate of another 20-30 chapters).

*** Could be in five chapters now, or another few dozen. No way to know, really, but there aren't really any major plot threads that need to be resolved by the end of the book, except one.
