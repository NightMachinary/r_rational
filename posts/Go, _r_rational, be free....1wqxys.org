Having a bit of a staffing change. I've been mod of [[/r/rational]] for about 5 months, and successfully repurposed it to the point that it's now an active subreddit. So my job is done, and I'm passing the torch down to [[/u/eaturbrainz]]. Besides, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/howtoquitreddit/comments/1srtz9/made_a_step_in_the_right_direction/][I've been meaning to quit reddit for some time now]] and, now I've cut myself from responsibility, what better time than now?

So yeah, that's what's happened. Carry on.

** Goodbye [[/u/seraphnb]]. You did well. I'll miss you insightful comments.

And I don't mean to suck up to the leadership, but I truly think [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is a good choice for your replacement.

** Seraphnb,

... I had to disappear for several of the same reasons. I was beating my head against areas that weren't [[/r/rational]] or for that matter, even at all rational.

I just stepped back in here because I needed to find a link to send to somebody else, then saw this message. Well. That's a crap of a downer.

I hope the fics that had you and me contacting each other in the first place work out.

For that matter, I hope you succeed in everything you have planned in the future but one thing. And may that thing always be changing for you.

Fare well.
