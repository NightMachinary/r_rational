*** Rational!Naruto/Princess Bride:

- Chouji Akimichi (heck, any of the Akimichis) dressed up in a fire-retardant cloak and doused with burning oil, hurtling through the Hyuga compound on a trolley, screaming "I AM THE DREAD JONIN ROBURETSU!" to provide a diversion while Naruto is busy sneaking into Hinata's room.

- "You see, there's two kinds of dead," said Tsunade, poking at Sasuke's limp body with an accusing digit; the supine genin was covered in the intricate whorls and marking of Orochimaru's Curse Seal, and still as a corpse. "This guy here? He's only /mostly/ dead."

"I learned this jutsu from Pervert-Sensei", Naruto said and slapped the ground with the flat of his palm.

"/Katon: Fire Swamp of the Underworld!/" Spreading around his hand like ripples in water, the wave of chakra mutated the surroundings as it passed, turning the training ground into marshland, with gouts of flame intermittently bursting from the mire.

"Just watch out for the T.O.U.S."

"T-T.O.U.S.?" stammered Hinata. She almost jumped out of her skin when the towering form of Gamabunta leaned down from behind and whispered in her ear (although his voice was still loud and booming enough to carry halfway across Konoha).

** Great to see another chapter!

I hate to be the guy who gives only negative feedback, but I have to quibble about rational!naruto's rationality. Why on earth does he go to the Hyuga compound in person if he genuinely thinks that Hiashi might kill him? There is literally no advantage to showing up as a clone and then being there in person anyway, unless Naruto is oath bound to obey Hiashi's demands somehow. Remember [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Yudkowsky's advice]] on how to write intelligent characters. Ask yourself what you would do in Naruto's situation: Would you show up in person if you could send a clone? Of course not.

I will also add in some of my own rules on writing rationalist fiction:\\
1) The greatest power of rationality is not to achieve a desired result in a clever manner, but to decide what should be done in the first place.\\
2) If a character gets in a "I almost died there" situation without massively rethinking everything they did to get to that point, they are not acting rationally.

I get that you are aiming more for humour than realism here, but it makes it difficult for me to think of Naruto as rational when his actions are so plainly driven by the needs of the plot. If you want to fix this it is easy to just say that Naruto HAD to show up in person because his shadow clones have a maximum range, or something.

BTW: If Hiashi could identify the original with his byakugan (otherwise the shell game wouldn't be necessary), how come he doesn't see right away that the first naruto was a clone?

*** Thanks. This is helpful.

The advantage of showing up as a clone, even if you intend to attend in person, is exactly what it turned out to be in practice: ambush protection.

The purpose of the shell game was to prevent Hiashi from going straight for the original Naruto; it's not that the Byakugan can identify clones from originals (IIRC that's a special ability of the Sharingan in canon, and I haven't changed this), but that the 360 degree vision means Naruto's only means of evasion/concealment was to hide in a crowd and keep moving.

Of course, Hiashi /could/ see, as soon as he activated the Byakugan at the end of the Hinata conversation, that Naruto's wristband was full of his chakra and therefore probably someone under the Transformation Technique. He attempted a one-hit-kill move on Naruto in full knowledge of this.

The original question of why Naruto would obey Hiashi's demand to turn up in person in the first place is still valid, though. I agree that Naruto's behaviour wasn't really rational here, although I do think it was in character - Naruto is arrogant, and bad at backing down from challenges, and also wary of risking his relationship with Hinata by further alienating the Hyūga (as well as extremely tired and not thinking straight). So he attempts to play by Hiashi's rules and win, and just barely manages it.

**** Thanks for the answer. My point was that Naruto has 3 options:\\
1) Show up in person\\
2) Show up as a clone\\
3) Show up as a wristband attached to a clone

Naruto has two concerns here: Not alienating the Hyuga, and surviving. Surviving is better accomplished by being a clone. The Hyuga are alienated if they find out that Naruto is a clone, but the only way they can notice that is if they attack Naruto, in which case it is still preferable to be a clone since he prefers surviving over playing by the rules (I assume). Therefore, option 3 may well be better than option 1, but option 3 is pareto-dominated by option 2. Rational!Naruto should realize this, or at least facepalm about it afterwards. It is especially noticeable to me because I just finished writing about Naruto almost making this exact mistake in my own rational!Naruto fanfic.

Btw, the sharingan only had the ability to identify clones in the anime filler (valley of the end fight), except madara who says he could identify wood clones with his eternal mangekyo I think. It was stated during the chunin exams that the Byakugan has better insight than the sharingan in every way, so it only makes sense that the sharingan would not be able to identify clones either.

***** Drat. Apparently my dōjutsu knowledge is weak. Thanks for the info.

I think the Hyūga could notice that Naruto is a clone without attacking him, and in fact this is something Naruto probably wouldn't put past Hyūga Hiashi (e.g. "oops, my servant has just bumped into you violently", or even "let me test you with a completely innocent sparring match").

You're right that this is a big enough deal that I'll address it in the next chapter, though.

**** Or maybe the "real" Naruto isn't actually Naruto at all, just another clone, and the real Naruto is actually back at his apartment, sleeping. The real Naruto probably gave the "real" Naruto clone half of the Chakra or something, so that he could still fight.

***** If it was a shadow clone, it would automatically get half the chakra anyway, since that's how shadow clones work - by taking an equal share of your chakra when created.

Naruto couldn't be sleeping because that dispels shadow clones (which is also why he didn't take a nap while the Uzumaki Naruto Coalition was preparing, and why his clones all got dispelled when Haku knocked him out). Incidentally, this is probably a major reason why shadow clones aren't normally sent on independent missions.

Your suggestion is an interesting one, but I think there's more character development potential in having Naruto face up to the fact that he acted irrationally and nearly got killed as a result. While the idea of him facing Hiashi as a chessmaster with contingencies and counter-contingencies has its own appeal, I'm not sure he's at that level quite yet. For one thing, he lacks the experience of battling intelligent opponents that would allow him to develop that sort of behaviour.

*** He was looking from a distance, and most of the colour he saw was Hiashi's very white formal robes (which also concealed all the flesh except his relatively pale face). It was a case of "oh, look, a statue" and then "probably marble".

As it happens, he also has an association of "marble = rich people's material", as seen when kid!Naruto requests a marble gravestone from kid!Sasuke in a flashback.

My original thinking is that if he was wearing his hair in a ponytail, then together with his receding hairline his hair might not necessarily have been visible from all angles. But I neglected the fact that he was sitting down, so Naruto would have been looking down on him at least slightly.
