Howdy folks! Long time reader, first time poster. I'm not particularly in favor of the general trend where "X" thing becomes popular, more things come around that are basically "Existing thing, but with X!". However, rationalfic where the plot is essentially a retelling of an existing story with better thinking in it has been pretty darned entertaining thus far. Also, I've had some story ideas knocking around in my head lately. So that said, would anyone be particularly interested in a Rational Fallout 3/New Vegas fic? Even if not, I'll probably still write the bloody thing, but some pre-story consultation would be cool :)

*** My intention is to play it completely straight. This is a world where physics are very different from our own. B-movie Science! That doesn't mean I don't intend for them to discover rules, or that I won't keep them internally consistent. And my protagonist will definitely notice, for instance, that Mackay's theories of mutation due to extended exposure to radiation don't really explain the presence of giant green people. The rules are insane by our standards, but they exist.

*** I dont remeber where I read or it's cannonicity but an explanation for a big deal of the mutations are due to the FEV (forced evolutionary virus) being released along the nukes. granted this replaces one handwavium with another but hey it's something. on the other hand there is a core of creatures that were the result of deliberate genetic engineering you can keep with cannon sources: deathclaws and super mutants from mariposa research cntr. cazadores, night stalkers, and man-eating plants from Big MT. considering the pre war world had [[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Sierra_Madre_vending_machine][nano assemblers]] i chose to think ghouls are victims of life support nanites that switched to being powered by radiation or radioisotopes (thus explaining why they heal when irradiated)

  Where the Vending Machine technology came from is unknown. While they take Sierra Madre Chips, they seem to supply a number of non-commercial services. A revolutionary pre-War technology that never achieved much commercial success outside the occasional world fair or the Sierra Madre. The vending machine is in fact a self-contained matter transformation device. It can recreate any item (limited by the templates stored in its memory) by using Sierra Madre chips as a battery and source of raw material for the created goods. It can also take certain items and transform them back into Sierra Madre chips. Selection is made through a holographic interface that displays the item being purchased. The machine demonstrates something astounding about pre-War civilization. As the chips are not some form of nanotech feedstock, but simple alloys of common and fissionable elements (see Coin Operator), the machines use nuclear fission/fusion to process this material not only into tools, but edible food and even prescription chems. They demonstrate that civilization was on the cusp of unimaginable prosperity when the bombs fell; a truly great height from which to fall.

** I've thought about a rationalist Fallout but kept more in the spirit of it's origin source, starting with Fallout 1's Vault Dweller and continue on with his descendents influence eastward through 2 and and New Vegas (as the courier). Just have a hard time writing due to being overly hard on myself on such tasks.

Did you have an idea for the protagonist?

If you are going ahead with a story like this I'd highly recommend going though the wiki since New Vegas has tons of small but interesting tie ins with Fallout 1/2.
