** I caught up to this one a while back, stopped at around chapter 50, it was interesting.

I think it fits well enough with this sub, not entirely rational but certainly contains themes of rationality.

If you are interested in an Isekai Romp from a whole bunch of different perspectives then give it a shot.

** A number of characters are Isekai'd into the world simultaneously, under various circumstances with various abilities. The story, world and characters are rationally constructed, but all the characters are (intentionally) flawed.

** Definitely recommended, not necessarily rational but if not it's pretty close. I really enjoy it.
