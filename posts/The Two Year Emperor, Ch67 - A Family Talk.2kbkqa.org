** Given that the FLEA exists, does Drifa losing her levels really matter?

This chapter was excellent. Definitely one of the best. This is likely partially because I spent most of it in fits of laughter

#+end_quote

Well, the levels can be restored, but she's going to lose her connection to her goddess, whom Drifa has dedicated her entire life to since she was 18 years old. She spent a century or two in the field, fighting to protect Amilsandre's people and their homes from every nasty thing that goes bump in the night. Then she spent some time in the upper echelons of Amilsandre's church, learning the political / economic / logistical side of making sure that people have homes and safety. Finally she became the head of the entire church, and spent all her time working to make sure that the church ran as smoothly as possible.

Now Amilsandre is going to shun her, strip away every tangible scrap of that lifetime of service, and render her untouchable by all faithful -- from now on, no worshipper of Amilsandre may speak to, sell to, or shelter Drifa. Ever.

So, yeah, it kinda matters.

Thanks! I had a lot of fun writing Drifa's lines; I was snickering most of the way through. I'm glad it came across as funny OUTSIDE of my head.

**** Ah, so it's less to do with the loss of cleric levels and more to do with the cultural aspects of being excommunicated. Perhaps add something in the text to make this clearer? I had thought that she was just referring to the XP she had gathered when talking about her centuries of work.

Are there any Amilsandre followers in Grofhamr? I had thought that they'd all converted to Herrún.

Good thought; I'll look this over.

Yep, there still are. Many of the people have switched, but not everyone. It's only been a few days so far since the ritual started; changing your primary object of worship away from your chosen god is a tough thing to do, even in a polytheistic religion where it's ok to pray to multiple gods.

******** Roughly what it sounds like; a god's official representative/chief spokesperson that they send to give messages on other planes in situations where a full Godly appearance isn't called for. The roles isn't enormously clear, but roles from Jesus to that angel that spoke to the shepherds could be divine herald jobs.

********* The only entry I can find for "divine herald" is Pathfinder. Is it a 3.5 thing as well? (Not that that is necessarily a showstopper, I'm just curious.)

On that subject...what exactly is the deal with Pathfinder? Is it a campaign setting? A revamp of the rules? Some of each? Where did it come from? (canon, 3rd party, etc) and why? Answers or pointers to the FM welcome.

********** It shows up in Deities and Demigods, IIRC, but it wasn't important. They're mentioned occasionally in other sourcebooks (I know the Tome of Magic mentions Andromalius as a former herald of Olidammara). Pathfinder included a lot more material in the freely-available published material, so it shows up there.

Pathfinder is not, legally speaking, D&D. It's unofficially called D&D 3.75, or occasionally just "Totally-not-Dungeons-and-Dragons." It's printed by Paizo, who wrote Dungeon and Dragon magazines for years (So it'c not quite 3rd party, but not quite canon either.) It picked up where edition 3.5 left off, with both extensive support for the OGL and very similar mechanics; it was originally going to be a set of tweaks, but they decided they wanted to change a little more than that and gave it an independent rulebook and title. It's basically a wholesale rebalancing, with more options added for everything and a new, pulpy campaign setting added.

I'm a big fan. When it looked like D&D NEXT was going to keep floundering, I was in favor of them scuttling their operations and selling the brand to Paizo, because they've done good things so far.

Ok, thanks. Yeah, divine herald sounds like a pretty good option. I think I'll use it.

Huh. Interesting; thanks for explaining. I had thought it was canon, so it's good to be set straight. I couldn't understand why Wizards was splitting their brand.
