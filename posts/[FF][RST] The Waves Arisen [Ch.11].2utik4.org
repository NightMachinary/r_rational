** I am getting that feeling I had when I read A Song of Ice and Fire, where I literally wonder every chapter who is going to die off next. Naruto left Hinata alone with Sai... Lee still back at Leaf...

Great job playing up Pein as a dark Naruto. You chose the perfect time to introduce him and his basic motivations as similar to Naruto's.

Danzo seems like a obvious culprit for the assassination, from canon we know he has the motives and means. We also know about Orochimaru from canon. Perhaps they colluded directly or indirectly.

Congratulations, you've gotten me to the point where I genuinely believe any character might die at any time. I would remind you to be careful of darkness induced audience apathy (to use the TvTropes terminology), but you've already written the draft and are just editing as you post apparently so I will just hope for the best.

**** Hey, its not guaranteed that Sai will take it as his opportunity to strike. Sure Hinata is alone and he thinks Naruto and Sasuke are tired from sparing each other, but maybe he will wait for another opportunity. And killing Hinata, she is a fan favorite, the author can't just kill her after giving her so much character development. /s

Oh crap, I wasn't sure it was going to happen before, but now I've convinced myself. My only hope is that Hinata figured out something was wrong and manages to take out the ANBU guy herself.

Naruto is obviously going to communicate stuff with Sasuke. Sparring also gives him opportunity to use Byakugan to see what's happening, so he can keep an eye on Hinata too.

Sai can sense through his chakra bugs, if he can hear through them too (and Naruto has no way of know he can't), then Naruto is going to need to come up with some hidden communication with Sasuke.

How is he ever going to think of something in time? Oh wait, shadow clones.

** Well that was gratuitous.

I understand why you killed Kakashi -- Danzo is evil, you needed a way to demonstrate that that had emotional impact. Ok fine. Killing Gai offstage as well doesn't serve any visible purpose other than to remove an interesting character and a good source of comic relief. At this point I'm pretty much assuming that a major canon character is going to die every chapter, just to show that it's a crapsack of world.

*** Killing Kakashi also makes the trio not be able to rely on adult help, so they have to do stuff alone. Gai would most probably be their next jounin of choice. I'm betting he is planning to make them get out of the village for good and turn traitor, which might be much easier to do when you don't have friends fighting against you.

** Wow you basically destroyed the canon plot. Talking about going off the roles. This Danzo seems to much more competent then his canon equivalent, he doesn't sound like a fascist sociopathic warmonger.

By the way, I don't think that Kakashi is dead yet. Maybe he's being tortured by Danzo in some dungoen somewhere but not dead.

Sai is definetly planning on killing Hinata. Hope she lives.

*** I felt the same way about Kakashi at first. Protagonists can't die offscreen, dying of food poisoning is pretty anticlimactic, he'll probably come back later and be all "Nah. I was just testing you."

But then I remembered that 2 chapters ago Hinata CRUSHED NEJI TO DEATH, and I decided he was probably gone.

** It would be hilarious in a dark way if it turns out that Sai never had any plans to kill them and the team is forced to run from their village due to Naruto's paranoia. But while it fits with the darkness of the story, it doesn't fit with the rationalist theme where the protagonist needs to have a good reason for most things and never turns out to be wrong.

I fully expect Hinata to die, and Naruto and Sasuke kill Sai before joining up with Pein (or Orochimaru if he's working separately from Pein). Less likely scenarios are ones where Sasuke dies instead of Hinata or only Naruto survives.

In addition, it would be an awesome ending if Naruto figures out a way to abuse the Rinnegan to revive everyone who has die in the story, but that has a really low chance.

Does anyone else think Madara is dead or did he fake Pein out?

Everything else is weak circumstantial evidence, however Sai asking Naruto to turn off his Byakugan, right as the get close to enemy territory, only really makes sense if Sai is plotting something he doesn't want Naruto to see.

Not really. HJPEV is completely wrong about Quirrel. Lex Luthor from alexanderwales rational fic was wrong in his assessment of superman for much of the story and was probably wrong to kill him. Hana (the person who designed CelestiAI) from Friendship is Optimal should have just programmed CelestiAI to satisfy human values and left out the friendship and ponies part.

I would say in rationalistfics the protagonist doesn't make casual, stupid mistakes (i.e. plot driven idiot ball, failure to communicate, forgetting to use their powers, etc.), not that they don't make any mistakes.

**** That's what I thought when I saw little snips of the show...it was much too shonen for me to enjoy today. I thought maybe there's something not easily seen at first. (Like Fullmetal or Madoka Magika - you can't immediately tell that they're good)

I'd wonder why it's inspired so many fanfics, but then again I still have a fondness for the pokemon-verse and I don't think I'd have the patience for such a grind-heavy game today either! (Seriously they could be raking in so much cash if they made a more sophisticated game along the same lines, for the kids who grew up, in addition to just repeatedly replicating the same game with more pokemon...)

***** Naruto is shonen's shonen- not only does hit have DBZ-level of slow pacing (5-episode fight scenes, extensive monologues to give important plot details), but the anime continually outpaced the manga as it was being written, so there are entire filler arcs, where nothing of consequence happens to the main characters. Many of them.

Also, the longer it went on (and it went on for years and years and years) the less sense any of it made- it very clearly wasn't plotted out before it started in any level of detail, so by the end there's like 7 levels of villains manipulating each other down the line, and of course you only find out about the newest one once the last one is defeated.

All I remember is a blur of Bu, a green person, Saiyans with tails and changing hair colors, a whole lot of screaming and people holding energy balls for the entire episode. I don't think I could give a coherent summary of what it was all about, and I kind of suspect it wasn't actually about /anything/ in particular.

It's interesting that animation (which is hard to create) could /ever/ outpace a manga (which is fairly easy to create), especially a manga without a particularly tight plot.
