** This trope shows up a lot in rational fiction, and is something of a real-world rationality lesson, so I thought I'd try getting it its own trope page. I'm hoping to get more attention and contribution by pointing it out here. If this goes well, I'll do a few more of these.

If you're not a troper normally, please be a good guest in their space. Possibly skim their [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TVTropesCustoms][customs document]] and similar things. Also, please remember that this trope should stand alone as a general fiction trope, apart from rational fiction as such.

If you can find anime/manga or comic book examples, I'd especially appreciate those as they can displace "fan works" from the first medium in alphabetical order. (Sadly, I don't know either well.)

** There are Buffy/Stargate crossover fanfics? I should be less surprised than I am...

*** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/topfanfic.php][Tons of them]]. It's [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/CategoryStories-1-17/Stargate.htm][one of the most popular crosses for Buffy]].

It actually works really well. Things like the Initiative actually make more sense if you assume the NID was smuggling Goa'uld tech to Dr. Walsh, and the whole "Sarcophagi use life energy" thing fits better with the Buffyverse magic system than it ever did with SG1's scifi.

Return to Normal works on a parallel-universes-with-different-laws basis (still an excellent fic, though read the prequel first). Better showcases of the cross are [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-4301/Kei+Trick+Or+Treat.htm][Trick Or Treat]], [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-21613/ShayneT+Potential.htm][Potential]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-7705/DonSample+Are+You+Ready.htm][Are You Ready?]]
