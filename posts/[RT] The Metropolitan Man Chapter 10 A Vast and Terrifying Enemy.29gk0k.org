*** You know, this comment had me puzzled for a few hours, since I couldn't figure out why someone would have paid attention to what I was saying and reddit isn't friendly about letting people search histories. It finally dawned on me that I must have made a blog post about it, and sure enough, I found five or six paragraphs about what I want out of Superman. It's weird but not all that surprising how closely much of what I wrote there parallels what I ended up writing in the fic. Out of curiosity, how on earth did anyone ever find that blog post? I feel like I must have linked to it at some point, but have no real recollection of it.

***** Mostly it's because ninety percent of the time when it's used, it's a cheesy plot device that's introduced only to add in some tension to a man that's got absurd powers. There are so few things that you can really do with kryptonite, and so much of the time it's either "Superman is still super even without the powers" or "Superman can still figure out a way to punch hard enough". As an obstacle to throw in front of a protagonist, much of the time its just ... lazy.

In my opinion, the very best Superman stories are character studies, where failure isn't a matter of not being strong enough or fast enough, but instead about what Superman's values are and how he goes about trying to satisfy them. There are some really great Superman comics, and the ones I love don't include kryptonite, because they don't need to - the conflict and tension are there without taking away Superman's powers.

(I also hate how every two-bit villain seems to have kryptonite for usually poorly explained reasons. The backstory for it is constantly shifting, but usually it doesn't satisfy me.)

So yes, I do dislike kryptonite, most of the time. I probably wouldn't include it in this story, except that Superman isn't the protagonist (which changes the narrative aspects some).

******** I believe I meant it more as "this is one of the things that Superman does". I might also have been thinking of [[http://i.imgur.com/jWz7kDh.jpg][one of my favorite pages from All-Star Superman]]. It's sort of unfair to criticize Superman based on your own value system, but in pretty much every incarnation stopping suicides is something he sees as important. The point I was trying to make is that Clark Kent values being Clark Kent above and beyond all of the things that Superman has declared he values.

Obviously if I were Superman, I would be doing bigger and better things than bothering with murder, rape, robbery, etc. I'd be somewhere between a god-tyrant and one-man megacorporation, and use my powers to affect change on a global scale rather than bothering with individuals. In [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Grounded][Superman: Grounded]] he spends an hour talking a woman down from jumping to her death (after promising her that he wouldn't just grab her and fly her to the ground), and while it definitely gives me the warm fuzzies, I can only see it as a horrible waste of his time, given how many other things he could be doing at that moment.

As to how I personally feel about stopping people who are suicidal: I'm fine with it. I attempted suicide about seven or eight years ago, and spent a few weeks in a mental institution where I got to know other people who were there for the same reason. The thing is, 95% of the time, the people who are attempting suicide don't actually mean it, and it really is a cry for help. I'm fully on-board with a right to death, and a person's right to control their own life (or lack thereof), but the fact is that suicide isn't usually so clear cut as "I have made the rational choice that I want to die". Quite a bit of the time, the problem is something that can be worked past with counseling or drugs; there's a reason that there's a single successful suicide for every 26 suicide attempts, and it's not just that there's an animal instinct stopping you. Obviously if Superman is just stopping someone from committing suicide and setting them down on the ground with a pat on the back and a simple "Don't do that again" he hasn't actually done anything, but at least in the comics much of what he does is talk the suicidal people out of suicide. I can get on board with either talking it out, or getting them the help that they need through other means. (And I've already written too much, but I'm totally on board with euthanasia, since that's one of those situations where suicide actually makes sense - that people routinely beg for death as they lay dying and are denied it is obscene.)

He's old enough that if he went to prison for a decade, he would almost surely die there, especially considering that his power base has crumbled away. He was really ready to die if the verdict came back guilty, mostly just to take his life back into his own hands. He gets handed this unexpected victory instead though, and had this feeling of elation, because he pulled out a win that he really didn't think he was going to get. So he does what he really wants to do, which is to rub Superman's nose in it, right in front of all the reporters, and so far as he knows, Superman's as stoic as they come and never responds to provocation, so this some safe, fun, gloating.

But yes, prior to the verdict coming back he's much more focused on getting revenge/vindication than actually living.

** "She would have run herself ragged trying to improve the world if she had Superman's powers."

You know this kind of thinking really annoys me, Lois is perfectly capable of making changes for herself but she actually spent time cleaning up her apartment (instead of working at a soup kitchen for example), and as far as we're aware she doesn't do anything more charitable than an every day person. Not only did Superman explicitly remind her of all the suffering going on around her, she apparently thinks of it, decides that of course she could never do anything about it (when she easily could) and then decides that Superman isn't doing enough, even the whole goddamn message Superman is sending is that everyone should try to be good. People are always like "Oh I would rescue that hobo if I won the lottery, or I would do X if Y happened, no one does it when they're in that position", there's probably some psychological phenomenon for the name of that.

So yeah, fucking hypocrites goddamn.

Yeah, don't know if that was deliberate the intention of that writing but that's my thoughts.

*** It comes down to a question of opportunity costs. Let's say that Lois Lane and Superman both sit down in a movie theater together to watch /Anne of Green Gables/.

The opportunity cost for Lois is relatively low - let's say that she makes the equivalent of $60,000 a year. It's almost certainly more efficient for her to push her comparative advantage (writing/reporting) than it is for her to donate her time to a soup kitchen, since a well-written essay on women's rights is likely to do a whole lot more than a single hour of labor. She could also work at her job and donate the money to a soup kitchen, which would almost certainly give a better expected payout than donating labor to something she has no particular skill in. Let's be generous and say that her opportunity cost for going to the movie is about $30 plus whatever a ticket costs.

The opportunity cost for Superman is relatively high. Even if he prohibits himself from making money (except as Clark Kent), advancing technology, or doing manual labor, his opportunity cost is still much, much higher than Lois's. Lex figures this at about one life per hour, but it's probably a little lower than that (Superman is actually pretty crappy at preventing disease and infection, which are by far the two largest causes of death during the time period). It's much harder to put a value on something like a human life, but I don't think it would be absurd to put the opportunity cost of Superman going to the movies at at least $100,000 ([[http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html][a number that I didn't just pull out of my hat]]).

Here's the steel manned version of Lois's line of thinking; if the cost of going to a movie was that high, she wouldn't go to a movie, and she wouldn't expect any moral person to do the same. It's only because the cost is low that it's worth it.

Here's one of the potential counterarguments from Superman; if going to a movie with Lois allows him to be better able to handle the psychological stress of being Superman, then that is the correct thing for him to do, because otherwise he would risk breaking down in some unpleasant manner. If he's in the business of getting warm fuzzies instead of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/][absolute efficiency]], that's still not all that bad, since a focus on efficiency could lead him to lose his motivation to do good (though in this fic it seems more like he's tortured about the use of his powers).

I would also agree with [[/u/Linmark]] that you're not being all that charitable towards Lois. She's been shown as active in the feminist movement and a hard worker who spends very little of her time on leisure, to the exclusion of friendships and romance. She also legitimately believes that investigation and reporting are good. And at the same time, I agree with you that she's not being entirely charitable to Superman, but there are reasons for that beyond pure hypocrisy - she resents that her primary comparative advantage now seems to be wooing Superman (which, incidentally, is the only reason she seems to have cleaned her apartment in the first place).

**** While I understand the point you raise I'm not sure I agree with Lois saying that if her time was X valuable she wouldn't do something.

While she does invest heavily into her work, that's hardly something that is immediately charitable and I would say that Lex is doing a way better job than her (how many trusts has she founded), and as far as we've seen from her it doesn't look like any other reporter would have engaged in less charity (excluding the Superman stuff). The feminist movement can be taken from an entirely selfish point of view, but let's not and assume that that is her contribution. She chooses to work over perhaps becoming a figurehead for the feminist movement, reporting on activities (and it's notable in her thoughts how unsympathetic she is towards the victims of the action, seeing them first and foremost as a story (like on the sinking boat)), or whatever.

The counterargument is pretty obvious but it's good to flesh it out. I think that pretty much overrules anything anyone could want Superman to do and I'm less concerned with the counterargument (though Lois in particular should realise that he is strained and mentally criticising him for not doing more could lead to some pretty problematic things if she revealed it), and more with the hypocrisy.

Your Lois argument if I summarise it:

"My time isn't worth over $99,523 an hour, therefore it is not immoral for me to go to a movie. If my time was worth [supermans] amount of time, then it would be."

I think not only is that an atrocious argument (at some level of cut off you should start being good but before that feel free to not care about others) it completely misses Superman message of being a being of good and perfection. He's trying to improve the human race by example, and instead of realising that we should all choose to do good she complains that he's not doing enough while spending her own time (while not completely ungood) carelessly. Also it's awfully specific and I wonder how much effort Superman has to do to allow himself some time, with the way I've phrased it it's obviously none which is true for Superman and Lex but she loves Lex to bits so Lex and her talking about Superman must be worth fucking millions)

#+begin_quote
  (which, incidentally, is the only reason she seems to have cleaned her apartment in the first place)
#+end_quote

Yeah but then you have to try and suggest that the value from Superman knowing she put effort by cleaning, which I can only imagine is a tiny marginal amount (considering she made him a meal, what's really the difference between "wow you made me a meal, and wow you made me a meal and cleaned up") is worth more than the value of say training to react to Superman better (like not BARELY avoiding flinching), or writing feminist literature or whatever.

Yeah it's not a huge deal, but it just annoys me because it's the whole damn problem with a lot of humanity in that instead of doing something themselves they're just like "Why the fuck don't the 1% donate all their money to charity" and then go back to playing DOTA or whatever.

One minor correction here. It's not that Lois going to the movie is immoral, it's that it's far, far less immoral to the point of being negligible.

As an extreme hypothetical. There are two buttons. One of them, when pressed, steals a penny from the bank account of a random person and places it into your own. The other button, when pressed, kills ten thousand random people. We can agree that these are wildly different crimes, right? Well imagine the inverse. Lois has a button that gives a penny to some random charitable organization, while Superman has a button that saves ten thousand random people from some horrible fate. What Lois is saying (or at least what I think she's saying) is that to quote Uncle Ben, with great power comes great responsibility. She wouldn't feel too bad about ducking out on pressing the Button of Minor Charity, but she would be absolutely wrecked by not pressing the Button of Save Everyone.

I personally agree with that. It's more complicated in the story, and even more complicated in the real world, but to say that there's a moral difference between things of different magnitudes is hardly surprising.

You can harp on Lois all you want for not liking Superman, and for letting her biases overcome her sense, and for being blinded to Lex Luthor, and for whatever else, but I hardly think that you could call her a hypocrite for saying that she would push herself harder than she perceives Superman to be pushing himself - and she hasn't even connected the dots about Clark Kent.

My issue is not that she is wrong for believing that people should invest ~100% into improved the world (or however amount that she is doing but superman is not), which sure she is, but rather than being wrong she's just being hypocritical. Why can you expect Superman to not take breaks and not run himself ragged (for a start he is running himself ragged as we've seen by his PoV), but she most certainly doesn't run herself ragged and invest 100% of her life in improved everyone.

The most obvious example is where she's whining about him spending dinner with her, but she literally spent X minutes cleaning her apartment, which is not helping anyone.
