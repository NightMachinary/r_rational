Kitchen Sink worlds. I'm pretty much talking about most Marvel and DC fiction here. Kitchen Sink worlds are worlds where there are a bunch of genres sharing a world. Marvel and DC don't do a good job at world-building their kitchen sink worlds. So the different genres rarely overlap and show no examples of effects on society. Outside a once in a while crossover story. When the crossover is finished. Everybody goes back to normal.

Kitchen sink is where sci-fi and supernatural shared one world.

Where mutants, wizards, aliens, cyborgs, gods, cosmic beings, etc shared a world.

But we have yet to see a story that shows the effects on society of all these things existing at once in fiction.

Sure Mutants like the X men might be good examples of how Superpowers affect the world. And maybe Aliens and Mutants sharing a world is not that big of a difference that could ruin genre recognition.

But even then we have yet to see how all these things existing at once affect society. Mutants tend to be the ones who get the most attention in these types of worlds. Aliens being second. While the others are ignored. We may see one affects society. But we never see how all affect society at once.

Is there a rational reason why a Marvel/DC like world can have multiple different sources coexist in one world?

Now let's talk about the elephant in the room. That elephant is superpowers and magic. So these two power systems are usually in their own stand-alone world. But when they shared a world. There is a lot of unnoticed overlaps and similarities that writers tend to ignored or not notice. It's almost like these genres are better off when they are in their own world lol.

For this post im going to call superpower users Mutants. And magic-users Mages.

Outside superpowers being biological. And magic is a skill achieved from hard work. What would be the main difference between mutants and mages in kitchen sink world? There aren't any other differences between mutants and mages. Both have the same powers. Both are usually a minority among muggles. Both are the same just with a different flavor. But if we ignored the small arbitrary differences. And pay attention to what makes them sperate for a moment.

So how is society going to react to a certain amount of the population having a genetic mutation that gives superpowers and also individuals in the same population having talent or natural aptitude for magic at the same time?

You have people who are born with powers and also people who learn to get powers coexisting in the same world together. So a mutant born with psychic powers shares a world with a Witch who uses spells that give psychic powers. It is hard to rationalized or world build. And outside magic being something learnable most of the time (cough cough, not Harry Potter). So what makes magic so special that it gets its own separate category from superpowers? The Flash is a mutant before he gets put in a sperate speed force user category. Spiderman is mutant before he gets put in a spider people category. If you remove the magic for everybody cliche. What is stopping magic from being just another unique mutant power?

And if you sperate superpowers from magic via "you have to learn magic" and "be born a mutant". Then my questions from earlier come back. How is society going to react to the people being born with telekinesis and people learning how to do telekinesis at the same time. There are two routes here. And both have their issues.

You see Worm and the Boys don't have to deal with this. Because only Mutants exist in those words. Harry Potter and Magicians don't have to deal with this. Because only Mages exist in those worlds. But kitchen sink worlds have this issue. Because both mutants and mages shared a world.

And even when magic and superpowers are in their own worlds. Both still, come with their exclusive problems. Now you put both none flawless systems in the same world. It's already bad enough most Wiccans are muggles who can't do magic because it takes a special hard worker with an affinity or mana. Now the muggle Wiccans also have to see random individuals being with the same powers as their magic counterparts have without even doing any training at all. And yeah don't forget about the countless supernatural creatures. Vampires, Werewolves, Dragons, Skin Walkers, etc. How do they play a factor with Mutants and Mages?

Ok now moving onto Aliens.

Why don't gods ever interact with Alien planets?

Do Aliens also do magic?

Are Aliens mutants from different planets?

Moving onto gods.

So are gods extradimensional beings?

What are gods in this world?

Are gods going to be supernatural?

Super technology

Oh my god. There is too much to cover in this category. Super soldiers, Chimera's hybrid animals, Transhumanism, etc. Even transhumanism is a category within itself. Robots, Androids, Biotech, Nanotech, Cyborgs, etc. So I think im going to leave this out. Now granted you can argue that superpowers and aliens can improve technology. Therefore providing a connection.

Now let's talk about Chi or Ki energy. A natural life force that exists in all humans.

In Marvel and DC and many other Kitchen Sink worlds Chi is confusing. One character is just like Captain America. Chi just pushes them to peak human levels. But another character has chi. And can used chi to shoot colorful blasts like Goku and have all sorts of supernatural powers. Yes, folks im still talking about the same world here. One day the chi users are just normal humans who can use chi to enhances their natural abilities like they are Batman or Kill Bill or something. The next day they are Wixua characters shooting fireballs out their hands and flying. So in Kitchen Sink worlds, there is a fine line between peak humans and magic. There is a fine line between the Charles Altas power and Magic.

Since kitchen sink worlds like Marvel and DC like to be realistic, relatable, and modern. To show how similar their worlds are to real life. Since everybody can't be a Chi user or Magic-user because " With everyone super, no one will be super". So I assume Shaolin Monks exist in those worlds. Just how I assume Wiccans exist in those worlds. I already mentioned the Wiccan muggle vs Magic person thing. Now how is the muggle Shaolin Monks going to react to Chi users who legit have superpowers?

I didn't forget about Batman. I didn't forget about the Charles Altas power.

Out of all the systems, this is the most ignored. Maybe that has to do with the users who have the powers are always portrayed as normal humans who trained really hard. But being a polymath crank up to 10 by knowing multiple martial arts, being an Olympic level athlete in every category, and learning any human skill in a short amount of time. Doing all this Is a superpower itself lol. And just like the Chi users and normal Shaolin Monks. How are normal MMA fighters going to react to some who can fight like they are in a "movie" or something? How are Martial artists going to react to someone mastering 20 different martial arts at once? This same question is for every normal human who has skill. But somehow there exist people who master their skills to a superhuman level. But they are not considered mutants.

Alone these things already have their issues

Kitchen Sink worlds just the same to add more issues and not even care about previous issues.

Not really showing how all these unrelated things connect.

I know I was all over the place with the post. But Kitchen Sink worlds are all over the place. There was a lot I was going to say about Marvel and DC and the whole Kitchen Sink World Concept. But this post was already long lol.


** "A story is finite in length. To have anything in it, an infinite number of things must be excluded."

The sort of story that tries to include everything typically fails to be internally consistent, to say nothing of rational. Authors often fail to coherently present a single system with a single set of rules. Adding an additional system working on divergent principles makes this much harder, as not only must both systems be worked out properly, but the interactions between the systems must be defined. Adding a third system means two more sets of interactions. Adding dozens of conflicting systems passes from the realm of madness into the realm of Sparta. Needless to say, rationality is left behind far before the kitchen sink is full.

** There are several different layers of problems you are pointing out and several different solutions.

On one level there is the narrative conceit that the Fantasy Kitchen World is like ours unless otherwise noted. Worm used a recent point of divergence to make this work and the contrast between Aleph and Bet as a narrative device to note to the reader where the real world and Worm diverged. In a world with an early divergence (ancient aliens, ancient magic traditions, etc.) a more complex is needed for why the world looks the same as ours (Earth is a isolated backwater that the aliens ignore, the mages have vowed non-interference and secrecy with regard to non-magical phenomena etc.). At some point, the reader just has to suspend disbelief and accept it on some level.

For aspects of the real world that exist in the fictional world that should interact with the supernatural stuff (Wiccans trying magic, Monks that should have Chi)... I would say let it, just keep the power levels low. The monks, and even top athletes in a world with Chi outperform ours in a way that would be recognized as mildly superhuman if scientists could compare them with our world, but since they can't, scientists don't recognize Chi... or maybe it is a fringe controversial subject where a few scientists have proposed it and have weak evidence based on body heat and metabolic rates and anecdotes of super human feats that seem to beat physics but nothing firm. Likewise for Wiccans.. a lot of religious people already think their prayers work in-spite of studies otherwise, so they would think the same in a world with magic... and it would be a controversial field of science trying to quantify what prayers and religions and rituals are most efficacious.

As to another issue... there is the issue of world building consistency. Worm has shown you can have a single underlying phenomena result in a variety of powers perceived as magic and demons and mutations by people. Now imagine another pair of entires decided on a slower more secretive cycle that would last three times longer and allow the hosts a more consistent power set from host to host but with more ways to use those powers (including ways to pass powers on). These powers might be even more perceived as magic and if the canon pair of entities show up you would end up with two very different general categories of power interacting with each other. In general, given non reductionist mind-interacting phenomena I think you could naturally get mutants and magic and gods and trained seemingly mundane humans, and super science enhanced humans all using the same underlying phenomena but because of different historical origins and means of accessing the phenomena are perceived very differently.

I'm going kinda off track but I'm reminded of a world where different factions of monks used either ki or chi, with different associated powers and effects. I always thought it strange why they learn and incorporate each other's techniques.

From a meta perspective the reference was to the different ways a reader might say the pinyin word Qi (translates to blood or HP+MP+SP), depending on whether they were familiar enough with pinyin to realize Q=soft ch.

From a world perspective it made no sense though.

Hmmm 🤔. So all those Vampires, Werewolves, and Salem Witches were just mutants this whole time. Is because of a lack of understanding. People in those days label mutants as magic. While fast forward to 2021 those witches are just metahumans with their gene activated

Ok, your comment is giving me the sci-fi and supernatural are the same vibes. Lol. It's the any advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic concept.

Like Gods are really Aliens. Because Aliens were very godlike. I.E. Mutants are very magic-like.

We taught electricity was magic one day tell a smart person explained what is. We used to think supernatural sea creatures roam the earth. Turns out it was just Whales and maybe some creepy look deep-sea creatures.

I don't if this what you getting at. But you are giving me this vibe. It's a great concept.

But still doesn't explain the normal Humans like Batman or learning the power aspect. But then again I guessed you can remove the learning aspect. And nothing will change.

**** They aren't necessarily “just” mutants. Perhaps a long time ago a mutant/magic user experimented with contagious and inheritable “curses” that also had beneficial effects and thus created werewolves/vampires/witches. Fast forward several hundred or thousand years, repeat for a variety of magic users and you have entire magical species that exist and have no obvious connection/origin relative to the other fantasy kitchen sink stuff.

For learning the power... if the first MCU sorcerer supreme uses his (or her) infinity stone to experiment with tapping into alternate dimensions she could expand beyond just time manipulation. By save scumming timelines she could perform really risky and unstable dimensional manipulations, brute forcing solutions and techniques. In some cases, she stumbles across dimensions that respond to her mind and intentions and she develops foundational techniques leveraging them to perform more complex things. She also bootstraps a way of allowing people without the infinity stone to learn to access these other dimensions. Continue for several thousand years and she has “magic” that can be passed on and leveraged.

Or for a simpler example... a Psionic mutant directs their TK proprioception and telepathy at understanding the neural basis of their powers... and develops a way to pass them on to apprentices, who in turn can pass them on further. The end result: telepathy that can be taught by other telepaths.

Repeat for various traditions of bootstrapped contagious/inheritable/teachable powers and you end up with a fantasy kitchen sink. Add in a secret balance of power to them and you can at least maintain enough reader disbelief about how they existed to the modern day with only recently becoming impactful and public knowledge.

As for Batman... when a smart and obsessively motivated multimillionaire spends his fortune tracking down every bit of magic and supernaturally enhanced training usable by someone with no initial magical talent they are going to end up pretty ridiculously powerful. Of course Batman is clever and good at using deception: everyone knows it's totally mundane discipline and training that lets him see through illusions, not a risky and painful magical ritual to gain permanent true sight; it's extreme focus that lets him push through a literal broken back, not a bit of stolen Lazarus Pit incorporated into his suit (or body); it's extreme skill that lets him dodge an Omega Beam, not a modified from short term dose of Garrick Formula. The ridiculous thing isn't what Batman pulls off, it's that people buy that it is all just hard training.

***** Maybe the perception of Batman being a normal person is what drives his power. Worm deconstructed Batman with Victor, so imagine a skill vampire, but instead of touch he drains physical and mental skills of those who admire him AND‌ train to become more like him around the world. (Not much point in training if you know you'll never reach a superhuman level, but a "regular human" level easy)

** It's just a matter of how much effort you want to put into it. Most people don't want to put in the base level of effort for a single system, not when so much of it is probably not going to be central to the story.

And yes, if you compare the costs involved in building worlds, doing two systems that are each confined to their own separate world seems like it would be less complicated than having both systems in the same world ... at least to a point.

It's kind of a matter of personal preference, but I've always had a problem with X-men's integration with the rest of Marvel superhero stuff, which is that logically speaking, everything should either get put in a 'weird shit' bucket, or else lumped into an /inaccurate/ bucket. Spider-Man isn't a mutant, but it's not like anyone is checking him for an X-gene (and I think in some continuities, he /is/ a mutant). So if all this stuff starts happening at once, then maybe the government, media, or society would just say "hey, here's some weird stuff" and it would all be handled by the same organizations with the same kinds of conversations around them. This, in turn, would reduce the worldbuilding overhead needed, since the common folk might not know or care that e.g. The Flash was created through a freak accident that taps into the Speed Force rather than being born with an incredible 'gift'. A government agency responsible for "weird shit" might have detailed knowledge of the five or six ur-sources of that weird shit, but a lot of their protocols are the same. Again, that's a reduction in worldbuilding overhead. To give a small example, imagine that there are two power sets: one is a group of aliens who can shapeshift to blend in with normal society, while the other is a group from a parallel Earth that have been kidnapping and replacing important people. There's a lot of overlap there, and so the worldbuilding effort needed to realistically think about institutional and societal responses is actually somewhat lower. In a lot of cases, it's more about the effects than the systems which create those effects.

(Side note: I would love a novel focusing on a bureaucrat tasked with building up a government agency that has to deal with an ever-increasing number of paranormal, parascience, etc. developments. Yes, aliens exist and have been visiting Earth, but also there are parallel timelines, and occasional freak accidents that make superheroes, and mutations, and magic, and there have been five different societies living behind mutually-exclusive Masquerades, etc.)

** My take is that the only way to rationalise a Kitchen Sink world is to give all these powers a common origin, but one so distant in time and causality that it appears as if the powers were unrelated.

Bare bones version:

Once upon a time, not long after the Big Bang, there was a race of beings. These beings achieved Technological Singularity, then merged with their femto-technology and became "gods" vastly posthuman intelligences permeating space-time.

These *Gods* then decided to use their godtech to influence the creation and evolution of countless species, both Aliens and human. Among humans, they gave us a set of engineered genes that allows us to tap into the femto-technological network that permeates the Universe. But they left the expression of this Power Gene to be very open ended.

The *Power Gene* started mutating and evolving. At first, it responded to epigenetic and environmental cues, giving humans simple crude powers, or merging us with animals. This is the Origin of various supernatural creatures (from immortal elves to shapeshifting werewolves, and from vampires to plant-folk).\\
As humans evolved higher intelligence, our Power Gene allowed us to subconsciously, and then consciously tap into the Godtech.

Most of us who managed to consciously connect to it only had a weak connection and poor understanding of it, and had to amplify the effect with potions, herbs, meditation, drugs etc. This is the origin of *Witchcraft.*

Others managed to tap into the Godtech rationally, write down whole manuals, and a simplified "programming language" that allows one to control the Godtech somewhat. These is the origin of *Magic*, and it was independently discovered by various cultures and races throughout the universe, creatign countless different "schools" of Magic.

Soon a rough "types" of magic users formed:

- Mages: who had both powerfully expressed Power Gene, and great skills at using the Godtech (Powerful AND Skilled)

- Wizards: who had a weak expression of the Power Gene, but great skills at using the Godtech, and lots of theoretical knowledge of it ("wisdom" - hence Wizards) (Weak but Skilled)

- Sorcerers: weak Power Gene expression, and varied skills, but substituted by making deals with more powerful supernatural beings and using artefacts of Power.

Now, all that accounts for people who had a CONSCIOUS CONNECTION to the Godtech via their Power Gene.

But all the time there would be people born who had subconscious, almost animalistic connection to it, without being actually able to perceive the Godtech. Rather than able to "see the keyboard of the Universe" they only can forcefully smash a button or two. Most of them would go mad and kill themselves with their Power. But some would survive, and become Heroes, "gods", Seers etc, and even start their own supernatural bloodline, and form new supernatural species.

After the start of the Scientific Revolution, we started to notice these people, and study them. Turns out that the subconscious use of the Power Gene is caused when it undergoes a random mutation not suitable to produce a Mage or a Witch. We started calling these people *Mutants*.

As human race became more numerous, more and more Mutants would be born and survive to adulthood. Some would have children, and some of these children would inherit their Mutation, or have their own unique one.

Finally, There would be numerous attempts to graft Power Gene on people who either do not have it, or have it weakly expressed. The rare successful cases are called *Mutates.* Usually, Mutates have a simpler but more refined version of a Power that the Mutant donor had.

In general, Magic and Mutant Powers cannot coexist in one individual. Magic requires a conscious connection and hands-on control of the Power, while Mutant Powers require a subconscious, instinctual "tapping into" the Godtech. Not only would that require the Power Gene to activate /twice in one individual/, but said individual would have to be extremely good at compartmentalising their mind. Perhaps less than one in a million Powered people has the potential to be both a Mage and a Mutant, and almost always they just default to Mutant.

So, there you go. One simple system that accounts for Gods, "gods", supernatural races, Mages, Witches, Mutants and Mutates; both human and Alien alike.

** I don't think I can agree that a kitchen sink setting necessarily precludes rationality. You've listed ways in which a setting with multiple power sources is more complex but the real world has plenty of complexity and if reality doesn't count as rational we're all in big trouble.

I agree that existing settings like the Marvel and DC universes aren't particularly rational but that is a product of how they were stitched together from many independent properties, not an inherent rule of kitchen sinks.

** It's definitely much harder to write a reasonable world with both mutants and mages than one with one but not both, and I think it's probably true that the additional difficulty from adding mages to a mutant world or mutants to a mage world is bigger than from adding either of them to a muggle world. Adding Charles Atlas Superpowers - let's call them Monks if we need a word for them - is probably another, larger jump in difficulty. But it can be done.

W. Dow Rieder writes Doc Future's world, and manages it by providing a unified mechanism which underlies both mutant and mages, and then adding some extra things for the Monks. (Cognitive augmentation for the main couple, and having restraint for what other Monk powers exist, e.g. Jetgirl and +Iron+ Neodymium Man clearly have built really impressive flying machines and have access to much better tech than us, but aren't otherwise implausible.) He's written about the underlying logic in [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/87548056861/behind-the-future-part-1-creating-a-superhero][Behind The Future]].

The Whateley Universe is, well, it's completely batshit insane, but derivative works have built on it and made it come out basically reasonable (there's a bunch of [[https://glowfic.com/posts/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&board_id=&character_id=&setting_id=1059&subject=&commit=Search][glowfic]]). And it /started/ with the power classification system where Mage is actually just one of your subratings on your Mutant powers denoting "large natural gift for magic"; anyone else /can/ learn magic, but it's much, much harder so few muggles ever pull it off and therefore most people didn't believe in magic until mutants started cropping up (which was some time in the 20th Century).

** So, the way I see the Mutants vs Mages thing is kind of like this.

Let's say you want to move a block. It's not a heavy block. One character might have the Mutant power of /arms/; that is to say, a jointed limb that ends in a hand which can be used to pick up and move the block. Another might go to the effort of building a headset that reads his brainwaves and uses them as control signals to control a robotic cart with a small crane; all of which he has built himself. This would be analogous to the Magic user.

Now, both of them can use the blocks. The Magic user has had to put a lot more up-front effort into the whole business - he had to make the headset, the crane, the cart, while the Mutant just had to get born - but it's not like he doesn't have advantages. Let's say that the block is near the maximum weight that the Mutant can lift; even is he uses /all/ his Arm power. Now, what happens if they need to move a block ten times the weight? The Magic user can get a more powerful crane fairly easily. The Mutant? The best he can do is a lengthly program of training and exercise.

Now what if we need a block moved that's a hundred times the weight?

So, the Magic user has a lot more in the way of /initial/ costs. But once he's paid those initial costs, he also has a lot more /range/ of ability. There's a whole raft of other differences as well - the Mutant's powers are self-repairing on the small scale, while the Magic user has to do his own basic maintenance; the Mutant cannot rebuild from nothing if his powers are completely removed while the Magic user can.

You need some kind of fairly general explanation, and the more disparate things you need to explain, the greater the challenge.

** I think you'll need to clarify what you mean with a world being rational. Rational is usually a property ascribed to stories rather than worlds, and depends a lot on where the focus of the story is. If you mean internally self-consistent then no, marvel/DC is not. However. there could be any number of reasons for why a world would look like the marvel/DC world including alien brain parasites or divine micromanagement.

​

In a world with many path of gaining superhuman powers, I'd expect there to be regular screening in schools for aptitude in each of the path and counsilors specialized in helping superhumans to use their powers in the work force. I find it more likely that people will care about the power level someone can get than that the method of acquiring it.

Here's how I true to fathom it.

Our Kitchen Sink World is a reality where all ends meet because all time happens all the time.

Now everything isn't happening literally at once, but literally moments from the past and future are happening while you read this sentence.

How does that work?

Multiple states of matter can coexist and we have our quantum mechanics to prove instantaneous causation through entanglement.

To me, that means we are ALL happening at once.

There are other realities happening within and without our own reality, but not apart from it, is my belief.

Our world does not have obvious superheroes, but we have preternatural phenomena and strangeness all over.

How does Big Foot, Reptilians, and Grey aliens all exist?

My belief is that our realities are all overlapped, not that much unlike a dream where we can leave one place and arrive somewhere inexplicably.

So how do constants fit into a world of chaos?

Order, natural and impersonal or employed and guided, is the system we have yet to unanimously agree on.

We know we need air, blood, water, and more, but we are slow in agreeing that the systems governing larger reality have needs as well.

My head canon is that concepts like “money” “sex” and “power” never go away, they just change and hopefully evolve for the better.

In our Kitchen Sink World the emergence of UAP and other fascinating anomalies really only offer us one clear line of action: demand increased transparency.

Now do we need the 6th Sense and suddenly have all the living people see all the ghostly people around us?

Maybe, idk, I'm in control.

But I suspect we could gain a lot by simply agreeing that as a whole Earth we both know and don't know a lot more than we have been willingly to acknowledge.

If there is a need to hide the truth, we need to find better ways of understanding why. Because right now our reality looks like a kitchen with two adjacent sinks. One is clean, but careful with a black light. And the other is full of shit, piss, and vinegar. With a lot of added goodies.

Kitchen Sink Worlds do not make sense because our own world does not make sense.

Marvel, DC, and other Kitchen Sink worlds fail to reflect whole reality because WE FAIL to know whole reality.

So, whether that reality is a “truth is stranger than my own worst dreams” kind of nightmare, what we can see with our own senses is that billions of people suffer next to those who do not and will not reveal why they see no need for radical change.

Our Kitchen Sink would have to understand so much in a proper context to really feel the mingling of our millions.

And better, because time keeps collapsing and expanding culture, science, art, and religion, we can hardly keep up with the amount of time we're allotted from work.

Someday we will have a story that feels like our 21st lives are finally understood, but that may not be until we see how bizarrely divided our own reality has become.

** Witcher universe is kinda like that. There are mutants and biotechnology (using magic), knights, kings, wizards and parallel worlds with advanced technology (humans arrrived on the Witcher world in "metal ships").

But it's pretty well thought-out. Magic outcompeted science among the exiles from scientifically advanced worlds because it had quicker payoffs and didn't required backing of industrialized civillization.

The source of magic, mutations and monsters is ultimately the same and it also is the creation myth of this world. Magic is a little like nukes - every kingdom needs it and magical guild is a powerful political force deciding wars and guiding kings from behind the curtain. And the politicians that want to win against them start hate campaigns to make commoners riot against "the witches".

And then there's Witchers who are result of magical genetic experiments and are universally hated by commoners, politicians and wizards who created them.

** If you want self-consistent deep worldbuilding with many different genres, I recommend [[https://neorice.com/hoh_1][Hero Oh Hero]], a pixel-art serial webcomic that has released 3+ pages a week for eight years. It follows three separate protagonists, who experience a wide variety of genres within the same world.

There is a main magic system, that most people think of as the only magic, but there seem to be other magic systems that may or may not come from the same power source, and so far haven't had any intersection with the main system (e.g. magic suppression and detection don't work on these alternate systems).

So far, everything has been self consistent, and the author has a huge amount of private world-building that hasn't been shown on screen. This story has complicated political and governance systems, even though they aren't important to the plot.

** So I might sorta kinda have tried writing a kitchen sink world, though far, far less expansive than Marvel / DC (I am but one author, at most). Marvel and DC (and crossover fanfiction) kinda set the standard that these things could coexist without issue, so I ignored puting my Medieval fantasy and turn-of-the-millennium superhero stuff in the same universe as a problem for quite some time.

But, like, I think I have it sort of worked out into something that fits together coherently?

The key thing was working out the origins of all the magics (and I include superpowers and Clarktech as magic, for these purposes). By some fantastic bout of luck, my early concepts made it possible to tie everything to a small number of thaumogeneses. All the varieties evolve from these common origins, and if I really, really wanted to, I could probably get much deeper into the weeds (but then I'd inevitably have to nerf some of the more overpowered stuff, which I might do for a fanfictiony adaptation, but it's wormed its way too deep to excise all of the worst offenders).

But how does this affect civilization? Comics have the problem of trying to remain status quo, but also stay current, but also include the likes of Reed Richards and Lex Luthor and frequent alien invasions. So, yeah, either pull a /Worm/ to restrain those things (and watch the status quo go up in blood and ash anyway), or turn it into speculative fiction, or tone down the super. I mostly lean into the third option. Medieval mages should have broken history, so they have to have some gaping personality / tactical / geopolitical weaknesses that force them to collapse. My unifying model of Qi demands certain impacts, so those impacts must be felt, or the qi must be restrained ... or both, as a driving force of the overarching conflict in one front is powerful entities discovering how insanely useful qitech could be, and villains continuously intervening to delay the revolution long enough for the plot to happen. Do other planets have demons, since Earth does? Yes, but distribution of demons is effected by distribution of magics, so a random low-magic planet is unlikely to secretly harbor an abyss of evil. Aliens visit Earth? Obviously the space colonization industry goes from fringe to relevant overnight, so the timeline must be handled with care. Etc, etc.

The biggestproblem, I think, is that, after reading HPMoR and doubling my rationalization efforts, I've been writing much less. I don't think those are related, though. Besides, it probably would be terrible, anyway, regardless of rationality.

(Aliens capable of visiting Earth have access to some form of magic, axiomatically. FTL that doesn't break the universe is basically magic, after all. Still struggling to have that cake and eat it, without time-travel paradoxes, but Relativity's a B.)

The one thing that comics do that I've avoided, though, is gods. Mostly. There is a multiverse, containing at least one high fantasy world with a pantheon, but that's the exception; everything surrounding Earth-realm refuses to say anything particular about any god(s) in particular. Even the demons I mentioned earlier are contextualized less as biblical demons, and more as magic constructs, modeled after the intelligences who interact with them (hence the bouncing between anthropomorphic and eldrich). I sometimes just call these "superdemons" to contrast them with the spiritual concept. I did have a couple of these claim to be Grecoroman gods at one point, but I'm probably cutting that (and it was not treated as necessarily true when I first made that note over 15 years ago).

But all this "villains raid your department of thaumology lab to delay the revolution" excuses feel increasingly forced, the more detailed I get, though. Especially when the biggest player in this regard is not actually antiprogress, and is smart enough to eventually realize what they're holding back... long before they should actually stop. And if HPMoR gets written in a world where aliens made a mess in 2005, this character would read it, and be all like "Oh. Oopse."
