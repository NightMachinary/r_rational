  Much like how Atlas Shrugged was largely a build up to a 60-page speech on Objectivism, Worth the Candle has only been setting things up for a descent into dwarf smut. Prepare to become well-acquainted with the phrase "cloacal kiss". :)
#+end_quote

OMG seriously? Dwarves in this setting have cloaca? Like birds? I suppose that is the obvious way for the curse to work, but still. Are dwarven cloacas on the front of their bodies or the back? It would suck if the dwarven reproduction curse actually castrated them.

I'm a little bothered that nobody in this story seems to even consider that someone might prefer an eternity of painful existence to nonexistence.

*** Joon did opt for Helldiver himself, so it's passed through his mind.

But since Aerbians grow up knowing that even halfway through the 9k hells is pure agony, they'd be safe to assume nobody would want those odds. There are probably existential debates or deathbed petitions, but it's a moot point here since they who live by the sword aren't taking arrows with a will at hand.

*** This is discussed briefly in ch 8:

#+begin_quote
  “Helldiver” confirmed the existence of the hells, but it led down a philosophical rabbit hole. Was it better to die or to live a life of eternal suffering? I didn't know that I could properly answer that. Amaryllis had said that the highest level of hell wasn't much worse than Comfort, which seemed bearable, even in the long term. I decided against checking the box right that instant. Similarly, the “Dead Man's Switch” would kill me if I was going to suffer a fate worse than death. That seemed on the surface like a similar deal with regards to death and suffering, but it left me asking the question of “Worse by whose definition?” so the checkbox was also left unchecked.
#+end_quote

He later checks the "Hell Diver" option when he thinks that he's about to die in ch 10.

You are right that there's a mostly unquestioned (so far) cultural assumption that death is preferable to eternal torture, but this is a conscious choice on my part rather than just being something blithely chosen/stated.

Can you un-check the "hell diver" option later on? Like, if you die the first time, can you un-check it so the second dive kills you instead?

**** Well, every new chapter / set of chapters has been posted by you or someone else. You might as well just post them yourself, since they are going to get posted anyway, haha. I don't think anybody will argue that it's spam, it's one of the consistently highest-voted stories on here.

E: I guess the rule says to post your own stuff once a week max. We'll have to keep doing your work for you I guess ;)

**** They write [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/]["The Last Angel"]].

Without spoilers, humanity encounters a hostile alien race just as its leaving Earth and develops an advanced AI starship during the fight. They lose and the story is told millennia later partially from the perspective of that AI. It's very well done and I think it's been posted here a couple of times. The first story is also complete and Proximal Flame is, I believe, working on the sequel.

Perhaps "his" is meant to be "da nad"?

Also, in Chapter 33:
