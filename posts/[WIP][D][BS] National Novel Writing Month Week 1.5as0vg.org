This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st; we'll have four or five of these posts throughout the month.

- Want to check in your some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

(This thread will be pinned after a day or so.)


** Attempting NaNoWriMo: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]

Main goal: Resume habit of writing narrative daily. Secondary goal: Explore a future I wouldn't want to live in. Have managed two days of meeting word-count goal, and have enough ready to write for today's. Am making much up as I go, with a few particular points I'd like to hit. Comments/ideas/suggestions appreciated.

  She stood up, and said, <<We have come to the limits of what my dice said I should speak of today. I will return when they say I should speak to you again, if the gods are willing.>>
#+end_quote

Gave me chills. You should write less fanservice-ey stuff more often.

EDIT: Well, it's pretty much back to the same story-archetypes you've been using since M'you've, which I admit I'm a bit disappointed by. Not really my thing, and I mostly read it when you touch on good sci-fi.

**** I understand exactly what you mean, and I'm trying to work on very much that; unfortunately, the word-count pressure of NaNoWriMo is working against me, given how much easier it is to come up with words that fill a given fan-service-y niche than it is to come up with a brand-new sci-fi-y concept every day.

I think I'm going to have to resort to "And suddenly NINJAS!!!" more than once to break out of the mould here.

The current plan involves a good bit more interaction and cooperation towards useful goals from this point on. Put another way, I may have taken a while to get to where my hero 'leaves his home village' and answers the Call To Adventure, but that's arguably where the story is now.

I'm kind of thinking he's going to escape, only to be told by an overlord version of himself that this was all a simple test for beginners designed to build a self who would be able to help them escape from the next layer of the sim.

Not sure. Will be interesting to see where you go with this.

** [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][/The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/]] is approaching on 10,000 words written, which means that I'm ahead of schedule (this is my 2014/2015/2016 project, so I'm only counting stuff past 100,000 words for this year).

Pros: I think everyone is where they should be as far as keeping the (now) three main event tracks going forward in parallel, though I think for the sake of balance it might be better to have one of them take up the bulk of the word count heading forward.

I've liked a fair amount of the dialogue written so far. H/S stuff seems like it's hitting the right sort of intellectual playfulness (but will need to read again to see for sure).

There are quite a few lines and scenes that I'm looking forward to, both in terms of "oh shit" moments and things I think are clever. It's always easier to write when you know those things are ahead, and worst case scenario you can just write the stuff you're most enthusiastic about and skip the connective tissue until later. (Not looking forward to writing the stuff that comes after all of what I want to write most, but that's mostly comedown, and people tend to be lenient about skimping on denouement.)

Cons: I've been trying to do more show, less tell for relationship development, but that /also/ needs to be mixed with character and plot development, which is tough. H/S are going to the Citadel, but there needs to be some breathing room there so that it's not just "H/S arrived at the Citadel two weeks later", especially since their relationship needs to be in the right place in preparation for what's going to happen there (and just after).

I'll probably need to do a dialogue pass after NaNo in order to make the "voices" of the characters more distinct; not really sure that I have them quite right yet, and I worry that Sofia/Henry in particular are too interchangeable. That's one of those things that's /way/ easier to change after the fact than during writing, and I probably wouldn't want to devote effort to it now if I'm going to do a pass to focus on it afterward. (Also a concern is that there are deceptions involved, so it's not just "make S sound like S" but "make S sound like S sounding like F".)

Not sure that 10K words has moved the plot as much as it should have. I need to map out the remaining chapters to see how long they should each be in order to end the book at under 150K words ... but that cuts into writing time. R is dropping out of the narrative after one more scene I think, which speeds up velocity toward the end. But V/M/C need more scenes (which I'm not too sure on) and those will take some word count.

(Writing this was helpful, I think; as always, comments and criticism are much more helpful /after/ NaNo is over, because during NaNo I can't really respond to them and they risk making me stressed and unhappy about what I'm writing. I would like for them to be given to me after NaNo is over though, if you'd like to give them.)

I've really enjoyed the dialogue between H/S. It's playful and would work well in a romantic comedy :) They have distinct voices and the layers of deceptions (S pretending to be F and H pretending not to know) works really well.

I'm kind of curious, you sometimes end the day in the middle of a sentence (I remember you did that last year too) Is that because you give yourself a strict limit for the number of words written in a day or is it because it makes it easier to continue the next day?

#+end_quote

Usually when I stop in the middle of a sentence it's because I'm thinking about what the second half of a sentence is, or getting ready to go find a synonym to prevent a repeated word, or unhappy with how that particular section is going. But that pause in the flow is /also/ usually when I go take a look at the clock, check reddit, etc. so it sometimes ends up being where I stop for the night.

It's not uncommon for me to just delete those fragments as the first thing that I do when sitting down to write for the day, depending on whether I know what the rest of the thought was going to be and/or whether it was going in the right direction.

** I'm unsure of my ability to get chapters w/ the regularity of lots of words a day, but NaNoWriMo's definitely got me thinking more about fun plot ideas.

I started a budding idea of a short story [[https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/11/05/genie-1/][here]] about a genie who's largely useless, and some ensuing events.

*** Yeah, /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ is supposed to be finished this year, fingers crossed. [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][This year's link here.]] I've installed the Chrome extension StayFocusd to block off reddit, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, etc. in the evenings in the hopes of increasing productivity, and I feel like I'm probably going to introduce some continuity issues by not quite remembering details accurately, but I'm fairly hopeful that I can push through to the end and then start on actual editing and rearranging.

(To anyone wondering, the .html file there is generated by Scrivener, which is why the formatting is more traditional novel style than web style in how it does paragraph breaks. After the daily compile, I run a simple .bat file to insert all the anchor tags and chapter links.)

** So far on track with my goal of 2,000 words per day. Last year I did the same, but missed three full days close to the end. Still met the NaNo goal, of course (crushed it), but my personal challenge is to just write 2k words /every day/ regardless of how much I've already written.

I'm continuing my story that I started last year, Mapmaker, Mapbreaker - the alpha readers edition of Part One available here [[http://goo.gl/gBzwCC]] as an ePub (I'm on mobile, otherwise I'd insert the link the cleaner way).

I've found out that writing while I'm working out, between sets, greatly increases my concentration and ability to stay focused. As well as counteracting any mental fatigue that usually impedes my ability to write in the evening. Anyone else have any interesting writing techniques?
