My character will exercise rationality to the best of my ability as a writer, and hopefully serve as a low level, partially functioning AI comprised of my problem-solving skills. He is a Paladin of Knowledge, which I will elaborate more on in the story.

** My general advice is "don't ask, just do." If you write it and post it, either we'll read it or we won't. I occasionally ask here if people want to read something, but that's because I'm trying to choose between possibilities to write. If you've got an idea you're excited by, go with it.

*** What does "written well" mean in this case? There are a number of ideas that I'd never care to read, no matter how well-written they were, so we're apparently using different definitions.

**** I probably wouldn't go so far as "any", but there are some truly stupid ideas that an author can get away with if they're well-written. Generating "bad ideas" is actually surprisingly difficult, because there are stories buried everywhere, and if you have skill with characterization and prose you can bring them to life. (The set of all stories is large enough that there are some truly terrible ideas though; ones that you could never make good.)

***** See, I think that "Pokemon meets lost Roman legion" could actually be interesting. I once did a series of articles called Genre Splash, where I'd create stuff out of whatever random ideas people squashed together for me.

But I don't think that Total Possible /Good/ Idea Space is exactly as large as Total Possible Idea Space.

Unless, again, we're using different definitions, which I'm totally fine with.

**** You should totally rules cheese! Rationalist D&D players are all about abusing grapple, peasant canons, and super genre-savviness!

But in seriousness, it's a great idea. I'd go with either a smart, grumpy character who can usually solve the problems before him but sometimes rubs people the wrong way (kind of like HJPEV) or a smart, charismatic character (perhaps bard) who convinces others to join them by explaining how it's in their best interests to do so.

***** Peasant canons shouldn't work. "Velocity" of a picked up item doesn't give a any attack or damage bonuses to the person making the ranged attack. Either you use real world physics in which case you cant just hand each other anything at the speed of sound or you use D&D rules where a mundane thrown weapon always only takes into consideration its own properties (speak range increment) and your strength, dexterity, BAB and potential feats.

****** You are completely correct: the peasant canon is a horrible bastardization of rules cheese and real-world physics that should never have been combined.

But it's still funny.

**** Does that include D&D's completely wonky physics even when no magic is involved? I'm talking about capped falling damage, the invisibility of the moon, improvised weaponry always being equally more difficult to use, how hit points work, cats being more dangerous than commoners and everything else in that spirit.

What do you mean by that? He won't just be a rational and intelligent person with human-like emotions and such? Because I think I'd prefer such a character over an ambulant weak AI coldly problem-solving its way through a medieval fantasy world. But who knows. Maybe you'd write that better than I can imagine. I'd definitely give your story a try.
