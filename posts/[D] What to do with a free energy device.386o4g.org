Suppose that, in the otherwise unchanged modern day, you have uncovered an obscure principle allowing for free energy without any obvious implications for other applications. The technology has the following attributes:

- Each generator is relatively cheap to produce in the current economy, perhaps a bit more expensive than a similarly-sized gas motor. The prices of required components may skyrocket if it becomes clear what they may be used for, though.
- No external fuel is consumed in operation. Maintenance costs are basically nonexistent. Barring external damage, an activated generator will run about a millennium without human input.
- The first generation of the technology puts out 0.25 watts/m^{3.} You expect that further research and development will exponentially increase the power output per volume until some unknown, far-off conceptual limit is hit, similar to the development of faster and more information-dense computers.

You are the only individual on the planet who's aware of this discovery. How do you wield this asset to fulfill your values?


** I'd plaster everything I know about this device all over the web. I'm not smart enough to make the best possible use of this technology on my own but I'm highly likely to benefit from hundreds of very smart people all over the world suddenly having access to free energy.

*** Basically this. I'm not particularly interested in money, though of course having more to donate would not be a bad thing. I'd do some thinking first and ask suitably smart and trustworthy people, but it feels like giving it to a single actor, corporation or whatnot, is probably not going to be very efficient at improving the quality of life of as many people as possible.

In addition, in a case where something like this is discovered, I am highly more likely to be one of the people who don't discover it rather than the one who does, and so in that position I would most likely wish for whoever is in the position to make this decision to choose to open source it.

**** You're right, I had not considered the implication that having discovered this technology I must logically have a significant amount of knowledge not available to my current self. I had previously assumed a blueprints falling into my lap scenario. I still don't think I could justify putting limits on access to such a game changing technology, we're talking lives saved on a massive scale. There is no reason however I shouldn't make very clear my own role in this technology's development which has to be worth at least an exceptionally high paying job in a field I'm implicitly quite gifted in.

******* Obviously they would sell the energy, clearly I have to make this clearer for you.

Let's go with your scenario where they all buy access to the patent, they then compete with each other and since it's free money it's a race to the bottom. Soon the companies will be "hey if you join with us you get free power also we have a theme park" , where you don't even try to sell the power but have it as a loss leader. EDIT: THIS MEANS THEY'RE MAKING LESS MONEY THAN BEFORE

The alternative is that the market leader would buy this license only for themselves, in which case they would undercut all competition and supply power to the world for huge profits. This is called a monopoly.

Obviously the rest of the power companies don't want that which is why they conglomerate against the market leader to buy the license and then not use it.

You are so dumb it's unreal.

If the company decides to use the patent (which the group of companies will only buy in a way that makes it illegal to use for any of them, eg buying a company that they all share ownership in that owns the patent, denying any of them license or access to it), then the other companies will do it too.

This will cause the issue that I literally just explained where if a product that you sell is now free to produce then you can't profit from the sale of that product unless you are the only person who can sell it for free.

Which as I said is the monopoly position which is what the other companies would band together TO STOP not TO LET ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS DO IT??!??!

********** Let me comprehensively explain to you why you're wrong, then.

First of all, you're assuming that the companies care about the patent. Even if they did, however, it is only the original design that is patented, or otherwise the entire mechanism that enables free energy would have to be officially publicized in the patent. So either the mechanism leaks out some other way, the mechanism itself is not what is patented, or the colluding companies don't care about the patent in the first place. The first option is not plausible (in the real world, at least, as we would see evidence of this) since that would result in the cabal losing their monopoly on the free energy mechanism. (and note that filing a suit related to the patent will result in the details of the mechanism being released to the public, or otherwise the mechanism itself wouldn't be protected at all) Moving on, now that we know that companies can dodge the patent by either producing new and more efficient designs, or simply not caring about the patent at all...

Having a usable design will inevitably result in one or more of the companies using it. This is a collapse to a more stable equilibrium than before, as companies both have means and motive to use the technology: outcompeting all of their competitors, including the companies they're colluding with, and gaining massive profits from the massive drop in costs. Since their partners are defecting, there are two options for the cooperating members of the cabal: either defect themselves, and gain as much profit as possible from the race to the bottom that will follow, or punish the defectors, by racing to the bottom even faster. Except wait, they can't punish the defectors, because any revenues that are non-zero will result in profits anyway. So the result of /any/ defection will either be not keeping up with the race to the bottom, and being outcompeted even in the short run, racing to the bottom via defecting, or racing to the bottom via punishment. And at that point the government becomes very suspicious as to the origin of this energy and would then investigate, but only after some /very/ interesting market activity.

The "issue" that you literally just explained, "where if a product that you sell is now free to produce then you can't profit from the sale of that product unless you are the only person who can sell it for free," is exactly right. Energy will collapse as an industry as a result of the device becoming available to more than one company, and it would probably collapse even when available to /only/ one company, simply because it's so hard to keep a secret. That is the Nash equilibrium. And simply put, I say it is conspiracy-theory levels of insane because that is /exactly/ what several major conspiracy theories are about, and if I were being less charitable I would assume you yourself held to them, considering your position in this argument.

Uh, no the original post assumed this, and I continued from this premise. I don't think the patent is worth much of anything.

#+begin_quote
  Moving on, now that we know that companies can dodge the patent by either producing new and more efficient designs, or simply not caring about the patent at all...
#+end_quote

I'm not responding to this paragraph because I agree with it all, the premise that the patent matters in this scenario was taken from being able to sell the patent to the highest bidder. No one would buy a patent that isn't worth anything.

My principle argument relies on companies obeying patent law and so completely collapses without it. There is no reasons for a cabal of companies to buy a patent to be unused if people will use the patent regardless, indeed that should have been so incredibly apparent by the fact that I was replying to a guy who was explicitly selling the patent that I wonder why you didn't just respond with this point in the first place.

As it is I agree with everything you've said a lack of business confidence in the global patent system would devalue the concept and so the original concept to sell it would result in pittances. If anything.

Edit: I don't know what you changed in your edit but as far as I'm aware I don't believe in any major conspiracy theories that rely on mutually destructive behaviour that is also against human psychology, the only conspiracy theory that comes to mind is the Enron conspiracy which I think everyone knows was a conspiracy, pretty much the most major one I can think of.

At no point during your initial points (which is where it would be reasonable to include such a diverged premise) did you even remotely mention that.

Edit: For reference I still maintain that in a patent respected environment a bid for a patent that allows for costless production of something will be bought out by a company that is a shell for the interests of those who wouldn't want another highest bidder to undercut them, this shell will be jointly owned so and would obviously need a board vote to license their only asset (the patent), and so locking the patent away.

*** Actually, if we want to go the rational route, take a month or more to really dig deep. Try and find evidence that someone has already investigated the discovery. If you do find it, see where their idea differed from yours, and/or why they failed. Then, with that information in hand, look at your own idea again.

You need them for when your energy needs outpace the available insolation of your planet. Prior to achieving a space-going civilization, the best usage of this stuff is to manufacture carbon-neutral hydrocarbons.

****** I /love/ my pocket-sized supercomputer.

And I'm sure we'll find a use for all that energy. I bet there are lots of potential useful household products that aren't common because they're not energy cost-effective. First, I'd stop setting my thermostat to "tolerable" and instead put it on "ideal". Then I'll take my ~$60 energy bill per month and give it to charity. Then I'd get an oven that preheats more rapidly, or maybe just stays at 375 all the time. Then I'd enter my house in a Tacky Light Show competition.

And one day, when they get really tiny, I'll use it to power my /laptop/.

** Much like DCarrier, I patent it in the United States only, reserve the right to distribute one license per year after the third year for free, and sell it. If the sales price is ludicrous, I start donating part of my income stream to charity.

Patenting it in the US only and reserving the right to donate one license per year after the third year will make sure the patent doesn't get bought and buried.

** u/ulyssessword:
#+begin_quote
  The first generation of the technology puts out 0.25 watts/m^{3.}
#+end_quote

For comparison, a solar panel (1m^{2,} 20% efficient, in Colorado) can produce enough to power a 50 watt lightbulb 24 hours/day 365 days/year, which provides a useful floor to how good the free energy machine has to be before it gets used for things.

#+begin_quote
  You expect that further research and development will exponentially increase the power output per volume until some unknown, far-off conceptual limit is hit, similar to the development of faster and more information-dense computers.
#+end_quote

Let's say that it follows Moore's Law exactly, and doubles every 18 months. It will take quite a while to be valuable as a product instead of as a technology. In three years, it will reach 1W/m^{3.} In another 9 years, it will reach 64W/m^{3,} still well below a solar panel + battery in a sunny climate, but kind of useful. Another 7.5 years will have it at 1kW/m^{3,} and finally reaching the level of solar power for power density (assuming 1 m^{3} = 20 m^{2).} Almost 20 years after discovery, it finally has widespread commercial uses.

Another 6 years, and it can beat gasoline generators (16kW/m^{3),} and then it can beat practically anything soon after that.

** 0.25W/m³ really isn't that great. In comparison, 0.25W can be produced with a $2 solar panel. This thing is obviously too weak to have any real-world benefits. To tap that exponential potential, it wouldn't be sufficient to put it on Youtube or something - there's too many posts that scream "free energy"; your invention wouldn't be noticed.

I also don't think that a patent wouldn't be useful for anything. It would also be too expensive for me to build.

So, I'd convince my wife to help me flesh out the theoretical physics, and visit the local university with the draft of a theoretical paper. With their help, I'd get it published in a small but good Physics journal. No proposed applications, just theory. No need to get the press interested. The electricity industry doesn't have to know about this invention until it's ready to disrupt it.

*** Graphene is not only very far from anything you can call "cheap", it's also incredibly hard to mass-produce and hard to work with. Because it's so incredibly thin, it loses its cool properties even when you lay it on a perfectly smooth silicon surface.

Until its price point and versatility improve by a couple of magnitudes, this is just a novelty finding.

Once we have dependable nanoscale manufacturing, graphene should become far easier to manufacture.
