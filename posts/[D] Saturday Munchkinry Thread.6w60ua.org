Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Some aliens come by Earth and give the UN access to the galactic energy banking system.

With it, a civilization is able to take out "energy loans" in the form of electrical energy. These loans come with 20% APR, meaning for every gigajoule of energy loaned, you must pay ~6.34 watts of power in interest until the loan is repaid.

In addition, Earth is only certified to take out loans up to 5x the energy it produces in a year. Every year, an appraiser from the galactic bank will come to scan Earth and re-certify our loan limit. The appraiser is not a computer and will only take into account power facilities made in good faith.

To access the galactic energy banking system, the UN receives schematics to create connection points. These facilities are about the same price to build and size as a modern nuclear power plant. These facilities produce power at an adjustable rate as long as they are allowed to take out more loans. These facilities also accept electrical power to pay for interest / repay the loans.

The alien bankers are understanding and will allow for a grace period in the case of disasters. However, they reserve the right to deny loans and have the ability to put a lien on Earth's power production in the case of a default.

You have been appointed the UN Chief of Electrical Finance. You are the only human able to approve of energy loans and can distribute them as you wish to different facilities. You also have a lot of sway in producing an energy plan for the Earth. Also, you have access to see current loan amounts, interest due, as well as usages and payment history of each facility.

With this new found source of energy capital, how can you advance humanity into a new age?

*** Oh! This one is easy. Since they are galactic aliens, it stands to reason that you can take out a loan anywhere in the solar system, and repay it from Earth.

Build a connection point on Earth and another one on every planetary body in the solar system. Then this galactic bank effectively allows you to transfer as much electricity as you want from Earth to another planet (and back if you want to build nuclear power plants on other planets). This massive amount of electricity would allow us to quickly colonize or even terraform our entire solar system.

It isn't "all you need", but it solves a ton of problems, or makes them much easier. With power from Earth, you can start growing food in artificial farms, using heaters/air conditioners to control the temperature, using artificial sunlight, using air purifiers to get rid of dust, etc. You can recycle water much more easily by boiling it and re-condensing it. Or electrolyzing and burning it. Or pumping it through various filters. Oxygen is also solved by the artificial farm.

For the rocky planets/moons, you can even use the power to drill underground, allowing you to build underground bases that are protected from the planet's weather storms or meteors.

*** Some ideas:

- If paying back loans early is allowed, two connection points could be setup to transfer energy between them without power losses. Put one near the equator with large amounts of solar panels, and one near giant cities.

- Do we receive interest on the overproduction of electricity (a.k.a. our bank account) If we get 10-15%, I'm sure we can get find funding to invest a few trillion dollar into more power generation. If not, we'll start our own bank and charge only 19%.

- Dyson sphere with a connection point included solves the energy transfer problem.

- Connection points on mars and the moon will rapidly increase our collonization efforts.

- We can get rid of our pollution coal power plants. Maybe even the gas plants, to keep these fossil fuels in the earth and lower global warming.

- Also aliens exist and have FTL travel and communication. They probably have a lot of advanced technology we could buy/trade for.

*** Since we have contact with advanced aliens we can be pretty sure that any energy our entire civ might want would be basically chump change for type 2 civs meaning taking out loans seems a bad idea. So your best bet is to try to sell some other resource such as minerals which might of relatively little value to them but would still be much more valuable to them than any amount of energy humanity could want for the foreseeable future (for instance ice has hydrogen making even a relatively small amount of it worth enough to fulfill our energy needs).\\
So I think the best plan is probably to sell mineral rights for the outer solar system (say the oort cloud and kuiper belt) for a staggering amount of credit. Then use that to buy the necessary tech to start disassembling mercury and setting up your own dyson sphere. Using the energy to build massive ships powered by connection points which can presumably draw upon our credit and not just take out loans. These ships would probably be used as our primary spaceships until we really got a sizeable swarm of statites around the sun which would beam their energy to a larger craft equipped with a connector.

*** We only need to pay the interest and a little extra to pay off the principle as far as wattage goes, so if you can generate 25% of the wattage you're getting from the bank and constantly pumping it into the connection points you can triple your energy output in the short term. Use that to invest in yet more energy production until you hit something like a dyson swarm. Once you're self-sufficient for any need you might have, pay back everything you owe.

*** As others have said, galactic energy banking system basically solves all energy distribution problems we may have. Take out loans where you need energy, and generate energy where it's convenient.

Short-term, missions to Mars are suddenly much easier. Methane for rocket fuel generated via Sabatier reaction will take days to make, not months (what spacex is planning to do in near future). Dyson swarm of solar power satellites in orbit near sun are now viable. Ion propulsion for interstellar missions is doable, although the size of access points is prohibitive for small probes.

I'm thinking the only time we should take out a loan is to bootstrap solar panel production for the first batch of Dyson swarm solar satellites, although having the option is good in case of natural diaasters. All in all, the ability to take loans is insignificant compared to the existence of galaxy-wide energy distribution system.

** Let me know if someone's done this already:

You have one (1) Remembrall: it is a clear hollow glass sphere about 10 cm in diameter with translucent white smoke inside. The smoke turns red when someone who is currently holding it forgets something, and turns white again about 5 seconds later. It does not tell you what you have forgotten, and it only works as a complete unit - you can't e.g. take the smoke out and use it for FTL signaling. You also don't have other Harry Potter magic. Basically it is a really specific brain machine interface that works on unknown principles.

I'm not sure if the great JK Rowling specified what it means to be holding something or forgetting something, so I'd probably munchkin away from there? Conquer the world, make a trillion dollar industry, discover the meaning of life, whatever you can figure out.

** Munchkin magical translation from any language into any other language . Something counts as a language only if at least 100 persons know how to Speak it.(edit now you have to take over the world whith it or at least get big amounts of money and or power, other creative uses of the power are still ok , but try to think how to exploit them). (EDIT rules of what counts as a language added)

The 100 humans(they have to have minds that are humankind enough for the magic to detect them as users) have to be able to more or less understand each other talking it( they have to be able to communicate more or less the same amount of information the average English speaker can communicate to other English speakers, this is a static variable that doesnt depend on the current number of English speakers as defined by the magic) , they have to think of it as a different language and their brain has to store it the way brains store new languages(so you can't arbitrarily decide something is a different language) .Also at least 1/4 of the world population has to not be able to understand it(so gestures and body language don't count).Once something is considered a language it isn't enough for someone to say a word thinking of it as for exaple English in order for the translation to work if that word isn't recognized as English by most English speakers, 100 English speakers have to agree that it's a English word to count as English .

*** Create a language based on some NP problem. Translate that language back to English and get your answer in linear time.

For example, let's create a language that will allow us to find the prime factorization of a number in linear time.

Our language is pretty much like English except for one particular rule. If we want to say a list of prime numbers, like "two, two, three, five", we instead say "foobar" followed by their product. For example, "two, two, three, five" in our language is "foobar sixty".

Since this language is pretty much just English with an extra rule, we can teach it to most educated English speakers. This extra rule makes it more complicated to speak the language, but theoretically, anyone with an understanding of the rule and some time can understand our "foobar" phrases.

Now, we want to find the prime factorization of 16,407,349.

First, we say "foobar sixteen million four hundred and seven thousand three hundred and forty-nine" and then translate it and find out it's actually "seven, twenty-three, one hundred and one, one thousand and nine" in English.

So, we have just found out that the prime factorization of 16,407,349 is 7 * 23 * 101 * 1009.

We can similarly do this for other problems where it is theoretically possible for a human to translate in an arbitrary amount of time.

****** Well, you're the one who posed the problem in the first place, so what you say, goes... but I do think there's something of an issue with specifying arbitrary languages and then just assuming humans are capable of speaking it. Basically, [[/u/GemOfEvan]] replaced the "at least 100 humans need to speak it" requirement with "it's possible /in principle/ for a human with an arbitrary amount of time to translate back and forth from this new language and a natural one", and the two criteria don't exactly coincide in my mind (the second criterion means that literally any Turing-complete language is permissible, and that turns the power from "magical translation" to "a halting oracle").

This isn't much different from hard to understand things in real languages. Take "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" for example. Understanding it takes time, but you can and it is English.

***** First I don't think people can talk omegalish well enough to be considered a omegaish speaker by the magic. You can't use it in most contexts where English speakers ask questions so think you don't pass the threshold of being roughly as good talking it as the average english speaker speaks english In the np example not being able to use big numbers was a problem but you could still memorice a lot of numbers putting you barely on the treshold . I guess that boundary is too vague and I shouldn't use it to discard solutions that I dont like. .Another problem is that speaking omegalish requires extra information that the humans speaking it dont necessarily have, humans can't speak Omegaish , even whith infinite time and memory which is . Also normal languages don't depend on some sentence being true for some combination of words to be correct , and in fact here you have combinations of words(like "what time is it?" ) that can be correct a given moment and then stop being a correct translation , wich makes the language so diferent from normal ones than it wouldnt be recongised as a language by a magic translator that was desinged for human languajes . So i could argue that Omegalish wouldnt work , but lets say it does since I guess as its written my proposal technically doens't disalow it . In that case I wouldn't risk asking for world domination to a unknown process that you don't know if its aligned with your preferences , and that you don't even know what criterion it uses for deciding whats the "answer" of a question.

My point was that in this variant, it's even easier than that since you don't need to precommit to anything--you're effectively viewing the actions of a copy of you who /doesn't/ have the power.

Though it's worth noting this is critically different from seeing a vision as if you didn't have the power, as if you didn't have the power you wouldn't precommit to anything as there was no reason to. Your big limitation here of course is if something interrupts your ability to carry out a planned action, you'll see what would've happen if you hadn't used your power, but that could have up to 23 hours worth of time to derail plans in potentially the most inanely minor ways. Generally useful though for sure, probably less useful the less regular your actions are as it's more likely for something to go wrong then.

Another thing which I think he probably left out is that you could generate vastly more energy by exploiting Red's thermodynamics violating regeneration than you could having him run a generator. For instance by using the materials from his body to perform fusion or just feeding it to a tiny black hole that produces useful amounts of hawking radiation.

Of course Green would be much better by every account since they could turn a generator by changing from a smaller form into a blue whale (or better yet a new creature designed to be as large as possible while still counting as an animal) and back. Or if injuries don't transfer between forms and material separated from the body sticks around then you can generate vastly greater amounts of fusion material/black hole fuel.

Intelligence doesn't let you break the laws of physics. Unless we are mistaken about the laws of physics, even a superintelligence wouldn't be able to solve negentropy. So it is entirely possible that a superintelligence was one of the alternative methods they tried and failed.

I would argue that spinning a turbine is really the best option here, since it's the safest. Seeing as Red is literally the only thing in the universe that can fight negentropy, you really don't want to risk anything dangerous happening to him. Cutting out chunks of his body to feed to blackholes sounds pretty dangerous, even if he has high regenerative abilities.

It kind of seems you're thinking too small here, given the sort of regen we're talking about here a superintelligence ought to be able to figure out what kinds of injury can be dealt on a consistent basis with no chance for death. Or say figure out the set rate of blood it can safely and continually drain from Red while he is hooked up to VR and nanobots tamper with his body in just the right way as to safely maximize output.

******** One day, your head scientist tells Red that for the sake of humanity, there is a much better way than simply spinning a turbine: he should simply allow the scientists to cut up large chunks of his body or drain his blood and throw them into a black hole. Compared to the energy from spinning a turbine, harvesting Red-matter is far, far more profitable.

Red thinks he is under attack and punches the scientist, instantly turning the scientist into a cloud of blood and gore.

Your next attempt is more careful. An elite negotiator is sent, attempting to talk sense into Red. Red still stubbornly refuses to cooperate. You decide, to hell with it, /it's not like Red needs to be conscious for his regenerative ability to work./

Tranquilizers are fired, and Red is put to sleep. Permanently. The next few millenniums are a breeze. The universe is filled with massive amounts of energy from all the Red-matter harvested from the unconscious Red.

Then one day, a tiny mistake occurs. The dosage of tranquilizer is insufficient. Red awakens, enraged by the fact that he has been attacked. Using his super strength and speed, he destroys everyone and everything around him. Your forces corner Red, you must get him sedated again. Red sees no way to escape and decides to make his own, punching down walls with his BRUTE STRENGTH.

Unfortunately, what Red doesn't realize is that there are no planets anymore. Such constructs are a massive waste of energy. Instead, everyone lives aboard space stations that are carefully insulated from the outside emptiness of space.

Red punches a hole in the wall and falls out of the space station, dying in the vacuum of space. The space station is quickly repaired so the other inhabitants don't immediately die, but now there is no way to combat negentropy. Humanity mourns its now inevitable demise.

Black, aboard another space station somewhere in the cosmos, is eventually contacted. He destroys the entire timeline, going back to the era before Red-matter. He relays strict orders from the future: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HARVEST RED-MATTER.

********** Ok...

He relays strict orders from the future. The dosage of tranquilizers are now monitored more strictly. The space station's external walls are now transparent glass, ensuring Red would never stupidly punch one open again.

Another few millenniums pass. Another incident occurs. Some idealists got it into their heads that keeping a person permanently sedated is inhumane and decided to free Red. Red awakens, entering a destructive rage. Your forces corner Red. Red flees and mis-estimates a jump, crashing into deadly factory waste and dying instantly.

Black is once again contacted. The timeline is destroyed. In the new timeline, people are stripped of their freedoms so they can't form idealist groups that might free Red. Factories are strictly ordered to control their waste products and make them utterly safe. Humanity is turned into a totalitarian regime under Orange.

It doesn't work. The idealist/resistance movement goes underground. Red once again breaks free and once again gets himself killed in some stupid fashion.

Black is contacted yet again. And again. And again. A civil war. A terrorist group. A sympathetic guard. Red keeps getting freed and proceeding to die in unimaginably dumb ways. Timelines keep getting destroyed. Black's personal plans keep being disrupted, being called in to reverse Red's various deaths over and over. Finally, after one particularly disastrous timeline resulting in Black foreseeing his future self being killed in one of Red's rampages, Black decides to just go back to before the era of Red-matter and stop this fiasco from ever happening.

*********** You're thinking about things as still being dominated by human level intelligences in a cliched sci-fi setting, however if you don't make that assumption then there is no real issue.

The singularity intelligence merely convinces red to plug into a virtual world that is paradise for him, while his blood is drained in the real world at a steady rate. Red never has any hope to rebel because his thoughts are monitored by nanomachines so the GAI always has perfect knowledge of how to manipulate him in whatever direction it wishes, though it's not like he would even want to leave his comfortable digital utopia. After all by now all of the quadrillions of minds in existence are simulated anyway, whereas the physical world is a boring cold place just a bunch of computronium arranged in a shell around the mini black hole. Though the computronium is constantly upgrading as the empty universe continues cooling. Since the landauer limit is inversely related to temperature so given a fixed amount of energy being extracted by Red the available processing continuously increases over time.\\
Plus even if Red were unable to be convinced by any means the nanomachines in his body can control him if the need arises his regen not protecting him from all his neurons, muscles and the like being hijacked with some electrical stimulation by the ever present nanobots.

However now that I'm thinking more seriously about this I don't actually think Red would be the primary source of energy, since he can only be used to run a single fusion generator. No actually I think Blue and Black both have obvious methods of vastly exceeding Red's output:

- Black: It's easy to forget but obtaining information requires energy, and if you know about Maxwell's demon you should be able to start to see how you can use these powers to create energy. It's honestly hard to imagine what kind of complex arrangement would be used to most efficiently transfer back the information best usable to get the most free computation and energy but a superintelligence would find the best way.\\
  Inevitably Black probably lives the gamut of human experiences during the early era of the universe, but eventually like most people he slowly improves his intelligence to open up new novel experiences. Eventually as a superintelligence himself he is either merged with the primary superintelligence, or he most likely agrees to use his power to bring back incomprehensibly large messages that can be used to exploit thermodynamic work. If he still needs the powers to be stored in a biological brain, then that remains a small part of his total mind and is reworked entirely towards maximizing information throughput.

- Blue: Even assuming you can't do time travel this is still pretty damned useful. By the time Blue's powers are of use like Black she probably went down the route of superintelligence. Since she cannot be physically harmed the interface with her larger electronic mind is probably achieved via nanomachines connected with her neurons and interfaced wirelessly with computronium.\\
  Her powers ultimately provide so much output it's unclear there is ultimately any real use to bothering with any of the others. Since she can easily teleport anywhere and have no relative motion compared to her new location, all she has to do is teleport constantly. Adopting the speed of some adjacent streams of high energy radiation used for reference, and the infrared radiation from her body is blue-shifted to create gamma rays that are as powerful as possible without creating a kugelblitz (since the resulting black hole would be far too large to produce useful amounts of hawking radiation). Through this she will be able to output amounts of energy that nevertheless exceed the outputs of most galaxies at the very least, since the energy density of the relevant kugelblitz would be utterly insane.\\
  EDIT: Now that I think about it I'm already thinking of like a million ways you could probably circumvent the kugelblitz problem (or just harvest the black holes energy over incomprehensible time spans if tech allows), in order to get even more unbounded energy production. Primarily by exploiting the limits around what the power will teleport since it doesn't mentioned teleporting you naked.\\
  A lot of these however boil down to daisy chaining many tiny black holes embedded in galaxy scale megastructures. Ultimately however it seems like there's no upper limit here on expansion so we can eventually aim for the ambitious goal of filling the entire ever expanding universe (she's ftl so that's not even an issue) with computronium, and even speeding up that expansion if that gets too slow for us. Basically her power has no real upper limit on how staggeringly awesome it is.

Now you can use some of that money to influence politics. Since power doesn't specify that you need to see a future of yourself you can use it to see any future. Set a plan to buy off every politician in parliament check in a future how they respond. Since it's simple 0, 1 outcome. You then go out and buy off only those guys who will definitely say yes. To be safe you check their future as well to make sure non of them is reporting you to some services within next 23h hours.

Check the amount of votes on issues that are important to you and only use enough influence to pass them into the law.

In a mean time look for new announcements of starts up going into public. Say something like new facebook announces to start selling shares. See if those shares are worth more or less in 23 hours and buy to make profit. Growing your income resources. Apart of that just invest most of the money in low fee index funds and double it every 10 years.

In probably couple of months you are the richest person on the planet with greatest influence on politics.

No, a bigger problem will be that when your share purchases get big enough, then they themselves will affect the 23-hour future share price. Well before becoming a billionaire yourself, your future-shares trick will stop working. (The lottery trick, on the other hand, will work better. Pick a different lottery every time you need more money, just to really annoy any investigators. By the third or fourth lottery, expect someone to sneakily observe your ticket numbers and purchase several tickets with the same numbers, reducing your prize. By the fifth or sixth, expect the lottery organisers to hear that you have purchased a ticket and immediately switch to their backup lottery drawing machine while the main one goes in for thorough investigation and repairs - this will change the numbers drawn and eliminate your prize (The solution to this is to purchase one ticket before your vision and one ticket after...)).
