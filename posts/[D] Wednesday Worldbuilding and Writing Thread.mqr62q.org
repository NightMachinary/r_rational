Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** A party defeats a monster and gains XP. Dividing XP equally rewards freeloaders and dividing by damage shafts support classes. Dividing by contribution makes the most sense.

What happens when we take this idea to its limit?

A warrior kills a monster and gains XP. A portion of it goes to his mage buddy who hasted him. Some goes to his trainers. Some goes to the smith who forged his weapon and armor. Some goes to the peasant who guided him to the lair but stood aside. Some goes to the King who is entitled to a portion of his subjects' XP.

What would be the ramifications and knock-on effects?

*** Either the King requires more XP per level, or the King is going to level /real/ fast. If the latter and levels have the usual superlinear effect on capability, the capability gap between commoners and nobility is going to be simply ludicrous as a result.

Lone hermits making their own gear and solo-clearing dungeons are going to be gods amongst mortals. Your Knight in plate wielding steel weapons, who has a lifetime of training and travels to the dungeon on a road that's maintained by society and eats food other people cook? That lady is a chump by comparison to the murderhobo of the woods.

The image of a warrior who mines the ore himself and turns it into a sword is appealing but I imagine a balance is needed to be struck not to spread yourself too thin.

*** A lot of it depends on any misalignment between the XP weighting and the effort a support class needs to put in / supply of those support classes. For example, if a blacksmith can fully supply 10 adventurers and gets 20% of the XP, then blacksmiths are very powerful folks. That'd incentivize more people to become blacksmiths, which would bring their share of the XP down, but it's a skilled trade that's hard to get into, so they'd still come out ahead.

It's also going to depend on what classes exist / what XP gets you. For example, some of the XP goes to the farmers who fed everyone involved. They're vitally important. But they're also fungible, so we wouldn't expect any one farmer to get a lot of XP, just a world where farmers are a bit more buff than normal. But if they're actually gaining levels in a Farmer class that makes them wildly more productive, then a randomly chosen food item is more likely to have come from a powerful Farmer, so they experience lopsided XP growth. Or if the Farmer class makes their crops somehow preferable to adventurers, then they also experience a lopsided XP growth, the same way blacksmiths do.

Since you specified the king gets a portion of the subjects' XP, that does seem like a candidate for runaway XP growth. It doesn't take any particular effort for a king to rule over two adventuring parties instead of one. And since they're amassing direct personal power in the form of XP, that actually reduces the difficulty of being a king. It's a lot easier to make sure your supporters always have more power than any pretenders if you (your most stalwart supporter) personally count extra.

**** Healers are hard to quantify wrt to their contribution. Would they steal the XP from those they heal? A smith's share would not be flat of course. What I had in mind was that if a warrior is given The Sword of Ogreslaying and slays a bunch of ogres, most contribution should go to the smith not the warrior.

*** If people are aware of the XP gain and agree with how it's shared out, it could also serve as a way to decide how to split the loot. To take this to an extreme, if there's an accurate measure of XP available then the state might pay people 1GP per XP for their services to civilization in a reversal of the older editions of D&D where escaping the dungeon with gold earned XP.

If people disagree with how the XP is shared, there might be traditions that evolved to mitigate the issues. For example, if preparation before a fight is overvalued compared to healing afterwards, healers might also take on the role of squires to the warriors so that their XP share better reflects their contribution.

If people are conscious of their XP gain, especially if they can deduce what they earned it for, that could lead to significantly more experimentation among supporters, as teachers can learn which types of lessons earn them the most XP once their students head down to the dungeon, and iterate towards an optimised adventurer curriculum.

On the other hand, it could lead to a winner-takes-all situation: if one blacksmith is five levels higher, they'll get a lot more business even if they earned those levels through luck, and that extra business will only increase their level advantage further.

Do the dead get a share of the XP? If they don't, that incentivises the party to kill anyone who contributes before the earnings occur. If they do, that encourages everyone to come up with new techniques, strike out into new lands, and otherwise avoid relying on previous generations who leech their XP without benefiting from it. That could potentially lead to a justification for that discredited trope of the "hard times make strong men" cycle: hard times means little support from previous generations and so a larger share of the XP, but that then puts subsequent generations in a better position and so they earn less XP until the lack of levels causes society to collapse again.

*** I mean, if balanced properly, this could be a good way to provide non-combatants with XP, and they don't even need to be aware of it. People just assume that it's their natural progression in their careers--eg a successful blacksmith will be gaining more XP as he grows older. He thinks this is because he's being rewarded for doing good work, when really, it's that his products are widely used.

*** Taken to the extreme extreme, everyone in the world would gain a piece of the pie. Every single interaction is driven by a previous interaction. The guide ate a pie cooked by a baker who received their flour by a merchant who traded for the flour from a farmer who inherited their land from... etc. etc.

The ramifications would depend on the split. If the farmer above gained a small fraction of an exp point, it'd basically be negligible. If the farmer gained 1 exp point, then there'd be a lot more farmers who are buff and high level because their tendrils would affect nearly every single outcome in the world.

**** The problem I can see with that is how do people work out that slaying momsters, or whatever the xp source is, actually is the xp source? If everyone is getting xp constantly from the actions of everyone else, the world is a very large place after all, pinpointing when your own actions of slaying an ogre contributed is nigh impossible without one guy with a sword having a larger share than the contributions of literally the entirety of society up to this point (even limited to those that are alive still, that is a lot), since everyone is connected to and supported by those around them, and those people the others around them, and so on and so on.

That said, if killing people would count, the growth that occurs alongside a major battle might tip people off, but maybe it would get dismissed as combat xp rather than openning the door to murdering people for xp gain. Although the story prompt of "a major war happened, and full share xp litrpg world had its top brass realise that wars let you grind xp" couod be interesting, replace the "wars" with "massive bloodshed" and you've got people committing genocide for power growth, but that sounds grimdark as fuck though.

***** Since this is all hypothetical without an actual example, it all depends on implementation.

With an interface, and logs, then everyone has perfect information. They know where they're getting exp from.

If there's an interface but no logs then it depends on the granularity of your interface. If you have levels and current exp on your interface, it'll be quite easy to determine the transitive exp gains with the assumption that exp gains and distribution is instantaneous. If you only have current level but no current exp, then it'll be harder to correlate that you're getting transitive exp from killing or fighting, but it's still within the realm of possiblity.

Lastly, if there's no interface but levels and exp still exists, then people would figure out that killing mobs makes you stronger than just working out and doing pushups. Transitively gaining exp still exists and people in certain non-combat jobs would get stronger than others. That difference would eventually be explored and understood. People who interact with the "hero" would become stronger faster than others. The exact correlation of slaying to receiving transitive exp may not be discovered, but really, what's the difference? If you interact with strong people, or interact with large amounts of people, you get stronger faster.

*** the system would quickly exhaust itself.

If XP is granted for doing quests, and most quests boil down to "go, kill monster x", then after few decades every person in the kingdom is going to be a demigod, and monsters will be extinct. All we can hope for then is that some of these demigods will turn to villainy to become Bosses to defeat, but what if they don't want to?

**** If I was the DM or god of such a world, I would probably put in some kind of tax or experience sink to keep the system from breaking. Perhaps the King and the commoners have abilities that use up or sacrifice xp/levels to get something they want or that it is necessary to survive. The world had an apocalypse and normal farming just doesn't work anymore so they have to sacrifice xp to the god of harvest to instantly grow some food. You can sacrifice xp to this god for more youth, for a magic ability to this other god, and so on. Still wouldn't be perfect with plenty of other potential issues but might work.

*** How transparent is this process? If the effect is transparent it gives an effective way to evaluate people further up the XP chain. Would having a minimum XP kickback from people further down the line be needed as a sign of competence? Changing your doctor or prime minister because they are not leveling up enough?

Does XP only come from killing monsters or do non-combat actions produce XP as well? Feudal society would be very different if monster killing was the only XP. Everyone supports the local knight/adventurer to be his best but the knight would be seen as neglecting his duty if he doesn't slay monsters to level up everyone else. Kingdoms that periodically go to war to level their populations? Would it be better to be a peasant on a knight, wizard, or cleric's land? You can live freely in some places without leveling or choose to be a serf and level. A "stock market" of investing in potential heroes? Everyone puts a bit of polish on the knights armor to get some XP in the coming battle? That could be effective or symbolic action. The lady gives her favorite knight a token to inspire him in the coming battle but gets no XP back so she accuses him of being unfaithful?

Does the effect diminish over time? Does the smith that made the sword get progressively less XP from it just because? Does the smith get less XP as the warrior carriers around the because the warrior is maintaining it and taking the sword to useful areas becomes a bigger contribution? Equipment reuse and heirloom items to keep XP in the family/group? Would the smith get less XP is there was a near by stick the warrior could have picked up instead even if the warrior never notices it? Does a sandwich maker get less XP if the sandwich becomes stale and less tasty or less nutritious?

How fair and all knowing is the process? Does it measure what is useful and effective contribution or does it measure time, effort, and involvement? Should you try and involve yourself in every stage to minimize XP lose? Can I run a lawless town so my law abiding friend and neigh can gain XP by recovering "lost" goods and arresting law breakers? In short can the system be gamed by making problems or allowing problems to exist? Can a king make small changes to a laws so they get the XP rather than his predecessor or ministers? Can you loophole yourself into the process at a low level? If you teach someone to read or walk do you get an XP kickback for everything they do involving reading or walking? The king technically owns all the land so he gets more XP than in a different system where everyone owned their own land? Why does the king get XP for something they were not involved in anyways? Because they think they were? The gods support monarchy and made it so? Because the king created a system of laws and institutions that were effective and benefited the end XP gainer directly or indirectly?

Is it rude to offer help because you take someone else's XP or rude to refuse help because you deny the other person XP? How do people (and the system) react to unwanted help?

Are non-contributing members of a community shamed, shunned, or exiled because they do not add to the value chain? How are low level people treated? Does the society as a whole want everyone involved? Are you only consider to be a member of the community when you gain XP from contributing to the local hero/knight? Monsters that give XP are both a threat and a resource to be managed for the community.

Or is the XP chain for each warrior closely guarded? Secret mines and fields to supply the hero so no one can sneak in and contribute. Large baggage trains of goods and support personnel follow each warrior to make sure no "leeches" steal XP?

Does a master swordsman keep more XP because he depends more on his skill then the weapon? Or does the quality of his gear have set XP drain regardless of his own skill?

Squires and apprentices maintain their masters' equipment to get their initial levels by XP drain. Is apprenticeship over when your master sees that you are giving more XP then you are draining?

Any institution that interrupts the XP flow between the top and bottom would be heavily regulated (if possible) by those at the top. Historically guilds, person, or titles that had rights to produce or sell certain goods were a big deal, the desire to control such activities could be greatly multiplied with XP in the mix.

A selfish teacher teacher tell you what he knows for maximum XP kickback while a good teacher put you on the path to discovery so the student keeps the max XP possible.

Are gods people that have just been on the top of the XP chain for a very long time? Do pray to gods for help and give them thanks because that creates the XP funnel to the gods?

*** Let's consider a full example.

Sir Knightsalot defeated the Monster.

This defeat had the following direct contributors:

- King Rulesalot has made a number of policy decisions over the years that incentivise royal knights slaying monsters, but only if those monsters kill people; monsters who do not kill people are left alone to breed more monsters on their own.
- A peasant left a sign by the road, directing people towards the monster's lair. Three other peasants gave Sir Knightsalot verbal directions during his quest.
- Sir Knightsalot's armour and sword came from the Royal Armoury. He has no idea which blacksmiths made them; there are several smiths working for the Armoury.
- His food was provided by the Royal Order of Knights, who draw the required money from a Royal Account, which comes from the Kingdom's taxes.
- He was trained by the Royal Trainer, a position made by the King to ensure that all Royal Knights meet certain minimal standards.
- He was healed after the fight by a doctor from the Royal Physician Corps; he has been healed in this way after previous fights as well.
- Mage Castsalot, from the Royal Mage Corps, provided three different buff spells and debuffed the Monster as well.

So. That's quite a broad base, already. I'm thinking that Sit Knightsalot would get the majority of the XP, while Mage Castsalot would also get a substantial portion. Next in total XP gained would probably be King Rulesalot; because he has put in place a /lot/ of Royal Institutions which have helped Sir Knightsalot to become what he is. After that would probably come one or two of the Royal Blacksmiths, followed by the peasants who verbally directed him, followed by the peasant who put up the last directional sign. Followed by a tiny XP boost to everyone who paid their taxes for the year...

** Significantly inspired by [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia][Virtuous Sons]], a xianxia story based off of Greco-Roman history, I've been working a bit on a Norse-Icelandic mythological version, mainly just to see if it takes me anywhere interesting. I have a few notes about it down - berserkers (and the various berserker cults) are one 'path,' the 9 worlds are the cultivation stages, that kind of thing.

From there I've been working on an idea where Ragnarok occurred in the distant past, and the remnants of those killed form the basis of many other practices - the One-Handed God, for example, is Tyr (who got his hand bitten off by Fenrir), and adherents of his cult inscribe the Tiwaz rune (synonymous with war and victory, kinda) on their bodies for increased power.

There are various other aspects as well, but what would you expect to see in a Norse mythological xianxia?
