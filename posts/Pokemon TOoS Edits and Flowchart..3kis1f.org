Hey all, wanted to alert you to a couple of things. First off, I finally made some edits to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Chapter 1]] to better characterize Red and Blue in their introduction. The original version always bothered me, and I hope this one better serves to set the tone for the story and their personalities.

Second, I also got around to mapping out and uploading the complete flowchart that Red referenced in Chapter 20 for when he notices that he's upset. You can find the first rough draft of it here:

As a final note, for those that don't follow pokemon news all that closely, I was very happy to see that my prediction of an Augmented Reality pokemon game is coming true, with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs][Pokemon Go.]] After a friend got me into Ingress, I outlined the concept for a Pokemon themed version of the game, down to the massive public Legendary battles (as I'm obviously a fan of that), and what do you know, the same company was in fact working on that very thing. I'm really hoping the game delivers on its potential for a new way to enjoy the pokemon world.

That's it for now. Any feedback on the changes to Chapter 1 or the flowchart would be very appreciated. See you October 1st!


** If they're even remotely competent about it, Pokemon Go is going to make Niantic and Nintendo approximately eleven billion dollars. Needless to say, I'm going to play it.

Also, thank you for the excuse to reread again. I think I'll go do that now.

*** Yeah, it's a really hard concept to fuck up, but then, Elder Scrolls Online took what I thought was a no brainer (just make it like their main games, but let friends join each other's games for dungeon diving and exploring and whatever) and stripped the game down to a mostly generic fantasy MMO.

Pokemon Go might screw it up by abandoning the main games' battle system for something super simple (select your pokemon, select enemy's pokemon, watch as they deal a % of damage to eachother), or make the microtransactions overwhelmingly onerous: pokeballs for 1 dollar each, some kind of limited energy system, or similar. Here's hoping it's everything we can hope for and more.

**** Niantic didn't have microtransactions in Ingress, right? Been a long while since I played, but they never added it, right?

**** Yeah, I suppose they might end up just completely gutting it, but I +just know+ am hoping that Nintendo retains enough control in this venture to keep them from gutting the combat system that much.

Although I do kind of wish we'd get a proper Pokemon MMO, this could fill in the void.

** Enjoyed the new Chapter 1. Can't really remember the details of the old Chapter 1 to compare but what I just read is good stuff.

Quickly gets across some of Red's personality with all the business with his alarm, tugs at the heart when he's parting with his mother, and then the relationship with Blue is distinctly rivalrous, though not a /bitter/ rivalry.

This was definitely one of my main goals, as well as making Blue appear less dumb or "obviously wrong." Glad to hear you enjoyed it!

**** He gets in some well-aimed barbs (the ones along the lines of "You think you know better than all the experts... why exactly?") which I think give him a viewpoint that's worth giving time and credence to, even if he does turn out to be wrong.

*** Not at all. if you want to credit it, writing "by [[/u/DaystarEld]]" in the corner is fine, for those that know what Reddit is. I'll probably be updating it sometime soon anyway, and will include it myself in the future.

** The ending following [Said]>[Assertion]>[No]>[Yes]>[Yes] may be the most ethical response but it doesn't seem like the smartest or most rational response as it requires the assumption that the "others" in question are themselves rational. Using common logical fallacies and appeals to emotion in tandem to your facts can often be more effective in the right crowd.

*** Agreed, but I prefer to promote using Lightside techniques whenever possible, unless the stakes are sufficiently high enough to warrant actions I would criticize in others. Since the basis for this flowchart is that something someone said upset you, and not something someone said is causing you to potentially lose your livelihood or put someone in harm's way, I assume the most generic situations.

If however you're "upset" because someone is accusing you of being a witch in a town where the inhabitants tend to burn witches, by all means, do what you need to stay alive.
