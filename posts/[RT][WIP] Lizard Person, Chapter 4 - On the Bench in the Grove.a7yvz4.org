** Very nice chapter, finally found time to catch up. I really enjoy the story so far. Its getting way more fluid, but i am also very interested what implications telepathy will have on the general students university lifestyle. Will normal tests still be effective ? I see some sort of challenges ahead... are there materials to inhibit telepathy? etc..

** Insert obligatory <I'm sorry it's taking so long, school/life/etc.> here.

Big thanks again to confettibin for editing!

Summary so far:

- Chapter 1: Carol's boyfriend Nic discovers that William Statton and the alien his family raised, Rose, are coming to their college. They help the Stattons unload and Rose watches a movie in Carol's dorm. Carol decides to enroll in Telepathy.

- Chapter 2: Rose tells Carol and Nic about a mysterious species of intelligent beings that is missing from both Earth and from her public record of history. They all go to dinner, and Rose is introduced to the rest of the college.

- Chapter 3: In the first Telepathy class, students are 'seeded' with the power.

*** Really most people who follow this kind of stuff are good as long as you keep updating. I know I am! It's really exciting seeing each new development in the story, and this chapter certainly introduced a couple of doozies.

***** Thank you! I'm glad the slow updates aren't too bad. I keep telling myself that the important thing is that it gets written.
